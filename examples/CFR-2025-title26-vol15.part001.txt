To show that reasonable cause exists for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the reporting corporation must make an affirmative showing of all the facts alleged as reasonable cause for the failure in a written statement containing a declaration that it is made under penalties of perjury. The statement must be filed with the District Director (in the case of failure to maintain or furnish requested information permitted to be maintained outside the United States within the time required under § 1.6038A-3(f) or a failure to file Form 5472) or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center where the Form 5472 is required to be filed (in the case of failure to file Form 5472). The District Director or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center where the Form 5472 is required to be filed, as appropriate, shall determine whether the failure was due to reasonable cause, and if so, the period of time for which reasonable cause existed. If a return has been filed as required by § 1.6038A-2 or records have been maintained as required by § 1.6038A-3, except for an omission of, or error with respect to, some of the information required or a record to be maintained, the omission or error shall not constitute a failure for purposes of section 6038A(d) if the reporting corporation that filed the return establishes to the satisfaction of the District Director or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center that it has substantially complied with the filing of Form 5472 or the requirement to maintain records.
(ii)
Small corporations.
The District Director shall apply the reasonable cause exception liberally in the case of a small corporation that had no knowledge of the requirements imposed by section 6038A; has limited presence in and contact with the United States; and promptly and fully complies with all requests by the District Director to file Form 5472, and to furnish books, records, or other materials relevant to
the reportable transaction. A small corporation is a corporation whose gross receipts for a taxable year are $20,000,000 or less.
(iii)
Facts and circumstances taken into account.
The determination of whether a taxpayer acted with reasonable cause and in good faith is made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all pertinent facts and circumstances. Circumstances that may indicate reasonable cause and good faith include an honest misunderstanding of fact or law that is reasonable in light of the experience and knowledge of the taxpayer. Isolated computational or transcriptional errors generally are not inconsistent with reasonable cause and good faith. Reliance upon an information return or on the advice of a professional (such as an attorney or accountant) does not necessarily demonstrate reasonable cause and good faith. Similarly, reasonable cause and good faith is not necessarily indicated by reliance on facts that, unknown to the taxpayer, are incorrect. Reliance on an information return, professional advice or other facts, however, constitutes reasonable cause and good faith if, under all the circumstances, the reliance was reasonable. A taxpayer, for example, may have reasonable cause for not filing a Form 5472 or for not maintaining records under section 6038A if the taxpayer has a reasonable belief that it is not owned by a 25-percent foreign shareholder. A reasonable belief means that the taxpayer does not know or has no reason to know that it is owned by a 25-percent foreign shareholder. For example, a reporting corporation would not know or have reason to know that it is owned by a 25-percent foreign shareholder if its belief that it is not so owned is consistent with other information reported or otherwise furnished to or known by the reporting corporation. A taxpayer may have reasonable cause for not treating a foreign corporation as a related party for purposes of section 6038A where the foreign corporation is a related party solely by reason of § 1.6038A-1(d)(3) (under the principles of section 482), and the taxpayer had a reasonable belief that its relationship with the foreign corporation did not meet the standards for related parties under section 482.
(c)
Failure to maintain records or to cause another to maintain records.
A failure to maintain records or to cause another to maintain records is determined by the District Director upon the basis of the reporting corporation's overall compliance (including compliance with the non-U.S. maintenance requirements under § 1.6038A-3(f)(2)) with the record maintenance requirements. It is not an item-by-item determination. Thus, for example, a failure to maintain a single or small number of items may not constitute a failure for purposes of section 6038A(d), unless the item or items are essential to the correct determination of transactions between the reporting corporation and any foreign related parties. The District Director shall notify the reporting corporation in writing of any determination that it has failed to comply with the record maintenance requirement.
(d)
Increase in penalty where failure continues after notification
—(1)
In general.
If any failure described in this section continues for more than 90 days after the day on which the District Director or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center where the Form 5472 is required to be filed mails notice of the failure to the reporting corporation, the reporting corporation shall pay a penalty (in addition to the penalty described in paragraph (a) of this section) of $25,000 with respect to each related party for which a failure occurs for each 30-day period during which the failure continues after the expiration of the 90-day period. Any uncompleted fraction of a 30-day period shall count as a 30-day period for purposes of this paragraph (d).
(2)
Additional penalty for another failure.
An additional penalty for a taxable year may be imposed, however, if at a time subsequent to the time of the imposition of the monetary penalty described in paragraph (a) of this section, a second failure is determined and the second failure continues after notification under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Thus, if a taxpayer fails to file Form 5472 and is assessed a monetary penalty and later, upon audit, is determined to have failed to maintain
records, an additional penalty for the failure to maintain records may be assessed under the rules of this paragraph if the failure to maintain records continues after notification under this paragraph.
(3)
Cessation of accrual.
The monetary penalty will cease to accrue if the reporting corporation either files Form 5472 (in the case of a failure to file Form 5472), furnishes information to substantially complete Form 5472, or demonstrates compliance with respect to the maintenance of records (in the case of a failure to maintain records) for the taxable year in which the examination occurs and subsequent years to the satisfaction of the District Director. The monetary penalty also will cease to accrue if requested information, documents, or records, kept outside the United States under the requirements of § 1.6038A-3(f) and not produced within the time specified are produced or moved to the United States under the rules of paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.
(4)
Continued failures.
If a failure under this section relating to a taxable year beginning before July 11, 1989 occurs, and if the failure continues following 90 days after the notice of failure under this paragraph is sent, the amount of the additional penalty to be assessed under this paragraph is $25,000 for each 30-day period beginning after November 5, 1990, during which the failure continues. There is no limitation on the amount of the monetary penalty that may be assessed after November 5, 1990.
(e)
Other penalties.
For criminal penalties for failure to file a return and filing a false or fraudulent return, see sections 7203 and 7206 of the Code. For the penalty relating to an underpayment of tax, see section 6662.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section.
(1)
Failure to file Form 5472.
Corp X, a U.S. reporting corporation, engages in related party transactions with FC. Corp X does not timely file a Form 5472 or maintain records relating to the transactions with FC for Year 1 or subsequent years. The Service Center with which Corp X files its income tax return imposes a $25,000 penalty for each of Years 1, 2, and 3 under section 6038A (d) and this section for failure to provide information as required on Form 5472 and mails a notice of failure to provide inrormation. Corp X does not file Form 5472. Ninety days following the mailing of the notice of failure to Corp X an additional penaly of $25,000 is imposed. On the 135th day following the mailing of the notice of failure, Corp X files Form 5472 for Years 1, 2, and 3. The total penalty owed by Corp X for Year 1 is $75,000. ($25,000 for not timely filing Form 5472, $25,000 for the first 30-day period following the expiration of the 90-day period, and $25,000 for the fraction of the second 30-day period). The penalty for Years 2 and 3 for the failure to file Form 5472 is also $75,000 for each year, calculated in the same manner as for Year 1. The total penalty for failure to file Form 5472 for Years 1, 2, and 3 is $225,000.
(2)
Failure to maintain records.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1.
In Year 5, Corp X is audited for Years 1 through 3. Corp X has not been maintaining records relating to the transactions with FC. The District Director issues a notice of failure to maintain records. Corp X has already been subject to the monetary penalty of $25,000 for each of Years 1, 2, and 3 for failure to file Form 5472 and, therefore, a monetary penalty under paragraph (a) of this section for failure to maintain records is not assessed. However, an additional penalty is assessed after the 90th day following the mailing of the notice of failure to maintain records. Corp X develops a record maintenance system as required by section 6038A and § 1.6038A-3. On the 180th day following the mailing of the notice of failure to maintain records, Corp X demonstrates to the satisfaction of the District Director that the newly developed record maintenance system will comply with the requirements of § 1.6038A-3 and the increase in the monetary penalty after notification ceases to accrue. The additional penalty for failure to maintain records is $75,000. An additional penalty of $75,000 per year is assessed for each of years 2 and 3 for the failure to maintain records for a total of $225,000.

§ 1.6038A-5
Authorization of agent.
(a)
Failure to authorize.
The rules of § 1.6038A-7 shall apply to any transaction between a foreign related party and a reporting corporation (including any transaction engaged in by a partnership that is attributed to the reporting corporation under § 1.6038A-1(e)(2)), unless the foreign related party authorizes (in the manner described in paragraph (b) of this section) the reporting corporation to act as its limited agent solely for purposes of sections 7602, 7603, and 7604 with respect to any request by the Service to examine records or produce testimony that may be relevant to the tax treatment of such a transaction or with respect to any summons by the Service for such records or testimony. The fact that a reporting corporation is authorized to act as an agent for a foreign related party is to be disregarded for purposes of determining whether the foreign related party either has a trade or business in the United States for purposes of the Code or a permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States for purposes of an income tax treaty.
(b)
Authorization by related party
—(1)
In general.
Upon request by the Service, a foreign related party shall authorize as its agent (solely for purposes of sections 7602, 7603, and 7604) the reporting corporation with which it engages in transactions. The authorization must be signed by the foreign related party or an officer of the foreign related party possessing the authority to authorize an agent for purposes of Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The reporting corporation will accept this appointment by providing a statement to that effect, signed by an officer of the reporting corporation possessing the authority to accept such an appointment. The agency shall be effective at all times. For taxable years beginning after July 10, 1989, the authorization and acceptance must be provided to the Service within 30 days of a request by the Service to the reporting corporation for such an authorization. The authorization must contain a heading and statement as set forth below. A foreign government is not subject to the authorization of agent requirement.

# AUTHORIZATION OF AGENT
“[Name of foreign related party] hereby expressly authorizes [name of reporting corporation] to act as its agent solely for purposes of sections 7602, 7603, and 7604 of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to any request to examine records or produce testimony that may be relevant to the U.S. income tax treatment of any transaction between [name of the above-named foreign related party] and [name of reporting corporation] or with respect to any summons for such records or testimony.

(2)
Authorization for prior years.
A foreign related party shall authorize a reporting corporation to act as its agent with respect to taxable years for which a Form 5472 is required to be filed prior to the date on which the final regulations under section 6038A are published by providing the above executed authorization of agent within 30 days of a
request by the Service for such an authorization.
(c)
Foreign affiliated groups
—(1)
In general.
A foreign corporation that has effective legal authority to make the authorization of agent under paragraph (b) of this section on behalf of any group of foreign related parties may execute such an authorization for any members of the group. A single authorization may be made on a consolidated basis. In such a case, the common parent must attach a schedule to the authorization of agent stating which members of the group would otherwise be required to separately authorize the reporting corporation as agent. The schedule must provide the name, address, relationship to the reporting corporation, and U.S. taxpayer identification number, if applicable, of each member.
(2)
Application of noncompliance penalty adjustment.
In circumstances where a consolidated authorization of agent has been executed, if the agency authorization for any member of the group is not legally effective for purposes of sections 7602, 7603, and 7604, the noncompliance penalty adjustment under section 6038A(e) and § 1.6038A-7 shall apply.
(d)
Legal effect of authorization of agent.
The legal consequences of a foreign related party authorizing a reporting corporation to act as its agent for purposes of sections 7602, 7603, and 7604 of the Code are as follows.
(1)
Agent for purposes of commencing judicial proceedings.
A reporting corporation that is authorized by a foreign related party to act as its agent for purposes of sections 7602, 7603, and 7604 (including service of process) is also the agent of the foreign related party for purposes of—
(i) The filing of a petition to quash under section 6038A(e)(4)(A) or a petition to review an Internal Revenue Service determination of noncompliance under section 6038A(e)(4)(B), and
(ii) The commencement of a judicial proceeding to enforce a summons under section 7604, whether commenced in conjunction with a petition to quash under section 6038A(e)(4)(A) or commenced as a separate proceeding in the federal district court for the district in which the person to whom the summons is issued resides or is found.
(2)
Foreign related party found where reporting corporation found.
For any purposes relating to sections 7602, 7603, or 7604 (including service of process), a foreign related party that authorizes a reporting corporation to act on its behalf under section 6038A(e)(1) and this section may be found anywhere where the reporting corporation has residence or is found.
(e)
Successors in interest.
A successor in interest to a related party must execute the authorization of agent as described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(f)
Deemed compliance
—(1)
In general.
In exceptional circumstances, the District Director may treat a reporting corporation as authorized to act as agent for a related party for purposes of sections 7602, 7603, and 7604 in the absence of an actual agency appointment by the foreign related party, in circumstances where the actual absence of an appointment is reasonable. Factors to be considered include—
(i) If neither the reporting corporation nor the other party to the transaction knew or had reason to know that the two parties were related at the time of the transaction, and
(ii) The extent to which the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the District Director that all transactions between the reporting corporation and the related party were on arm's length terms and did not involve the participation of any known related party.
(2)
Reason to know.
Whether the reporting corporation or other party had reason to know that the two parties were related at the time of the transaction will be determined by all the facts and circumstances.
(3)
Effect of deemed compliance.
If a reporting corporation is deemed under this paragraph (f) to have been authorized to act as an agent for a foreign related party for purposes of sections 7602, 7603, and 7604, such deemed compliance is applicable only for that particular transaction and other reportable transactions entered into prior to the time when the reporting corporation knew or had reason to know that the related party, in fact, was related. The noncompliance rule of § 1.6038A-7
shall apply to any transaction subsequent to that time with the same related party, unless the related party actually authorizes the reporting corporation to act as its agent under paragraph (a) of this section. In addition, the record maintenance requirements of § 1.6038A-3 will apply to all subsequent transactions and, with respect to prior transactions, will apply to relevant records in existence at the time the relationship was discovered.
(g)
Effective dates.
For effective dates for this section, see § 1.6038A-1(n).
[T.D. 8353, 56 FR 28073, June 19, 1991; T.D. 8353, 56 FR 41792, Aug. 23, 1991]
§ 1.6038A-6
Failure to furnish information.
(a)
In general.
The rules of § 1.6038A-7 may be applied with respect to a transaction between a foreign related party and the reporting corporation (including any transaction engaged in by a partnership that is attributed to the reporting corporation under § 1.6038A-1(e)(2)) if a summons is issued to the reporting corporation to produce any records or testimony, either directly or as agent for such related party, to determine the correct treatment under title 1 of the Code of such a transaction between the reporting corporation and the related party; and if—
(1)(i) The summons is not quashed in a proceeding, if any, begun under section 6038A(e)(4) and is not determined to be invalid in a proceeding, if any, begun under section 7604 to enforce such summons; and
(ii) The reporting corporation does not substantially and timely comply with the summons, and the District Director has sent by certified or registered mail a notice under section 6038A(e)(2)(C) to the reporting corporation that it has not so complied; or
(2) The reporting corporation fails to maintain or to cause another to maintain records as required by § 1.6038A-3, and by reason of that failure, the summons is quashed in a proceeding under section 6038A(e)(4) or in a proceeding begun under section 7604 to enforce the summons, or the reporting corporation is not able to provide the records requested in the summons.
(b)
Coordination with treaties.
Where records of a related party are obtainable on a timely and efficient basis under information exchange procedures provided under a tax treaty or tax information exchange agreement (TIEA), the Service generally will make use of such procedures before issuing a summons. The absence or pendency of a treaty or TIEA request may not be asserted as grounds for refusing to comply with a summons or as a defense against the assertion of the noncompliance penalty adjustment under § 1.6038A-7. For purposes of this paragraph, information is available on a timely and efficient basis if it can be obtained within 180 days of the request.
(c)
Enforcement proceeding not required.
The District Director is not required to begin an enforcement proceeding to enforce the summons in order to apply the rules of § 1.6038A-7.
(d)
De minimis failure.
Where a reporting corporation's failure to comply with the requirement to furnish information under this section is
de minimis,
the District Director, in the exercise of discretion, may choose not to apply the noncompliance penalty. Thus, for example, in cases where a particular document or group of documents is not furnished upon request or summons, the District Director (in the District Director's sole discretion), may choose not to apply the noncompliance penalty if the District Director deems the document or documents not to have significant or sufficient value in the determination of the correctness of the tax treatment of the related party transaction.
(e)
Suspension of statute of limitations.
If the reporting corporation brings an action under section 6038A(e)(4)(A) (proceeding to quash) or (e)(4)(B) (review of secretarial determination of noncompliance), the running of any period of limitation under section 6501 (relating to assessment and collection of tax) or under section 6531 (relating to criminal prosecutions) for the taxable year or years to which the summons that is the subject of such proceeding relates shall be suspended for the period during which such proceeding, and appeals therein, are pending. In no event shall any such period expire before the 90th day after the day on which there is a final determination in such proceeding.
(f)
Effective dates.
For effective dates for this section, see § 1.6038A-1(n).
[T.D. 8353, 56 FR 28075, June 19, 1991]
§ 1.6038A-7
Noncompliance.
(a)
In general.
In the case of any failure described in § 1.6038A-5 or § 1.6038A-6, the rules of this § 1.6038A-7 apply to the reporting corporation. In such a case—
(1) The amount of the deduction allowed under subtitle A for any amount paid or incurred by the reporting corporation to the related party in connection with such transaction, and
(2) The cost to the reporting corporation of any property acquired in such transaction from the related party or transferred by such corporation in such transaction to the related party, may be determined by the District Director.
(b)
Determination of the amount.
The amount of the deduction or the cost to the reporting corporation shall be the amount determined by the District Director (in the District Director's sole discretion) from the District Director's own knowledge or from such information as the District Director may choose to obtain through testimony or otherwise. The District Director shall consider any information or materials that have been submitted by the reporting corporation or a foreign related party. The District Director, however, may disregard any information, documents, or records submitted by the reporting corporation or the related party if (in the District Director's sole discretion) the District Director deems that they are insufficiently probative of the relevant facts.
(c)
Separate application.
If the noncompliance penalty of this section applies with respect to transactions with a related party of the reporting corporation, it will not be applied with respect to any other related parties of the reporting corporation solely upon the basis of that failure. Thus, for example, if a reporting corporation engages in transactions with related party A and related party B, and the reporting corporation does not respond to a summons for records related to the transactions between the reporting corporation and related party A, the noncompliance penalty imposed as a result of such failure will not apply to the transactions between the reporting corporation and related party B. If a separate summons is issued for records relating to the transactions between the reporting corporation and related party B and the reporting corporation does not produce such records, the noncompliance penalty may be applied to those transactions.
(d)
Effective dates.
For effective dates for this section, see § 1.6038A-1(n).

§ 1.6038B-1
Reporting of certain transfers to foreign corporations.
(a)
Purpose and scope.
This section sets forth information reporting requirements under section 6038B concerning certain transfers of property to foreign corporations. Paragraph (b) of this section provides general rules explaining when and how to carry out the reporting required under section 6038B with respect to the transfers to foreign corporations. Paragraph (c) of this section and § 1.6038B-1T(d) specify the information that is required to be reported with respect to certain transfers of property that are described in section 6038B(a)(1)(A) and 367(d), respectively. Section 1.6038B-1(e) describes the filing requirements for property transfers described in section 367(e). Paragraph (f) of this section sets forth the consequences of a failure to comply with the requirements of section 6038B and this section. For effective dates, see paragraph (g) of this section. For rules regarding transfers to foreign partnerships, see section 6038B(a)(1)(B) and any regulations thereunder.
(b)
Time and manner of reporting
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Reporting procedure.
Except for stock or securities qualifying under the special reporting rule of § 1.6038B-1(b)(2), and certain exchanges described in section 354 or 356 (listed below), any U.S. person that makes a transfer described in section 6038B(a)(1)(A), 367(d) or (e), is required to report pursuant to section 6038B and the rules of § 1.6038B-1 and must attach the required information to Form 926, “Return by a U.S. Transferor of Property to a Foreign Corporation.” In addition, if the U.S. person files a statement under § 1.367(a)-3(d)(2)(vi)(C), a gain recognition agreement under § 1.367(a)-8, or a liquidation document
under § 1.367(e)-2(b), such person must comply in all material respects with the requirements of such section pursuant to the terms of the statement, gain recognition agreement, or liquidation document, as applicable, in order to satisfy a reporting obligation under section 6038B. For special rules regarding cash transfers made in tax years beginning after February 5, 1999, see paragraphs (b)(3) and (g) of this section. For purposes of determining a U.S. transferor that is subject to section 6038B, the rules of §§ 1.367(a)-1(c) and 1.367(a)-3(d) shall apply with respect to a transfer described in section 367(a), and the rules of § 1.367(a)-1(c) shall apply with respect to a transfer described in section 367(d). Additionally, if in an exchange described in section 354 or 356, a U.S. person exchanges stock or securities of a foreign corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(E), or a U.S. person exchanges stock or securities of a domestic or foreign corporation pursuant to an asset reorganization described in section 368(a)(1) (involving a transfer of assets under section 361) that is not treated as an indirect stock transfer under § 1.367(a)-3(d), then the U.S. person exchanging stock or securities is not required to report under section 6038B. Notwithstanding any statement to the contrary on Form 926, the form and attachments must be attached to, and filed by the due date (including extensions) of the transferor's income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of the transfer (as defined in § 1.6038B-1T(b)(4)). For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, any attachment to Form 926 required under the rules of this section is filed subject to the transferor's declaration under penalties of perjury on Form 926 that the information submitted is true, correct and complete to the best of the transferor's knowledge and belief. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, Form 926 and any attachments shall be verified by signing the income tax return with which the form and attachments are filed.
(ii)
Reporting by corporate transferor.
For transfers by corporations in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2003, Form 926 must be signed by an authorized officer of the corporation if the transferor is not a member of an affiliated group under section 1504(a)(1) that files a consolidated Federal income tax return and by an authorized officer of the common parent corporation if the transferor is a member of such an affiliated group. For transfers by corporations in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2002, Form 926 shall be verified by signing the income tax return to which the form is attached.
(iii)
Transfers of jointly-owned property.
If two or more persons transfer jointly-owned property to a foreign corporation in a transfer with respect to which a notice is required under this section, then each person must report with respect to the particular interest transferred, specifying the nature and extent of the interest. However, a husband and wife who jointly file a single Federal income tax return may file a single Form 926 with their tax return.
(2)
Exceptions and special rules for transfers of stock or securities under section 367(a)
—(i)
Transfers on or after July 20, 1998.
A U.S. person that transfers stock or securities on or after July 20, 1998 in a transaction described in section 6038B(a)(1)(A) will be considered to have satisfied the reporting requirement under section 6038B and paragraph (b)(1) of this section if either—
(A) The U.S. transferor owned less than 5 percent of both the total voting power and the total value of the transferee foreign corporation immediately after the transfer (taking into account the attribution rules of section 318 as modified by section 958(b)), and either:
(
1
) The U.S. transferor qualified for nonrecognition treatment with respect to the transfer (i.e., the transfer was not taxable under §§ 1.367(a)-3(b) or (c)); or
(
2
) The U.S. transferor is a tax-exempt entity and the income was not unrelated business income; or
(
3
) The transfer was taxable to the U.S. transferor under § 1.367(a)-3(c), and such person properly reported the income from the transfer on its timely-filed (including extensions) Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of the transfer; or
(
4
) The transfer is considered to be to a foreign corporation solely by reason
of § 1.83-6(d)(1) and the fair market value of the property transferred did not exceed $100,000; or
(B) The U.S. transferor owned 5 percent or more of the total voting power or the total value of the transferee foreign corporation immediately after the transfer (taking into account the attribution rules of section 318 as modified by section 958(b)) and either:
(
1
) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the U.S. transferor (or one or more successors) filed an initial gain recognition agreement under § 1.367(a)-8, and filed Form 926 in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section; or
(
2
) The transferor is a tax-exempt entity and the income was not unrelated business income; or

(v)
Property transferred under compulsion.
If property qualifies for the exception of § 1.367(a)-2(a)(2) under the rules of paragraph (h) of that section, provide information supporting the claimed application of such exception.
(vi)
Certain ineligible property.
Describe any property that is described in § 1.367(a)-2(c) and that therefore cannot qualify under § 1.367(a)-2(a)(2) regardless of its use in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States. The description must be divided into the relevant categories, as follows:
(A)
Inventory, etc.
Property described in § 1.367(a)-2(c)(1);

Describe any property, other than property described in § 1.367(a)-2(c), that cannot qualify under § 1.367(a)-2(a)(2) regardless of its use in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States and that is not subject to the rules of section 367(d) under § 1.367(a)-1(b)(5) (treatment of certain property as subject to section 367(d)). Each item of property must be separately identified.
(viii) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.6038B-1T(c)(4)(viii).
(5)
Transfer of foreign branch with previously deducted losses.
If the property transferred is property of a foreign branch with previously deducted losses subject to §§ 1.367(a)-6 and -6T, provide the following information:
(i) through (iv) [Reserved]. For further information, see § 1.6038B-1T(c)(5)(i) through (iv).

Transfers subject to section 367(a)(5)
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (c)(6) applies to a domestic corporation (U.S. transferor) that transfers section 367(a) property (as defined in § 1.367(a)-7(f)(10)) to a foreign corporation in a section 361 exchange (as defined in § 1.367(a)-7(f)(8)) and to which the provisions of § 1.367(a)-7(c) apply. Paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section establishes the time and manner for the U.S. transferor to elect to apply the provisions of § 1.367(a)-7(c). Paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section establishes the manner for the U.S. transferor to satisfy the requirement of § 1.367(a)-7(c)(4).
(ii)
Election.
The U.S. transferor elects to apply the provisions of § 1.367(a)-7(c) by including a statement entitled, “ELECTION TO APPLY EXCEPTION UNDER § 1.367(a)-7(c),” with its timely filed return (within the meaning of § 1.367(a)-7(f)(12)) for the taxable year during which the reorganization occurs and that includes the information described in paragraphs (c)(6)(ii)(A), (c)(6)(ii)(B), (c)(6)(ii)(C), (c)(6)(ii)(D), (c)(6)(ii)(E), (c)(6)(ii)(F), (c)(6)(ii)(G), and (c)(6)(ii)(H) of this section. See § 1.367(a)-7(c)(5)(ii) for the statement required to be filed by a control group member (as defined in § 1.367(a)-7(f)(1)) or final distributee (as defined in § 1.367(a)-7(d)).
(A) The name and taxpayer identification number (if any) of each control group member and final distributee (if any), the foreign acquiring corporation, and in the case of a triangular reorganization (within the meaning of § 1.358-6(b)(2)) the corporation that controls the foreign acquiring corporation, and the ownership interest percentage (as defined in § 1.367(a)-7(f)(7)) in the U.S. transferor of each control group member.
(B) A calculation of the gain recognized (if any) by the U.S. transferor under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii), and the basis adjustments (if any) required to be made by each control group member under § 1.367(a)-7(c)(3).
(C) The date on which the U.S. transferor and each control group member or final distributee entered into the written agreement described in § 1.367(a)-7(c)(5)(iv).
(D) The amount of any deductible liability (as defined by § 1.367(a)-7(f)(2)).
(E) The fair market value (as defined by § 1.367(a)-7(f)(3)) of property transferred to the foreign acquiring corporation in the section 361 exchange.
(F) The inside basis (as defined by § 1.367(a)-7(f)(4)).
(G) The inside gain (as defined by § 1.367(a)-7(f)(5)).
(H) The section 367(a) percentage (as defined by § 1.367(a)-7(f)(9)).
(iii)
Agreement to amend U.S. transferor's tax return.
The U.S. transferor complies with the requirement of § 1.367(a)-7(c)(4)(i) by attaching a statement to its timely filed return (within the meaning of § 1.367(a)-7(f)(12)) for the taxable year in which the reorganization occurs, entitled “STATEMENT UNDER § 1.367(a)-7(c)(4) FOR TRANSFERS OF ASSETS TO A FOREIGN CORPORATION IN A SECTION 361 EXCHANGE.” The statement must certify that if a significant amount of the section 367(a) property received by the foreign acquiring corporation from the U.S. transferor in the section 361 exchange is disposed of, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions described in paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B) of this section occurring within the sixty (60) month period that begins on the date of distribution or transfer (within the meaning of
§ 1.381(b)-1(b)), then the exception provided in § 1.367(a)-7(c) will not apply to the section 361 exchange. Accordingly, the U.S. transferor will recognize the gain realized but not recognized in the section 361 exchange, computed as if the exception provided in § 1.367(a)-7(c) had never applied. A U.S. income tax return (or amended U.S. income tax return, as the case may be) for the year in which the reorganization occurred reporting the gain must be filed. If the section 361 exchange occurs in connection with a triangular reorganization (within the meaning of § 1.358-6(b)(2)) and the corporation that controls the foreign acquiring corporation is foreign, an indirect disposition of the section 367(a) property includes the disposition by such controlling foreign corporation of the stock of the foreign acquiring corporation.
(A)
Disposition of a significant amount
—(
1
)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(6)(iii)(A)(
2
) and (c)(6)(iii)(A)(
3
) of this section, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(6)(iii), a disposition of a significant amount occurs if, in one or more related transactions, the foreign acquiring corporation disposes of an amount of the section 367(a) property received from the U.S. transferor in the section 361 exchange that is greater than 40 percent of the fair market value of all of the section 367(a) property transferred in the section 361 exchange.
(
2
)
Exception for certain nonrecognition exchanges.
Section 367(a) property that is subsequently transferred (retransferred property) pursuant to a nonrecognition provision is not treated as disposed of for purposes of paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section, provided such transfer satisfies, and is treated in a manner consistent with the principles underlying § 1.367(a)-8(k). Thus, for example, if section 367(a) property is subsequently transferred to a foreign corporation in exchange solely for stock in a transaction described in section 351, such retransferred property is not treated as disposed of for purposes of paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section; in such a case, however, a subsequent disposition of either the retransferred property by the transferee foreign corporation, or of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation received in exchange for the retransferred property, is subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section.
(
3
)
Exception for dispositions occurring in the ordinary course of business.
Dispositions of section 367(a) property described in section 1221(a)(2) occurring in the ordinary course of business of the foreign acquiring corporation are not treated as disposed of for purposes of paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A)(
1
) of this section.
(B)
Gain recognition transaction
—(
1
)
General rule.
A transaction is described in this paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B) if the transaction is entered into with a principal purpose of avoiding the U.S. tax that would have been imposed on the U.S. transferor on the disposition of the property transferred to the foreign acquiring corporation in the section 361 exchange. A disposition may have a principal purpose of tax avoidance even if the tax avoidance purpose is outweighed by other purposes when taken together.
(
2
)
Presumptive tax avoidance.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B), the principal purpose of the foreign acquiring corporation's disposition of a significant amount of the section 367(a) property within the two-year period that begins on the date of distribution or transfer (within the meaning of § 1.381(b)-1(b)) (whether in a recognition or nonrecognition transaction) will be presumed to be the avoidance of the U.S. tax that would have been imposed on the U.S. transferor on the disposition of the property transferred to the foreign acquiring corporation in the section 361 exchange. However, this presumption will not apply if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director of Field Operations, Large Business
International (or any successor to the roles and responsibilities of such person (Director) that the avoidance of U.S. tax was not a principal purpose of the disposition.
(
3
)
Interest.
If additional tax is required to be paid as a result of a transaction described in paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B) of this section, then interest must be paid on that amount at rates determined under section 6621 with respect to the period between the date prescribed for filing the U.S.
transferor's income tax return for the year in which the reorganization occurs and the date on which the additional tax for that year is paid.

Generally, each item of intangible property must be separately identified, including intangible property described in § 1.367(d)-1(g)(2)(i). Identify all property that is subject to the rules of section 367(d) under § 1.367(a)-1(b)(5) (treatment of certain property as subject to section 367(d)). Describe any property for which the income required to be taken into account under section 367(d) and the regulations thereunder will be recognized over a 20-year period pursuant to § 1.367(d)-1(c)(3)(ii). Estimate the anticipated income or cost reductions attributable to the intangible property's use beyond the 20-year period.
(v)-(vi) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.6038B-1T(d)(1)(v) through (1)(vi).
(vii)
Coordination with loss rules.
List any intangible property subject to section 367(d) the transfer of which also gives rise to the recognition of gain under section 904(f)(3) or §§ 1.367(a)-6 or -6T. Provide a calculation of the gain required to be recognized with respect to such property, in accordance with the provisions of § 1.367(d)-1(g)(3).

(F) Any other information as may be prescribed by the Commissioner in publications, forms, instructions, or other guidance.
(e)
Transfers subject to section 367(e)
—(1)
In general.
If a domestic corporation (distributing corporation) makes a distribution described in section 367(e)(1) or section 367(e)(2), the distributing corporation must comply with the reporting requirements of this paragraph (e). Unless otherwise provided in this section, a distributing corporation making a distribution described in sections 367(e)(1) or 367(e)(2) must file a Form 926, “Return by a U.S. Transferor of Property to a Foreign Corporation (under section 367),” as amended and modified by this section.
(2)
Reporting requirements for section 367(e)(1) distributions of domestic controlled corporations.
A domestic distributing corporation making a distribution of the stock or securities of a domestic corporation under section 355 is not required to file a Form 926, as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and shall have no other reporting requirements under section 6038B.
(3)
Reporting requirements for section 367(e)(1) distributions of foreign controlled corporations.
If the distributing corporation makes a section 355 distribution of the stock or securities of a foreign controlled corporation to distributee shareholders who are not qualified U.S. persons, as defined in § 1.367(e)-1(b)(1), then the distributing corporation shall complete Part 1 of the Form 926 and attach a signed copy of such form to its U.S. income tax return for the year of the distribution. The distributing corporation shall also attach to its U.S. income tax return for the year of distribution a statement signed under the penalties of perjury entitled, “Addendum to Form 926.” The addendum shall contain a brief description of the transaction, state the number of shares distributed to distributees who are not qualified U.S. persons (applying the rules contained in § 1.367(e)-1(d)), and state the basis and fair market value of the distributed stock or securities (including a list stating the amounts that were distributed to distributees who were not qualified U.S. persons and distributees who were qualified U.S. persons).
(4)
Reporting rules for section 367(e)(2) distributions by domestic liquidating corporations
—(i)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, if the distributing corporation makes a distribution of property in complete liquidation under section 332 to a foreign distributee corporation that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 332(b) with respect to the stock of the distributing corporation, then the distributing corporation must complete a Form 926 and attach a signed copy of such form to its timely filed U.S. income tax return (including extensions) for the taxable years that include one or more liquidating distributions. The property description contained in Part III of the Form 926 must contain a description, including the adjusted tax basis and fair market value, of all property distributed by the distributing corporation (regardless of whether the distribution of the property qualifies for nonrecognition treatment). The description must also identify the items of property for which nonrecognition treatment is claimed under § 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(ii) or (iii), as applicable.
(ii)
Special rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section, if the distributing corporation distributes items of property that will be used by the foreign distributee corporation in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and the distributing corporation does not recognize gain or loss on such distribution under § 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(i) with respect to such property, then the distributing corporation may satisfy the requirements of this section by completing Part I and Part II of Form 926, noting in Part III that the information required by Form 926 is contained in a statement required by § 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(i)(C)(
2
), and attaching a signed copy of Form 926 to its timely filed U.S. income tax return (including extensions) for each taxable year that includes one or more distributions in liquidation. In addition, if the distributing corporation distributes stock of a domestic subsidiary corporation and does not recognize gain or loss on such distribution under § 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(iii) with respect to such stock, then the distributing corporation may satisfy the requirements of this section by completing Part I and Part II of Form 926, noting in Part III that the information required by Form 926 is contained in a statement required by § 1.367(e)-2(b)(2)(iii)(D), and attaching a signed copy of Form 926 to its timely filed U.S. income tax return (including extensions) for the taxable years that include one or more distributions of domestic subsidiary stock.

paragraph (f)(3) of this section for certain relief that may be available.
(f)
Failure to comply with reporting requirements
—(1)
Consequences of failure.
If a U.S. person is required to file a notice (or otherwise comply) under paragraph (b) of this section and fails to comply with the applicable requirements of section 6038B and this section, then with respect to the particular property as to which there was a failure to comply—
(i) The U.S. person shall pay a penalty under section 6038B(b)(1) equal to 10 percent of the fair market value of the transferred property at the time of the exchange, but in no event shall the penalty exceed $100,000 unless the failure with respect to such exchange was due to intentional disregard (described under paragraph (g)(4) of this section); and
(ii) The period of limitations on assessment of tax upon the transfer of that property does not expire before the date which is 3 years after the date on which the Secretary is furnished the information required to be reported under this section. See section 6501(c)(8) and any regulations thereunder.
(2)
Failure to comply.
A failure to comply with the requirements of section 6038B is—
(i) The failure to report at the proper time and in the proper manner any material information required to be reported under the rules of this section; or
(ii) The provision of false or inaccurate information in purported compliance with the requirements of this section. Thus, a transferor that timely files Form 926 with the attachments required under the rules of this section shall, nevertheless, have failed to comply if, for example, the transferor reports therein that property will be used in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States, but in fact the property continues to be used in a trade or business within the United States.
(iii) With respect to an initial gain recognition agreement filed under § 1.367(a)-8, a failure to comply as determined under § 1.367(a)-8(j)(8), but for purposes of this section, determined without regard to the application of § 1.367(a)-8(p).
(iv) With respect to an initial liquidation document filed under § 1.367(e)-2(b)(2), a failure to comply as determined under § 1.367(e)-2(e)(4)(i), but for purposes of this section, determined without regard to the application of § 1.367(e)-2(f).
(3)
Reasonable cause for failure to comply
—(i)
Request for relief.
If the U.S. transferor fails to comply with any requirement of section 6038B and this section, the failure shall be deemed not to have occurred if the U.S. transferor is able to demonstrate that the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect using the procedure set forth in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. Whether the failure to timely comply was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect will be determined by the Director of Field Operations, Cross Border Activities Practice Area of Large Business
International (Director) based on all the facts and circumstances.
(ii)
Procedures for establishing that a failure to timely comply was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect
—(A)
Time of submission.
A U.S. transferor's statement that the failure to timely comply was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect will be considered only if, promptly after the U.S. transferor becomes aware of the failure, an amended return is filed for the taxable year to which the failure relates that includes the information that should have been included with the original return for such taxable year or that otherwise complies with the rules of this section, and that includes a written statement explaining the reasons for the failure to timely comply.
(B)
Notice requirement.
In addition to the requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the U.S. transferor must comply with the notice requirements of this paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B). If any taxable year of the U.S. transferor is under examination when the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return and any information required to be included with such return must be delivered to the Internal Revenue Service personnel
conducting the examination. If no taxable year of the U.S. transferor is under examination when the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return and any information required to be included with such return must be delivered to the Director.
(4)
Definition of intentional disregard.
If the transferor fails to qualify for the exception under paragraph (f)(3) of this section and if the taxpayer knew of the rule or regulation that was disregarded, the failure will be considered an intentional disregard of section 6038B, and the monetary penalty under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section will not be limited to $100,000. See § 1.6662-3(b)(2).
(g)

Reporting of certain transactions to foreign corporations (temporary).
(a) through (b)(3) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.6038B-1(a) through (b)(3).
(4)
Date of transfer
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the date of a transfer described in section 367 is the first date on which title to, possession of, or rights to the use of stock, securities, or other property passes pursuant to the plan for purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code. A transfer will not be considered to begin with a decision of a board of directors or similar action unless the transaction otherwise takes effect for purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code on that date.
(ii)
Termination of section 1504(d) election.
A transfer deemed to occur as a result of the termination of an election under section 1504(d) will be considered to occur on the date the contiguous country corporation first fails to continue to qualify for the election under section 1504(d). The rule of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) is illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
Domestic corporation W previously made a valid election under section 1504(d) to have its Mexican subsidiary S treated as a domestic corporation. On August 1, 1986, W disposes of its right, title, and interest in 10 percent of the stock of S by selling such stock to an unrelated United States person who is not a director of S. S first fails to continue to qualify for the election under section 1504(d) on August 1, 1986, since on such date it ceases to be directly or indirectly wholly owned or controlled by W. The constructive transfer of assets from “domestic” corporation S to Mexican corporation S is considered to occur on that date.
(iii)
Change in classification.
A transfer deemed to occur as a result of a change in classification of an entity caused by a change in the governing documents, articles, or agreements of the entity (as described in § 1.367(a)-1T(c)(6)) will be considered to occur on the date that such changes take effect for purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code.
(iv)
U.S. resident under section 6013 (g) or (h).
A transfer made by an alien individual who is considered to be a U.S. resident by reason of a timely election under section 6013 (g) or (h) will be considered to occur, for purposes of this section (but not for purposes of section 367), on the later of—
(A) The date on which the election under section 6013 (g) or (h) is made; or
(B) The date on which the transfer would otherwise be considered to occur under the rules of this paragraph (b)(3).
The rule of this paragraph (b)(3)(iv) is illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
D is a nonresident alien individual who is married to a United States citizen. On March 1, 1986, D transfers property to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351. On April 15, 1987, D and the spouse timely file with their tax return for the taxable year ended December 31, 1986, an election under section 6013(g) for D to be treated as a United States resident. The election is effective on January 1, 1986. For purposes of section 6038 B, the transfer described in section 367(a) made by D in connection with the section 351 exchange is considered to occur on April 15, 1987, the date on which the timely election was made under section 6013(g).

§ 1.6038B-2
Reporting of certain transfers to foreign partnerships.
(a)
Reporting requirements
—(1)
Requirement to report transfers.
A United States person that transfers property to a foreign partnership in a contribution described in section 721 (including section 721(b)) must report that transfer on Form 8865 “Information Return of U.S. Persons With Respect to Certain Foreign Partnerships” pursuant to section 6038B and the rules of this section, if—
(i) Immediately after the transfer, the United States person owns, directly, indirectly, or by attribution, at least a 10-percent interest in the partnership, as defined in section 6038(e)(3)(C) and the regulations thereunder;
(ii) The value of the property transferred, when added to the value of any other property transferred in a section 721 contribution by such person (or any related person) to the partnership during the 12-month period ending on the date of the transfer, exceeds $100,000; or
(iii) The United States person is a U.S. transferor (as defined in § 1.721(c)-1(b)(18)) that makes a gain deferral contribution and is required to report under § 1.721(c)-6(b)(2). The reporting required under this paragraph (a) includes the annual reporting required by
§ 1.721(c)-6(b)(3). For purposes of applying this paragraph (a)(1)(iii) to partnerships formed on or after January 18, 2017, a domestic partnership is treated as a foreign partnership pursuant to section 7701(a)(4).
(2)
Indirect transfer through a domestic partnership
—For purposes of this section, if a domestic partnership transfers property to a foreign partnership in a section 721 transaction, the domestic partnership's partners shall be considered to have transferred a proportionate share of the property to the foreign partnership. However, if the domestic partnership properly reports all of the information required under this section with respect to the contribution, no partner of the transferor partnership, whether direct or indirect (through tiers of partnerships), is also required to report under this section. For illustrations of this rule, see
Examples 4
and
5
of paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
(3)
Indirect transfer through a foreign partnership.
Solely for purposes of this section, if a foreign partnership transfers section 721(c) property (as defined in § 1.721(c)-1(b)(15)) to another foreign partnership in a transfer described in § 1.721(c)-3(d) (tiered-partnership rules), then the transferor foreign partnership's partners will be considered to have transferred a proportionate share of the property to the foreign partnership.
(4)
Requirement to report dispositions
—(i)
In general.
If a United States person was required to report a transfer to a foreign partnership of appreciated property under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, and the foreign partnership disposes of the property while such United States person remains a direct or indirect partner, that United States person must report the disposition by filing Form 8865. The form must be attached to, and filed by the due date (including extensions) of, the United States person's income tax return for the year in which the disposition occurred.
(ii)
Disposition of contributed property in nonrecognition transaction.
If a foreign partnership disposes of contributed appreciated property in a nonrecognition transaction and substituted basis property is received in exchange, and the substituted basis property has built-in gain under § 1.704-3(a)(8), the original transferor is not required to report the disposition. However, the transferor must report the disposition of the substituted basis property in the same manner as provided for the contributed property.
(5)
Time for filing Form 8865.
The Form 8865 on which a transfer is reported must be attached to the transferor's timely filed (including extensions) income tax return for the tax year that includes the date of the transfer. If the person required to report under this section is not required to file an income tax return for its tax year during which the transfer occurred, but is required to file an information return for that year (for example, Form 1065, “U.S. Partnership Return of Income,” or Form 990, “Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax”), the person should attach the Form 8865 to its information return.
(6)
Returns to be made
—(i)
Separate returns for each partnership.
If a United States person transfers property reportable under this section to more than one foreign partnership in a taxable year, the United States person must submit a separate Form 8865 for each partnership.
(ii)
Duplicate form to be filed.
If required by the instructions accompanying Form 8865, a duplicate Form 8865 (including attachments and schedules) must also be filed by the due date for submitting the original Form 8865 under paragraph (a)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.
(7)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph (a) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On November 1, 2001,
US,
a United States person that uses the calendar year as its taxable year, contributes $200,000 to
FP,
a foreign partnership, in a transaction subject to section 721. After the contribution,
US
owns a 5% interest in
FP. US
must report the contribution by filing Form 8865 for its taxable year ending December 31, 2001. On March 1, 2002,
US
makes a $40,000 section 721 contribution to
FP,
after which
US
owns a 6% interest in
FP. US
must report the $40,000 contribution by filing Form 8865 for its taxable year ending December 31, 2002, because the contribution, when added to the value of the other property contributed by
US
to
FP
during the 12-month period ending on the date of the transfer, exceeds $100,000.

# Example 2. F,
a nonresident alien, is the brother of
US,
a United States person.
F
owns a 15% interest in
FP,
a foreign partnership.
US
contributes $99,000 to
FP,
in exchange for a 1-percent partnership interest. Under sections 6038(e)(3)(C) and 267(c)(2),
US
is considered to own at least a 10-percent interest in
FP
and, therefore,
US
must report the $99,000 contribution under this section.

# Example 3. US,
a United States person, owns 40 percent of
FC,
a foreign corporation.
FC
owns a 20-percent interest in
FP,
a foreign partnership. Under section 267(c)(1),
US
is considered to own 8 percent of
FP
due to its ownership of
FC. US
contributes $50,000 to
FP
in exchange for a 5-percent partnership interest. Immediately after the contribution,
US
is considered to own at least a 10-percent interest in
FP
and, therefore, must report the $50,000 contribution under this section.

# Example 4. US,
a United States person, owns a 60-percent interest in
USP,
a domestic partnership. On March 1, 2001,
USP
contributes $200,000 to
FP,
a foreign partnership, in exchange for a 5-percent partnership interest. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section,
US
is considered as having contributed $120,000 to
FP
($200,000 × 60%). However, under paragraph (a)(2), if
USP
properly reports the contribution to
FP, US
is not required to report its $120,000 contribution. If
US
directly contributes $5,000 to
FP
on June 10, 2001,
US
must report the $5,000 contribution because
US
is considered to have contributed more than $100,000 to
FP
in the 12-month period ending on the date of the $5,000 contribution.

# Example 5. US,
a United States person, owns an 80-percent interest in
USP,
a domestic partnership.
USP
owns an 80-percent interest in
USP1,
a domestic partnership. On March 1, 2001,
USP1
contributes $200,000 to
FP,
a foreign partnership, in exchange for a 3-percent partnership interest. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section,
USP
is considered to have contributed $160,000 ($200,000 × 80%) to
FP. US
is considered to have contributed $128,000 to
FP
($200,000 × 80% × 80%). However, if
USP1
reports the transfer of the $200,000 to
FP,
neither
US
nor
USP
are required to report under this section the amounts they are considered to have contributed. Additionally, regardless of whether
USP1
reports the $200,000 contribution, if
USP
reports the $160,000 contribution it is considered to have made,
US
does not have to report under this section the $128,000 contribution
US
is considered to have made.
(b)
Transfers by trusts relating to state and local government employee retirement plans.
Trusts relating to state and local government employee retirement plans are not required to report transfers under this section, unless otherwise specified in the instructions to Form 8865.
(c)
Information required with respect to transfers of property.
With respect to transfers required to be reported under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, the return must contain information in such form or manner as Form 8865 (and its accompanying instructions) prescribes with respect to reportable events, including—
(1) The name, address, and U.S. taxpayer identification number of the United States person making the transfer;
(2) The name, U.S. taxpayer identification number (if any), and address of the transferee foreign partnership, and the type of entity and country under whose laws the partnership was created or organized;
(3) A general description of the transfer, and of any wider transaction of which it forms a part, including the date of transfer;
(4) The names and addresses of the other partners in the foreign partnership, unless the transfer is solely of cash and the transferor holds less than a ten-percent interest in the transferee foreign partnership immediately after the transfer. However, for tax years of U.S. persons beginning on or after January 1, 2000, the person reporting pursuant to section 6038B (the transferor) must provide the names and addresses of each United States person that owned a ten-percent or greater direct interest in the foreign partnership during the transferor's tax year in which the transfer occurred, and the names and addresses of any other United States or foreign persons that were direct partners in the foreign partnership during that tax year and that were related to the transferor during that tax year. See paragraph (i)(4) of this section for the definition of a related person;
(5) A description of the partnership interest received by the United States person, including a change in partnership interest;
(6) A separate description of each item of contributed property that is appreciated property subject to the allocation rules of section 704(c) (except
to the extent that the property is permitted to be aggregated in making allocations under section 704(c)), or is intangible property, including its estimated fair market value and adjusted basis;
(7) A description of other contributed property, not specified in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, aggregated by the following categories (with, in each case, a brief description of the property)—
(i) Stock in trade of the transferor (inventory);
(ii) Tangible property (other than stock in trade) used in a trade or business of the transferor;
(iii) Cash;
(iv) Stock, notes receivable and payable, and other securities; and
(v) Other property;
(8) With respect to reporting required under § 1.721(c)-6(b)(2) and paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section with regard to a gain deferral contribution, the information required by § 1.721(c)-6(b)(2); and
(9) With respect to section 721(c) property for which reporting is required under § 1.721(c)-6(b)(3) and paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, the information required by § 1.721(c)-6(b)(3).
(d)
Information required with respect to dispositions of property.
In respect of dispositions required to be reported under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the return must contain information in such form or manner as Form 8865 (and its accompanying instructions) prescribes with respect to reportable events, including—
(1) The date and manner of disposition;
(2) The gain and depreciation recapture amounts, if any, realized by the partnership; and
(3) Any such amounts allocated to the United States person.
(e)
Method of reporting.
Except as otherwise provided on Form 8865, or the accompanying instructions, all amounts reported as required under this section must be expressed in United States currency, with a statement of the exchange rates used. All statements required on or with Form 8865 pursuant to this section must be in the English language.
(f)
Reporting under this section not required of partnerships excluded from the application of subchapter K
—(1)
Election to be wholly excluded.
The reporting requirements of this section will not apply to any United States person in respect of an eligible partnership as described in § 1.761-2(a), if such partnership has validly elected to be excluded from all of the provisions of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code in the manner specified in § 1.761-2(b)(2)(i).

—(1)
Consequences of a failure.
If a United States person is required to file a return under paragraph (a) of this section and fails to comply with the reporting requirements of section 6038B and this section, or § 1.721(c)-6, then that person is subject to the following penalties:
(i) The United States person is subject to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the fair market value of the property at the time of the contribution. Such penalty with respect to a particular transfer is limited to $100,000, unless the failure to comply with respect to such transfer was due to intentional disregard.
(ii) The United States person must recognize gain (reduced by the amount of any gain recognized, with respect to that property, by the transferor after
the transfer) as if the contributed property had been sold for fair market value at the time of the contribution. Adjustments to the basis of the partnership's assets and any relevant partner's interest as a result of gain being recognized under this provision will be made as though the gain was recognized in the year in which the failure to report was finally determined.
(2)
Failure to comply.
A failure to comply with the requirements of section 6038B includes—
(i) The failure to report at the proper time and in the proper manner any information required to be reported under the rules of this section; and

(3)
Reasonable cause exception.
Under section 6038B(c)(2) and this section, the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this section will not apply if the United States person shows, in a timely manner, that a failure to comply was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. A United States person's statement that the failure to comply was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect will be considered timely only if, promptly after the United States person becomes aware of the failure, an amended return is filed for the taxable year to which the failure relates that includes the information that should have been included with the original return for such taxable year or that otherwise complies with the rules of this section, and that includes a written statement explaining the reasons for the failure to comply. If any taxable year of the United States person is under examination when the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return must be delivered to the Internal Revenue Service personnel conducting the examination when the amended return is filed. If no taxable year of the United States person is under examination when the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return must be delivered to the Director of Field Operations, Cross Border Activities Practice Area of Large Business
International (or any successor to the roles and responsibilities of such position, as appropriate) (Director). Whether a failure to comply was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect will be determined by the Director under all the facts and circumstances.

Separate annual return.
A married specified individual who files a separate annual return for the taxable year must fulfill the reporting requirements under section 6038D and § 1.6038D-2(a) by filing a separate Form 8938 with his or her return that reports all of the specified foreign financial assets in which the married specified individual has an interest, including each of the assets jointly owned with the married specified individual's spouse or with another person. If both of the spouses are specified individuals, each specified individual must report the entire value of each specified foreign financial asset that the spouses jointly own on Form 8938, not the value taken into account under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section for purposes of applying the applicable reporting thresholds.
(e)
Special rules for dual resident taxpayers
—(1)
In general.
Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, a specified individual is
not required to report specified foreign financial assets on Form 8938 for a taxable year or any portion of a taxable year that the individual is a dual resident taxpayer (within the meaning of § 301.7701(b)-7(a)(1) of this chapter) who is treated as a nonresident alien pursuant to § 301.7701(b)-7 of this chapter for purposes of computing his or her U.S. tax liability with respect to the portion of the taxable year the individual is considered a dual resident taxpayer.
(2)
Dual resident taxpayer filing as a nonresident alien at end of taxable year.
If a specified individual to whom this paragraph (e) applies computes his or her U.S. income tax liability as a nonresident alien on the last day of the taxable year and complies with the filing requirements of § 301.7701(b)-7(b) and (c) of this chapter and, in particular, such individual timely files with the Internal Revenue Service Form 1040NR, “U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return,” or Form 1040NR-EZ, “U.S. Income Tax Return for Certain Nonresident Aliens With No Dependents,” as applicable, and attaches thereto Form 8833, “Treaty-Based Return Position Disclosure Under Section 6114 or 7701(b),” such individual will not be required to report specified foreign financial assets on Form 8938 with respect to the portion of the taxable year covered by Form 1040NR (or Form 1040NR-EZ).
(3)
Dual resident taxpayer filing as resident alien at end of taxable year.
If a specified individual to whom this paragraph (e) applies computes his or her U.S. income tax liability as a resident alien on the last day of the taxable year and complies with the filing requirements of § 1.6012-1(b)(2)(ii)(a) and, in particular, such individual timely files with the Internal Revenue Service Form 1040, “U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,” or Form 1040EZ, “Income Tax Return for Single and Joint Filers With No Dependents,” as applicable, and attaches a properly completed Form 8833 to the schedule required by § 1.6012-1(b)(2)(ii)(a), such individual will not be required to report specified foreign financial assets on Form 8938 with respect to the portion of the individual's taxable year reflected on the schedule to such Form 1040 or Form 1040EZ required by § 1.6012-1(b)(2)(ii)(a).
(f)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (c) of this section:

# Example.
(1)
Facts.
Two married specified individuals, H and W, jointly own a specified foreign financial asset with a value of $90,000 at all times during the taxable year. H separately has an interest in a specified foreign financial asset with a value of $10,000 at all times during the taxable year. W separately has an interest in a specified foreign financial asset with a value of $1,000 at all times during the taxable year.
(2)
Filing requirement
—(i)
Married specified individuals filing separate annual returns.
If H and W file separate annual returns, the aggregate value of the specified foreign financial assets in which H has an interest at the end of the taxable year is $55,000, comprising one-half of the value of the jointly owned asset, $45,000, and the value of H's separately owned specified foreign financial asset, $10,000. The aggregate value of the specified foreign financial assets in which W has an interest at the end of the taxable year is $46,000, comprising one-half of the value of the jointly owned asset, $45,000, and the value of W's separately owned specified foreign financial asset, $1,000. H must file Form 8938 with his annual return for the taxable year because the aggregate value of the specified foreign financial assets in which H has an interest exceeds the applicable reporting threshold ($50,000) set forth in § 1.6038D-2(a)(1). H must report the maximum value of the entire jointly owned asset, $90,000, and the maximum value of the separately owned asset, $10,000. See § 1.6038D-5(b) regarding the maximum value of a jointly owned specified foreign financial asset to be reported by a specified person, including a married specified individual, that is a joint owner of an asset. The aggregate value of the specified foreign financial assets in which W has an interest, $46,000, does not exceed the applicable reporting threshold set forth in § 1.6038D-2(a)(1). W is not required to file Form 8938 with her separate annual return.
(ii)
Married specified individuals filing a joint annual return.
If H and W file a joint annual return, they must file a single Form 8938 with their joint annual return for the taxable year because the aggregate value of all of the specified foreign financial assets in which either H or W have an interest ($90,000 (included only once), $10,000, and $1000, or $101,000) exceeds the applicable reporting threshold ($100,000) set forth in § 1.6038D-2(a)(2). The single Form 8938 must report the maximum value of the jointly owned specified foreign financial asset, $90,000, and the maximum value of the specified foreign financial assets separately owned by H and W, $10,000 and $1,000, respectively.

—(i)
Accounts maintained by U.S. payors.
A financial account maintained by a U.S. payor as defined in § 1.6049-5(c)(5)(i) (including assets held in such an account) is not a specified foreign financial asset for purposes of section 6038D and the regulations.
(ii)
Mark-to-market election under section 475.

(iii) An interest in a foreign entity.
(2)
Mark-to-market election under section 475.

(3)
Held for investment.
An asset is held for investment for purposes of section 6038D and the regulations if that asset is not used in, or held for use in, the conduct of a trade or business of a specified person.
(4)
Trade-or-business test.
For purposes of section 6038D and the regulations, an asset is used in, or held for use in, the conduct of a trade or business and not held for investment if the asset is—
(i) Held for the principal purpose of promoting the present conduct of the trade or business;
(ii) Acquired and held in the ordinary course of the trade or business, as, for example, in the case of an account or note receivable arising from that trade or business; or
(iii) Otherwise held in a direct relationship to the trade or business as determined under paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
(5)
Direct relationship between holding an asset and a trade or business
—(i)
In general.
In determining whether an asset is held in a direct relationship to the conduct of a trade or business by a specified person, principal consideration will be given to whether the asset is needed in the trade or business of the specified person. An asset shall be considered needed in the trade or business, for this purpose, only if the asset is held to meet the present needs of that trade or business and not its anticipated future needs. An asset shall be considered as needed in the trade or business if, for example, the asset is held to meet the operating expenses of
the trade or business. Conversely, an asset shall be considered as not needed in the trade or business if, for example, the asset is held for the purpose of providing for future diversification into a new trade or business, future plant replacement, or future business contingencies. Stock is never considered used or held for use in a trade or business for purposes of applying this test.
(ii)
Presumption of direct relationship.
An asset will be treated as held in a direct relationship to the conduct of a trade or business of a specified person if—

An interest in a foreign trust or a foreign estate is not a specified foreign financial asset of a specified person unless the person knows, or has reason to know based on readily accessible information, of the interest. Receipt of a distribution from the foreign trust or foreign estate constitutes actual knowledge for this purpose.
(d)
Examples.
Examples of assets other than financial accounts that may be considered other specified foreign financial assets include, but are not limited to—
(1) Stock issued by a foreign corporation;
(2) A capital or profits interest in a foreign partnership;
(3) A note, bond, debenture, or other form of indebtedness issued by a foreign person;

§ 1.6038D-5
Valuation guidelines.
(a)
Fair market value.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, the value of a specified foreign financial asset for purposes of determining the aggregate value of specified foreign financial assets held by a specified person and the maximum value of a specified foreign financial asset required to be reported on Form 8938, “Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets,” is the asset's fair market value.
(b)
Valuation of assets
—(1)
Maximum value.

(2)
U.S. dollars.
For purposes of determining the aggregate value of specified foreign financial assets in which a specified person has an interest and determining the maximum value of a specified foreign financial asset, the value of a specified foreign financial asset denominated in a foreign currency during the taxable year must be determined in the foreign currency and then converted to U.S. dollars.
(3)
Asset with no positive value.
If the maximum fair market value of a specified foreign financial asset is zero or less than zero, then the asset's value is treated as zero for purposes of determining the aggregate value of specified foreign financial assets in which a specified person has an interest, and the maximum value of the specified foreign financial asset is zero for purposes of reporting under § 1.6038D-4(a)(5).
(c)
Foreign currency conversion
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (d) of this section, the U.S. Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service foreign currency exchange rate is to be used to convert the value of a specified foreign financial asset into U.S. dollars for purposes of determining the aggregate value of specified foreign financial assets in which a specified person has an interest and determining the maximum
value of a specified foreign financial asset.
(2)
Other publicly available exchange rate.
If no U.S. Treasury Department Bureau of the Fiscal Service foreign currency exchange rate is available for a particular currency, another publicly available foreign currency exchange rate may be used to convert the value of a specified foreign financial asset into U.S. dollars. In such case, the source of the foreign currency exchange rate must be disclosed on Form 8938.
(3)
Currency exchange rate.
In converting the currency of a foreign country, the foreign currency exchange rate applicable for converting the currency into U.S. dollars (that is, to purchase U.S. dollars) must be used.
(4)
Determination date.
In converting the currency of a foreign country into U.S. dollars for purposes of determining the maximum value of a specified foreign financial asset and determining the aggregate value of specified foreign financial assets in which a specified person has an interest, the applicable foreign currency exchange rate is the rate on the last day of the taxable year of the specified person, even if the specified person sold or otherwise disposed of a specified foreign financial asset prior to the last day of such year.
(d)
Financial accounts.
A specified person may rely upon periodic account statements that are provided at least annually by or on behalf of a financial institution maintaining an account, including the foreign currency conversion reflected in those statements, to determine the financial account's maximum value unless the specified person has actual knowledge, or reason to know based on readily accessible information, that the statements do not reflect a reasonable estimate of the maximum account value during the taxable year.

—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section, for specified foreign financial assets that are not financial accounts and that are held for investment and not held in an account maintained by a financial institution, a specified person may use the value of the asset as of the last day of the taxable year on which the specified person has an interest in the asset as the maximum value of that asset, unless the specified person has actual knowledge, or reason to know based on readily accessible information, that the value does not reflect a reasonable estimate of the maximum value of the asset during the taxable year.
(2)
Interests in trusts that are specified foreign financial assets
—(i)
Maximum value.
If a specified person is a beneficiary of a foreign trust, the maximum value of the specified person's interest in the trust is the sum of—
(A) The fair market value, determined as of the last day of the taxable year, of all of the currency or other property distributed from the foreign trust during the taxable year to the specified person as a beneficiary; and
(B) The value, determined as of the last day of the taxable year, of the specified person's right as a beneficiary to receive mandatory distributions from the foreign trust as determined under section 7520.

Reporting threshold.
For purposes of determining the aggregate value of specified foreign financial assets in which a specified person has an interest, if the specified person does not know, or have reason to know based on readily accessible information, the fair market value of the person's interest in a foreign trust during the taxable year, the value to be included in determining the aggregate value of the specified foreign financial assets is the maximum value of the specified person's interest in the foreign trust under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.
(3)
Interests in estates, pension plans, and deferred compensation
plans
—(i)
Maximum value.
The maximum value of a specified person's interest in a foreign estate, foreign pension plan, or foreign deferred compensation plan is the fair market value, determined as of the last day of the taxable year, of the specified person's beneficial interest in the assets of the foreign estate, foreign

(3)
Determination of passive income and assets
—(i)
Definition of passive income.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, passive income means the portion of gross income that consists of—
(A) Dividends, including substitute dividends;

(
1
) Any commodity hedging transaction described in section 954(c)(5)(A), determined by treating the corporation or partnership as a controlled foreign corporation; or

) Active business gains or losses from the sale of commodities, but only if substantially all the corporation or partnership's commodities are property described in paragraph (1), (2), or (8) of section 1221(a);
(H) The excess of foreign currency gains over foreign currency losses (as defined in section 988(b)) attributable to any section 988 transaction; and

(A) Any item of income or gain (other than any dividends or interest) from any transaction (including hedging transactions and transactions involving physical settlement) entered into in the ordinary course of such dealer's trade or business as such a dealer; and
(B) If such dealer is a dealer in securities (within the meaning of section 475(c)(2)), any income from any transaction entered into in the ordinary course of such trade or business as a dealer in securities.
(iii)
Related entities.
For purposes of applying the passive income and asset thresholds of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, all domestic corporations and domestic partnerships that are closely held by the same specified individual as determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section and that are connected through stock or partnership interest ownership with a common parent corporation or partnership are treated as owning the combined assets and receiving the combined income of all members of that group. For purposes of the preceding sentence, assets relating to any contract, equity, or debt existing between members of such a group, as well as any items of gross income arising under or from such contract, equity, or debt, are eliminated.

(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section:

# Example 1.
Closely held and constructive ownership.
(i)
Facts.
DC1 is a domestic corporation the total value of the stock of which is owned 60% by A, a specified individual, 30% by B, a member of A's family for purposes of section 267(c)(2) who is not a specified individual, and 10% by FC1, a foreign corporation. DC1 owns 90% of the total value of the stock of DC2, a domestic corporation. FC2, a foreign corporation, owns 10% of DC2. Neither A nor B owns, directly, indirectly, or constructively, any stock in FC1 or FC2.
(ii)
Closely held ownership determination.
A is considered to own 90% and 81% of the total value of DC1 and DC2, respectively, by application of the rules of section 267(c) and this section. DC1 and DC2 are closely held by A within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2) of this section because A, a specified individual, is considered to own more than 80% of their total value.

# Example 2.
Application of aggregation rule and reporting threshold.
(i)
Facts.
L is a specified individual. In Year X, L wholly owns DC1, a domestic corporation, and also owns a 90% capital interest in DP, a domestic partnership. DC1 owns 80% of the sole class of stock of DC2, a domestic corporation. DC1 has no assets other than its interest in DC2. DC2's only assets are assets that produce passive income, with a maximum value in Year X of $40,000 on October 12. DC2's assets are comprised in relevant part of specified foreign financial assets with a maximum value in Year X of $15,000 on October 12. DP's only assets are assets that produce passive income and that are specified foreign financial assets with a maximum value of $90,000 in Year X on October 12.
(ii)
Specified domestic entity status
—(A)
DC1 and DC2.
DC1 and DC2 are closely held by a specified individual for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. DC1 and DC2 are considered related entities that are connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, because DC1 and DC2 are closely held by L, and DC2 is connected with DC1 through DC1's ownership of stock of DC2 representing at least 80% of the voting power or value of DC2. As a result, for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, each of DC1 and DC2 is considered as owning the combined assets, and receiving the combined income, of both DC1 and DC2; however, DC1's equity interest in DC2 is disregarded for this purpose under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Therefore, DC1 and DC2 each satisfies the passive asset threshold of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, because 100 percent of each company's assets is passive. DC1 and DC2 are specified domestic entities for Year X.
(B)
DP.
DP is closely held by a specified individual for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. DP is not considered a related entity with DC1 and DC2 under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, because DC1 and DP are not owned by a common parent corporation or partnership. As a result, whether the passive income or passive asset threshold of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section is met with respect to DP is determined solely by reference to DP's separately earned passive income and separately held passive assets. DP holds only passive assets during Year X and therefore satisfies paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. DP is a specified domestic entity for Year X.
(iii)
Reporting requirements
—(A)
DC1.
Under § 1.6038D-2(a)(6)(ii), DC1 is not treated as owning the specified foreign financial assets held by DC2 and DP for purposes of applying the reporting threshold of § 1.6038D-2(a)(1), because DC1 does not have an interest in any specified foreign financial assets. DC1 is not required to file Form 8938 because DC1 does not satisfy the reporting threshold of § 1.6038D-2(a)(1).
(B)
DC2 and DP.
Under § 1.6038D-3, DC2 and DP each has an interest in specified foreign financial assets. For purposes of applying the reporting threshold of § 1.6038D-2(a)(1), § 1.6038D-2(a)(6)(ii) provides that DC2 is treated as owning in addition to its own assets the assets of DP, and DP is treated as owning in addition to its own assets the assets of DC2. As a result, DC2 and DP each satisfies the reporting threshold of § 1.6038D-2(a)(1), because the value of the specified foreign financial assets each is considered as owning for purposes of § 1.6038D-2(a)(1) is $105,000 on October 12, Year X, which exceeds DC2's and DP's $75,000 reporting threshold. DC2 and DP must each file Form 8938 for Year X to report their respective specified foreign financial assets in which they have an interest and disclose their maximum values as provided in § 1.6038D-4 ($15,000 in the case of DC2 and $90,000 in the case of DP).

# Example 3.
Application of aggregation rule and entity with an active trade or business.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that DC2 also owns an active business. The assets attributable to the business are not passive assets and constitute at least 60% of the value of DC2's assets at all times during Year X. The income from the business is not passive income and constitutes at least 60% of the gross income generated by DC2 in Year X.
(ii)
Specified domestic entity status
—(A)
DC1 and DC2.
DC1 and DC2 are considered related entities that are connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section because DC1 and DC2 are closely held by L, and DC2 is connected with DC1 though DC1's ownership of stock of DC2 representing at least 80% of the voting power or value of DC2. As a result, for purposes of applying paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, each of
DC1 and DC2 is treated as owning the combined assets, and receiving the combined income, of both DC1 and DC2; however, DC1's equity interest in DC2 is disregarded for this purpose under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. As a result, no more than 40 percent of the value of DC1's and DC2's assets at all times during Year X are passive and no more than 40 percent of DC1's and DC2's gross income for Year X is passive. DC1 and DC2 do not satisfy the passive income or passive asset threshold in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section for Year X. DC1 and DC2 are not specified domestic entities for Year X.
(B)
DP.
For the reasons described in paragraph (ii)(B) of
Example 2,
DP is a specified domestic entity for Year X.
(iii)
Reporting requirements
—(A)
DC1 and DC2.
DC1 and DC2 are not specified domestic entities for Year X, and are not required to file Form 8938.
(B)
DP.
Under § 1.6038D-3, DP has an interest in specified foreign financial assets. Under § 1.6038D-2(a)(6)(ii), DP is treated as owning in addition to its own assets the assets of DC2. As a result, DP satisfies the reporting threshold of § 1.6038D-2(a)(1) because the value of the specified foreign financial assets it is considered to own for purposes of § 1.6038D-2(a)(1) is $105,000 on October 12, Year X, which exceeds DP's $75,000 reporting threshold. DP must file Form 8938 for Year X to report the specified foreign financial assets in which it has an interest and disclose their maximum values as provided in § 1.6038D-4, which is $90,000.
(c)
Domestic trusts.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, a trust described in section 7701(a)(30)(E) is formed or availed of for purposes of holding, directly or indirectly, specified foreign financial assets if and only if the trust has one or more specified persons as a current beneficiary. The term current beneficiary means, with respect to the taxable year, any person who at any time during such taxable year is entitled to, or at the discretion of any person may receive, a distribution from the principal or income of the trust (determined without regard to any power of appointment to the extent that such power remains unexercised at the end of the taxable year). The term current beneficiary also includes any holder of a general power of appointment, whether or not exercised, that was exercisable at any time during the taxable year, but does not include any holder of a general power of appointment that is exercisable only on the death of the holder.
(d)
Excepted domestic entities.

(1)
Certain persons described in section 1473(3).

If any failure to comply with the applicable reporting requirement of section 6038D and the regulations continues for more than 90 days after the day on which the Commissioner or his delegate mails a notice of the failure to the specified person required to file the Form 8938, the specified person is required to pay an additional penalty of $10,000 for each 30-day period (or fraction thereof) during which the failure continues after the 90-day period has expired.

(d)

Except as otherwise provided in §§ 1.6041-3 and 1.6041-4, every person engaged in a trade or business shall make an information return for each calendar year with respect to payments it makes during the calendar year in the course of its trade or business to another person of fixed or determinable income described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) (A) or (B) of this section. For purposes of the regulations under this section, the person described in this paragraph (a)(1)(i) is a payor.
(A) Salaries, wages, commissions, fees, and other forms of compensation for services rendered aggregating $600 or more.
(B) Interest (including original issue discount), rents, royalties, annuities, pensions, and other gains, profits, and income aggregating $600 or more.
(ii)
Information returns required under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
The payments described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) and (B) of this section shall not include any payments of amounts with respect to which an information return is required by, or may be required under authority of, section 6042(a) (relating to dividends), section 6043(a)(2) (relating to distributions in liquidation), section 6044(a) (relating to patronage dividends), section 6045 (relating to brokers' transactions with customers and certain other transactions), sections 6049(a)(1) and (2) (relating to interest), section 6050N(a) (relating to royalties), or section 6050P(a) or (b) (relating to cancellation of indebtedness). For information returns required under section 6045(f) (relating to payments to attorneys), see special rules in §§ 1.6041-1(a)(1)(iii) and 1.6045-5(c)(4). For payment card transactions (as described in § 1.6050W-1(b)) and third party network transactions (as defined in § 1.6050W-1(c)) required to be reported on information returns required under section 6050W (relating to payment card and third party network transactions), see special rules in § 1.6041-1(a)(1)(iv).
(iii) Information returns required under section 6045(f) on or after January 1, 2007. For payments made on or after January 1, 2007 to which section 6045(f) (relating to payments to attorneys) applies, the following rules apply. Not withstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, payments to an attorney that are described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section but which otherwise would be reportable under section 6045(f) are reported under section 6041 and this section and not section 6045(f). This exception applies only if the payments are reportable with respect to the same payee under both sections. Thus, a person who, in the course of a trade or business, pays $600 of taxable damages to a claimant by paying that amount to the claimant's attorney is required to file an information return under section 6041 with respect to the claimant, as well as another information return under section 6045(f) with respect to the claimant's attorney. For provisions relating to information reporting for payments to attorneys, see § 1.6045-5.
(iv)
Information returns required under section 6050W for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2010.
For payments made by payment card (as defined in § 1.6050W-1(b)(3)) or through a
third party payment network (as defined in § 1.6050W-1(c)(3)) after December 31, 2010, that are required to be reported on an information return under section 6050W (relating to payment card and third party network transactions), the following rule applies. Transactions that are described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section that otherwise would be subject to reporting under both sections 6041 and 6050W are reported under section 6050W and not section 6041. For provisions relating to information reporting for payment card and third party network transactions, see § 1.6050W-1. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, the de minimis threshold for third party network transactions in § 1.6050W-1(c)(4) is disregarded in determining whether the transaction is subject to reporting under section 6050W.
(v)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Restaurant owner A, in the course of business, pays $600 of fixed or determinable income to B, a repairman, by credit card. B is one of a network of unrelated persons that has agreed to accept A's credit card as payment under an agreement that provides standards and mechanisms for settling the transactions between a merchant acquiring bank and the persons who accept the cards. Merchant acquiring bank Y is responsible for making the payment to B. Under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, A, as payor, is not required to file an information return under section 6041 with respect to the transaction because Y, as the payment settlement entity for the payment card transaction, is required to file an information return under section 6050W.

# Example 2.
Restaurant owner A, in the course of business, pays $600 of fixed or determinable income to B, a repairman, through a third party payment network. B is one of a substantial number of persons who have established accounts with Y, a third party settlement organization that provides standards and mechanisms for settling the transactions and guarantees payments to those persons for goods or services purchased through the network. Y is responsible for making the payment to B. Under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section, A, as payor, is not required to file an information return under section 6041 with respect to the transaction because the transaction is a third party network transaction that is subject to reporting under section 6050W. Solely for purposes of determining whether A is eligible for relief from reporting under section 6041, the de minimis threshold for third party network transactions in § 1.6050W-1(c)(4) is disregarded.
(2)
Prescribed form.
The return required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be made on Forms 1096 and 1099 except that (i) the return with respect to distributions to beneficiaries of a trust or of an estate shall be made on Form 1041, and (ii) the return with respect to certain payments of compensation to an employee by his employer shall be made on Forms W-3 and W-2 under the provisions of § 1.6041-2 (relating to return of information as to payments to employees). Where Form 1099 is required to be filed under this section, a separate Form 1099 shall be furnished for each person to whom payments described in subdivision (i), (ii), or (iii) of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph are made. For time and place for filing Forms 1096 and 1099, see § 1.6041-6. For the requirement to submit the information required by Form 1099 on magnetic media for payments after December 31, 1983, see section 6011(e) and § 301.6011-2 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations).
(b)
Persons engaged in trade or business
—(1)
In general.
The term “all persons engaged in a trade or business”, as used in section 6041(a), includes not only those so engaged for gain or profit, but also organizations the activities of which are not for the purpose of gain or profit. Thus, the term includes the organizations referred to in section 401(a), 501(c), 501(d) and 521 and in paragraph (i) of this section. On the other hand, section 6041(a) applies only to payments in the course of trade or business; hence it does not apply to an amount paid by the proprietor of a business to a physician for medical services rendered by the physician to the proprietor's child.
(2)
Special rule for REMICs.
For purposes of chapter 1 subtitle F, chapter 61A, part IIIB, the terms “all persons engaged in a trade or business” and “any service-recipient engaged in a trade or business” includes a real estate mortgage investment conduit or REMIC (as defined in section 860D).
(c)
Fixed or determinable income.
Income is fixed when it is to be paid in amounts definitely predetermined. Income is determinable whenever there is
a basis of calculation by which the amount to be paid may be ascertained. The income need not be paid annually or at regular intervals. The fact that the payments may be increased or decreased in accordance with the happening of an event does not for purposes of this section make the payments any the less determinable. A payment made jointly to two or more payees may be fixed and determinable income to one payee even though the payment is not fixed and determinable income to another payee. For example, property insurance proceeds paid jointly to the owner of damaged property and to a contractor that repairs the property may be fixed and determinable income to the contractor but not fixed and determinable income to the owner, and should be reported to the contractor. A salesman working by the month for a commission on sales which is paid or credited monthly receives determinable income.
(d)
Payments specifically included
—(1)
In general.
Amounts paid in respect of life insurance, endowment, or annuity contracts are required to be reported in returns of information under this section—
(i) Unless the payment is made in respect of a life insurance or endowment contract by reason of the death of the insured and is not required to be reported by paragraph (b) of § 1.6041-2,
(ii) Unless the payment is made by reason of the surrender prior to maturity or lapse of a policy, other than a policy which was purchased (
a
) by a trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a), (
b
) as part of a plan described in section 403(a), or (
c
) by an employer described in section 403(b)(1)(A),
(iii) Unless the payment is interest as defined in § 1.6049-2 and is made after December 31, 1962,
(iv) Unless the payment is a payment with respect to which a return is required by § 1.6047-1, relating to employee retirement plans covering owner-employees,
(v) Unless the payment is payment with respect to which a return is required by § 1.6052-1, relating to payment of wages in the form of group-term life insurance.
(2)
Professional fees.
Fees for professional services paid to attorneys, physicians, and members of other professions are required to be reported in returns of information if paid by persons engaged in a trade or business and paid in the course of such trade or business.
(3)
Prizes and awards.
Amounts paid as prizes and awards that are required to be included in gross income under section 74 and § 1.74-1 when paid in the course of a trade or business are required to be reported in returns of information under this section.
(4)
Disability payments.
Amounts paid as disability payments under section 105(d) are required to be reported in returns of information under this section.
(5)
Notional principal contracts.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section, amounts paid after December 31, 2000, with respect to notional principal contracts referred to in § 1.863-7 or 1.988-2(e) to persons who are not described in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) are required to be reported in returns of information under this section. The amount required to be reported under this paragraph (d)(5) is limited to the amount of cash paid from the notional principal contract as described in § 1.446-3(d). A non-periodic payment is reportable for the year in which an actual payment is made. Any amount of interest determined under the provisions of § 1.446-3(g)(4) (dealing with interest in the case of a significant non-periodic payment) is reportable under this paragraph (d)(5) and not under section 6049 (see § 1.6049-5(b)(15)). See § 1.6041-4(a)(4) for reporting exceptions regarding payments to foreign persons. See, however, § 1.1461-1(c)(1) for reporting amounts described under this paragraph (d)(5) that are paid to foreign persons. The provisions of § 1.6049-5(d) shall apply for determining whether a payment with respect to a notional principal contract is made to a foreign person. See § 1.6049-4(a) for a definition of payor. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(5), a payor includes a middleman defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(4).
(i) An amount paid with respect to a notional principal contract is not required to be reported if the amount is paid by a non-U.S. payor or a non-U.S. middleman and is paid and received
outside the United States (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(16)).
(ii) An amount paid with respect to a notional principal contract is not required to be reported if the amount is paid by a payor that has no actual knowledge that the payee is a U.S. person and is paid and received outside the United States (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(16)), and the payor is—
(A) A U.S. payor or U.S. middleman that is not a U.S. person (such as a controlled foreign corporation defined in section 957(a) or certain foreign corporations or foreign partnerships engaged in a U.S. trade or business); or
(B) A foreign branch of a U.S. bank. See § 1.6049-5(c)(5) for a definition of a U.S. payor, a U.S. middleman, a non-U.S. payor, and a non-U.S. middleman.
(e)
Payment made on behalf of another person
—(1)
In general.
A person that makes a payment in the course of its trade or business on behalf of another person is the payor that must make a return of information under this section with respect to that payment if the payment is described in paragraph (a) of this section and, under all the facts and circumstances, that person—
(i) Performs management or oversight functions in connection with the payment (this would exclude, for example, a person who performs mere administrative or ministerial functions such as writing checks at another's direction); or
(ii) Has a significant economic interest in the payment (i.e., an economic interest that would be compromised if the payment were not made, such as by creation of a mechanic's lien on property to which the payment relates, or a loss of collateral).
(2)
Determination of payor obligated to report.
If two or more persons meet the requirements for making a return of information with respect to a payment, as set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the person obligated to report the payment is the person closest in the chain to the payee, unless the parties agree in writing that one of the other parties meeting the requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section will report the payment.
(3)
Special rule for payment by employee to employer.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an employee acting in the course of his employment who makes a payment to his employer on behalf of another person is not required to make a return of information with respect to that payment.
(4)
Optional method to report.
A person that makes a payment on behalf of another person but is not required to make an information return under paragraph (e)(1) of this section may elect to do so pursuant to the procedures established by the Commissioner. See, e.g., Rev. Proc. 84-33 (1984-1 C.B. 502) (optional method for a paying agent to report and deposit amounts withheld for payors under the statutory provisions of backup withholding) (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(5)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (e) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Bank B provides financing to C, a real estate developer, for a construction project. B makes disbursements from the account for labor, materials, services, and other expenses related to the construction project. In connection with the payments, B performs the following functions: approves payments to the general contractor or subcontractors; ensures that loan proceeds are properly applied and that all approved bills are properly paid to avoid mechanics' or materialmen's liens; conducts site inspections to determine whether work has been completed (but does not check the quality of the work). B is performing management or oversight functions in connection with the payments and is subject to the information reporting requirements of section 6041 with respect to payments.

# Example 2.
Mortgage company D holds a mortgage on business property owned by E. When the property is damaged by a storm, E's insurance company issues a check payable to both D and E in settlement of E's claim. Pursuant to the contract between D and E, D holds the insurance proceeds in an escrow account and makes disbursements, according to E's instructions, to contractors and subcontractors performing repairs on the property. D is not performing management or oversight functions, but D has a significant economic interest in the payments because the purpose of the arrangement is to ensure that property on which D holds a mortgage is repaired or replaced. D is subject to the information reporting requirements of section 6041 with respect to the payments to contractors.

# Example 3.
Settlement agent F provides real estate closing services to real estate
brokers and agents. F deposits money received from the buyer or lender in an escrow account and makes payments from the account to real estate agents or brokers, appraisers, land surveyors, building inspectors, or similar service providers according to the provisions of the real estate contract and written instructions from the lender. F may also make disbursements pursuant to oral instructions of the seller or purchaser at closing. F is not performing management or oversight functions and does not have a significant economic interest in the payments, and is not subject to the information reporting requirements of section 6041. For the rules relating to F's obligation to report the gross proceeds of the sale, see section 6045(e) and § 1.6045-4.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3.
In addition, the seller instructs F to hire a contractor to perform repairs on the property. F selects the contractor, negotiates the cost, monitors the progress of the project, and inspects the work to ensure it complies with the contract. With respect to the payments to the contractor, F is performing management or oversight functions and is subject to the information reporting requirements of section 6041.

# Example 5.
G is a rental agent who manages certain rental property on behalf of property owner H. G finds tenants, arranges leases, collects rent, responds to tenant inquiries regarding maintenance, and hires and makes payments to repairmen. G subtracts her commission and any maintenance payments from rental payments and remits the remainder to H. With respect to payments to repairmen, G is performing management or oversight functions and is subject to the information reporting requirements of section 6041. With respect to the payment of rent to H, G is subject to the information reporting requirements of section 6041 regardless of whether she performs management or oversight functions or has a significant economic interest in the payment. See § 1.6041-3(d) for rules relating to rental agents. See § 1.6041-1(f) to determine the amount that G should report to H as rent.

# Example 6.
Literary agent J receives a payment from publisher L of fees earned by J's client, author K. J deposits the payment into a bank account in J's name. From time to time and as directed by K, J makes payments from these funds to attorneys, managers, and other third parties for services rendered to K. After subtracting J's commission, J pays K the net amount. J does not order or direct the provision of services by the third parties to K, and J exercises no discretion in making the payments to the third parties or to K. J is not performing management or oversight functions and does not have a significant economic interest in the payments and is not subject to the information reporting requirements of section 6041 in connection with the payments to K or to the third parties. For the rules relating to L's obligation to report the payment of the fees to K, see paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (f) of this section. For the rules relating to K's obligation to report the payment of the commission to J and the payments to the third parties for services, see paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (d)(2) of this section.

# Example 7.
Attorney P deposits into a client trust fund a settlement payment from R, the defendant in a breach of contract action for lost profits in which P represented plaintiff Q. P makes payments from the client trust fund to service providers such as expert witnesses and private investigators for expenses incurred in the litigation. P decides whom to hire, negotiates the amount of payment, and determines that the services have been satisfactorily performed. In the event of a dispute with a service provider, P withholds payment until the dispute is settled. With respect to payments to the service providers, P is performing management or oversight functions and is subject to the information reporting requirements of section 6041.

# Example 8.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 7.
In addition, assume that after paying the service providers and deducting his legal fee, P pays Q the remaining funds that P had received from the settlement with R. With respect to the payment to Q, P is not performing management or oversight functions, does not have a significant economic interest in the payment, and is not subject to the information reporting requirements of section 6041. For the rules relating to R's obligation to report the payment of the settlement proceeds to P, see section 6045(f) and the regulations thereunder. For the rules relating to R's obligation to report the payment of the settlement proceeds to Q, see paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (f) of this section. For the rules relating to Q's obligation to report the payment of attorney fees to P, see paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (d)(2) of this section.

# Example 9.
Medical insurer S operates as the administrator of a health care program under a contract with a state. S makes payments of government funds to health care providers who provide care to eligible patients. S receives and reviews claims submitted by patients or health care providers, determines if the claims meet all the requirements of the program (e.g., that the care is authorized and that the patients are eligible beneficiaries), and determines the amount of payment. S is performing management or oversight functions and is subject to the information reporting requirements of section 6041 with respect to the payments.

# Example 10.
Race track employee T holds deposits made by horse owner U in a special escrow account in U's name. U enters into a contract with jockey V to ride U's horse in a race at the track. As directed by U, T pays V the fee for riding U's horse from U's escrow
account. T is not performing management or oversight functions, does not have a significant economic interest in the payment, and is not subject to the information reporting requirements of section 6041. For the rules relating to U's obligation to report the payment of the fee to V, see paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.

# Example 11.
X is a certified public accountant employed by Firm Y, and is not a partner. Client Z pays X directly for accounting services. X remits the amount received to Y, as required by the terms of his employment. X does not have any reporting obligation with respect to the payment to Y. For the rules relating to Z's obligation to report the payment to Y for services, see paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (d)(2) of this section.

# Example 12.
Bank contracts with Title Company with respect to the disbursement of funds on a construction loan. Pursuant to their arrangement, the contractor sends draw requests to Title Company, which inspects the work, verifies the amount requested, and then sends the draw request to Bank with supporting documents. Bank pays Title Company the amount of the draw request, and Title Company insures Bank against any loss if it cannot obtain the necessary lien waivers. Bank has a significant economic interest in the payment as a mortgagee, and Title Company exercises management or oversight over the payment. Since Title Company is closest in the chain to the contractor, Title Company should report the payment, unless the parties agree in writing that Bank will report the payment.
(f)
Amount to be reported when fees, expenses or commissions are deducted
—(1)
In general.
The amount to be reported as paid to a payee is the amount includible in the gross income of the payee (which in many cases will be the gross amount of the payment or payments before fees, commissions, expenses, or other amounts owed by the payee to another person have been deducted), whether the payment is made jointly or separately to the payee and another person. The Commissioner may, by guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, illustrate the circumstances under which the gross amount or less than the gross amount may be reported.
(2) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (f) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Attorney P represents client Q in a breach of contract action for lost profits against defendant R. R settles the case for $100,000 damages and $40,000 for attorney fees. Under applicable law, the full $140,000 is includible in Q's gross taxable income. R issues a check payable to P and Q in the amount of $140,000. R is required to make an information return reporting a payment to Q in the amount of $140,000. For the rules with respect to R's obligation to report the payment to P, see section 6045(f) and the regulations thereunder.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that R issues a check to Q for $100,000 and a separate check to P for $40,000. R is required to make an information return reporting a payment to Q in the amount of $140,000. For the rules with respect to R's obligation to report the payment to P, see section 6045(f) and the regulations thereunder.
(g)
Payment made in medium other than cash.
If any payment required to be reported on Form 1099 is made in property other than money, the fair market value of the property at the time of payment is the amount to be included on such form.
(h)
When payment deemed made.
For purposes of a return of information, an amount is deemed to have been paid when it is credited or set apart to a person without any substantial limitation or restriction as to the time or manner of payment or condition upon which payment is to be made, and is made available to him so that it may be drawn at any time, and its receipt brought within his own control and disposition.
(i)
Payments made by the United States or a State.
Information returns on:
(1) Forms 1096 and 1099 and
(2) Forms W-3 and W-2 (when made under the provisions of § 1.6041-2)
of payments made by the United States or a State, or political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, shall be made by the officer or employee of the United States, or of such State, or political subdivision, or of the District of Columbia, or of such agency or instrumentality, as the case may be, having control of such payments or by the officer or employee appropriately designated to make such returns.
(j)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to payments made on or after
January 6, 2017.

§ 1.6041-2
Return of information as to payments to employees.
(a)(1)
In general.
Wages, as defined in section 3401, paid to an employee are required to be reported on Form W-2. See section 6011 and the Employment Tax Regulations thereunder. All other payments of compensation, including the cash value of payments made in any medium other than cash, to an employee by his employer in the course of the trade or business of the employer must also be reported on Form W-2 if the total of such payments and the amount of the employee's wages (as defined in section 3401), if any, required to be reported on Form W-2 aggregates $600 or more in a calendar year. For example, if a payment of $700 was made to an employee and $400 thereof represents wages subject to withholding under section 3402 and the remaining $300 represents compensation not subject to withholding, such wages and compensation must both be reported on Form W-2. A separate Form W-2 shall be furnished for each employee for whom a return must be made. At the election of the employer, components of amounts required to be reported on Form W-2 pursuant to the provisions of this subparagraph may be reported on more than one Form W-2.
(2)
Transmittal form.
The transmittal form for a return on Form W-2 made pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be Form W-3. In a case where an employer must file a Form W-3 under this paragraph and also under § 31.6011(a)-4 or § 31.6011(a)-5 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations), the Form W-3 filed under such § 31.6011(a)-4 or § 31.6011(a)-5 shall also be used as the transmittal form for a return on Form W-2 made pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph.
(3)
Time for filing
—(i)
General rule.
In a case where an employer must file Forms W-3 and W-2 under this paragraph and also under § 31.6011(a)-4 or § 31.6011(a)-5 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations), the time for filing such forms under this paragraph shall be the same as the time (including extensions thereof) for filing such forms under § 31.6011(a)-4 or § 31.6011(a)-5.
(ii)
Exception.
In a case where an employer is not required to file Forms W-3 and W-2 under § 31.6011(a)-4 or § 31.6011(a)-5 of this chapter, returns on Forms W-3 and W-2 required under this paragraph (a) for any calendar year shall be filed on or before January 31 of the following year.
(iii)
Cross reference.
For extensions of time for filing returns, see section 6081 and the regulations thereunder.
(4)
Place for filing.
The returns on Forms W-3 and W-2 required under this paragraph shall be filed pursuant to the rules contained in § 31.6091-1 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations), relating to the place for filing certain returns.
(5)
Statement for employees.
An employer required under this paragraph (a) to file Form W-2 with respect to an employee is also required under sections 6041(d) and 6051 to furnish a written statement to the employee. This written statement must be furnished on Form W-2 in accordance with section 6051 and the regulations.
(b)
Distributions under employees' trust or plan.
(1) Amounts which are:
(i) Distributed or made available to a beneficiary, and to which section 402 (relating to employees' trusts) or section 403 (relating to employee annuity plans) applies, or
(ii) Described in section 72(m)(3)(B), shall be reported on Forms 1096 and 1099 to the extent such amounts are includible in the gross income of such beneficiary if the amounts so includible aggregate $600 or more in any calendar year. In addition, every trust described in section 501(c)(17) which makes one or more payments (including separation and sick and accident benefits) totaling $600 or more in 1 year to an individual must file an annual information return on Form 1096, accompanied by a statement on Form 1099,
for each such individual. Payments made by an employer or a person other than the trustee of the trust should not be considered in determining whether the $600 minimum has been paid by the trustee. The provisions of this subparagraph shall not be applicable to payments of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits made after December 31, 1970, which are treated as if they were wages for purposes of section 3401(a). Such amounts are required to be reported on Forms W-3 and W-2. See paragraph (b)(14) of § 31.3401(a)-1 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations).
(2) Any amount with respect to which a statement is required by § 1.6047-1, relating to employee retirement plans covering owner-employees, shall not be included in amounts required to be reported under section 6041.
(c)
Payments to foreign persons.
See § 1.6041-4 for reporting exemptions regarding payments to foreign persons. See § 1.6049-5(d) for determining whether a payment is made to a foreign person.
(d)

Returns of information are not required under section 6041 and §§ 1.6041-1 and 1.6041-2 for payments described in paragraphs (a) through (q) of this section. See § 1.6041-4 for reporting exemptions regarding payments to foreign persons.

(h)(1)
In general.
Payments made under reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangements that meet the requirements of section 62(c) of the Code and § 1.62-2, that do not exceed the amount of the expenses substantiated (i.e., amounts which are treated as paid under an accountable plan), and that are received by an employee on or after January 1, 1989, with respect to expenses paid or incurred on or after January 1, 1989.
(2)
Transition rule.
Payments made under reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangements that are received by an employee on or after January 1, 1989, but prior to July 1, 1990, to the extent that the employee is required to account (within the meaning of the term “account” as set forth in § 1.162-17(b)(4) or 1.274-5T(f)(4), whichever is applicable) and does so account to the payor for such expenses, provided the payor has made a reasonable, good faith effort to comply with the requirements of section 62(c). In general, compliance with the provisions of this section, as in effect for payments made under reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangements that were received by an employee before January 1, 1989, with respect to expenses paid or
incurred before January 1, 1989, will constitute such reasonable good faith compliance. In no event, however, will reasonable good faith compliance exist if a payor fails to report payments made under an arrangement (other than a per diem or mileage allowance type arrangement) under which an employee is not required to substantiate expenses paid or incurred or is not required to return amounts in excess of the substantiated expenses.
(i) Payments of interest on obligations of the United States, or a State, Territory, or political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing (but for requirements for reporting certain such payments by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof, see §§ 1.1461-1 to 1.1461-3, inclusive).

(2) The organization has immunity with respect to the invoilability of its archives pursuant to an international agreement having full force and effect in the United States.
(l) A payment to an informer as an award, fee, or reward for information relating to criminal activity, but only if such payment is made by the United States, a State, Territory, or political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, or any agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or, with respect to payments made after December 31, 1987, by an organization that is described in section 501(c)(3) and that makes such payments in furtherance of a charitable purpose to lessen the burdens of government within the meaning of § 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(2).

(n) Payments to individuals as scholarships or fellowship grants within the meaning of section 117(b)(1), whether or not “qualified scholarships” as described in section 117(b). This exception does not apply to any amount of a scholarship or fellowship grant that represents payment for services within the meaning of section 117(c). Instead, these amounts are required to be reported as wages on Form W-2. See § 1.1461-1(c) for applicable reporting requirements for amounts paid to foreign persons.

However, no reporting is required where payment is made to a hospital or extended care facility described in section 501(c)(3) which is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) or to a hospital or extended care facility owned and operated by the United States, a State, the District of Columbia, a possession of the United States, or a political subdivision, agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing. For reporting requirements as to payments by cooperatives, and to certain other payments, see sections 6042, 6044, and 6049 and the regulations thereunder in this part.
(2) An organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a), as described

§ 1.6041-4
Foreign-related items and other exceptions.
(a)
Exempted foreign-related items.
(1) Returns of information are not required for payments that a payor can, prior to payment, reliably associate with documentation upon which it may rely to treat as made to a foreign beneficial owner in accordance with § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii) or as made to a foreign payee in accordance with § 1.6049-5(d)(1) or presumed to be made to a foreign payee under § 1.6049-5(d)(2), (3), (4), or (5). Returns of information are also not required for a payment that a payor or middleman can, prior to payment, reliably associate with documentation upon which it may rely to treat as made to a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity in accordance with § 1.1441-1(b) if it obtains from the intermediary or flow-through entity a withholding statement described in § 1.6049-5(b)(14) that allocates the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(5)) or specific payees to which withholding applies under chapter 4. Payments excepted from reporting under this paragraph (a)(1) may be reportable, for purposes of chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), under § 1.1461-1(b) and (c) and, for purposes of chapter 4 of the Code, under § 1.1474-1(d)(2). The provisions in § 1.6049-5(c) regarding documentation of foreign status shall apply for purposes of this paragraph (a)(1). The provisions in § 1.6049-5(c)(5) regarding the definitions of U.S. payor and non-U.S. payor shall also apply for purposes of this paragraph (a)(1). See § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(B) and (C) for special payee rules regarding scholarships, grants, pensions, annuities, etc. The provisions of § 1.1441-1 shall apply by substituting the term “payor” for the term “withholding agent” and without regard to the fact that the provisions apply only to amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code and the regulations under that chapter.
(2) Returns of information are not required for payments of amounts from sources outside the United States (determined under the provisions of part I, subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code and the regulations under those provisions) paid by a non-U.S. payor or non-U.S. middleman and that are paid and received outside the United States. For a definition of non-U.S. payor and non-U.S. middleman, see § 1.6049-5(c)(5). For circumstances in which an amount is considered to be paid and received outside the United States, see § 1.6049-4(f)(16).
(3) If a foreign intermediary, as described in § 1.1441-1(c)(13), or a U.S. branch that is not treated as a U.S. person receives a payment from a payor, which payment the payor can reliably associate with a valid withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii) or (iii), or § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(v), respectively, furnished by such intermediary or branch, then the intermediary or branch is not required to report such payment when it, in turn, pays the amount, unless, and to the extent, the intermediary or branch knows that the payment is required to be reported under this section and was not so reported. For example, if a U.S. branch described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) fails to provide information regarding U.S. persons that are not exempt from
reporting under § 1.6041-3(q) to the person from whom the U.S. branch receives the payment, the U.S. branch must report the payment on an information return. See, however, paragraph (a)(7) of this section for when reporting under section 6041is coordinated with reporting under chapter 4 of the Code or an applicable IGA (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(7)). The exception described in this paragraph (a)(3) for amounts paid by a foreign intermediary shall not apply to a qualified intermediary that assumes reporting responsibility under chapter 61 of the Code with respect to amounts reportable under the agreement described in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(iii).
(4) Returns of information are not required for amounts paid with respect to notional principal contracts referred to in § 1.863-7 or 1.988-2(e) which the payor may treat as effectively connected income of a foreign payee under the provisions of § 1.1441-4(a)(3) or if the payee provides a representation in a master agreement that governs the transactions in notional principal contracts between the parties (for example, an International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Agreement, including the Schedule thereto) or in the confirmation on the particular notional principal contract transaction that the counterparty is a foreign person. See, however, § 1.1461-1(c)(2)(i) for applicable reporting requirements.
(5) Returns of information are not required for the period that the amounts paid represent assets blocked as described in § 1.1441-2(e)(3). The exemption in this paragraph (a)(5) shall terminate when payment is deemed to occur in accordance with the provisions of § 1.1441-2(e)(3).
(6) For rules concerning direct sellers, see § 1.6041A-1(d)(3)(i)(C).
(7) Returns of information are not required for payments with respect to which a return is not required by applying the rules of § 1.6049-4(c)(4) (by substituting the term “a payment subject to reporting under section 6041” for the term “an interest payment”).
(b)
Joint owners.
Amounts paid to joint owners for which a certificate or documentation is required as a condition for being exempt from reporting under paragraph (a) of this section are presumed made to U.S. payees who are not exempt recipients if, prior to payment, the payor or middleman cannot reliably associate the payment either with a Form W-9 furnished by one of the joint owners in the manner required in §§ 31.3406(d)-1 through 31.3406(d)-5, or with documentation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section furnished by each joint owner upon which the payor or middleman can rely to treat each joint owner as a foreign payee or foreign beneficial owner. However, in the case of a withholdable payment (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(15)) made to joint payees, if any joint payee does not appear to be an individual, the payment is presumed made to a foreign payee that is a nonparticipating FFI (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(82)). See § 1.1471-3(f)(7).
(c)
Conversion into United States dollars of amounts paid in foreign currency.
For rules concerning foreign currency conversion, see § 1.6049-4(d)(3)(i).
(d)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to payments made on or after January 6, 2017.

(b)
Returns on magnetic tape by departments of health care carriers.
(1) For calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 1971, a health care carrier, or an agent thereof, making payment of fees or other compensation to providers of medical and health care services, may make a separate return on magnetic tape for each separate department within a specific line of such carrier's business, so long as all of such returns taken together contain all of the information required by section 6041 with respect to each provider of medical and health care services to whom such health care carrier makes payments aggregating $600 or more during the calendar year. Examples of separate departments within a specific line of such carrier's business (such as health and accident insurance) include, but are not limited to, separate departments to process claims of individual and group policyholders; and separate departments established along geographic lines.
(2) For purposes of this paragraph, the term “health care carrier” means any person making health care payments: (i) In exchange for the payment of a premium, (ii) in accordance with an employee benefit program, or (iii) in connection with a government-sponsored health care program.

§ 1.6041-10
Return of information as to payments of winnings from bingo, keno, and slot machine play.
(a)
In general.
Every person engaged in a trade or business (as defined in § 1.6041-1(b)) and who, in the course of such trade or business, makes a payment of reportable gambling winnings (defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) must make an information return with respect to such payment. Unless the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section (regarding aggregate reporting) apply, a separate information return is required with respect to each payment of reportable gambling winnings.
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Reportable gambling winnings.
(i) For purposes of this section, the term reportable gambling winnings is defined as follows:
(A) For bingo, the term “reportable gambling winnings” means winnings of $1,200 or more from one bingo game, without reduction for the amount wagered. All winnings received from all wagers made during one bingo game are combined (for example, all winnings from all cards played during one bingo game are combined).
(B) For keno, the term “reportable gambling winnings” means winnings of $1,500 or more from one keno game reduced by the amount wagered on the same keno game. All winnings received from all wagers made during one keno game are combined (for example, all winnings from all “ways” on a multi-way keno ticket are combined).
(C) For slot machine play, the term “reportable gambling winnings” means winnings of $1,200 or more from one slot machine play, without reduction for the amount wagered.
(ii) Winnings and wagers from different types of games are not combined to determine if the reporting threshold is satisfied. Bingo, keno, and slot machine play are different types of games.
(iii) Winnings include the fair market value of a payment in any medium other than cash.
(iv) The amount wagered in the case of a free play is zero.
(2)
Information reporting period
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, the “information reporting period” begins when a patron places the first wager on a particular type of game at a gaming establishment, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section, and ends when the patron places his or her last wager on the same type of game at the same gaming establishment before the end of the “information reporting period.” An information reporting period is a 24-hour period. A payor may select a calendar day (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) or a gaming day (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section) as the information reporting period for purposes of the aggregate reporting method in paragraph (g) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), time is determined by the time zone of the location where the patron places the wager. A payor must use the same information reporting period (a calendar day or gaming day) to report all “reportable gambling winnings” paid during the calendar year. Once selected, a payor may not change its information reporting period during a calendar year. Any changes to a payor's information reporting period from one calendar year to another must be implemented on January 1.
(ii)
Calendar day.
A calendar day is determined with reference to a period beginning at 12 a.m. and ending no later than 11:59 p.m. of the same calendar day.
(iii)
Gaming day
—(A)
In general.
A gaming day is a 24-hour period other than a calendar day (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) selected by the payor, subject to the special rules for December 31 and January 1 in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section.
(B)
Special rule for December 31.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the gaming day that begins on December 31 of any calendar year ends at 11:59 p.m. on December 31, regardless of the time on December 31 on which that gaming day began.
(C)
Special rule for January 1.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the gaming day of January 1 begins at 12:00 a.m. on January 1, regardless of the time and calendar day on
which that gaming day ends, and may extend beyond 24 hours.
(iv)
Gaming establishment.
For purposes of this section, a gaming establishment is a business entity of a payor of reportable gambling winnings with respect to bingo, keno, or slot machine play, and includes all gaming establishments owned by such payor using the same employer identification number (EIN) issued to such payor in accordance with section 6109.
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

# Example 1.
Casino R uses the aggregate reporting method under paragraph (g) of this section to report certain reportable gambling winnings. For other regulatory purposes, Casino R uses a gaming day that begins at 3 a.m. and ends at 2:59 a.m. the following calendar day. Casino R chooses to use its gaming day as its information reporting period for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section during Year 1. Accordingly, the information reporting period for purposes of paragraph (g) of this section for each day during Year 1 begins at 3 a.m. and ends at 2:59 a.m. the following day. The information reporting period for December 31 of Year 1 begins at 3 a.m. on December 31 of Year 1 and ends at 11:59 p.m. on December 31 of Year 1. The information reporting period for January 1 of Year 2 begins at 12 a.m. on January 1 of Year 2 and ends at 2:59 a.m. on January 2 of Year 2.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as Example 1, except Casino R uses a calendar day as its information reporting period for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section during Year 1. Accordingly, the information reporting period for purpose of paragraph (g) of this section for each day during Year 1 begins at 12 a.m. and ends at 11:59 p.m. on the same day.

# Example 3.
Casino R uses the aggregate reporting method under paragraph (g) of this section to report certain reportable gambling winnings. For other regulatory purposes, Casino R uses a gaming day that begins at 9:00 p.m. and ends at 8:59 p.m. the following calendar day. Casino R chooses to use its gaming day as its information reporting period for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section during Year 1. Accordingly, the information reporting period for purposes of paragraph (g) of this section for each day during Year 1 begins at 9:00 p.m. and ends at 8:59 p.m. the following day. The information reporting period for December 31 of Year 1 begins at 9:00 p.m. on December 30 and ends at 8:59 p.m. on December 31. A second information reporting period for December 31 then begins at 9:00 p.m. on December 31 and ends at 11:59 p.m. on December 31. The information reporting period for January 1 of Year 2 begins at 12:00 a.m. on January 1 and ends at 8:59 p.m. on January 1 of Year 2.

# Example 4.
Casino R uses the aggregate reporting method under paragraph (g) of this section to report certain reportable gambling winnings. In Year 1, Casino R chooses to use a “gaming day” that begins at 3 a.m. and ends at 2:59 a.m. the following day as its information reporting period. During the course of Year 1, Casino R decides that it would like to change its information reporting period to instead begin at 5 a.m. and end at 4:59 a.m. the following day. Casino R must wait until January 1 of Year 2 to implement such a change. On January 1 of Year 2, Casino R's information reporting period will begin at 12 a.m. and end at 4:59 a.m. on January 2. On December 31 of Year 2, Casino R's information reporting period will begin at 5 a.m. and end at 11:59 p.m.

Slot machine.
The term “slot machine” means a device that, by application of the element of chance, may deliver, or entitle the person playing or operating the device to receive cash, premiums, merchandise, or tokens whether or not the device is operated by insertion of a coin, token, or similar object.
(c)
Prescribed form; time and place for filing the return.
The return described in paragraph (a) of this section is a Form W-2G, “Certain Gambling Winnings.” The Form W-2G must be filed with the appropriate Internal Revenue Service location designated in the instructions to the form on or before February 28 (March 31, if filed electronically) of the year following the calendar year in which the reportable gambling winnings were paid. See section 6011 and § 1.6011-2 for requirements to file electronically.
(d)
Information included on the return
—(1)
In general.
Each return required by paragraph (a) of this section must contain:
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the payor;
(ii) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the payee;
(iii) A general description of the two types of identification (as described in paragraph (e) of this section), one of which must have the payee's photograph on it (except in the case of tribal member identification cards in certain circumstances as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) that the
payor relied on to verify the payee's name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
(iv) The date and amount of payment;
(v) The type of wagering transaction (bingo, keno, or slot machine play);
(vi) In the case of a bingo or keno game, any number, color, or other designation assigned to the game for which the payment is made;
(vii) In the case of slot machine play, the identification number of the slot machine(s) (for example, location and asset number);
(viii) Any other information required by the forms, instructions, revenue procedures, or other applicable guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(2)
Special rule for tribal member identification cards.
A tribal member identification card need not contain the payee's photograph to meet the identification requirement described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section if:
(i) The payee is a member of a federally recognized Indian tribe;
(ii) The payee presents the payor with a tribal member identification card issued by a federally recognized Indian tribe stating that the payee is a member of such tribe; and
(iii) The payor is a gaming establishment (as described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section) owned or licensed (in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 2710) by the tribal government that issued the tribal member identification card referred to in (d)(2)(ii).
(3)
Special rule for optional aggregate reporting method.
In the case of aggregate reporting under paragraph (g) of this section, the amount of the payment in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section is the aggregate amount of payments of reportable gambling winnings from the same type of game (bingo, keno, or slot machine play) made to the same payee during the same information reporting period (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section). Unless otherwise provided in forms, instructions, or other guidance, in the case of aggregate reporting under paragraph (g) of this section, the information required by paragraphs (d)(1)(v) through (viii) of this section must be maintained by the payor as described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
(e)
Identification.
The following items are treated as identification for purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section—
(1) Government-issued identification (for example, a driver's license, passport, social security card, military identification card, tribal member identification card issued by a federally recognized Indian tribe, or voter registration card) in the name of the payee; and
(2) A Form W-9, “Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification,” signed by the payee, that includes the payee's name, address, taxpayer identification number, and other information required by the form. A Form W-9 is not acceptable for this purpose if the payee has modified the form (other than pursuant to instructions to the form) or if the payee has deleted the jurat or other similar provisions by which the payee certifies or affirms the correctness of the statements contained on the form.
(f)
Furnishing a statement to the payee.
Every payor required to make a return under paragraph (a) of this section must also make and furnish to each payee, with respect to each payment of reportable gambling winnings, a written statement that contains the information that is required to be included on the return under paragraph (d) of this section. The payor must furnish the statement to the payee on or before January 31st of the year following the calendar year in which payment of the reportable gambling winnings is made. The statement will be considered furnished to the payee if it is provided to the payee at the time of payment or if it is mailed to the payee on or before January 31st of the year following the calendar year in which payment was made.
(g)
Aggregate reporting of bingo, keno, and slot machine winnings
—(1)
In general.
In lieu of filing a separate information return for each payment of reportable gambling winnings as required by paragraph (a) of this section, a payor may use the aggregate reporting method (defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section) to report reportable gambling winnings from bingo, keno, or
slot machine play. A payor using the aggregate reporting method to file information returns under paragraph (a) of this section must also furnish statements to the payee under paragraph (f) of this section using the aggregate reporting method.
(2)
Aggregate reporting method defined.
(i) The aggregate reporting method is a method of reporting more than one payment of reportable gambling winnings from the same type of game (bingo, keno, or slot machine play) made to the same payee during the same information reporting period (as defined in this paragraph (b)(2) of this section) on one information return or statement.
(ii) A payor may use the aggregate reporting method for payments to some payees and not others, at its own discretion. In addition, with respect to a single payee, the payor may use the aggregate reporting method to report winnings from one type of game, but not for winnings from another type of game.
(iii) Failure to report some reportable gambling winnings from a particular type of game during one information reporting period to a particular payee under the aggregate reporting method (for whatever reason, including because the winnings are not permitted to be reported using the aggregate reporting method under paragraph (g)(4) of this section) will not disqualify the payor from using the aggregate reporting method to report other reportable gambling winnings from that type of game during that information reporting period to that payee. The payor may stop using the aggregate reporting method for a particular payee or for all payees before the end of the payor's information reporting period for any reason.
(3)
Recordkeeping under the aggregate reporting method.
A payor using the aggregate reporting method must maintain a record of every payment of reportable gambling winnings from the same type of game made to the same payee during the information reporting period that will be reported using the aggregate reporting method. Every individual that the payor has determined is responsible for an entry in the record must confirm the information in the entry by signing the record in a manner that will enable the signature to be associated with the relevant entry. Each payment of a reportable gambling winning made to the same payee and reported under the aggregate reporting method must have its own entry in the record, however, the information required by paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section is not required to be recorded more than one time per information reporting period. A payor that uses the aggregate reporting method must retain a copy of the record in its files. The record (which may be electronic provided the requirements set forth in forms, instructions, or guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin are met) must include the following information about each payment:
(i) The payee's signature confirming the information in the record;
(ii) The information required under paragraph (d) of this section;
(iii) The time of the win resulting in the reportable gambling winnings;
(iv) The total amount of reportable gambling winnings with respect to all payments to the payee during the information reporting period;
(v) The amount of reportable gambling winnings with respect to each particular payment;
(vi) The method of payment to the payee (for example, cash, check, voucher, credit, token, or chips); and
(vii) The name and unique identification number of the individual who the payor has determined is responsible for ensuring that the entry with respect to the reportable gambling winnings (including the general description of two types of identification used to verify the payee's name, address, and taxpayer identification number) is complete and accurate and who is authorized to perform that function by the applicable gaming regulatory control authority. Such individual may or may not be the same individual who prepared the entry.
(4)
When the aggregate reporting method may not be used.
A payor cannot use the aggregate reporting method if—
(i) The payment is to a foreign person, as described in section 1.6041-10(h);
(ii) The payor knows or has reason to know that the person making the
wager is not the person entitled to the winnings or is not the only person entitled to the winnings (regardless of whether the person making the wager furnishes a Form 5754, “Statement by Person(s) Receiving Gambling Winnings”); or
(iii) Backup withholding under section 3406(a) applies to the payment.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section. For each example, assume that for purposes of the aggregate reporting method in paragraph (g) of this section, Casino R's “information reporting period” for all calendar years is a gaming day that begins at 3 a.m. and ends at 2:59 a.m. the following day (except for January 1 and December 31) and that individuals C, D, and E are U.S. persons.

# Example 1.
On Day 1, between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., C places five wagers at casino R on five different slot machines. The first two wagers result in no win. The third wager results in a $1,500 win. The fourth wager results in a $2,500 win. The fifth wager results in an $800 win:
(i) Under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section, there are reportable gambling winnings from the slot machine play of $4,000 ($1,500 + $2,500). The $800 win is not a reportable gambling winning from slot machine play because it does not equal or exceed the $1,200 threshold.
(ii) Because all of the amounts were won on the same type of game (even though each of the winnings occurred on different machines) during the same information reporting period, R is permitted to use the aggregate reporting method under this paragraph (g). If R decides not to use the aggregate reporting method, a separate Form W-2G would have to be filed and furnished for the payment of reportable gambling winnings of $1,500 and for the payment of reportable gambling winnings of $2,500. However, if R decides to use the aggregate reporting method, R may report total reportable gambling winnings from slot machine play of $4,000 ($1,500 + $2,500) on one Form W-2G.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as
Example 1,
except that in addition to the winnings described in
Example 1,
at 5 a.m. on Day 2, C wins $3,250 from one slot machine play at casino R. Even though C played the same type of game (slot machine play) on Day 1 and Day 2, under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the win at 5 a.m. on Day 2 is a win during a separate information reporting period. Under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, the $3,250 of reportable gambling winnings on Day 2 cannot be aggregated with the reportable gambling winnings of $4,000 from Day 1 on a single Form W-2G. Accordingly, if R uses the aggregate reporting method, R must file two Forms W-2G with respect to C's reportable gambling winnings on Day 1 and Day 2. R must report $4,000 of reportable gambling winnings from slot machine play paid to C on Day 1 on the first Form W-2G, and $3,250 of reportable gambling winnings from slot machine play paid to C on Day 2 on the second Form W-2G.

# Example 3.
On December 31 of Year 1 at 4:00 p.m., C wins $10,000 from one slot machine play at casino R. At 12:30 a.m. on January 1 of Year 2, C wins $4,000 from one slot machine play at casino R. Under paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section, the win at 4 p.m. on December 31 of Year 1 and the win at 12:30 a.m. on January 1 of Year 2 are wins during different information reporting periods. Under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, the $4,000 of reportable gambling winnings on January 1 cannot be aggregated with the reportable gambling winnings of $10,000 from December 31 on a single Form W-2G. Accordingly, if R uses the aggregate reporting method, R must file two Forms W-2G with respect to C's reportable gambling winnings on Day 1 and Day 2. R must report $10,000 of reportable gambling winnings from slot machine play paid to C on December 31 on the first Form W-2G and $4,000 of reportable gambling winnings from slot machine play paid to C on January 1 on the second Form W-2G.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as example 3, except that C also wins $5,000 from one slot machine play at 3:30 p.m. on January 1 and $7,000 from one slot machine play at 1:30 a.m. on January 2. Under the special rule of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the “information reporting period” begins at 12:00 a.m. on January 1 and extends until the start of the next information reporting period, in this case 2:59 a.m. on January 2. Under paragraph (b)(1)(C) of this section, Casino R will pay C a total of $26,000 ($10,000 + $4,000 + $5,000 + $7,000) in reportable gambling winnings; however, $10,000 must be reported in Year 1, and $16,000 must be reported in Year 2. Because all of the amounts won in Year 2 were won on the same type of game and during the same information reporting period, R is permitted to use the aggregate reporting method under this paragraph (g). If R decides to use the aggregate reporting method, R may report $10,000 of reportable gambling winnings from slot machine play paid to C on December 31 on the first Form W-2G and $16,000 of total reportable gambling winnings from slot machine play paid to C on January 1 on the second Form W-2G.

# Example 5.
At 2 p.m. on Day 1, D won $2,000 (after reducing the amount of the win by the amount wagered) playing one keno game at
casino R. D provides R with his driver's license. The driver's license has D's photograph on it, as well as D's name and address. The driver's license does not include D's social security number. D cannot remember his social security number and has no other identification at the time with his social security number on it. D does not provide R with his social security number before R pays the winnings to D. Because D cannot remember his social security number, D cannot complete and sign a Form W-9. R deducts and withholds $560 (28 percent of $2,000) under the backup withholding provisions of section 3406(a) and pays the remaining $1,440 in winnings to D. D returns to casino R and at 6 p.m. on Day 1 wins $1,500 (after reducing the amount of the win by the amount wagered) in one keno game. D provides R with his driver's license as well as D's social security card. R generally uses the aggregate reporting method and in all cases where it is used, R complies with the requirements of this paragraph (g). At 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Day 1, D wins an additional $1,800 and $1,700 (after reducing the amount of the win by the amount wagered), respectively, from two different keno games. For each of these two wins, an employee of R obtains the information from D required by this paragraph (g):
(i) Under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section, each of D's wins from the four games of keno on Day 1 ($2,000, $1,500, $1,800, and $1,700) are reportable gambling winnings. Because D's first win on Day 1 was at 2 p.m. and D's last win on Day 1 was at 10 p.m., all of D's reportable gambling winnings from keno are won during the same information reporting period. Because R satisfies the requirements of paragraph (g)(2)(i), R may use the aggregate reporting method to report D's reportable gambling winnings from keno. However, pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section, the $2,000 payment made to D at 2 p.m. cannot be reported under the aggregate reporting method because that payment was subject to backup withholding. Accordingly, if R uses the aggregate reporting method under this paragraph (g), R will have to file two Forms W-2G with respect to D's reportable gambling winnings from keno on Day 1. On the first Form W-2G, R will report $2,000 of reportable gambling winnings and $560 of backup withholding with respect to the 2 p.m. win from keno, and, on the second Form W-2G, R will report $5,000 of reportable gambling winnings from keno (representing the three payments of $1,500, $1,800, and $1,700 that D won between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Day 1).

# Example 6.
In one information reporting period on Day 1, E won five reportable gambling winnings from five different bingo games at a casino R. R generally uses the aggregate reporting method and in all cases where it is used, R complies with the requirements of this paragraph (g). Although E signed the entry in the record R maintains for payment of the first four reportable gambling winnings, E refuses to sign the entry in the record for the fifth payment of reportable gambling winnings. R may use the aggregate reporting method for the first four payments of reportable gambling winnings to E. However, because the entry in the record for the fifth payment of reportable gambling winnings does not include E's signature, as required by paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, that payment may not be reported under the aggregate reporting method. Accordingly, if R uses the aggregate reporting method under paragraph (g) of this section, R must prepare two Forms W-2G as follows: On the first Form W-2G, R must report the first four payments of reportable gambling winnings from bingo made to E on Day 1. On the second Form W-2G, R must report the fifth payment of reportable gambling winnings from bingo made to E on Day 1.
(h)

Foreign transactions
—(i)
In general.
No return shall be required under section 6041A with respect to payments described in this paragraph (d)(3).
(A) Returns of information are not required for payments that a payor can, prior to payment, associate with documentation upon which it may rely to treat as made to a foreign beneficial owner in accordance with § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii) or as made to a foreign payee in accordance with § 1.6049-5(d)(1) or presumed to be made to a foreign payee under § 1.6049-5(d)(2), (3), (4), or (5). However, such payments may be reportable under § 1.1461-1(b) and (c). For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A), the provisions in § 1.6049-5(c) (regarding rules applicable to documentation of foreign status and definition of U.S. payor and non-U.S. payor) shall apply. The provisions of § 1.1441-1 shall apply by substituting the term
payor
for the term
withholding agent.
(B) Returns of information are not required for payments of remuneration for services from sources outside the United States (determined under the provisions of part I, subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations under those provisions) if payments are made outside the United States by a non-U.S. payor or non U.S. middleman. For a definition of non U.S. payor or non-U.S. middleman, see § 1.6049-5(c)(5). For circumstances in which a payment is considered to be made outside the United States, see § 1.6049-5(e).
(C) Returns of information are not required under sections 6041 or 6041A for amounts paid outside of the United States (within the meaning of § 1.6049-5(e)) as remuneration for services as a direct seller (within the meaning of section 3508) performed outside of the United States or for sales described in section 6041A(b) made outside of the United States of consumer products for resale outside of the United States.
(ii)
Payor.
The term
payor
has the same meaning as described in § 1.6049-4(a)(2).
(iii)
Joint owners.
Amounts paid to joint owners for which a certificate or documentation is required as a condition for being exempt from reporting under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section are presumed made to U.S. payees who are not exempt recipients if, prior to payment, the payor or middleman cannot reliably associate the payment either with a Form W-9 furnished by one of the joint owners in the manner required in §§ 31.3406(d)-1 through 31.3406(d)-5 of this chapter, or with documentation described in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A) of this section furnished by each joint owner upon which it can rely to treat each joint owner as a foreign payee or foreign beneficial owner.
(iv)
Conversion into United States dollars of amounts paid in foreign currency.
For rules concerning foreign currency conversion, see § 1.6049-4(d)(3)(i).

Effective date.
The provisions of this paragraph (d)(3) apply to payments made after December 31, 2000.

Information returns required under section 6050W for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2010.
(i) For payments made by payment card (as defined in § 1.6050W-1(b)(3)) or through a third party payment network (as defined in § 1.6050W-1(c)(3)) after December 31, 2010, that are required to be reported on an information return under section 6050W (relating to payment card and third party network transactions), the following rule applies. Transactions that otherwise would be reportable under both sections 6041A(a) and 6050W are reported under section 6050W and not section 6041A(a). For provisions relating to information reporting for payment card transactions and third party network transactions, see § 1.6050W-1. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, the de minimis threshold for third party network transactions in § 1.6050W-1(c)(4) is disregarded in determining whether the transaction is subject to reporting under section 6050W.
(ii)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraph (d)(4) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Service-recipient A, in the course of its business, pays remuneration of $600 to service provider B by credit card for services performed by B. B is one of a network of unrelated persons that has agreed to accept A's credit card as payment under an agreement that provides standards and mechanisms for settling the transactions between a merchant acquiring bank and the
persons who accept the cards. Merchant acquiring bank Y is responsible for making the payment to B. Under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, A is not required to file an information return under section 6041A(a) with respect to the transaction because Y, as the payment settlement entity for the payment card transaction, is required to file an information return under section 6050W.

# Example 2.
Service-recipient A, in the course of business, pays $600 of fixed or determinable income to B, a repairman, through a third party payment network. B is one of a substantial number of persons who have established accounts with Y, a third party settlement organization that provides standards and mechanisms for settling the transactions and guarantees payments to those persons for goods or services purchased through the network. Y is responsible for making the payment to B. Under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, A is not required to file an information return under section 6041A(a) with respect to the transaction because the transaction is a third party network transaction that is subject to reporting under section 6050W. Solely for purposes of determining whether the transaction is subject to reporting under section 6050W, the de minimis threshold for third party network transactions in § 1.6050W-1(c)(4) is disregarded.
(iii)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (d)(4) of this section applies to payments made by payment card or through a third party payment network after December 31, 2010.

§ 1.6042-1
Return of information as to dividends paid in calendar years before 1963.
(a)
Requirement of return
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, every domestic corporation, or foreign corporation engaged in business within the United States or having an office or place of business or a fiscal or paying agent in the United States, making payments during any calendar year before 1963 of $10 or more of dividends and distributions (other than distributions in liquidation) to any shareholder who is an individual (citizen or resident of the United States), a resident fiduciary, or a resident partnership any member of which is a citizen or resident shall file for the calendar year a return setting forth the amount of such payments for such calendar year. A separate return on Form 1099, showing the name and address of the payer and the shareholder, and the amount paid, shall be prepared with respect to each shareholder. These returns shall be accompanied by transmittal Form 1096.
(2)
Federal land bank associations and certain other corporations.
A corporation described in section 501(c) (12), (15), or (16), or section 521(b)(1), or a Federal land bank association or a production credit association, making a payment of a dividend, or a distribution, to any shareholder in any calendar year before 1963 shall file an information return with respect to such payments when they total $100 or more during the calendar year.
(3)
Savings and loan associations, etc.
A savings and loan association, a cooperative bank, a homestead association, a credit union, or a building and loan association is required to file an information return with respect to distributions made to a shareholder during any calendar year before 1963 only if the amount thereof paid to the shareholder during the calendar year, or such amount when aggregated with other
payments made to the shareholder during such year of interest, rents, royalties, annuities, pensions, and other gains, profits, and income, as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of § 1.6041-1, totals $600 or more. For this purpose, the term “distributions to a shareholder” includes periodical distributions of earnings on running installment shares of stock paid or credited by a building and loan association to its holders of that class of stock, and the sum received upon withdrawal from a building and loan association in excess of the amounts paid in on account of membership fees and stock subscriptions, consisting of accumulated profits.
(b)
Nontaxable or partly nontaxable distributions.
In the case of a distribution which is made from a depletion or depreciation reserve, or which for any other reason is deemed by the corporation to be nontaxable or partly nontaxable to its shareholders, the corporation shall fill in the information on both sides of Form 1096.
(c)
Information as to actual owner
—(1)
In general.
When the person receiving a payment with respect to which an information return is required under authority of the Code is not the actual owner of the income received, the name and address of the actual owner or payee shall be furnished upon demand of the person paying the income, and in default of a compliance with such demand the payee becomes liable for the penalties provided. See section 7203. Dividends on stock are prima facie the income of the record owner of the stock. If a record owner of stock who is not the actual owner thereof receives dividends on such stock in any calendar year before 1963, he shall file a Form 1087 disclosing the name and address of the actual owner or payee, the name of the issuing corporation, the number of shares of such stock, and the amount of dividends received with respect to such stock during the calendar year. (For the reporting by a nominee of dividends received by him on behalf of another person in any calendar year after 1962, see § 1.6042-2.) Unless such a disclosure is made the record owner will be held liable for any tax based upon such dividends. A separate Form 1087 shall be filed by the record owner for each of the stockholdings of each actual owner for whom he acts as nominee. However, where the record owner is a banking institution, trust company, or brokerage firm, it may, provided it maintains such records as will permit a prompt substantiation of each payment of dividends made to the actual owner, file one Form 1087 for each actual owner for whom it acts as nominee and report thereon the total amount of the dividends paid to such actual owner (without itemization as to the issuing company, class of stock, etc.).
(2)
Exceptions.
The filing of Form 1087 is not required if:
(i) The record owner is required to file a fiduciary return on Form 1041, or a withholding return on Form 1042, disclosing the name and address of the actual owner or payee;
(ii) The actual owner or payee is a nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation and the tax has been withheld at the source before receipt of the dividends by the record owner;
(iii) The record owner is a banking institution, a trust company, or a brokerage firm which prepares the individual income tax return of the actual owner, provided the verification on the return with respect to the preparation thereof is executed by such record owner;
(iv) The record owner is a nominee of a banking institution or trust company exercising trust powers, and such banking institution or trust company is required to file a fiduciary return on Form 1041 which reflects the name and address of the actual owner or payee;
(v) The actual owner is an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) and is exempt from the requirement of filing a return under section 6033 and paragraph (g) of § 1.6033-1; or
(vi) The record owner is a banking institution or trust company exercising trust powers, or a nominee thereof, and the actual owner is an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) for which such banking institution or trust company files an annual return.
See § 1.1441-1, relating to withholding of tax on nonresident alien individuals, and § 1.1442-1, relating to withholding
of tax on nonresident foreign corporations.
(d)
Time and place for filing.
Returns made under this section on Forms 1096 and 1099 and Form 1087 for any calendar year shall be filed on or before February 28 of the following year with any of the Internal Revenue Service Centers, the addresses of which are listed in the instructions for such forms.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12108, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6628, 27 FR 12795, Dec. 28, 1962]
§ 1.6042-2
Returns of information as to dividends paid.
(a)
Requirement of reporting
—(1)
In general.
An information return on Form 1099 shall be made under section 6042(a) by—
(i) Every person who makes a payment of dividends (as defined in § 1.6042-3) to any other person during a calendar year. The information return shall show the aggregate amount of the dividends, the name, address, and taxpayer identifying number of the person to whom paid, the amount of tax deducted and withheld under section 3406 from the dividends, if any, and such other information as required by the forms. An information return is generally not required if the amount of dividends paid to the other person during the calendar year aggregates less than $10 or if the payment is made to a person who is an exempt recipient described in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) unless the payor backup withholds under section 3406 on such payment (because, for example, the payee has failed to furnish a Form W-9), in which case the payor must make a return under this section, unless the payor refunds the amount withheld pursuant to § 31.6413(a)-3 of this chapter. Further, a return of information is not required under this section for—
(A) Payments with respect to which a return is not required by applying the rules of § 1.6049-4(c)(4) (by substituting the term “dividend” for the term “interest”); or
(B) Payments made by a paying agent on behalf of a corporation described in section 1297(a) with respect to a shareholder of the corporation if—
(
1
) The paying agent obtains from the corporation a written certification signed by a person authorized to sign on behalf of the corporation, that states that the corporation is described in section 1297(a) for each calendar year during which the paying agent relies on the provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section, and the paying agent has no reason to know the written certification is unreliable or incorrect;
(
2
) The paying agent identifies, prior to payment, the corporation as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(10) or (14), respectively), or reporting Model 1 FFI (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(13)), in accordance with the requirements of § 1.1471-3(d)(4) (substituting the terms “paying agent” and “corporation” for the terms “withholding agent” and “payee,” respectively) and validates that status annually;
(
3
) The paying agent obtains a written certification representing that the corporation shall report the payment as part of its reporting obligations under chapter 4 of the Code or an applicable IGA (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(7)) with respect to its U.S. accounts and provided the paying agent does not know that the corporation is not reporting the payment as required. The paying agent may rely on the written certification until there is a change in circumstances or the paying agent knows or has reason to know that the statement is unreliable or incorrect. A paying agent that knows that the corporation is not reporting the payment as required under chapter 4 of the Code or an applicable IGA (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(7)) must report all payments reportable under this section that it makes during the year in which it obtains such knowledge; and
(
4
) The paying agent is not also acting in its capacity as a custodian, nominee, or other agent of the payee with respect to the payments.
(ii) Every person, except to the extent that he acts as a nominee described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, who receives payments of dividends as a nominee on behalf of another person shall make a return of information under this section for the
calendar year of the payment . The information return shall show the aggregate amount of the dividends, the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person on whose behalf the dividends are received, the amount of tax deducted and withheld under section 3406 from the dividends, if any, and such other information as required by the forms. An information return is generally not required if the amount of the dividends received on behalf of the other person during the calendar year aggregates less than $10. However, a return of information is not required under this section if—
(A) The record owner is, pursuant to section 6012(a) (3) or (4) and § 1.6012-3, required to file a fiduciary return on Form 1041 that is filed for the estate or trust disclosing the name, address, and identifying number of both the record owner and actual owner and furnishes Form K-1 to each actual owner containing the information required to be shown on the form, including amounts withheld under section 3406;
(B) The record owner is a nominee of a banking institution or trust company exercising trust powers, and such banking institution or trust company is, pursuant to section 6012(a) (3) or (4) and § 1.6012-3, required to file a fiduciary return on Form 1041 that is filed for the estate or trust disclosing the name, address, and identifying number of both the record owner and the actual owner and furnishes Form K-1 to each actual owner containing the information required to be shown on the form, including amounts withheld under section 3406; or
(C) The record owner is a banking institution or trust company exercising trust powers, or a nominee thereof, and the actual owner is an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) for which such banking institution or trust company files an annual return but only if the name, address, and identifying number of the record owner are included on or with the annual return filed for the tax exempt organization).
(iii) Every person who is a nominee acting as a custodian of a unit investment trust described in section 851(f)(1) and paragraph (d) of § 1.851-7 who, during a calendar year after 1968, receives payments of dividends in such capacity, shall make an information return on Forms 1096 and 1099, for such calendar year showing the information required by such forms and instructions thereto and the name, address, and identifying number of the nominee identified as such. This subdivision shall not apply if the regulated investment company agrees with the nominee to satisfy the requirements of section 6042 and the regulations thereunder with respect to each holder of an interest in the unit investment trust whose shares are being held by the nominee as custodian and within the time limit for furnishing statements prescribed by § 1.6042-4, files with the Internal Revenue Service office where such company's return is to be filed for the taxable year, a statement that the holders of the unit investment trust with whom the agreement was made have been directly notified by the regulated investment company. Such statement shall include the name, sponsor, and custodian of each unit investment trust whose holders have been directly notified. The nominee's requirements under this subdivision shall be deemed met if the regulated investment company transmits a copy of such statement to the nominee within such period; provided, however, if the regulated investment company fails or is unable to satisfy the requirements of section 6042 with respect to the holders of interest in the unit investment trust, it shall so notify the Internal Revenue Service within 45 days following the close of its taxable year. The custodian shall, upon notice by the Internal Revenue Service that the regulated investment company has failed to comply with the agreement, satisfy the requirements of this subdivision within 30 days of such notice.
(2)
Definitions.
The term “person” when used in this section does not include the United States, a State, the District of Columbia, a foreign government, a political subdivision of a State or of a foreign government, or an international organization. Therefore, dividends paid by or to one of these entities need not be reported. For purposes of this section, a person who receives a dividend shall be considered to have received it as a nominee if he is not the
actual owner of such dividend and if he was required under § 1.6109-1 to furnish his identifying number to the payer of the dividend (or would have been so required if the total of such dividends for the year had been $10 or more), and such number was (or would have been) required to be included on an information return filed by the payer with respect to the dividend. However, a person shall not be considered to be a nominee as to any portion of a dividend which is actually owned by another person whose name is also shown on the information return filed by the payer or nominee with respect to such dividend. Thus, in the case of stock jointly owned by a husband and wife, the husband will not be considered as receiving any portion of a dividend on that stock as a nominee for his wife if his wife's name is included on the information return filed by the payer with respect to the dividend.
(3)
Determination of person to whom a dividend is paid or for whom it is received.
For purposes of applying the provisions of this section, the person whose identifying number is required to be included by the payer of a dividend on an information return with respect to such dividend shall be considered the person to whom the dividend is paid. In the case of a dividend received by a nominee on behalf of another person, the person whose identifying number is required to be included on an information return made by the nominee with respect to such dividend shall be considered the person on whose behalf such dividend is received by the nominee. Thus, in the case of a dividend made payable to a person other than the record owner of the stock with respect to which the dividend is paid, the record owner of the stock shall be considered the person to whom the dividend is paid for purposes of applying the reporting requirements in this section, since his identifying number is required to be included on the information return filed under this section by the payer of the dividend. Similarly, if a stockbroker receives a dividend on stock held in street name for the joint account of a husband and wife, the dividend is considered as received on behalf of the husband since his identifying number should be shown on the information return filed by the nominee under this section. Thus, if the wife has a separate account with the same stockbroker, any dividends received by the stockbroker for her separate account should not be aggregated with the dividends received for the joint account for purposes of information reporting. For regulations relating to the use of identifying numbers, see § 1.6109-1.
(4)
Inclusion of other payments.
The Form 1099 filed by any person with respect to payments of dividends to another person during a calendar year may, at the election of the maker, include other payments made by him to such other person during such year which are required to be reported on Form 1099. Similarly, the Form 1099 filed by a nominee with respect to payments of dividends received by him on behalf of any other person during a calendar year may include payments of interest received by him on behalf of such person during such year which are required to be reported on Form 1099.
(b)
When payment deemed made.
For purposes of a return of information, an amount is deemed to have been paid when it is credited or set apart to a person without any substantial limitation or restriction as to the time or manner of payment or condition upon which payment is to be made, and is made available to him so that it may be drawn at any time, and its receipt brought within his own control and disposition.
(c)
Time and place for filing.
The returns required under this section for any calendar year shall be filed after September 30 of such year, but not before the payer's final payment for the year, and on or before February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically) of the following year with any of the Internal Revenue Service Centers, the addresses of which are listed in the instructions for Form 1096. For extensions of time for filing returns under this section, see § 1.6081-1.
(d)
Cross-reference to penalty.
For provisions relating to the penalty provided for failure to file timely a correct information return required under section 6042(a), see § 301.6721-1 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations). See § 301.6724-1 of this
chapter for the waiver of a penalty if the failure is due to reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect.
(e)
Magnetic media requirement.
For rules relating to permission to submit the information required by Form 1087 or 1099 on magnetic tape or other media, see § 1.9101-1. For the requirement to submit the information required by Form 1099 on magnetic media for payments after December 31, 1983, see section 6011(e) and § 301.6011-2 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations).
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to payments made on or after January 6, 2017. (For payments made after June 30, 2014, and before January 6, 2017, see this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1, as revised April 1, 2016. For payments made after December 31, 2000, and before July 1, 2014, see this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1, as revised April 1, 2013.)

§ 1.6042-3
Dividends subject to reporting.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the term
dividend
for purposes of this section and §§ 1.6042-2 and 1.6042-4 means the amounts described in the following paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section—
(1) Any distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders which is a dividend as defined in section 316; and
(2) Any payment made by a stockbroker to any person as a substitute for a dividend. Such a payment includes any payment made in lieu of a dividend to a person whose stock has been borrowed. See § 1.6045-2(h) for coordination of the reporting requirements under sections 6042 and 6045(d) with respect to such payments; and
(3) A distribution from a regulated investment company (irrespective of the fact that any part of the distribution may not represent ordinary income (i.e., may, for example, represent a capital gain dividend as defined in section 852(b)(3)(C)).
(b)
Exceptions
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of §§ 1.6042-2 and 1.6042-4, the amounts described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section are not dividends.
(i) Amounts paid by an insurance company to a policyholder, other than a dividend upon its capital stock.
(ii) Payments (however denominated) by a mutual savings bank, savings and loan association, or similar organization, in respect of deposits, investment certificates, or withdrawable or repurchasable shares. See, however, section 6049 and the regulations under that section for provisions requiring reporting of these payments.
(iii) Distributions or payments that a payor can, prior to payment, reliably associate with documentation upon which it may rely to treat as made to a foreign beneficial owner in accordance with § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii) or as made to a foreign payee in accordance with § 1.6049-5(d)(1) or presumed to be made to a foreign payee under § 1.6049-5(d)(2), (3), (4), or (5). Returns of information are also not required for payments that a payor or middleman can, prior to payment, reliably associate with documentation upon which it may rely to treat as made to a foreign intermediary in accordance with § 1.1441-1(b) if it obtains from the intermediary entity a withholding statement (described in § 1.6049-5(b)(14)) that allocates the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(5)) or to specific payees to which withholding under chapter 4 applies. Payments excepted from reporting under this paragraph (b)(1)(iii) may be reportable, for purposes of chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), under § 1.1461-1(b) and (c) or, for chapter 4 purposes, under § 1.1474-1(d)(2). The provisions in § 1.6049-5(c) regarding documentation of foreign status shall apply for purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(iii). The provisions in § 1.6049-5(c) regarding the definitions of U.S. payor and non-U.S. payor shall also apply for purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(iii). The provisions of § 1.1441-1 shall apply by substituting the term
payor
for the
term
withholding agent
and without regard to the fact that the provisions apply only to amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code.
(iv) Distributions or payments from sources outside the United States (as determined under the provisions of part I, subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code and the regulations under those provisions) that are paid by a non-U.S. payor or non-U.S. middleman and that are paid and received outside the United States. For a definition of non-U.S. payor and non-U.S. middleman, see § 1.6049-5(c)(5). For circumstances in which an amount is considered to be paid and received outside the United States, see § 1.6049-4(f)(16).
(v) Distributions or payments for the period that the amounts represent assets blocked as described in § 1.1441-2(e)(3). The exemption in this paragraph (b)(1)(v) shall terminate when payment is deemed to occur in accordance with the rules of § 1.1441-2(e)(3).
(vi) If a foreign intermediary, as described in § 1.1441-1(c)(13), or a U.S. branch that is not treated as a U.S. person receives a payment from a payor, which payment the payor can reliably associate with a valid withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii) or (iii), or § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(v), respectively, furnished by such intermediary or branch, then the intermediary or branch is not required to report such payment when it, in turn, pays the amount, unless, and to the extent, the intermediary or branch knows that the payment is required to be reported under this section and was not so reported. For example, if a U.S. branch described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) fails to provide information regarding U.S. persons that are not exempt from reporting under § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) to the person from whom the U.S. branch receives the payment, the amount paid by the U.S. branch to such person is a dividend. See, however, § 1.6042-2(a)(1)(i)(A) for when reporting under section 6042 is coordinated with reporting under chapter 4 of the Code or an applicable IGA (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(7)). The exception of this paragraph (b)(1)(vi) for amounts paid by a foreign intermediary shall not apply to a qualified intermediary that assumes reporting responsibility under chapter 61 of the Code with respect to amounts reportable under the agreement described in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(iii).
(vii) With respect to amounts paid or credited after December 31, 1982, any amount paid or credited to any person described in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii), unless a tax is withheld under section 3406 and is not refunded by the payor in accordance with § 31.6413(a)-3 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations).
(2)
Payor.
The term
payor
has the same meaning as described in § 1.6049-4(a)(2).
(3)
Joint owners.
Amounts paid to joint owners for which a certificate or documentation is required as a condition for being exempt from reporting under this paragraph (b) are presumed made to U.S. payees who are not exempt recipients if, prior to payment, the payor or middleman cannot reliably associate the payment either with a Form W-9 furnished by one of the joint owners in the manner required in §§ 31.3406(d)-1 through 31.3406(d)-5 of this chapter, or with documentation described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section furnished by each joint owner upon which it can rely to treat each joint owner as a foreign payee or foreign beneficial owner. However in the case of a withholdable payment (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(15)) made to joint payees, if any such joint payee does not appear to be an individual, the payment is presumed made to a foreign payee that is a nonparticipating FFI (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(82)). See § 1.1471-3(f)(7). For purposes of applying this paragraph (b)(3), the grace period described in § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(ii) shall apply only if each payee qualifies for such grace period.
(4)
Conversion into United States dollars of amounts paid in foreign currency.
For rules concerning foreign currency conversion, see § 1.6049-4(d)(3)(i).
(c)
Special rule.
If a person makes a payment which may be a dividend, or if a nominee receives a payment which may be a dividend, but such person or nominee is unable to determine the portion of the payment which is a dividend (as defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section) at the time he files his return under § 1.6042-2, he shall, for
purposes of such section, treat the entire amount of such payment as a dividend.
(d)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies on or after January 6, 2017. (For payments made after June 30, 2014, and before January 6, 2017, see this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1, as revised April 1, 2016. For payments made after December 31, 2000, and before July 1, 2014, see this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1, as revised April 1, 2013).
[T.D. 6628, 27 FR 12797, Dec. 28, 1962, as amended by T.D. 6908, 31 FR 16774, Dec. 31, 1966; T.D. 7987, 49 FR 42719, Oct. 24, 1984; T.D. 8029, 50 FR 23680, June 5, 1985; T.D. 8734, 62 FR 53475, Oct. 14, 1997; T.D. 8804, 63 FR 72186, Dec. 31, 1998; 64 FR 73411, Dec. 30, 1999; T.D. 8881, 65 FR 32205, May 22, 2000; T.D. 9658, 79 FR 12794, Mar. 6, 2014; T.D. 9808, 82 FR 2107, Jan. 6, 2017]
§ 1.6042-4
Statements to recipients of dividend payments.
(a)
Requirement.
A person required to make an information return under section 6042(a)(1) and § 1.6042-2 must furnish a statement to each recipient whose identifying number is required to be shown on the related information return for dividend payments.
(b)
Form and content of the statement.
The statement required by paragraph (a) of this section must be either the official Form 1099 prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for the respective calendar year or an acceptable substitute statement that contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the official Form 1099 for the respective calendar year. For further guidance on how to prepare an acceptable substitute statement, see Rev. Proc. 2012-38, 2012-48 IRB 575, also published as Publication 1179, “General Rules and Specifications for Substitute Forms 1096, 1098, 1099, 5498, and Certain Other Information Returns,” or any successor guidance. An IRS truncated taxpayer identifying number (TTIN) may be used as the identifying number of the recipient. For provisions relating to the use of TTINs, see § 301.6109-4 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations).
(c)
Aggregation of payments.
A payor may aggregate on one Form 1099 all payments made to a recipient with respect to each separate account during a calendar year.
(d)
Manner of providing statements to recipients
—(1)
In general.
The Form 1099, or acceptable substitute statement, must be provided to the recipient either in person or by first-class mail to the recipient's last known address in a statement mailing.
(2)
Statement mailing requirement.
The mailing required under section 6042(c) of a Form 1099 to a payee-recipient must qualify as a statement mailing. A statement mailing must contain the required Form 1099 or acceptable substitute statement (written statement) and must comply with enclosure and envelope restrictions.
(i)
Enclosure restrictions.
To qualify as a statement mailing, the mailing cannot contain any enclosures except those listed in this paragraph (d)(2)(i). Moreover, no promotional or advertising material is permitted in the mailing of the written statement. Even a
de minimis
amount of promotional or advertising material violates the statement mailing requirement. However, a logo on the envelope containing the written statement and on nontax enclosures described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) (A) through (D) of this section does not violate the written statement requirement. The written statement required under section 6042(c) and paragraph (a) of this section may be perforated to a check or to a statement of the recipient-payee's specific account with the payor described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) (A) or (C) of this section. The enclosure to which the written statement is perforated must contain, in a bold and conspicuous type, the legend: “Important Tax Return Document Attached.” The enclosures permitted in a mailing are limited to—
(A) A check with respect to the account reported on the written statement;
(B) A letter explaining why a check with respect to such account is not enclosed with the written statement (for example, because a dividend has not been declared payable);
(C) A statement of the taxpayer-recipient's specific account with the payor if payments on such account are reflected on the written statement;
(D) A letter limited to an explanation of the tax consequences of the information set forth on the enclosed written statement;
(E) Payee statements related to other Forms 1099, Form 1098, and Form 5498 (or the account balance on a Form 5498), Forms W-2 and W-2G; and
(F) Any document concerning the solicitation of the Form W-9, as described in § 31.3406(h)-3(a) of this chapter, or of the Form W-8 as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(1).
(ii)
Envelope and delivery restrictions
—(A)
Envelope restrictions.
The outside of the envelope in which the written statement is mailed and each nontax enclosure enclosed in the envelope must contain, in a bold and conspicuous type, the legend: “Important Tax Return Document Enclosed.” For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), a nontax enclosure is any item listed in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section. However, a payor is not required to include the legend on the outside of an envelope containing only the enclosures in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(D) through (F) of this section.

After the transaction, Y owns all the outstanding X stock. Assume that, under section 367(a) and the regulations, the X shareholders must recognize gain (if any) on the exchange of their stock. Because the transaction results in an acquisition of control of X, X must comply with the rules in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. X must file Form 8806 reporting the transaction. X must also file a Form 1099-CAP with respect to each shareholder who is not an exempt recipient showing the fair market value of the Y stock received by that shareholder, and X must furnish a copy of the Form 1099-CAP to that shareholder. If X elects on the Form 8806 to permit the IRS to publish information regarding the transaction, X is not required to file or furnish Forms 1099-CAP with respect to shareholders that are clearing organizations.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
, except X hires a transfer agent to effectuate the exchange. The transfer agent is treated as a broker under section 6045 and is required to report the fair market value of the Y stock received by X's shareholders under § 1.6045-3. Under paragraph (b)(6) of this section, X is not required to file information returns under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a shareholder of record, unless X knows or has reason to know that the transfer agent does not satisfy its information reporting obligation under § 1.6045-3 with respect to that shareholder. Thus, if the transfer agent satisfies its information reporting requirements under § 1.6045-3 with respect to shareholder I, an individual who receives X stock, X is not required to file a Form 1099-CAP with respect to I. Conversely, if the transfer agent does not have an information reporting obligation under § 1.6045-3 with respect to one of X's shareholders of record (for example, a clearing organization that is an exempt recipient under § 1.6045-3(b)(2)), or if X knows or has reason to know that the transfer agent has not satisfied its information reporting requirement with respect to a shareholder, then X must provide a Form 1099-CAP to that shareholder.

§ 1.6044-1
Returns of information as to patronage dividends with respect to patronage occurring in taxable years beginning before 1963.
(a)
Requirement
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, any corporation allocating to any patron in respect of patronage occurring in any taxable year of the corporation beginning before January 1, 1963, amounts aggregating $100 or more during a calendar year as patronage dividends, rebates, or refunds (whether in cash, merchandise, capital stock, revolving fund certificates, retain certificates, letters of advice, or in some other manner that discloses to each patron the amount of such dividend, rebate, or refund) shall for each such calendar year file a return of information with respect to such allocation on Forms 1096 and 1099. A separate Form 1099 shall be prepared for each patron showing the name and address of the patron to whom such allocation is made, and the amount of the allocation. The allocation shall be reported for the calendar year during which the allocation is made, regardless of whether the allocation is deemed for the purpose of section 522 to be made at the close of a preceding taxable year of the corporation.
(2)
Exception.
A return is not required under this section in the case of any corporation (including any cooperative or nonprofit corporation engaged in rural electrification) described in section 501(c) (12) or (15) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a), or in the case of any corporation subject to a tax imposed by subchapter L, chapter 1, of the Code.
(b)
Time and place for filing.
Returns made under this section on Forms 1096 and 1099 for any calendar year shall be filed on or before February 28 of the following year with any of the Internal Revenue Service Centers, the addresses of which are listed in the instructions for such forms.
(c)
Definitions.
The terms “cooperative association”, “patron”, “patronage dividends, rebates, and refunds”, and “allocation” are defined, for the purpose of this section, in paragraph (b) of § 1.522-1.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12108, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6628, 27 FR 12798, Dec. 28, 1962]
§ 1.6044-2
Returns of information as to payments of patronage dividends.
(a)
Requirement of reporting
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in § 1.6044-4, every organization described in paragraph (b) of this section which makes payments with respect to patronage occurring on or after the first day of the first taxable year of the organization beginning after December 31, 1962, of amounts described in § 1.6044-3 aggregating $10 or more to any person during any calendar year shall make an information return on Forms 1096 and 1099 for the calendar year showing the aggregate amount of such payments, the name and address of the person to whom paid, the total of such payments for all persons, and such other information as is required by the forms. The organization is required to make an information return regardless of the amount of the payment if the tax imposed by section 3406 is required to be withheld. Thus, in the case of any amount subject to backup withholding under section 3406 and not refunded by the payor before the due date of the information return in accordance with the regulations under section 3406, an information return shall be made even if the payment is not generally reportable because it is made to an exempt recipient described in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) or the amount paid during the calendar year to the recipient aggregates less than $10.
(2)
Definitions.
The term “person” when used in this section does not include the United States, a State, the District of Columbia, a foreign government, a political subdivision of a State or of a foreign government, or an international organization. Therefore, payment of amounts described in § 1.6044-3 to one of these entities need not be reported.
(3)
Determination of person to whom a patronage dividend is paid.
For purposes of applying the provisions of this section, the person whose identifying number is required to be included by the cooperative on an information return with respect to a patronage dividend shall be considered the person to whom such dividend is paid. For regulations relating to the use of identifying numbers, see § 1.6109-1.
(4)
Inclusion of other payments.
The Form 1099 filed by an organization with respect to payments of patronage dividends made to any person during a calendar year may, at the election of the organization, include other payments made by it to such person during such year which are required to be reported on Form 1099.
(b)
Organizations subject to reporting requirement.
The organizations subject to the reporting requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are:
(1) Any organization exempt from tax under section 521 (relating to exemption of farmers' cooperatives from tax), and
(2) Any corporation operating on a cooperative basis other than an organization:
(i) Which is exempt from tax under chapter 1 (other than section 521), or
(ii) Which is subject to the provisions of part II of subchapter H of chapter 1 (relating to mutual savings banks, etc.), or subchapter L of chapter 1 (relating to insurance companies), or
(iii) Which is engaged in furnishing electric energy, or providing telephone service, to persons in rural areas.
(c)
When payment deemed made.
For purposes of this section, money or other property (except written notices of allocation) is deemed to have been paid when it is credited or set apart to a person without any substantial limitation or restriction as to the time or manner of payment or condition upon which payment is to be made, and is made available to him so that it may be drawn at any time, and its receipt brought within his own control and disposition. A written notice of allocation is considered to have been paid when it is issued by the organization to the distributee. Similarly, a qualified check (as defined in section 1388(d)(4)) is considered to have been paid when it is issued to the distributee.
(d)
Time and place for filing.
The return required under this section on Forms 1096 and 1099 for any calendar year shall be filed after September 30 of such year, but not before the payer's final payment for the year, and on or before February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically) of the following year, with any of the Internal Revenue Service Centers, the addresses of which are listed in the instructions for such forms. For extensions of time for filing returns under this section, see § 1.6081-1.
(e)
Cross-reference to penalty.
For provisions relating to the penalty provided for failure to file timely a correct information return required under section 6044(a), see § 301.6721-1 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations). See § 301.6724-1 of this chapter for the waiver of a penalty if the failure is due to reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect.
(f)
Magnetic media requirement.
For the requirement to submit the information required by Form 1099 on magnetic media for payments after December 31, 1983, see section 6011(e) and § 301.6011-2 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations). For rules relating to permission to submit the information required by Form 1099 on magnetic tape or other media, see § 1.9101-1.

§ 1.6044-3
Amounts subject to reporting.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the amounts subject to reporting under § 1.6044-2 are:
(1) Payments by all organizations subject to such reporting requirements of:
(i) Patronage dividends (as defined in section 1388(a)) paid in money, qualified written notices of allocation (as defined in section 1388(c)), or other property (except nonqualified written
notices of allocation as defined in section 1388(d)); and
(ii) Amounts described in section 1382(b)(2) (relating to redemption of nonqualified written notices of allocation previously paid as patronage dividends) paid in money or property (except written notices of allocation); and
(2) Payments by farmers' cooperatives exempt from tax under section 521 of:
(i) Amounts described in section 1382(c)(2)(A) (relating to distributions with respect to earnings derived from sources other than patronage) paid in money, qualified written notices of allocation, or other property (except nonqualified written notices of allocation); and
(ii) Amounts described in section 1382(c)(2)(B) (relating to redemption of nonqualified written notices of allocation previously paid as distributions with respect to earnings derived from sources other than patronage) paid in money or other property (except written notices of allocation).
(b)
Special rules.
(1) If an organization makes a distribution consisting in whole or in part of a written notice of allocation and a qualified check and, at the time it files its return under § 1.6044-2, is unable to determine whether such written notice of allocation and such check constitute nonqualified written notices of allocation, such organization shall for purposes of such return treat such written notice of allocation as a qualified written notice of allocation and such qualified check as a payment in money.
(2) An amount described in paragraph (a) of this section is subject to reporting even though the organization paying such amount is allowed no deduction for it because it was not paid within the time prescribed in section 1382. Thus, a patronage dividend of $25 paid by a marketing cooperative must be reported even though it is paid after the end of the payment period (see section 1382(d)) for the organization's taxable year in which the patronage occurred.
(c)
Exceptions.
An amount described in paragraph (a) of this section does not include—
(1) Any amount described in § 1.6042-3(b); or
(2) With respect to amounts paid or credited after December 31, 1982, any amount paid or credited to any person described in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii).
(d)
Determination of amount paid.
For purposes of § 1.6044-2 and this section, in determining the amount of any payment subject to reporting under paragraph (a) of this section:
(1) Property (other than a qualified written notice of allocation) shall be taken into account at its fair market value, and
(2) A qualified written notice of allocation shall be taken into account at its stated dollar amount.
[T.D. 6628, 27 FR 12798, Dec. 28, 1962, as amended by T.D. 8734, 62 FR 53476, Oct. 14, 1997]
§ 1.6044-4
Exemption for certain consumer cooperatives.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Determination of exemption.
Exemption from the reporting requirements of § 1.6044-2 shall, upon application therefor, be granted by the district director to any cooperative which he determines is primarily engaged in selling at retail goods or services of a type which is generally for personal, living, or family use. A cooperative is not exempt from the reporting requirements merely because it is an organization of a type to which section 6044(c) and this section relate. In order for the exemption from reporting to apply, it is necessary that the cooperative file an application in accordance with this section and obtain a determination of exemption.
(2)
Basis for exemption.
For a cooperative to qualify for the exemption from reporting provided by section 6044(c) and this section 85 percent of its gross receipts for the preceding taxable year, or 85 percent of its aggregate gross receipts for the preceding three taxable years, must have been derived from the sale at retail of goods or services of a type which is generally for personal, living, or family use. In determining whether an item is of a type that is generally for personal, living, or family use, an item which may be purchased either for such use or for business use and which when acquired for business purposes is generally purchased at wholesale will, when sold by a cooperative at retail, be treated as goods or
services of a type generally for personal, living, or family use.
(3)
Period of exemption.
A determination of exemption from reporting shall apply beginning with the payments made during the calendar year in which the determination is made and shall automatically cease to be effective beginning with payments made after the close of the first taxable year of the cooperative in which less than 70 percent of its gross receipts is derived from the sale at retail of goods or services of a type which is generally for personal, living, or family use.
(b)
Application for exemption.
Application for exemption from the reporting requirements of section 6044 shall be made on Form 3491, and shall be filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in which the cooperative has its principal place of business.
[T.D. 6628, 27 FR 12799, Dec. 28, 1962]
§ 1.6044-5
Statements to recipients of patronage dividends.
(a)
Requirement.
A person required to make an information return under section 6044(a)(1) and § 1.6044-2 must furnish a statement to each recipient whose identifying number is required to be shown on the related information return for patronage dividends paid.
(b)
Form, manner, and time for providing statements to recipients.
The statement required by paragraph (a) of this section must be either the official Form 1099 prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service for the respective calendar year or an acceptable substitute statement. The rules under § 1.6042-4 (relating to statements with respect to dividends) apply comparably in determining the form of an acceptable substitute statement permitted by this section. Those rules also apply for purposes of determining the manner of and time for providing the Form 1099 or its acceptable substitute to a recipient under this section. However, each Form 1099 or acceptable substitute statement required by this section must be furnished on or before January 31 of the following year, but no statement may be furnished before the final payment has been made for the calendar year. For a statement required to be furnished after December 31, 2008, the February 15 due date under section 6045 applies to the statement if the statement is furnished in a consolidated reporting statement under section 6045.
See
§§ 1.6045-1(k)(3), 1.6045-2(d)(2), 1.6045-3(e)(2), 1.6045-4(m)(3), and 1.6045-5(a)(3)(ii). An IRS truncated taxpayer identifying number (TTIN) may be used as the identifying number of the recipient in lieu of the identifying number appearing on the corresponding information return filed with the Internal Revenue Service. For provisions relating to the use of TTINs, see § 301.6109-4 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations).
(c)
Cross-reference to penalty.
For provisions relating to the penalty provided for failure to furnish timely a correct payee statement required under section 6044(e), see § 301.6722-1 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations). See § 301.6724-1 of this chapter for the waiver of a penalty if the failure is due to reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect.
(d)
Effective/applicability date.
This section is effective for payee statements due after December 31, 1995, without regard to extensions. The amendments to paragraph (b) are effective for payee statements due after December 31, 2014. For payee statements due before January 1, 2015, § 1.6044-5(b) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2013) shall apply.

[T.D. 10000, 89 FR 56548, July 9, 2024, as amended by TD 10021, 89 FR 106958, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.6045-1
Returns of information of brokers and barter exchanges.
(a)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section and §§ 1.6045-2 and 1.6045-4.
(1)
Broker.
The term
broker
means any person (other than a person who is required to report a transaction under section 6043 of the Code), U.S. or foreign, that, in the ordinary course of a trade or business during the calendar year, stands ready to effect sales to be made by others. A broker includes an obligor that regularly issues and retires its own debt obligations, a corporation that regularly redeems its own stock, or a person that regularly offers to redeem digital assets that were created or issued by that person. A broker also includes a real estate reporting person under § 1.6045-4(e) who (without regard to any exceptions provided by § 1.6045-4(c) and (d)) would be required to make an information return with respect to a real estate transaction under § 1.6045-4(a). However, with respect to a sale (including a redemption or retirement) effected at an office outside the United States under paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section (relating to sales other than sales of digital assets), a broker includes only a person described as a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman in § 1.6049-5(c)(5). In the case of a sale of a digital asset, a broker includes only a U.S. digital asset broker as defined in paragraph (g)(4)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section. In addition, a broker does not include an international organization described in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(G) that redeems or retires an obligation of which it is the issuer.
(2)

(C) The participant in the sale responsible for paying to such person or crediting to such person's account the gross proceeds on the sale; or
(D) A digital asset middleman, as defined in paragraph (a)(21) of this section, that effects the sale of a digital asset for such person.
(ii)
Special rules for payment transactions involving digital assets.
In addition to the persons defined as customers in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the term
customer
includes:
(A) The person who transfers digital assets in a sale described in paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D) of this section to a processor of digital asset payments that has an agreement or other arrangement with such person for the provision of digital asset payment services that provides that the processor of digital asset payments may verify such person's identity or otherwise comply with anti-money laundering (AML) program requirements under 31 CFR part 1010, or any other AML program requirements, as are applicable to that processor of digital asset payments. For purposes of the previous sentence, an agreement or other arrangement includes any arrangement under which, as part of customary onboarding procedures, such person is treated as having agreed to general terms and conditions.
(B) The person who transfers digital assets or directs the transfer of digital assets—
(
1
) In exchange for property of a type the later sale of which, if effected by such broker, would constitute a sale of that property under paragraph (a)(9) of this section; or
(
2
) In exchange for the acquisition of services performed by such broker; and
(C) In the case of a real estate reporting person under § 1.6045-4(e) with respect to a real estate transaction as defined in § 1.6045-4(b)(1), the person who transfers digital assets or directs the transfer of digital assets to the transferor of real estate (or the seller's nominee or agent) to acquire such real estate.

(vii) An option described in paragraph (m)(2) of this section; or
(viii) A securities futures contract.
(4)
Barter exchange.
The term
barter exchange
means any person with members or clients that contract either with each other or with such person to trade or barter property or services either directly or through such person. The term does not include arrangements that provide solely for the informal exchange of similar services on a noncommercial basis.
(5)
Commodity.
The term
commodity
means:
(i) Any type of personal property or an interest therein (other than securities as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section), the trading of regulated futures contracts in which has been approved by or has been certified to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (
see
17 CFR 40.3 or 40.2);
(ii) Lead, palm oil, rapeseed, tea, tin, or an interest in any of the foregoing; or

(i) An executory contract that requires delivery of a commodity in exchange for cash and which contract is not a regulated futures contract;
(ii) An executory contract that requires delivery of personal property or an interest therein in exchange for cash, or a cash settlement contract, if such executory contract or cash settlement contract is of a type the Secretary determines is to be treated as a
forward contract
under this section, from and after the date specified in a notice of such determination published in the
Federal Register
; or
(iii) An executory contract that—
(A) Requires delivery of a digital asset in exchange for cash, stored-value cards, a different digital asset, or any other property or services described in paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section; and

(8)
Closing transaction.
The term
closing transaction
means a lapse, expiration, settlement, abandonment, or other termination of a position. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a position includes a right or an obligation under a forward contract, a regulated futures contract, a securities futures contract, or an option.
(9)
Sale
—(i)
In general.
The term
sale
means any disposition of securities, commodities, options, regulated futures contracts, securities futures contracts, or forward contracts, and includes redemptions of stock, retirements of debt instruments (including a partial retirement attributable to a principal payment received on or after January 1, 2014), and enterings into short sales, but only to the extent any of these actions are conducted for cash. In the case of an option, a regulated futures contract, a securities futures contract, or a forward contract, a sale includes any closing transaction. When a closing transaction for a contract described in section 1256(b)(1)(A) involves making or taking delivery, there are two sales, one resulting in profit or loss on the contract, and a separate sale on the delivery. When a closing transaction for a contract described in section 988(c)(5) of the Code involves making delivery, there are two sales, one resulting in profit or loss on the contract, and a separate sale on the delivery. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a broker may assume that any customer's functional currency is the U.S. dollar. When a closing transaction in a forward contract involves making or taking delivery, the broker may treat the delivery as a sale without separating the profit or loss on the contract from the profit or loss on the delivery, except that taking delivery for U.S. dollars is not a sale. The term
sale
does not include entering into a contract that requires delivery of personal property or an interest therein, the initial grant or purchase of an option, or the exercise of a purchased call option for physical delivery (except for a contract described in section 988(c)(5)). For purposes of this section only, a constructive sale under section 1259 of the Code and a mark to fair market value under section 475 or 1296 of the Code are not sales.
(ii)
Sales with respect to digital assets
—(A)
In general.
In addition to the specific rules provided in paragraphs (a)(9)(ii)(B) through (D) of this section, the term
sale
also includes:
(
1
) Any disposition of a digital asset in exchange for cash or stored-value cards;
(
2
) Any disposition of a digital asset in exchange for a different digital asset; and
(
3
) The delivery of a digital asset pursuant to the settlement of a forward contract, option, regulated futures contract, any similar instrument, or any other executory contract which would be treated as a sale of a digital asset under this paragraph (a)(9)(ii) if the contract had not been executory. In the case of a transaction involving a contract described in the previous sentence,
see
paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section for rules applicable to determining whether a sale has occurred and how to report the making or taking delivery of the underlying asset.
(B)
Dispositions of digital assets for certain property.
Solely in the case of a broker that is a real estate reporting person defined in § 1.6045-4(e) with respect to real property or is in the business of effecting sales of property for others, which sales when effected would constitute sales under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section, the term
sale
also includes any disposition of a digital asset in exchange for such property.
(C)
Dispositions of digital assets for certain services.
The term
sale
also includes any disposition of a digital asset in consideration for any services provided by a broker that is a real estate reporting person defined in § 1.6045-4(e) with respect to real property or a broker that is in the business of effecting sales of property described in paragraph (a)(9)(i), paragraphs (a)(9)(ii)(A) and (B), or paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D) of this section.
(D)
Special rule for certain sales effected by processors of digital asset payments.
In the case of a processor of digital asset payments as defined in paragraph (a)(22) of this section, the term
sale
also includes the payment by one party of a digital asset to a processor of digital asset payments in return for the payment of that digital asset, cash, or a different digital asset to a second party. If any sale of digital assets described in this paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D) would also be subject to reporting under one of the definitions of sale described in paragraphs (a)(9)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section as a sale effected by a broker other than as a processor of digital asset payments, the broker must treat the sale solely as a sale under such other paragraph and not as a sale under this paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D).
(10)
Effect
—(i)
In general.
The term
effect
means, with respect to a sale, to act as—
(A) An agent for a party in the sale wherein the nature of the agency is such that the agent ordinarily would know the gross proceeds from the sale;
(B) In the case of a broker described in the second sentence of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a person that is an obligor retiring its own debt obligations, a corporation redeeming its own stock, or an issuer of digital assets redeeming those digital assets;
(C) A principal that is a dealer in such sale; or
(D) A digital asset middleman as defined in paragraph (a)(21) of this section for a party in a sale of digital assets.
(ii)
Actions relating to certain options and forward contracts.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(10)(i) of this section, acting as an agent, principal, or digital asset middleman with respect to grants or purchases of options, exercises of call options, or enterings into contracts that require delivery of personal property or an interest therein is not of itself effecting a sale. A broker that has on its books a forward contract under which delivery is made effects such delivery.
(11)

foreign currency
means currency of a foreign country.
(12)

specified security
means:

(ii) Any debt instrument described in paragraph (a)(17) of this section, other than a debt instrument subject to section 1272(a)(6) of the Code (certain interests in or mortgages held by a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC), certain other debt instruments with payments subject to acceleration, and pools of debt instruments the yield on which may be affected by prepayments) or a short-term obligation described in section 1272(a)(2)(C);

(iii)
Corporate actions and other events.
For purposes of this paragraph (a)(15), a security acquired due to a stock dividend, stock split, reorganization, redemption, stock conversion, recapitalization, corporate division, or other similar action is considered acquired for cash in an account.

that time, the broker knows or should have known (including by reason of information that the broker is required to collect under section 1471 or 1472 of the Code) that the customer is not a foreign person.
(D) A security for which reporting under this section is required by § 1.6049-5(d)(3)(ii) (certain securities owned by a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity).

Solely for purposes of this section, a security classified as debt by the issuer is treated as debt. If the issuer has not classified the security, the security is not treated as debt unless the broker knows that the security is reasonably classified as debt under general Federal tax principles or that the instrument or position is treated as a debt instrument under a specific provision of the Code.
(18)
Securities futures contract.
For purposes of this section, the term
securities futures contract
means a contract described in section 1234B(c) of the Code whose underlying asset is described in paragraph (a)(14)(i) of this section and which is entered into on or after January 1, 2014.
(19)
Digital asset
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the term

(ii)
No inference.
Nothing in this paragraph (a)(19) or elsewhere in this section may be construed to mean that a digital asset is or is not properly classified as a security, commodity, option, securities futures contract, regulated futures contract, or forward contract for any other purpose of the Code.
(20)
Digital asset address.
For purposes of this section, the term
digital asset address

Effectuating service.
The term
effectuating service
means any service, with respect to a sale of digital assets, that is:
(A) A trading front-end service described in paragraph (a)(21)(iii)(A) of this section wherein the nature of the service arrangement is such that the person providing that service ordinarily would know or be in a position to know within the meaning of paragraph (a)(21)(ii) of this section the nature of the transaction potentially giving rise to gross proceeds from the sale of digital assets; or
(B) Any other service described in paragraph (a)(21)(iii)(B) of this section.
(ii)
Position to know.
A person providing trading front-end services ordinarily would know or be in a position to know the nature of the transaction potentially giving rise to gross proceeds from a sale of digital assets if that person maintains control or sufficient influence over the trading front-end services to have the ability to determine whether and the extent to which the transfer of digital assets involved in a transaction gives rise to gross proceeds. A person providing trading front-end services will be considered to maintain control or sufficient influence over such services as referred to in this paragraph (a)(21)(ii)
if that person has the ability to amend, update, or otherwise substantively affect the terms under which the services are provided or the manner in which the order described in paragraph (a)(21)(iii)(A) of this section is processed. Additionally, a person providing trading front-end services will be considered to maintain control or sufficient influence over such services as referred to in this paragraph (a)(21)(ii) if that person has the ability to collect the fees charged for those services from the transaction flow (including from the digital assets disposed of or the digital assets received by the customer in the sale), whether or not the person actually collects fees in this manner. A person providing trading front-end services also will be considered to maintain control or sufficient influence over such services as referred to in this paragraph (a)(21)(ii) if that person has the ability, in connection with processing the order described in paragraph (a)(21)(iii)(A) of this section, to add to the order a sequence of instructions to query the cryptographically secured distributed ledger to determine if the processed order is, in fact, executed or to use another method of confirmation based on information known to that person as a result of providing the trading front-end services. Except as provided by the Secretary, a contractual or other restriction not required by law that limits the ability of the person providing trading front-end services to amend, update, or otherwise substantively affect the terms under which the services are provided (including the manner in which any fees are collected) or the manner in which the order is processed will be disregarded for purposes of this paragraph (a)(21)(ii).
(iii)
Trading front-end service and other effectuating services
—(A)
Trading front-end service
—(
1
)
In general.
A
trading front-end service
means a service that, with respect to a sale of digital assets, receives a person's order to sell and processes that order for execution by providing user interface services, including graphic and voice user interface services, that are designed to:
(
i
) Enable such person to input order details with respect to a transaction to be carried out or settled on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger (or any similar technology); and
(
ii
) Transmit those order details so that the transaction can be carried out or settled on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger (or any similar technology), including by transmitting the order details to the person's wallet in such form that, if authorized by the person, causes the order details to be transmitted to a distributed ledger network for interaction with a digital asset trading protocol as defined in paragraph (a)(21)(iii)(D) of this section.
(
2
)
Location of digital assets received in an exchange and indirect transmissions of orders.
A service is a trading front-end service regardless of whether the digital assets received in the exchange are received in the wallet of the person providing the order details or in the wallet of another person pursuant to the first person's order details. The direct or indirect transmission to a distributed ledger network of order details that call upon or otherwise invoke the functions of automatically executing contracts that comprise a digital asset trading protocol is a transmission of order details to a distributed ledger network for interaction with a digital asset trading protocol.
(B)
Other effectuating services.
An
effectuating service
also means any of the services described in paragraphs (a)(21)(iii)(B)(
1
) through (
5
) of this section.
(
1
) The acceptance or processing of digital assets as payment for property of a type which when sold would constitute a sale under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section by a broker that is in the business of effecting sales of such property.
(
2
) Any service performed by a real estate reporting person as defined in § 1.6045-4(e) with respect to a real estate transaction in which digital assets are paid by the real estate buyer in full or partial consideration for the real estate, provided the real estate reporting person has actual knowledge or ordinarily would know that digital assets were used by the real estate buyer to make payment to the real estate seller. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(21)(iii)(B)(
2
), a real estate reporting person is considered to have actual knowledge that digital assets were
used by the real estate buyer to make payment if the terms of the real estate contract provide for payment using digital assets.
(
3
) The acceptance or processing of digital assets as payment for any service provided by a broker described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section determined without regard to any sales under paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(C) of this section that are effected by such broker.
(
4
) Any payment service performed by a processor of digital asset payments described in paragraph (a)(22) of this section, provided the processor of digital asset payments has actual knowledge or ordinarily would know the nature of the transaction and the gross proceeds therefrom.

Excluded activities
—(

)
Validation services.
Notwithstanding the definition of trading front-end services or other effectuating services in paragraphs (a)(21)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section, distributed ledger transaction validation services (whether through proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, or any other similar consensus mechanism), including those services necessary to complete the validation, are not effectuating services described in paragraph (a)(21)(i) of this section.
(

)
Licensing of software or selling of hardware.
If a person licenses software or sells hardware that provides unhosted wallet services that include both trading front-end services with respect to some sales of digital assets and other services that are not trading front-end services or other effectuating services under paragraph (a)(21)(iii)(B) of this section with respect to other sales of digital assets, that person is providing effectuating services only with respect to the sales of digital assets that are carried out using the trading front-end services provided by the unhosted wallet software licensed or hardware sold.
(D)
Digital asset trading protocol.
A
digital asset trading protocol
means a distributed ledger application consisting of computer software, including automatically executing contracts, that exchange one digital asset for another digital asset pursuant to instructions from a user.
(22)
Processor of digital asset payments.
For purposes of this section, the term
processor of digital asset payments
means a person who in the ordinary course of a trade or business stands ready to effect sales of digital assets as defined in paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D) of this section by regularly facilitating payments from one party to a second party by receiving digital assets from the first party and paying those digital assets, cash, or different digital assets to the second party.
(23)
Stored-value card.
For purposes of this section, the term
stored-value card
means a card, including any gift card, with a prepaid value in U.S. dollars, any convertible foreign currency, or any digital asset, without regard to whether the card is in physical or digital form.
(24)
Transaction identification.
For purposes of this section, the term
transaction identification,
or
transaction ID,
means the unique set of alphanumeric identification characters that a digital asset distributed ledger associates with a transaction involving the transfer of a digital asset from one digital asset address to another. The term transaction ID includes terms such as a
TxID
or
transaction hash.
(25)
Wallet, hosted wallet, unhosted wallet, and held in a wallet or account
—(i)
Wallet.
A
wallet
is a means of storing, electronically or otherwise, a user's private keys to digital assets held by or for the user.
(ii)
Hosted wallet.
A
hosted wallet
is a custodial service that electronically stores the private keys to digital assets held on behalf of others.
(iii)
Unhosted wallet.
An
unhosted wallet
is a non-custodial means of storing, electronically or otherwise, a user's private keys to digital assets held by or for the user. Unhosted wallets, sometimes referred to as self-hosted or self-custodial wallets, can be provided through software that is connected to the internet (a hot wallet) or through hardware or physical media that is disconnected from the internet (a cold wallet).
(iv)
Held in a wallet or account.
A digital asset is referred to in this section
as
held in a wallet or account
if the wallet, whether hosted or unhosted, or account stores the private keys necessary to transfer control of the digital asset. A digital asset associated with a digital asset address that is generated by a wallet, and a digital asset associated with a sub-ledger account of a wallet, are similarly referred to as held in a wallet. References to variations of held in a wallet or account, such as held at a broker, held with a broker, held by the user of a wallet, held on behalf of another, acquired in a wallet or account, or transferred into a wallet or account, each have a similar meaning.
(b)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the definitions in paragraph (a) of this section.
(1)
Example 1.
The following persons generally are brokers within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section—
(i) A mutual fund, an underwriter of the mutual fund, or an agent for the mutual fund, any of which stands ready to redeem or repurchase shares in such mutual fund.

(ix) [Reserved]
(x) A person who in the ordinary course of a trade or business stands ready at a physical location to effect sales of digital assets on behalf of others.
(xi) [Reserved]
(2)
Example 2.
The following persons are not brokers within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the absence of additional facts that indicate the person is a broker—
(i) A stock transfer agent for a corporation, which agent daily records transfers of stock in such corporation, if the nature of the activities of the agent is such that the agent ordinarily would not know the gross proceeds from sales.

(v) A floor broker on a commodities exchange, which broker maintains no records with respect to the terms of sales.
(vi) A corporation that issues and retires long-term debt on an irregular basis.

(3)
Example 3: Barter exchange.
A, B, and C belong to a carpool in which they commute to and from work. Every third day, each member of the carpool provides transportation for the other two members. Because the carpool arrangement provides solely for the informal exchange of similar services on a noncommercial basis, the carpool is not a barter exchange within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(4)
Example 4: Barter exchange.
X is an organization whose members include retail merchants, wholesale merchants, and persons in the trade or business of performing services. X's members exchange property and services among themselves using credits on the books of X as a medium of exchange. Each exchange through X is reflected on the books of X by crediting the account of the member providing property or services and debiting the account of the member receiving such property or services. X also provides information to its members concerning property and services available for exchange through X. X charges its members a commission on each transaction in which credits on its books are used as a medium of exchange. X is a barter exchange within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(5)
Example 5: Commodity, forward contract.
A warehouse receipt is an interest in personal property for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section. Consequently, a warehouse receipt for a quantity of lead is a commodity under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section. Similarly, an executory contract that requires delivery of a warehouse receipt for a quantity of lead is a forward contract under paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section.
(6)
Example 6: Customer.
The only customers of a depositary trust acting as an escrow agent in corporate acquisitions, which trust is a broker, are shareholders to whom the trust makes payments or shareholders for whom the trust is acting as an agent.
(7)
Example 7: Customer.
The only customers of a stock transfer agent, which agent is a broker, are shareholders to whom the agent makes payments or shareholders for whom the agent is acting as an agent.
(8)
Example 8: Customer.
D, an individual not otherwise exempt from reporting, is the holder of an obligation issued by P, a corporation. R, a broker, acting as an agent for P, retires such obligation held by D. Such obligor payments from R represent obligor payments by P. D, the person to whom the gross proceeds are paid or credited by R, is the customer of R.
(9)
Example 9: Covered security.
E, an individual not otherwise exempt from reporting, maintains an account with S, a broker. On June 1, 2012, E instructs S to purchase stock that is a specified security for cash. S places an order to purchase the stock with T, another broker. E does not maintain an account with T. T executes the purchase. Custody of the purchased stock is transferred to E's account at S. Under paragraph (a)(15)(ii) of this section, the stock is considered acquired for cash in E's account at S. Because the stock is acquired on or after January 1, 2012, under paragraph (a)(15)(i) of this section, it is a covered security.
(10)
Example 10: Covered security.
F, an individual not otherwise exempt from
reporting, is granted 100 shares of stock in F's employer by F's employer. Because F does not acquire the stock for cash or through a transfer to an account with a transfer statement (as described in § 1.6045A-1), under paragraph (a)(15) of this section, the stock is not a covered security.
(11)
Example 11: Covered security.
G, an individual not otherwise exempt from reporting, owns 400 shares of stock in Q, a corporation, in an account with U, a broker. Of the 400 shares, 100 are covered securities and 300 are noncovered securities. Q takes a corporate action to split its stock in a 2-for-1 split. After the stock split, G owns 800 shares of stock. Because the adjusted basis of 600 of the 800 shares that G owns is determined from the basis of noncovered securities, under paragraphs (a)(15)(iii) and (a)(15)(iv)(B) of this section, these 600 shares are not covered securities and the remaining 200 shares are covered securities.
(12)
Example 12: Processor of digital asset payments, sale, and customer
—(i)
Facts.
Company Z is an online merchant that accepts digital asset DE as a form of payment for the merchandise it sells. The merchandise Z sells does not include digital assets. Z does not provide any other service that could be considered as standing ready to effect sales of digital assets or any other property subject to reporting under section 6045. CPP is in the business of facilitating payments made by users of digital assets to merchants with which CPP has an account. CPP also has contractual arrangements with users of digital assets for the provision of digital asset payment services that provide that CPP may verify such user's identity pursuant to AML program requirements. Z contracts with CPP to help Z's customers to make payments to Z using digital assets. Under Z's agreement with CPP, when purchasers of merchandise initiate payment on Z's website using DE, they are directed to CPP's website to complete the payment part of the transaction. CPP is a third party settlement organization, as defined in § 1.6050W-1(c)(2), with respect to the payments it makes to Z. Customer R seeks to purchase merchandise from Z that is priced at $6,000 (which is 6,000 units of DE). After R initiates a purchase, R is directed to CPP's website where R is directed to enter into an agreement with CPP, which as part of CPP's customary onboarding procedures developed pursuant to AML program requirements, requires R to submit information to CPP to verify R's identity. Thereafter, R is instructed to transfer 6,000 units of DE to a digital asset address controlled by CPP. CPP then pays $6,000 in cash to Z, who in turn processes R's order.
(ii)
Analysis.
CPP is a processor of digital asset payments within the meaning of paragraph (a)(22) of this section because CPP, in the ordinary course of its business, regularly effects sales of digital assets as defined in paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D) of this section by receiving digital assets from one party and paying those digital assets, cash, or different digital assets to a second party. Based on CPP's contractual relationship with Z, CPP has actual knowledge that R's payment was a payment transaction and the amount of gross proceeds R received as a result. Accordingly, CPP's services are facilitative services under paragraph (a)(21)(iii)(B) of this section and CPP is acting as a digital asset middleman under paragraph (a)(21) of this section to effect R's sale of digital assets under paragraph (a)(10)(i)(D) of this section. R's payment of 6,000 units of DE to CPP in return for the payment of $6,000 cash to Z is a sale of digital assets under paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D) of this section. Additionally, because CPP has an arrangement with R for the provision of digital asset payment services that provides that CPP may verify R's identity pursuant to AML program requirements, R is CPP's customer under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. Finally, CPP is also required to report the payment to Z under § 1.6050W-1(a) because the payment is a third party network transaction under § 1.6050W-1(c). The answer would be the same if CPP paid Z the 6,000 units of DE or another digital asset instead of cash.
(13)
Example 13: Broker.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (b)(12)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 12
), except that Z accepts digital asset DE from its purchasers directly without the services of CPP or any other processor of digital asset payments. To pay
for the merchandise R purchases on Z's website, R is directed by Z to transfer 15 units of DE directly to Z's digital asset address. Z is not a broker under the definition of paragraph (a)(1) of this section because Z does not stand ready as part of its trade or business to effect sales as defined in paragraph (a)(9) of this section made by others. That is, the sales that Z is in the business of conducting are of property that is not subject to reporting under section 6045.
(14)
Example 14: Processor of digital asset payments
—(i)
Facts.
Customer S purchases goods that are not digital assets with 10 units of digital asset DE from Merchant M using a digital asset DE credit card issued by Bank BK. BK has a contractual arrangement with customers using BK's credit cards that provides that BK may verify such customer identification information pursuant to AML program requirements. In addition, as part of BK's customary onboarding procedures, BK requires credit card applicants to submit information to BK to verify their identity. M is one of a network of unrelated persons that has agreed to accept digital asset DE credit cards issued by BK as payment for purchase transactions under an agreement that provides standards and mechanisms for settling the transaction between a merchant acquiring bank and the persons who accept the cards. Bank MAB is the merchant acquiring entity with the contractual obligation to make payments to M for goods provided to S in this transaction. To make payment for S's purchase of goods from M, S transfers 10 units of digital asset DE to BK. BK pays the 10 units of DE, less its processing fee, to Bank MAB, which amount Bank MAB pays, less its processing fee, to M.
(ii)
Analysis.
BK is a processor of digital asset payments as defined in paragraph (a)(22) of this section because BK, in the ordinary course of its business, regularly effects sales of digital assets as defined in paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D) of this section by receiving digital assets from one party and paying those digital assets, cash, or different digital assets to a second party. Bank BK has actual knowledge that payment made by S is a payment transaction and also knows S's gross proceeds therefrom. Accordingly, BK's services are facilitative services under paragraph (a)(21)(iii)(B) of this section and BK is acting as a digital asset middleman under paragraph (a)(21) of this section to effect sales of digital assets under paragraph (a)(10)(i)(D) of this section. S's payment of 10 units of DE to BK for the payment of those units, less BK's processing fee, to Bank MAB is a sale by S of digital assets under paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D) of this section. Additionally, because S transferred digital assets to BK in a sale described in paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D) of this section and because BK has an arrangement with S for the provision of digital asset payment services that provides that BK may verify S's identity, S is BK's customer under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.

Example 15: Digital asset middleman and effect
—(i)
Facts.
SBK is in the business of effecting sales of stock and other securities on behalf of customers. To open an account with SBK, each customer must provide SBK with its name, address, and tax identification number. SBK accepts 20 units of digital asset DE from Customer P as payment for 10 shares of AB stock. Additionally, P pays SBK an additional 1 unit of digital asset DE as a commission for SBK's services.
(ii)
Analysis.
SBK's acceptance of 20 units of DE as payment for the AB stock is a facilitative service under paragraph (a)(21)(iii)(B) of this section because the payment is for property (the AB stock) that when sold would constitute a sale under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section by a broker that is in the business of effecting sales of stock and other securities. SBK's acceptance of 1 unit of DE as payment for SBK's commission is also a facilitative service under paragraph (a)(21)(iii)(B) of this section because SBK is a broker under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to a sale of stock under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section. Accordingly, SBK is acting as a digital asset middleman to effect P's sale of 10 units of DE in return for the AB stock and P's sale of 1 unit of DE as payment for SBK's commission under paragraphs (a)(10)(i)(D) and (a)(21) of this section.

Example 16: Digital asset middleman and effect
—(i)
Facts.
J, an unmarried individual not otherwise exempt from reporting, enters into a contractual agreement with B, an individual not otherwise exempt from reporting, to exchange J's principal residence, Blackacre, which has a fair market value of $225,000 for units of digital asset DE with a value of $225,000. Prior to closing, J provides closing agent CA, who is a real estate reporting person under § 1.6045-4(e), with the certifications required under § 1.6045-4(c)(2)(iv) (to exempt the transaction from reporting under § 1.6045-4(a) due to Blackacre being J's principal residence). Prior to closing, B transfers the digital assets directly from B's wallet to J's wallet, and J certifies to the closing agent (CA) that J received the digital assets required to be paid under the contract.
(ii)
Analysis.
CA is performing services as a real estate reporting person with respect to a real estate transaction in which the real estate buyer (B) pays digital assets in full or partial consideration for the real estate. In addition, CA has actual knowledge that payment made to B included digital assets because the terms of the real estate contract provide for such payment. Accordingly, the closing services provided by CA are facilitative services under paragraph (a)(21)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section, and CA is acting as a digital asset middleman under paragraph (a)(21) of this section to effect B's sale of 1,000 DE units under paragraph (a)(10)(i)(D) of this section. These conclusions are not impacted by whether or not CA is required to report the sale of the real estate by J under § 1.6045-4(a).
(17)
Example 17: Digital asset and cash
—(i)
Facts.
Y is a privately held corporation that issues DL, a digital representation of value designed to track the value of the U.S. dollar. DL is backed in part or in full by U.S. dollars held by Y, and Y offers to redeem units of DL for U.S. dollars at par at any time. Transactions involving DL utilize cryptography to secure transactions that are digitally recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger called the DL blockchain. CRX is a digital asset broker that also provides hosted wallet services for its customers seeking to make trades of digital assets using CRX. R is a customer of CRX. R exchanges 100 units of DL for $100 in cash from CRX. CRX does not record this transaction on the DL blockchain, but instead records the transaction on CRX's own centralized private ledger.
(ii)
Analysis.
DL is not cash under paragraph (a)(12) of this section because it is not issued by a government or central bank. DL is a digital asset under paragraph (a)(19) of this section because it is a digital representation of value that is recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger. The fact that CRX recorded R's transaction on its own private ledger and not on the DL blockchain does not change this conclusion.
(18)
Example 18: Broker and effect
—(i)
Facts.
Individual J is an artist in the business of creating and selling nonfungible tokens that reference J's digital artwork. To find buyers and to execute these transactions, J uses the services of P2X, an unrelated digital asset marketplace that provides a service for nonfungible token sellers to find buyers and automatically executing contracts in return for a transaction fee. J does not perform any other services with respect to these transactions. Using P2X's platform, buyer K purchases J's newly created nonfungible token (DA-J) for 1,000 units of digital asset DE. Using the interface provided by P2X, J and K execute their exchange using an automatically executing contract, which automatically transfers DA-J to K and K's payment of DE units to J.
(ii)
Analysis.
Although J is a principal in the exchange of DA-J for 1,000 units of DE, J is not acting as an obligor retiring its own debt obligations, a corporation redeeming its own stock, or an issuer of digital assets that is redeeming those digital assets, as described in paragraph (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section. Because J created DA-J as part of J's business of creating and selling specified nonfungible tokens, J is also not acting in these transactions as a dealer as described in paragraph (a)(10)(i)(C) of this section, as an agent for another party as described in paragraph (a)(10)(i)(A) of this section, or as
a digital asset middleman described in paragraph (a)(10)(i)(D) of this section. Accordingly, J is not a broker under paragraph (a)(1) of this section because J does not effect sales of digital assets on behalf of others under the definition of effect under paragraph (a)(10)(i) of this section.
(19)
Example 19: Broker, sale, and effect
—(i)
Facts.
HWP is a person that regularly provides hosted wallet services for customers. HWP does not operate a digital asset trading platform, but at the direction of its customers regularly executes customer exchange orders using the services of digital asset trading platforms. Individual L maintains digital assets with HWP. L places an order with HWP to exchange 10 units of digital asset DE held by L with HWP for 100 units of digital asset RN. To execute the order, HWP places the order with PRX, a person, as defined in section 7701(a)(1) of the Code, that operates a digital asset trading platform. HWP debits L's account for the disposed DE units and credits L's account for the RN units received in exchange.
(ii)
Analysis.
The exchange of L's DE units for RN units is a sale under paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section. HWP acts as an agent for L in this sale, and the nature of this agency is such that HWP ordinarily would know the gross proceeds from the sale. Accordingly, HWP has effected the sale under paragraph (a)(10)(i)(A) of this section. Additionally, HWP is a broker under paragraph (a)(1) of this section because in the ordinary course of its trade or business, HWP stands ready to effect sales to be made by others. If PRX is also a broker,
see
the multiple broker rule in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.
(20)
Example 20: Digital asset and security.
M owns 10 ownership units of a fund organized as a trust described in § 301.7701-4(c) of this chapter that was formed to invest in digital assets. M's units are held in a securities brokerage account and are not recorded using cryptographically secured distributed ledger technology. Although the underlying investments are comprised of one or more digital assets, M's investment is in ownership units of a trust, and the units are not themselves digital assets under paragraph (a)(19) of this section because transactions involving these units are not secured using cryptography and are not digitally recorded on a distributed ledger, such as a blockchain. The answer would be the same if the fund is organized as a C corporation or partnership.
(21)
Example 21: Forward contract, closing transaction, and sale
—(i)
Facts.
On February 24, Year 1, J contracts with broker CRX to sell J's 10 units of digital asset DE to CRX at an agreed upon price, with delivery under the contract to occur at 4 p.m. on March 10, Year 1. Pursuant to this agreement, J delivers the 10 units of DE to CRX, and CRX pays J the agreed upon price in cash.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section, the contract between J and CRX is a forward contract. J's delivery of digital asset DE pursuant to the forward contract is a closing transaction described in paragraph (a)(8) of this section that is treated as a sale of the underlying digital asset DE under paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(A)(
3
) of this section. Pursuant to the rules of paragraphs (a)(9)(i) and (a)(9)(ii)(A)(
3
) of this section, CRX may treat the delivery of DE as a sale without separating the profit or loss on the forward contract from the profit or loss on the delivery.
(22)
Example 22: Digital asset
—(i)
Facts.
On February 7, Year 1, J purchases a regulated futures contract on digital asset DE through futures commission merchant FCM. The contract is not recorded using cryptographically secured distributed ledger technology. The contract expires on the last Friday in June, Year 1. On May 1, Year 1, J enters into an offsetting closing transaction with respect to the regulated futures contract.
(ii)
Analysis.
Although the regulated futures contract's underlying assets are comprised of digital assets, J's investment is in the regulated futures contract, which is not a digital asset under paragraph (a)(19) of this section because transactions involving the contract are not secured using cryptography and are not digitally recorded using cryptographically secured distributed ledger technology, such as a
blockchain. When J disposes of the contract, the transaction is a sale of a regulated futures contract covered by paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section.
(23)
Example 23: Closing transaction and sale
—(i)
Facts.
On January 15, Year 1, J purchases digital asset DE through Broker. On March 1, Year 1, J sells a regulated futures contract on DE through Broker. The contract expires on the last Friday in June, Year 1. On the last Friday in June, Year 1, J delivers the DE in settlement of the regulated futures contract.
(ii)
Analysis.
J's delivery of the DE pursuant to the regulated futures contract is a closing transaction described in paragraph (a)(8) of this section that is treated as a sale of the regulated futures contract under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section. In addition, under paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(A)(
3
) of this section, J's delivery of digital asset DE pursuant to the settlement of the regulated futures contract is a sale of the underlying digital asset DE.

Example 24: Effect, effectuating services, digital asset middleman, position to know, and customer
—(i)
Facts.
As part of B's trade or business, B stands ready to provide customers with trading front-end services in return for a 1% transaction fee withheld either from digital assets transferred or digital assets received by its customers in the trade. B provides these trading front-end services to digital asset user C for the sale of 200 units of digital asset DE in exchange for 1,500 units of digital asset ST (sale 1) and withholds 2 units of DE as a transaction fee. B also provides digital asset validation services for a distributed ledger network. B validates a transaction involving the sale of 20 units of digital asset DE for 150 units of digital asset ST (sale 2). B does not provide any services described in paragraph (a)(21)(iii) of this section with respect to sale 2.
(ii)
Analysis with respect to sale 1.
With respect to sale 1, B has the ability to collect fees charged for its trading front-end services from the transaction flow. Accordingly, B is in a position to know the nature of sale 1 under paragraph (a)(21)(ii) of this section because B maintains control or sufficient influence over the trading front-end services to have the ability to determine whether and the extent to which the transfer of digital assets involved in a transaction gives rise to gross proceeds. Because B provides a trading front-end service with respect to sale 1 and is in a position to know the nature of sale 1 under paragraph (a)(21)(ii) of this section, B provides an effectuating service under paragraph (a)(21)(i)(A) of this section. Accordingly, B is a digital asset middleman under paragraph (a)(21) of this section with respect to sale 1. Additionally, B effects sale 1 for C under paragraph (a)(10)(i)(D) of this section, and C is B's customer under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(D) of this section.
(iii)
Analysis with respect to sale 2.
Under paragraph (a)(21)(iii)(C) of this section, B's validation services with respect to sale 2 are not effectuating services. Accordingly, notwithstanding that B acts as a digital asset middleman with respect to sale 1, B does not act as a digital asset middleman with respect to sale 2 or effect sale 2.

Corporation S is engaged in the business of operating and maintaining a website that licenses S-brand unhosted wallets (S-Wallets). S-Wallets are accessible online, allow users to control private keys to digital asset addresses, and allow users to transfer (and receive) digital assets directly from (into) their S-Wallets. S also offers trading front-end services (S-Trade) to each S-Wallet user. S charges S-Wallet users that dispose of digital assets held in their S-Wallets using the S-Trade service a 1% transaction fee that is withheld by S either from the digital assets transferred or the digital assets received by the user in the trade. S-Wallet users can use the S-Wallet's private key control function and can transfer digital assets to and from their S-Wallets without using the S-Trade function. S-Wallet user K uses the S-Trade function within K's S-Wallet to trade 200 units of digital asset DE for 1,500 units of digital asset ST (sale 1). S withholds 2 units of DE as a transaction fee with respect to this trade. K also uses the S-Wallet to transfer 5 units of DE directly to the digital asset address of another person's wallet in return for services provided by that other person
(sale 2). S does not provide any other services described in paragraph (a)(21)(iii) of this section with respect to sale 2.
(ii)
Analysis with respect to sale 1.
With respect to sale 1, S has the ability to collect fees charged for its trading front-end services from the transaction flow. Accordingly, S is in a position to know the nature of sale 1 under paragraph (a)(21)(ii) of this section because S maintains control or sufficient influence over the trading front-end services to have the ability to determine whether and the extent to which the transfer of digital assets involved in a transaction gives rise to gross proceeds. Because S provides a trading front-end service with respect to sale 1 and is in a position to know the nature of sale 1 under paragraph (a)(21)(ii) of this section, S provides an effectuating service under paragraph (a)(21)(i)(A) of this section. Accordingly, S is a digital asset middleman under paragraph (a)(21) of this section with respect to sale 1. Finally, S effects sale 1 for K under paragraph (a)(10)(i)(D) of this section, and K is S's customer under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(D) of this section.
(iii)
Analysis with respect to sale 2.
S's services with respect to sale 2 are not effectuating services under paragraph (a)(21)(i) of this section because these services are not described in paragraph (a)(21)(iii)(B) of this section and are not trading front-end services under paragraph (a)(21)(iii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, notwithstanding that S acts as a digital asset middleman with respect to sale 1, S does not act as a digital asset middleman with respect to sale 2 or effect sale 2.
(c)
Reporting by brokers
—(1)
Requirement of reporting.
Any broker shall, except as otherwise provided, report in the manner prescribed in this section.
(2)
Sales required to be reported.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(5), and (g) of this section, a broker is required to make a return of information for each sale by a customer of the broker if, in the ordinary course of a trade or business in which the broker stands ready to effect sales to be made by others, the broker effects the sale or closes the short position opened by the sale.
(3)
Exceptions
—(i)
Sales effected for exempt recipients
—(A)
In general.
No return of information is required with respect to a sale effected for a customer that is an exempt recipient under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section.

et seq.
) or with a state securities regulator and that investment adviser is not otherwise an exempt recipient in one or more of paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(B)(
1
) through (
11
) of this section.
(C)
Exemption certificate
—(
1
)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C)(
2
) or (
3
) of this section, a broker may treat a person described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section as an exempt recipient based on a properly completed exemption certificate (as provided in § 31.3406(h)-3 of this chapter); the broker's actual knowledge that the customer is a person described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section; or the applicable indicators described in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(A) through (M). A broker may require an exempt recipient to file a properly completed exemption certificate and may treat an exempt recipient that fails to do so as a recipient that is not exempt.
(
2
)
Limitation for corporate customers.
For sales of covered securities acquired on or after January 1, 2012, a broker may not treat a customer as an exempt recipient described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section based on the indicators of corporate status described in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(A). However, for sales of all securities and for sales of digital assets, a broker may treat a customer as an exempt recipient if one of the following applies—
(
i
) The name of the customer contains the term
insurance company, indemnity company, reinsurance company,
or
assurance company.
(
ii
) The name of the customer indicates that it is an entity listed as a per se corporation under § 301.7701-2(b)(8)(i) of this chapter.
(
iii
) The broker receives a properly completed exemption certificate (as provided in § 31.3406(h)-3 of this chapter) that asserts that the customer is not an S corporation as defined in section 1361(a).
(
iv
) The broker receives a withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i) that includes a certification that the person whose name is on the certificate is a foreign corporation.
(
3
)
Limitation for U.S. digital asset brokers.
For sales of digital assets, a broker may not treat a customer as an exempt recipient described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(
12
) of this section unless it obtains from that customer a certification on a properly completed exemption certificate (as provided in § 31.3406(h)-3 of this chapter) that the customer is a U.S. digital asset broker described in paragraph (g)(4)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section.
(ii)
Excepted sales.
No return of information is required with respect to a sale effected by a broker for a customer if the sale is an excepted sale. The inclusion in this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of a digital asset transaction is not intended to create an inference that the transaction is a sale of a digital asset under paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section. For this purpose, a sale is an excepted sale if it is—
(A) So designated by the Internal Revenue Service in a revenue ruling or revenue procedure (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter);
(B) A sale with respect to which a return is not required by applying the rules of § 1.6049-4(c)(4) (by substituting the term
a sale subject to reporting under section 6045
for the term
an interest payment
);
(C) A sale of digital asset units withheld by the broker from digital assets received by the customer in any underlying digital asset sale to pay for the customer's digital asset transaction costs;
(D) A sale for cash of digital asset units withheld by the broker from digital assets received by the customer in a sale of digital assets for different digital assets (underlying sale) that is undertaken immediately after the underlying sale to satisfy the broker's obligation under section 3406 of the Code to deduct and withhold a tax with respect to the underlying sale;
(E) A disposition of a digital asset representing loyalty program credits or loyalty program rewards offered by a provider of non-digital asset goods or services to its customers, in exchange
for non-digital asset goods or services from the provider or other merchants participating with the developer as part of the program, provided that the digital asset is not capable of being transferred, exchanged, or otherwise used outside the cryptographically secured distributed ledger network of the loyalty program;
(F) A disposition of a digital asset created and designed for use within a video game or network of video games in exchange for different digital assets also created and designed for use within that video game or video game network, provided the disposed of digital assets are not capable of being transferred, exchanged, or otherwise used outside of the video game or video game network;
(G) Except in the case of digital assets cleared or settled on a limited-access regulated network as described in paragraph (c)(8)(iii) of this section, a disposition of a digital asset representing information with respect to payment instructions or the management of inventory that does not consist of digital assets, within a cryptographically secured distributed ledger (or network of interoperable distributed ledgers) that provides access only to users of such information provided the digital assets disposed of are not capable of being transferred, exchanged, or otherwise used outside such distributed ledger or network; or
(H) A disposition of a digital asset offered by a seller of goods or provider of services to its customers that can be exchanged or redeemed only by those customers for goods or services provided by such seller or provider if the digital asset is not capable of being transferred, exchanged, or otherwise used outside the cryptographically secured distributed ledger network of the seller or provider and cannot be sold or exchanged for cash, stored-value cards, or qualifying stablecoins at a market rate inside the seller or provider's distributed ledger network.
(iii)
Multiple brokers
—(A)
In general.
If a broker is instructed to initiate a sale by a person that is an exempt recipient described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(
6
), (
7
), or (
11
) of this section, no return of information is required with respect to the sale by that broker. In a redemption of stock or retirement of securities, only the broker responsible for paying the holder redeemed or retired, or crediting the gross proceeds on the sale to that holder's account, is required to report the sale.
(B)
Special rule for sales of digital assets.
If more than one broker effects a sale of a digital asset on behalf of a customer, the broker responsible for first crediting the gross proceeds on the sale to the customer's wallet or account is required to report the sale. A broker that did not first credit the gross proceeds on the sale to the customer's wallet or account is not required to report the sale if prior to the sale that broker obtains a certification on a properly completed exemption certificate (as provided in § 31.3406(h)-3 of this chapter) that the broker first crediting the gross proceeds on the sale is a person described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(
12
) of this section.
(iv)
Cash on delivery transactions.
In the case of a sale of securities through a cash on delivery account, a delivery versus payment account, or other similar account or transaction, only the broker that receives the gross proceeds from the sale against delivery of the securities sold is required to report the sale. If, however, the broker's customer is another broker (second-party broker) that is an exempt recipient, then only the second-party broker is required to report the sale.
(v)
Fiduciaries and partnerships.
No return of information is required with respect to a sale effected by a custodian or trustee in its capacity as such or a redemption of a partnership interest by a partnership, provided the sale is otherwise reported by the custodian or trustee on a properly filed Form 1041, or the redemption is otherwise reported by the partnership on a properly filed Form 1065, and all Schedule K-1 reporting requirements are satisfied.
(vi)
Money market funds
—(A)
In general.
No return of information is required with respect to a sale of shares in a regulated investment company that is permitted to hold itself out to investors as a money market fund under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (17 CFR 270.2a-7).
(B)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (c)(3)(vi)(A) of this section applies to sales of shares in calendar years beginning on or after July 8, 2016. Taxpayers and brokers (as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(1)), however, may rely on paragraph (c)(3)(vi)(A) of this section for sales of shares in calendar years beginning before July 8, 2016.
(vii)
Obligor payments on certain obligations.
No return of information is required with respect to payments representing obligor payments on—
(A) Nontransferable obligations (including savings bonds, savings accounts, checking accounts, and NOW accounts);
(B) Obligations as to which the entire gross proceeds are reported by the broker on Form 1099 under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 6045 (including stripped coupons issued prior to July 1, 1982); or
(C) Retirement of short-term obligations (
i.e.,
obligations with a fixed maturity date not exceeding 1 year from the date of issue) that have original issue discount, as defined in section 1273(a)(1), with or without application of the
de minimis
rule. The preceding sentence does not apply to a debt instrument issued on or after January 1, 2014. For a short-term obligation issued on or after January 1, 2014,
see
paragraph (c)(3)(xiii) of this section.
(D) Demand obligations that also are callable by the obligor and that have no premium or discount. The preceding sentence does not apply to a debt instrument issued on or after January 1, 2014.
(viii)
Foreign currency.
No return of information is required with respect to a sale of foreign currency other than a sale pursuant to a forward contract or regulated futures contract that requires delivery of foreign currency.
(ix)
Fractional share.
No return of information is required with respect to a sale of a fractional share of stock if the gross proceeds on the sale of the fractional share are less than $20.
(x)
Certain retirements.
No return of information is required from an issuer or its agent with respect to the retirement of book entry or registered form obligations as to which the relevant books and records indicate that no interim transfers have occurred. The preceding sentence does not apply to a debt instrument issued on or after January 1, 2014.
(xi)
Short sales
—(A)
In general.
A broker may not make a return of information under this section for a short sale of a security entered into on or after January 1, 2011, until the year a customer delivers a security to satisfy the short sale obligation. The return must be made without regard to the constructive sale rule in section 1259 or to section 1233(h). In general, the broker must report on a single return the information required by paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section for the short sale except that the broker must report the date the short sale was closed in lieu of the sale date. In applying paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the broker must report the relevant information regarding the security sold to open the short sale and the adjusted basis of the security delivered to close the short sale and whether any gain or loss on the closing of the short sale is long-term or short-term (within the meaning of section 1222).
(B)
Short sale closed by delivery of a noncovered security.
A broker is not required to report adjusted basis and whether any gain or loss on the closing of the short sale is long-term or short-term if the short sale is closed by delivery of a noncovered security and the return so indicates. A broker that chooses to report this information is not subject to penalties under section 6721 or 6722 for failure to report this information correctly if the broker indicates on the return that the short sale was closed by delivery of a noncovered security.
(C)
Short sale obligation transferred to another account.
If a short sale obligation is satisfied by delivery of a security transferred into a customer's account accompanied by a transfer statement (as described in § 1.6045A-1(b)(7)) indicating that the security was borrowed, the broker receiving custody of the security may not file a return of information under this section. The receiving broker must furnish a statement to the transferor that reports the amount of gross proceeds received from the short sale, the date of the sale, the quantity of shares, units, or amounts sold, and the Committee on Uniform
Security Identification Procedures (CUSIP) number of the sold security (if applicable) or other security identifier number that the Secretary may designate by publication in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). The statement to the transferor also must include the transfer date, the name and contact information of the receiving broker, the name and contact information of the transferor, and sufficient information to identify the customer. If the customer subsequently closes the short sale obligation in the transferor's account with non-borrowed securities, the transferor must make the return of information required by this section. In that event, the transferor must take into account the information furnished under this paragraph (c)(3)(xi)(C) on the return unless the transferor knows that the information furnished under this paragraph (c)(3)(xi)(C) is incorrect or incomplete. A failure to report correct information that arises solely from this reliance is deemed to be due to reasonable cause for purposes of penalties under sections 6721 and 6722.
See
§ 301.6724-1(a)(1) of this chapter.
(xii)
Cross reference.
For an exception for certain sales of agricultural commodities and certificates issued by the Commodity Credit Corporation after January 1, 1993,
see
paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
(xiii)
Short-term obligations issued on or after January 1, 2014.
No return of information is required under this section with respect to a sale (including a retirement) of a short-term obligation, as described in section 1272(a)(2)(C), that is issued on or after January 1, 2014.
(xiv)
Certain redemptions.
No return of information is required under this section for payments made by a stock transfer agent (as described in § 1.6045-1(b)(iv)) with respect to a redemption of stock of a corporation described in section 1297(a) with respect to a shareholder in the corporation if—
(A) The stock transfer agent obtains from the corporation a written certification signed by a person authorized to sign on behalf of the corporation, that states that the corporation is described in section 1297(a) for each calendar year during which the stock transfer agent relies on the provisions of this paragraph (c)(3)(xiv), and the stock transfer agent has no reason to know that the written certification is unreliable or incorrect;
(B) The stock transfer agent identifies, prior to payment, the corporation as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(10) or (14), respectively), or reporting Model 1 FFI (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(13)), in accordance with the requirements of § 1.1471-3(d)(4) (substituting the terms
stock transfer agent
and
corporation
for the terms
withholding agent
and
payee,
respectively) and validates that status annually;
(C) The stock transfer agent obtains a written certification representing that the corporation shall report the payment as part of its account holder reporting obligations under chapter 4 of the Code or an applicable IGA (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(7)) and provided the stock transfer agent does not know that the corporation is not reporting the payment as required. The paying agent may rely on the written certification until there is a change in circumstances or the paying agent knows or has reason to know that the statement is unreliable or incorrect. A stock transfer agent that knows that the corporation is not reporting the payment as required under chapter 4 of the Code or an applicable IGA must report all payments reportable under this section that it makes during the year in which it obtains such knowledge; and
(D) The stock transfer agent is not also acting in its capacity as a custodian, nominee, or other agent of the payee with respect to the payment.
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of the rules in paragraph (c)(3) of this section:
(i)
Example 1.
P, an individual who is not an exempt recipient, places an order with B, a person generally known in the investment community to be a federally registered broker/dealer, to effect a sale of P's stock in a publicly traded corporation. B, in turn, places an order to sell the stock with C, a second broker, who will execute the sale.
B discloses to C the identity of the customer placing the order. C is not required to make a return of information with respect to the sale because C was instructed by B, an exempt recipient as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(
6
) of this section, to initiate the sale. B is required to make a return of information with respect to the sale because P is B's customer and is not an exempt recipient.
(ii)
Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
) except that B has an omnibus account with C so that B does not disclose to C whether the transaction is for a customer of B or for B's own account. C is not required to make a return of information with respect to the sale because C was instructed by B, an exempt recipient as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(
6
) of this section, to initiate the sale. B is required to make a return of information with respect to the sale because P is B's customer and is not an exempt recipient.
(iii)
Example 3.
D, an individual who is not an exempt recipient, enters into a cash on delivery stock transaction by instructing K, a federally registered broker/dealer, to sell stock owned by D, and to deliver the proceeds to L, a custodian bank. Concurrently with the above instructions, D instructs L to deliver D's stock to K (or K's designee) against delivery of the proceeds from K. The records of both K and L with respect to this transaction show an account in the name of D. Pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) of this section, D is considered the customer of K and L. Under paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, K is not required to make a return of information with respect to the sale because K will pay the gross proceeds to L against delivery of the securities sold. L is required to make a return of information with respect to the sale because D is L's customer and is not an exempt recipient.
(iv)
Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section (the facts in
Example 3
) except that E, a federally registered investment adviser, instructs K to sell stock owned by D and to deliver the proceeds to L. Concurrently with the above instructions, E instructs L to deliver D's stock to K (or K's designee) against delivery of the proceeds from K. The records of both K and L with respect to the transaction show an account in the name of D. Pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) of this section, D is considered the customer of K and L. Under paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, K is not required to make a return of information with respect to the sale because K will pay the gross proceeds to L against delivery of the securities sold. L is required to make a return of information with respect to the sale because D is L's customer and is not an exempt recipient.
(v)
Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section (the facts in
Example 4
) except that the records of both K and L with respect to the transaction show an account in the name of E. Pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) of this section, E is considered the customer of K and L. Under paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, K is not required to make a return of information with respect to the sale because K will pay the gross proceeds to L against delivery of the securities sold. L is required to make a return of information with respect to the sale because E is L's customer and is not an exempt recipient. E is required to make a return of information with respect to the sale because D is E's customer and is not an exempt recipient.
(vi)
Example 6.
F, an individual who is not an exempt recipient, owns bonds that are held by G, a federally registered broker/dealer, in an account for F with G designated as nominee for F. Upon the retirement of the bonds, the gross proceeds are automatically credited to the account of F. G is required to make a return of information with respect to the retirement because G is the broker responsible for making payments of the gross proceeds to F.
(vii)
Example 7.
On June 24, 2010, H, an individual who is not an exempt recipient, opens a short sale of stock in an account with M, a broker. Because the short sale is entered into before January 1, 2011, paragraph (c)(3)(xi) of this section does not apply. Under paragraphs (c)(2) and (j) of this section, M must make a return of information for the year of the sale regardless of when the short sale is closed.
(viii)
Example 8
—(A)
Facts.
On August 25, 2011, H opens a short sale of stock in an account with M, a broker. H closes the short sale with M on January 25, 2012, by purchasing stock of the same corporation in the account in which H opened the short sale and delivering the stock to satisfy H's short sale obligation. The stock H purchased is a covered security.
(B)
Analysis.
Because the short sale is entered into on or after January 1, 2011, under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(xi) of this section, the broker closing the short sale must make a return of information reporting the sale for the year in which the short sale is closed. Thus, M is required to report the sale for 2012. M must report on a single return the relevant information for the sold stock, the adjusted basis of the purchased stock, and whether any gain or loss on the closing of the short sale is long-term or short-term (within the meaning of section 1222). Thus, M must report the information about the short sale opening and closing transactions on a single return for taxable year 2012.
(ix)
Example 9
—(A)
Facts.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (c)(4)(viii) of this section (the facts in
Example 8
) except that H also has an account with N, a broker, and satisfies the short sale obligation with M by borrowing stock of the same corporation from N and transferring custody of the borrowed stock from N to M. N indicates on the transfer statement that the transferred stock was borrowed in accordance with § 1.6045A-1(b)(7).
(B)
Analysis with respect to M.
Under paragraph (c)(3)(xi)(C) of this section, M may not file the return of information required under this section. M must furnish a statement to N that reports the gross proceeds from the short sale on August 25, 2011, the date of the sale, the quantity of shares sold, the CUSIP number or other security identifier number of the sold stock, the transfer date, the name and contact information of M and N, and information identifying H such as H's name and the account number from which H transferred the borrowed stock.
(C)
Analysis with respect to N.
N must report the gross proceeds from the short sale, the date the short sale was closed, the adjusted basis of the stock acquired to close the short sale, and whether any gain or loss on the closing of the short sale is long-term or short-term (within the meaning of section 1222) on the return of information N is required to file under paragraph (c)(2) of this section when H closes the short sale in the account with N.
(x)
Example 10: Excepted sale of digital assets representing payment instructions
—(A)
Facts.
BNK is a bank that uses a cryptographically secured distributed ledger technology system (DLT) that provides access only to other member banks to securely transfer payment instructions that are not securities or commodities described in paragraph (c)(8)(iii) of this section. These payment instructions are exchanged between member banks through the use of digital asset DX. Dispositions of DX do not give rise to sales of other digital assets within the cryptographically secured distributed ledger (or network of interoperable distributed ledgers) and are not capable of being transferred, exchanged, or otherwise used, outside the DLT system. BNK disposes of DX using the DLT system to make a payment instruction to another bank within the DLT system.
(B)
Analysis.
BNK's disposition of DX using the DLT system to make a payment instruction to another bank within the DLT system is a disposition of a digital asset representing payment instructions that are not securities or commodities within a cryptographically secured distributed ledger that provides access only to users of such information. Because DX cannot be transferred, exchanged, or otherwise used, outside of DLT, and because the payment instructions are not dual classification assets under paragraph (c)(8)(iii) of this section, BNK's disposition of DX is an excepted sale under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(G) of this section.
(xi)
Example 11: Excepted sale of digital assets representing a loyalty program
—(A)
Facts.
S created a loyalty program as a marketing tool to incentivize customers to make purchases at S's store, which sells non-digital asset goods and services. Customers that join S's loyalty program receive 1 unit of digital asset LY at the end of each month for every $1 spent in S's store. Units of LY
can only be disposed of within S's cryptographically secured distributed ledger (DLY) in exchange for goods or services provided by S or merchants, such as M, that have contractually agreed to provide goods or services to S's loyalty customers in exchange for a predetermined payment from S. Customer C is a participant in S's loyalty program and has earned 1,000 units of LY. C redeems 1,000 units of LY in exchange for non-digital asset goods in M's store.
(B)
Analysis.
Customer C's disposition of LY using the DLY system in exchange for non-digital asset goods in M's store is a disposition of a digital asset representing loyalty program credits in exchange for non-digital asset goods or services from M, a merchant participating with S's loyalty program. Because LY cannot be transferred, exchanged, or otherwise used outside of DLY, C's disposition of LY is an excepted sale under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of this section.

Example 12: Multiple brokers
—(A)
Facts.
L, an individual who is not an exempt recipient, maintains digital assets with HWP, a U.S. corporation that provides hosted wallet services. L also maintains an account at CRX, a U.S. corporation that operates a digital asset trading platform and that also provides custodial services for digital assets held by L. L places an order with HWP to exchange 10 units of digital asset DE for 100 units of digital asset RN. To effect the order, HWP places the order with CRX and communicates to CRX that the order is on behalf of L. Prior to initiating the transaction, CRX obtains a certification from HWP on a properly completed exemption certificate (as provided in § 31.3406(h)-3 of this chapter) that HWP is a U.S. digital asset broker described in paragraph (g)(4)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section. CRX completes the transaction and transfers the 100 units of RN to HWP. HWP, in turn, credits L's account with the 100 units of RN.
(B)
Analysis.
HWP is the broker responsible for first crediting the gross proceeds on the sale to L's wallet. Accordingly, because CRX has obtained from HWP a certification on a properly completed exemption certificate (as provided in § 31.3406(h)-3 of this chapter) that HWP is a U.S. digital asset broker described in paragraph (g)(4)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section, CRX is not required to make a return of information with respect to the sale of 100 units of RN effected on behalf of L under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. In contrast, because HWP is the broker that credits the 100 units of RN to L's account, HWP is required to make a return of information with respect to the sale.
(xiii)
Example 13: Multiple brokers
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(4)(xii)(A) of this section (the facts in
Example 12
), except that CRX deposits the 100 units of RN into L's account with CRX after the transaction is effected by CRX. Thereafter, L transfers the 100 units of RN in L's account with CRX to L's account with HWP. Prior to the transaction, HWP obtained a certification from CRX on a properly completed exemption certificate (as provided in § 31.3406(h)-3 of this chapter) that CRX is a U.S. digital asset broker described in paragraph (g)(4)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section.
(B)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, despite being instructed by HWP to make the sale of 100 units of RN on behalf of L, CRX is required to make a return of information with respect to the sale effected on behalf of L because CRX is the broker that credits the 100 units of RN to L's account. In contrast, HWP is not required to make a return of information with respect to the sale effected on behalf of L because HWP obtained from CRX a certification on a properly completed exemption certificate (as provided in § 31.3406(h)-3 of this chapter) that CRX is a U.S. digital asset broker described in paragraph (g)(4)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section.
(5)
Form of reporting for regulated futures contracts
—(i)
In general.
A broker effecting closing transactions in regulated futures contracts shall report information with respect to regulated futures contracts solely in the manner prescribed in this paragraph (c)(5). In the case of a sale that involves making delivery pursuant to a regulated futures contract, only the profit or loss on the contract is reported as a transaction with respect to regulated futures contracts under this paragraph (c)(5); such sales are, however, subject
to reporting under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A). The information required under this paragraph (c)(5) must be reported on a calendar year basis, unless the broker is advised in writing by an account's owner that the owner's taxable year is other than a calendar year and the broker elects to report with respect to regulated futures contracts in such account on the basis of the owner's taxable year. The following information must be reported as required by Form 1099-B,
Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions,
or any successor form, with respect to regulated futures contracts held in a customer's account:
(A) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the customer.
(B) The net realized profit or loss from all regulated futures contracts closed during the calendar year.
(C) The net unrealized profit or loss in all open regulated futures contracts at the end of the preceding calendar year.
(D) The net unrealized profit or loss in all open regulated futures contracts at the end of the calendar year.
(E) The aggregate profit or loss from regulated futures contracts ((
b
) + (
d
)−(
c
)).
(F) Any other information required by Form 1099-B.
See
17 CFR 1.33. For this purpose, the end of a year is the close of business of the last business day of such year. In reporting under this paragraph (c)(5), the broker shall make such adjustments for commissions that have actually been paid and for option premiums as are consistent with the books of the broker. No additional returns of information with respect to regulated futures contracts so reported are required.
(ii)
Determination of profit or loss from foreign currency contracts.
A broker effecting a closing transaction in foreign currency contracts (as defined in section 1256(g)) shall report information with respect to such contracts in the manner prescribed in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section. If a foreign currency contract is closed by making or taking delivery, the net realized profit or loss for purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(i)(B) of this section is determined by comparing the contract price to the spot price for the contract currency at the time and place specified in the contract. If a foreign currency contract is closed by entry into an offsetting contract, the net realized profit or loss for purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(i)(B) of this section is determined by comparing the contract price to the price of the offsetting contract. The net unrealized profit or loss in a foreign currency contract for purposes of paragraphs (c)(5)(i) (C) and (D) of this section is determined by comparing the contract price to the broker's price for similar contracts at the close of business of the relevant year.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of the rules in this paragraph (c)(5):

# Example 1.
On October 30, 1984, A, an individual who is a calendar year taxpayer not otherwise exempt from reporting, buys one March 1985 put on Treasury Bond futures (i.e. A purchases an option to enter into a short regulated futures contract of $100,000 face value U.S. Treasury bonds). A pays $500 for the option. On December 19, 1984, A, through B, exercises the option and enters into the futures contract. On February 15, 1985, A, through B, enters into a closing transaction with respect to the futures contract. These are A's only transactions in the account. Since B's books list A's regulated futures contract on December 31, 1984, B must report for A, for 1984, the unrealized profit or loss in the contract as of December 31, 1984. For 1985, B will report the same amount for A as the unrealized profit or loss at the beginning of 1985. The return of information for 1985 will also include the gain or loss from the contract in the net realized profit or loss from all regulated futures contracts sales during 1985.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that A does not enter into the closing transaction, but instead, on March 20, 1985, B informs A that A will make delivery under the contract. On March 22, 1985, A does so; consequently, A becomes entitled to the gross proceeds. B enters the closing transaction on its books on March 20, 1985. In addition to the returns of information required by paragraph (c)(5), as described in Example (1), B must report the March 22, 1985 delivery as a separate transaction. B may use as the sale date for the delivery either March 20, 1985, the date the transaction is entered on the books of B, or March 22, 1985, the date A becomes entitled to the gross proceeds. B may not deduct the $500 premium from the gross proceeds with respect to the March 22, 1985 delivery.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in Example (2) except that A buys a call on Treasury bond futures and takes delivery. B will
supply the returns of information required by paragraph (c)(5), as described in Example (1). B is not required to make a return of information with respect to A's taking delivery.

# Example 4.
C, an individual who is a calendar year taxpayer not otherwise exempt from reporting, has an account with D, a broker. C trades both regulated futures contracts and forward contracts through C's account with D. D must report C's regulated futures contracts on an annual basis as required by paragraph (c)(5). With respect to C's forward contracts, D may elect to use the calendar month, quarter, or year as D's reporting period as provided in paragraph (c)(6).
(6)
Reporting periods and filing groups
—(i)
Reporting period
—(A)
In general.
A broker may elect to use the calendar month, quarter, or year as the broker's reporting period. A broker may separately elect a reporting period for each filing group.
(B)
Election.
For each calendar year, a broker shall elect a reporting period by filing Forms 1096 and 1099 in the manner elected. A different reporting period may be subsequently elected by filing in the manner subsequently elected, provided no duplication of reported transactions results.
(ii)
Filing group
—(A)
In general.
A broker may elect to group customers or customer accounts by office, branch, department or other method of operational classification and separately file Forms 1096 and 1099 for each filing group.
(B)
Election.
For each calendar year, a broker shall elect filing groups by filing Forms 1096 and 1099 in the manner elected. Different filing groups may be subsequently elected by filing in the manner subsequently elected, provided no duplication of reported transactions results.
(iii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (c)(6):

# Example.
The A department of C, a broker, files a separate report for each month of 1984, whereas the B department of C files one report for all of 1984. C makes no other reports or returns of information under section 6045 for 1984. C had thereby elected two filing groups for 1984, the A department and the B department. The A department has the calendar month as its 1984 reporting period, whereas the B department has the calendar year as its 1984 reporting period. The same result would occur if A and B were offices or branches of C.
(7)
Exception for certain sales of agricultural commodities and commodity certificates
—(i)
Agricultural commodities.
No return of information is required under section 6045 for a spot or forward sale of an agricultural commodity. This paragraph (c)(7)(i) does not except from reporting sales of agricultural commodities pursuant to regulated futures contracts, sales of derivative interests in agricultural commodities, or sales described in paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Commodity Credit Corporation certificates.
Except as otherwise provided in a revenue ruling or revenue procedure, no return of information is required under section 6045 with respect to a sale of a commodity certificate issued by the Commodity Credit Corporation under 7 CFR 1470.4 (1990).
(iii)
Sales involving designated warehouses.
Paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section does not apply to any sale involving a warehouse receipt for an agricultural commodity issued by a designated warehouse for an agricultural commodity of the type for which the warehouse is a designated warehouse.
(iv)
Definitions.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(7):
(A)
Agricultural commodity.
An “agricultural commodity” includes, but is not limited to, a commodity within the meaning of paragraph (a)(5) of this section that is a grain, feed, livestock, meat, oil seed, timber, or fiber.
(B)
Spot sale.
A spot sale is a sale that results in the substantially contemporaneous delivery of a commodity.
(C)
Forward sale.
A forward sale is a sale pursuant to a forward contract within the meaning of paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
(D)
Designated warehouse.
A designated warehouse is a warehouse, depository, or other similar entity, designated by a commodity exchange under 7 CFR 1.43 (1992), in which or out of which a particular type of agricultural commodity is deliverable in satisfaction of a regulated futures contract.
(8)
Special coordination rules for reporting digital assets that are dual classification assets
—(i)
General rule for reporting dual classification assets as digital assets.
Except in the case of a sale described in paragraph (c)(8)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, for any sale of a digital asset under paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section that also constitutes a sale under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section, the broker must treat the transaction as set forth in paragraphs (c)(8)(i)(A) through (D). For purposes of this section, an asset described in this paragraph (c)(8)(i) is a dual classification asset.
(A) The broker must report the sale only as a sale of a digital asset under paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section and not as a sale under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section.
(B) The broker must treat the sale only as a sale of a specified security under paragraph (a)(14)(v) or (vi) of this section, as applicable, and not as a specified security under paragraph (a)(14)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section.
(C) The broker must apply the reporting rules set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(B) through (D) of this section, as applicable, for the information required to be reported for such sale.
(D) For a sale of a dual classification asset that is treated as a tokenized security, the broker must report the information set forth in paragraph (c)(8)(i)(D)(
3
) of this section.
(
1
) A
tokenized security
is a dual classification asset that:
(
i
) Provides the holder with an interest in another asset that is a security described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, other than a security that is also a digital asset; or
(
ii
) Constitutes an asset the offer and sale of which was registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, other than an asset treated as a security for securities law purposes solely as an investment contract.
(
2
) For purposes of paragraph (c)(8)(i)(D)(
1
) of this section, a qualifying stablecoin is not treated as a tokenized security.
(
3
) In the case of a sale of a tokenized security, the broker must report the information set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B)(
6
) of this section, as applicable. In the case of a tokenized security that is a specified security under paragraph (a)(14)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, the broker must also report the information set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(D)(
4
) of this section.
(ii)
Reporting of dual classification assets that constitute contracts covered by section 1256(b) of the Code.
For a sale of a digital asset on or after January 1, 2025, that is also a contract covered by section 1256(b), the broker must report the sale only under paragraph (c)(5) of this section including, as appropriate, the application of the rules in paragraph (m)(3) of this section.
(iii)
Reporting of dual classification assets cleared or settled on a limited-access regulated network
—(A)
General rule.
The coordination rule of paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section does not apply to any sale of a dual classification asset that is a digital asset solely because the sale of such asset is cleared or settled on a limited-access regulated network described in paragraph (c)(8)(iii)(B) of this section. In such case, the broker must report such sale only as a sale under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section and not as a sale under paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section and must treat the sale as a sale of a specified security under paragraph (a)(14)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, to the extent applicable, and not as a sale of a specified security under paragraph (a)(14)(v) or (vi) of this section. For all other purposes of this section including transfers, a dual classification asset that is a digital asset solely because it is cleared or settled on a limited-access regulated network is not treated as a digital asset and is not reportable as a digital asset.
See
paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section for the information required to be reported for such a sale.
(B)
Limited-access regulated network.
For purposes of this section, a limited-access regulated network is described in paragraph (c)(8)(iii)(B)(
1
) or (
2
) of this section.
(
1
) A cryptographically secured distributed ledger, or network of interoperable cryptographically secured distributed ledgers, that provides clearance or settlement services and that either:
(
i
) Provides access only to persons described in one or more of paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(B)(
6
), (
7
), (
10
), or (
11
) of this section; or
(
ii
) Is provided exclusively to its participants by an entity that has registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a clearing agency, or that has received an exemption order from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a clearing agency, under section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
(
2
) A cryptographically secured distributed ledger controlled by a single person described in one of paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(B)(
6
) through (
11
) of this section that permits the ledger to be used solely by itself and its affiliates, and therefore does not provide access to the ledger to third parties such as customers or investors, in order to clear or settle sales of assets.
(iv)
Reporting of dual classification assets that are interests in money market funds.
The coordination rule of paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section does not apply to any sale of a dual classification asset that is a share in a regulated investment company that is permitted to hold itself out to investors as a money market fund under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (17 CFR 270.2a-7). In such case, the broker must treat such sale only as a sale under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section and not as a sale under paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
See
paragraph (c)(3)(vi) of this section, providing that no return of information is required for shares described in the first sentence of this paragraph (c)(8)(iv).
(v)
Example: Digital asset securities
—(A)
Facts.
Brokers registered under the securities laws of the United States have formed a large network (broker network) that maintains accounts for customers seeking to purchase and sell stock. The broker network clears and settles sales of this stock using a cryptographically secured distributed ledger (DLN) that provides clearance or settlement services to the broker network. DLN may not be used by any person other than a registered broker in the broker network.
(B)
Analysis.
DLN is a limited-access regulated network described in paragraph (c)(8)(iii)(B)(
1
)(
i
) of this section because it is a cryptographically secured distributed ledger that provides clearance or settlement services and that provides access only to brokers described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)(
6
) of this section. Additionally, sales of stock cleared on DLN are sales of securities under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section and sales of digital assets under paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, sales of stock cleared on DLN are described in paragraph (c)(8)(iii) of this section and the coordination rule of paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section does not apply to these sales. Therefore, the sales of stock cleared on DLN are reported only under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section.
See
paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section for the method for reporting the information required to be reported for such a sale.
(d)
Information required
—(1)
In general.
A broker that is required to make a return of information under paragraph (c) of this section during a reporting period is required to report for each filing group on a separate Form 1096, “Annual Summary and Transmittal of U.S. Information Returns,” or any successor form, the information required by the form in the manner and number of copies required by the form.
(2)
Transactional reporting
—(i)
Required information
—(A)
General rule for sales described in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, for each sale described in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section for which a broker is required to make a return of information under this section, the broker must report on Form 1099-B,
Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions,
or any successor form, the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the customer, the property sold, the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures (CUSIP) number of the security sold (if applicable) or other security identifier number that the Secretary may designate by publication in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), the adjusted basis of the security sold, whether any gain or loss with respect to the security sold is long-term or short-term (within the meaning of section 1222 of the Code), the gross proceeds of the sale, the sale date, and other information required by the form
in the manner and number of copies required by the form. In addition, for a sale of a covered security on or after January 1, 2014, a broker must report on Form 1099-B whether any gain or loss is ordinary.
See
paragraph (m) of this section for additional rules related to options and paragraph (n) of this section for additional rules related to debt instruments.
See
paragraph (c)(8) of this section for rules related to sales of securities or sales of commodities under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section that are also sales of digital assets under paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
(B)
Required information for digital asset transactions.
Except in the case of a sale of a qualifying stablecoin or a specified nonfungible token for which the broker reports in the manner set forth in paragraph (d)(10) of this section and subject to the exception described in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(C) of this section for sales of digital assets described in paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D) of this section (sales effected by processors of digital asset payments), for each sale of a digital asset described in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section for which a broker is required to make a return of information under this section, the broker must report on Form 1099-DA,
Digital Asset Proceeds From Broker Transactions,
or any successor form, in the manner required by such form or instructions the following information:
(
1
) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the customer;
(
2
) The name and number of units of the digital asset sold;
(
3
) The sale date;
(
4
) The gross proceeds amount (after reduction for the allocable digital asset transaction costs as defined and allocated pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section);
(
5
) Whether the sale was for cash, stored-value cards, or in exchange for services or other property;
(
6
) In the case of a sale that is reported as a digital asset sale pursuant to the rule in paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section and is described as a tokenized security in paragraph (c)(8)(i)(D) of this section, the broker must also report to the extent required by Form 1099-DA or instructions: the CUSIP number of the security sold (if applicable) or other security identifier number that the Secretary may designate by publication in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter); any information required under paragraph (m) of this section (related to options); any information required under paragraph (n) of this section (related to debt instruments); and any other information required by the form or instructions;
(
7
) For each such sale of a digital asset that was held by the broker in a hosted wallet on behalf of a customer and was previously transferred into an account at the broker (transferred-in digital asset), the broker must also report the date of such transfer in and the number of units transferred in by the customer;
(
8
) Whether the broker took into account customer-provided acquisition information from the customer or the customer's agent as described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
4
) of this section when determining the identification of the units sold (without regard to whether the broker's determination with respect to the particular unit sold was derived from the broker's own records or from that information); and
(
9
) Any other information required by the form or instructions.
(C)
Exception for certain sales effected by processors of digital asset payments.
A broker is not required to report any information required by paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section with respect to a sale of a digital asset described in paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D) of this section (sales effected by processors of digital asset payments) by a customer if the gross proceeds (after reduction for the allocable digital asset transaction costs) from all such sales of digital assets effected by that broker for the year by the customer do not exceed $600. Gross proceeds from sales of qualifying stablecoins or specified nonfungible tokens that are reported in the manner set forth in paragraph (d)(10) of this section are not included in determining if this $600 threshold has been met. For the rules applicable for determining who the customer is for purposes of calculating this $600 threshold in the case of a joint account,
see
paragraph (d)(10)(v) of this section.
(D)
Acquisition information for sales of certain digital assets.
Except in the case of a sale of a qualifying stablecoin or a specified nonfungible token for which the broker reports in the manner set forth in paragraph (d)(10) of this section, for each sale described in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section on or after January 1, 2026, of a covered security defined in paragraph (a)(15)(i)(H), (J), or (K) of this section that was acquired by the broker for the customer and held in the customer's account, for which a broker is required to make a return of information under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the broker must also report the following information:
(
1
) The adjusted basis of the covered security sold calculated in accordance with paragraph (d)(6) of this section;
(
2
) The date such covered security was purchased, and whether any gain or loss with respect to the covered security sold is long-term or short-term in accordance with paragraph (d)(7) of this section;
(
3
) For purpose of determining the information required in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(D)(
1
) through (
2
) in the case of an option and any asset delivered in settlement of an option, the broker must apply any applicable rules set forth in paragraph (m) of this section; and
(
4
) In the case of a sale that is reported as a digital asset sale pursuant to the rule in paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section and is described as a tokenized security in paragraph (c)(8)(i)(D) of this section,
see
paragraphs (d)(6)(iii)(A)(
2
) and (d)(7)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section regarding the basis and holding period adjustments required for wash sales, paragraph (d)(6)(v) of this section for rules regarding the application of the average basis method, paragraph (m) of this section for rules related to options, paragraph (n) of this section for rules related to debt instruments, and any other information required by the form or instructions.
(ii)
Specific identification of specified securities
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in § 1.1012-1(e)(7)(ii), for a specified security described in paragraph (a)(14)(i) of this section sold on or after January 1, 2011, or for a specified security described in paragraph (a)(14)(ii) of this section sold on or after January 1, 2014, a broker must report a sale of less than the entire position in an account of a specified security that was acquired on different dates or at different prices consistently with a customer's adequate and timely identification of the security to be sold.
See
§ 1.1012-1(c). If the customer does not provide an adequate and timely identification for the sale, the broker must first report the sale of securities in the account for which the broker does not know the acquisition or purchase date followed by the earliest securities purchased or acquired, whether covered securities or noncovered securities.
(B)
Identification of digital assets sold, disposed of, or transferred.
For a specified security described in paragraph (a)(14)(v) of this section, a broker must determine the unit sold, disposed of, or transferred, if less than the entire position in an account of such specified security that was acquired on different dates or at different prices, consistently with the adequate identification of the digital asset to be sold, disposed of, or transferred.
(
1
)
No identification of units by customer.
In the case of multiple units of the same digital asset that are held by a broker for a customer, if the customer does not provide the broker with an adequate identification of which units of a digital asset are sold, disposed of, or transferred by the date and time of the sale, disposition, or transfer, and the broker does not have adequate transfer-in date records and does not have or take into account customer-provided acquisition information as defined by paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
4
) of this section, then the broker must first report the sale, disposition, or transfer of units that were not acquired by the broker for the customer. After the disposition of all such units of digital assets, the broker must treat units as sold, disposed of, or transferred in order of time from the earliest date on which units of the same digital asset were acquired by the customer.
See
paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
4
) of this section for circumstances under which a broker may use information provided by the customer or the customer's agent to determine when units of a digital asset were acquired by the
customer. If the broker does not receive customer-provided acquisition information with respect to digital assets that were transferred into the customer's account or otherwise does not take such information into account, the broker must treat those units as acquired as of the date and time of the transfer.
(
2
)
Adequate identification of units by customer.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
3
) of this section, when multiple units of the same digital asset are left in the custody of the broker, an adequate identification occurs if, no later than the date and time of the sale, disposition, or transfer, the customer specifies to the broker the particular units of the digital asset to be sold, disposed of, or transferred by reference to any identifier that the broker designates as sufficiently specific to determine the units sold, disposed of, or transferred. For example, a customer's reference to the purchase date and time of the units to be sold may be designated by the broker as sufficiently specific to determine the units sold, disposed of, or transferred if no other unidentified units were purchased at that same purchase date and time or purchase price. To the extent permitted by paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
4
) of this section, a broker may take into account customer-provided acquisition information with respect to transferred-in digital assets for purposes of enabling a customer to make a sufficiently specific reference. A standing order or instruction for the specific identification of digital assets is treated as an adequate identification made at the date and time of sale, disposition, or transfer. In the case of a broker that offers only one method of making a specific identification, such method is treated as a standing order or instruction within the meaning of the prior sentence.
(
3
)
Special rule for the identification of certain units withheld from a transaction.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
1

) of this section, in the case of a sale of digital assets in exchange for other digital assets differing materially in kind or in extent and for which the broker withholds units of the digital assets received for either the broker's obligation to deduct and withhold a tax under section 3406, or for payment of the customer's digital asset transaction costs as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, the customer is deemed to have made an adequate identification, within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(

)
Customer-provided acquisition information for digital assets.
For purposes of identifying which units are sold, disposed of, or transferred under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, a broker is permitted, but not required, to take into account customer-provided acquisition information. For purposes of this section, customer-provided acquisition information means reasonably reliable information, such as the date and time of acquisition of units of a digital asset, provided by a customer or the customer's agent to the broker no later than the date and time of a sale, disposition, or transfer. Reasonably reliable information includes purchase or trade confirmations at other brokers or immutable data on a public distributed ledger. Solely for purposes of penalties under sections 6721 and 6722, a broker that takes into account customer-provided acquisition information for purposes of identifying which units are sold, disposed of, or transferred is deemed to have relied upon this information in good faith if the broker neither knows nor has reason to know that the information is incorrect.
See
§ 301.6724-1(c)(6) of this chapter.
(iii)
Penalty relief for reporting information not subject to reporting
—(A)
Noncovered securities.
A broker is not required to report adjusted basis and the character of any gain or loss for the sale of a noncovered security if the return identifies the sale as a sale of a noncovered security. A broker that chooses to report this information for a noncovered security is not subject to penalties under section 6721 or 6722 of
the Code for failure to report this information correctly if the return identifies the sale as a sale of a noncovered security. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A), a broker must treat a security for which a broker makes the single-account election described in § 1.1012-1(e)(11)(i) as a covered security.
(B)
Gross proceeds from digital assets sold before applicability date.
A broker is not required to report the gross proceeds from the sale of a digital asset as described in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section if the sale is effected prior to January 1, 2025. A broker that chooses to report this information on either the Form 1099-B, or when available the Form 1099-DA, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section is not subject to penalties under section 6721 or 6722 for failure to report this information correctly.
See
paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section for the reporting of adjusted basis and the character of any gain or loss for the sale of a noncovered security that is a digital asset.
(iv)
Information from other parties and other accounts
—(A)
Transfer and issuer statements.
When reporting a sale of a covered security, a broker must take into account all information, other than the classification of the security (such as stock), furnished on a transfer statement (as described in § 1.6045A-1) and all information furnished or deemed furnished on an issuer statement (as described in § 1.6045B-1) unless the statement is incomplete or the broker has actual knowledge that it is incorrect. A broker may treat a customer as a minority shareholder when taking the information on an issuer statement into account unless the broker knows that the customer is a majority shareholder and the issuer statement reports the action's effect on the basis of majority shareholders. A failure to report correct information that arises solely from reliance on information furnished on a transfer statement or issuer statement is deemed to be due to reasonable cause for purposes of penalties under sections 6721 and 6722.
See
§ 301.6724-1(a)(1) of this chapter.
(B)
Other information with respect to securities.
Except in the case of a covered security that is described in paragraph (a)(15)(i)(H), (J), or (K) of this section, a broker is permitted, but not required, to take into account information about a covered security other than what is furnished on a transfer statement or issuer statement, including any information the broker has about securities held by the same customer in other accounts with the broker. For purposes of penalties under sections 6721 and 6722, a broker that takes into account information with respect to securities described in the previous sentence that is received from a customer or third party other than information furnished on a transfer statement or issuer statement is deemed to have relied upon this information in good faith if the broker neither knows nor has reason to know that the information is incorrect.
See
§ 301.6724-1(c)(6) of this chapter.
(v)
Failure to receive a complete transfer statement for securities.
A broker that has not received a complete transfer statement as required under § 1.6045A-1(a)(3) for a transfer of a specified security described in paragraphs (a)(14)(i) through (iv) of this section must request a complete statement from the applicable person effecting the transfer unless, under § 1.6045A-1(a), the transferor has no duty to furnish a transfer statement for the transfer. The broker is only required to make this request once. If the broker does not receive a complete transfer statement after requesting it, the broker may treat the security as a noncovered security upon its subsequent sale or transfer. A transfer statement for a covered security is complete if, in the view of the receiving broker, it provides sufficient information to comply with this section when reporting the sale of the security. A transfer statement for a noncovered security is complete if it indicates that the security is a noncovered security.
(vi)
Reporting by other parties after a sale of securities
—(A)
Transfer statements.
If a broker receives a transfer statement indicating that a security is a covered security after the broker reports the sale of the security, the broker must file a corrected return within thirty days of receiving the statement unless the broker reported
the required information on the original return consistently with the transfer statement.
(B)
Issuer statements.
If a broker receives or is deemed to receive an issuer statement after the broker reports the sale of a covered security, the broker must file a corrected return within thirty days of receiving the issuer statement unless the broker reported the required information on the original return consistently with the issuer statement.
(C)
Exception.
A broker is not required to file a corrected return under this paragraph (d)(2)(vi) if the broker receives the transfer statement or issuer statement more than three years after the broker filed the return.
(vii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (d)(2). Unless otherwise indicated, all events and transactions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(vii)(C) and (D) of this section (
Examples 3
and

Facts.
On February 22, 2012, K sells 100 shares of stock of C, a corporation, at a loss in an account held with F, a broker. On March 15, 2012, K purchases 100 shares of C stock for cash in an account with G, a different broker. Because K acquires the stock purchased on March 15, 2012, for cash in an account after January 1, 2012, under paragraph (a)(15) of this section, the stock is a covered security. K asks G to increase K's adjusted basis in the stock to account for the application of the wash sale rules under section 1091 to the loss transaction in the account held with F.
(

)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, G is not required to take into account the information provided by K when subsequently reporting the adjusted basis and whether any gain or loss on the sale is long-term or short-term. If G chooses to take this information into account, under paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, G is deemed to have relied upon the information received from K in good faith for purposes of penalties under sections 6721 and 6722 if G neither knows nor has reason to know that the information provided by K is incorrect.

Facts.
L purchases shares of stock of a single corporation in an account with F, a broker, on April 17, 1969, April 17, 2012, April 17, 2013, and April 17, 2014. In January 2015, L sells all the stock.
(

)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section, F must separately report the gross proceeds and adjusted basis attributable to the stock purchased in 2014, for which the gain or loss on the sale is short-term, and the combined gross proceeds and adjusted basis attributable to the stock purchased in 2012 and 2013, for which the gain or loss on the sale is long-term. Under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, F must also separately report the gross proceeds attributable to the stock purchased in 1969 as the sale of noncovered securities in order to avoid treatment of this sale as the sale of covered securities.

Example 3: Ordering rule

)
Facts.
On August 1, Year 1, TP opens a hosted wallet account at CRX, a digital asset broker that owns and operates a digital asset trading platform, and purchases within the account 10 units of digital asset DE for $9 per unit. On January 1, Year 2, TP opens a hosted wallet account at BEX, another digital asset broker that owns and operates a digital asset trading platform, and purchases within this account 20 units of digital asset DE for $5 per unit. On August 1, Year 3, TP transfers the digital asset units held in TP's hosted wallet account with CRX into TP's hosted wallet account with BEX. On September 1, Year 3, TP directs BEX to sell 10 units of DE but does not specify which units are to be sold and does not provide to BEX purchase date and time information with respect to the DE units transferred into TP's account with BEX. BEX has adequate transfer-in date records with respect to TP's transfer of the 10 units of DE on August 1, Year 3. BEX effects the sale on TP's behalf for $10 per unit.
(
2
)
Analysis.
TP did not make an adequate identification of the units to be sold in a sale of DE units that was less than TP's entire position in digital asset DE. Therefore, BEX must treat the units of digital asset DE sold according to the ordering rule provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.
Pursuant to that rule, because BEX has adequate transfer-in date records with respect to TP's transfer of the 10 units of DE on August 1, Year 3, and because TP did not give BEX customer-provided acquisition information as defined by paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
4
) of this section with respect to the units transferred into TP's account at BEX, the units sold must be attributed to the earliest units of digital asset DE acquired by TP. Additionally, because TP did not give BEX customer-provided acquisition information, BEX must treat those units as acquired as of the date and time of the transfer (August 1, Year 3). Accordingly, the 10 units sold must be attributed to 10 of the 20 DE units purchased by TP on January 1, Year 2, in the BEX account because based on the information known to BEX these units were purchased prior to the date (August 1, Year 3) when TP transferred the other units purchased at CRX into the account. The DE units are digital assets that were acquired on or after January 1, 2026, for TP by a broker (BEX) providing custodial services, and, thus, constitute covered securities under paragraph (a)(15)(i)(J) of this section. Accordingly, in addition to the gross proceeds and other information required to be reported under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section, BEX must also report the adjusted basis of the DE units sold, the date the DE units were purchased, and whether any gain or loss with respect to the DE units sold is long-term or short-term as required by paragraph (d)(2)(i)(D) of this section. Finally, because TP did not give BEX customer-provided acquisition information, TP will be required to treat different units as sold under the rules provided by § 1.1012-1(j)(3) from those units that BEX treats as sold under this section unless TP adopts a standing order to follow the ordering rule result required by BEX.

§ 1.1012-1(j)(5)(iv) (

Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(2)(vii)(C)(
1
) of this section (the facts in
Example 3
), except on September 1, Year 3, TP's agent (CRX) provides BEX with purchase confirmations showing that the 10 units TP transferred into TP's account at BEX were purchased on August 1, Year 1. BEX neither knows nor has reason to know that the information supplied by CRX is incorrect and chooses to take this information into account for purposes of identifying which of the TP's units are sold, disposed of, or transferred.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Because TP did not make an adequate identification of the units to be sold in a sale of DE units that was less than TP's entire position in digital asset DE, BEX must treat the units of digital asset DE sold as the earliest units of digital asset DE acquired by TP. The purchase confirmations (showing a purchase date of August 1, Year 1) for the 10 units that were transferred into TP's account at BEX constitute customer-provided acquisition information under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
4
) of this section, which BEX is permitted, but not required, to take into account. Accordingly, BEX is permitted to treat the 10 units sold by TP as the 10 DE units TP purchased on August 1, Year 1 (and transferred into BEX's account on August 1, Year 3), because these were the earliest units of digital asset DE acquired by TP. The DE units are digital assets that were acquired on or after January 1, 2026, for TP by a broker (CRX) providing custodial services, and, thus, constitute covered securities under paragraph (a)(15)(i)(J) of this section. However, because these covered securities were not acquired and thereafter held by the selling broker (BEX), BEX is not required to report the acquisition information required by paragraph (d)(2)(i)(D) of this section. Finally, because TP provided the purchase information with respect to the transferred in units to BEX, the units determined as sold by BEX are the same units that TP must treat as sold under § 1.1012-1(j)(3)(i).
See
§ 1.1012-1(j)(5)(iv) (
Example 4
).
(3)
Sales between interest payment dates.
For each sale of a debt instrument prior to maturity with respect to which a broker is required to make a return of information under this section, a broker must show separately on Form 1099 the amount of accrued and unpaid qualified stated interest as of the sale date that must be reported by the customer as interest income under
§ 1.61-7(d).
See
§ 1.1273-1(c) for the definition of qualified stated interest. Such interest information must be shown in the manner and at the time required by Form 1099 and section 6049.
(4)
Sale date
—(i)
In general.
For sales of property that are reportable under this section other than digital assets, a broker must report a sale as occurring on the date the sale is entered on the books of the broker.
(ii)
Special rules for digital asset sales.
For sales of digital assets that are effected when digitally recorded using cryptographically secured distributed ledger technology, such as a blockchain or similar technology, the broker must report the date of sale as the date when the transactions are recorded on the ledger. For sales of digital assets that are effected by a broker and recorded in the broker's books and records (commonly referred to as an
off-chain
transaction) and not directly on a distributed ledger or similar technology, the broker must report the date of sale as the date when the transactions are recorded on its books and records without regard to the date that the transactions may be later recorded on the distributed ledger or similar technology.
(5)
Gross proceeds
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section with respect to digital asset sales, for purposes of this section,
gross proceeds
on a sale are the total amount paid to the customer or credited to the customer's account as a result of the sale reduced by the amount of any qualified stated interest reported under paragraph (d)(3) of this section and increased by any amount not paid or credited by reason of repayment of margin loans. In the case of a closing transaction (other than a closing transaction related to an option) that results in a loss, gross proceeds are the amount debited from the customer's account. For sales before January 1, 2014, a broker may, but is not required to, reduce gross proceeds by the amount of commissions and transfer taxes, provided the treatment chosen is consistent with the books of the broker. For sales on or after January 1, 2014, a broker must reduce gross proceeds by the amount of commissions and transfer taxes related to the sale of the security. For securities sold pursuant to the exercise of an option granted or acquired before January 1, 2014, a broker may, but is not required to, take the option premiums into account in determining the gross proceeds of the securities sold, provided the treatment chosen is consistent with the books of the broker. For securities sold pursuant to the exercise of an option granted or acquired on or after January 1, 2014, or for the treatment of an option granted or acquired on or after January 1, 2014,
see
paragraph (m) of this section. A broker must report the gross proceeds of identical stock (within the meaning of § 1.1012-1(e)(4)) by averaging the proceeds of each share if the stock is sold at separate times on the same calendar day in executing a single trade order and the broker executing the trade provides a single confirmation to the customer that reports an aggregate total price or an average price per share. However, a broker may not average the proceeds if the customer notifies the broker in writing of an intent to determine the proceeds of the stock by the actual proceeds per share and the broker receives the notification by January 15 of the calendar year following the year of the sale. A broker may extend the January 15 deadline but not beyond the due date for filing the return required under this section.
(ii)
Sales of digital assets.
The rules contained in paragraphs (d)(5)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section apply solely for purposes of this section.
(A)
Determining gross proceeds.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, gross proceeds from the sale of a digital asset are equal to the sum of the total cash paid to the customer or credited to the customer's account from the sale plus the fair market value of any property or services received (including services giving rise to digital asset transaction costs), reduced by the amount of digital asset transaction costs, as defined and allocated under paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section. In the case of a debt instrument issued in exchange for the digital asset and subject to § 1.1001-1(g), the amount realized attributable to the debt instrument is determined under
§ 1.1001-7(b)(1)(iv) rather than by reference to the fair market value of the debt instrument.
See
paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(C) of this section for a special rule setting forth how cascading digital asset transaction costs are to be allocated in certain exchanges of one digital asset for a different digital asset.
(
1
)
Determining fair market value.
Fair market value is measured at the date and time the transaction was effected. Except as provided in the next sentence, in determining the fair market value of services or property received or credited in exchange for a digital asset, the broker must use a reasonable valuation method that looks to contemporaneous evidence of value, such as the purchase price of the services, goods or other property, the exchange rate, and the U.S. dollar valuation applied by the broker to effect the exchange. In determining the fair market value of services giving rise to digital asset transaction costs, the broker must look to the fair market value of the digital assets used to pay for such transaction costs. In determining the fair market value of a digital asset, the broker may perform its own valuations or rely on valuations performed by a digital asset data aggregator as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, provided such valuations apply a reasonable valuation method for digital assets as described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(
3
) of this section.
(
2
)
Consideration value not readily ascertainable.
When valuing services or property (including digital assets) received in exchange for a digital asset, the value of what is received should ordinarily be identical to the value of the digital asset exchanged. If there is a disparity between the value of services or property received and the value of the digital asset exchanged, the gross proceeds received by the customer is the fair market value at the date and time the transaction was effected of the services or property, including digital assets, received. If the broker or digital asset data aggregator, in the case of digital assets, reasonably determines that the fair market value of the services or property received cannot be determined with reasonable accuracy, the fair market value of the received services or property must be determined by reference to the fair market value of the transferred digital asset at the time of the exchange.
See
§ 1.1001-7(b)(4). If the broker or digital asset data aggregator, in the case of a digital asset, reasonably determines that neither the value of the received services or property nor the value of the transferred digital asset can be determined with reasonable accuracy, the broker must report that the received services or property has an undeterminable value.
(
3
)
Reasonable valuation method for digital assets.
A reasonable valuation method for digital assets is a method that considers and appropriately weighs the pricing, trading volumes, market capitalization and other factors relevant to the valuation of digital assets traded through digital asset trading platforms. A valuation method is not a reasonable valuation method for digital assets if it, for example, gives an underweight effect to exchange prices lying near the median price value, an overweight effect to digital asset trading platforms having low trading volume, or otherwise inappropriately weighs factors associated with a price that would make that price an unreliable indicator of value.
(B)
Digital asset data aggregator.
A digital asset data aggregator is an information service provider that provides valuations of digital assets based on any reasonable valuation method.
(iii)
Digital asset transactions effected by processors of digital asset payments.
The amount of gross proceeds under paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section received by a party who sells a digital asset under paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D) of this section (effected by a processor of digital asset payments) is equal to: the sum of the amount paid in cash, and the fair market value of the amount paid in digital assets by that processor to a second party, plus any digital asset transaction costs and other fees charged to the second party that are withheld (whether withheld from the digital assets transferred by the first party or withheld from the amount due to the second party); and reduced by the amount of digital asset transaction costs paid by or withheld from the first party, as defined and allocated under
the rules of paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section.
(iv)
Definition and allocation of digital asset transaction costs
—(A)
Definition.
The term
digital asset transaction costs
means the amount paid in cash or property (including digital assets) to effect the sale, disposition, or acquisition of a digital asset. Digital asset transaction costs include transaction fees, transfer taxes, and commissions.
(B)
General allocation rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(C) of this section, in the case of a sale or disposition of digital assets, the total digital asset transaction costs paid by the customer are allocable to the sale or disposition of the digital assets.
(C)
Special rule for allocation of certain cascading digital asset transaction costs.
In the case of a sale of one digital asset in exchange for another digital asset differing materially in kind or in extent (original transaction) and for which digital assets received in the original transaction are withheld to pay digital asset transaction costs, the total digital asset transaction costs paid by the taxpayer to effect both the original transaction and the disposition of the withheld digital assets are allocable exclusively to the disposition of digital assets in the original transaction.
(v)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (d)(5). Unless otherwise indicated, all events and transactions in the following examples occur on or after January 1, 2025.
(A)
Example 1: Determination of gross proceeds when digital asset transaction costs paid in digital assets
—(

)
Facts.
CRX, a digital asset broker, buys, sells, and exchanges various digital assets for cash or different digital assets on behalf of its customers. For this service, CRX charges a transaction fee equal to 1 unit of CRX's proprietary digital asset CM per transaction. Using the services of CRX, customer K, an individual not otherwise exempt from reporting, purchases 15 units of CM and 10 units of digital asset DE. On April 28, Year 1, when the CM units have a value of $2 per unit, the DE units have a value of $8 per unit, and digital asset ST units have a value of $0.80 per unit, K instructs CRX to exchange K's 10 units of DE for 100 units of digital asset ST. CRX charges K one unit of CM as a transaction fee for the exchange.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, K has digital asset transaction costs of $2, which is the value of 1 CM unit. Under paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, the gross proceeds amount that CRX must report from K's sale of the 10 units of DE is equal to the fair market value of the 100 units of ST that K received (less the value of the CM unit sold to pay the digital asset transaction cost to CRX and allocable to the sale of the DE units). The fair market value of the 100 units of ST at the date and time the transaction was effected is equal to $80 (the product of $0.80 and 100 units). Accordingly, CRX must report gross proceeds of $78 from K's sale of the 10 units of DE. CRX must also report the gross proceeds from K's sale of one CM unit to pay for CRX's services. Under paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, the gross proceeds from K's sale of one unit of CM is equal to the fair market value of the digital assets used to pay for such transaction costs. Accordingly, CRX must report $2 as gross proceeds from K's sale of one unit of CM.

Example 2: Determination of gross proceeds when digital asset transaction costs are withheld from transferred digital assets
—(

)
Facts.
K owns a total of 10 units of digital asset A that K deposits with broker BEX that provides custodial services for digital assets. K directs BEX to effect the exchange of 10 units of K's digital asset A for 20 units of digital asset B. At the time of the exchange, each unit of digital asset A has a fair market value of $2 and each unit of digital asset B has a fair market value of $1. BEX charges a fee of $2 per transaction, which BEX withholds from the units of the digital asset A transferred. At the time of the transaction, BEX withholds 1 unit of digital asset A. TP exchanges the remaining 9 units of digital asset A for 18 units of digital asset B.
(
2
)
Analysis.
The withholding of 1 unit of digital asset A is a sale of a digital asset for BEX's services within the meaning of paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(C) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, K has digital asset transaction costs of $2. Under
paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(C) of this section, TP must allocate such costs to the disposition of the 10 units of digital asset A. Under paragraphs (d)(5)(ii)(A) and (d)(5)(iv)(C) of this section, TP's gross proceeds from the sale of the 10 units of digital asset A is $18, which is the excess of the fair market value of the 18 units of digital asset B received ($18) and the fair market value of the broker services received ($2) as of the date and time of the transaction over the allocated digital asset transaction costs ($2). Accordingly, BEX must report $18 as gross proceeds from K's sale of 10 units of digital asset A.

)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B)(
1
) of this section (the facts in
Example 2
), except that BEX requires its payment be withheld from the units of the digital asset acquired. At the time of the transaction, BEX withholds 3 units of digital asset B, two units of which effect the exchange of digital asset A for digital asset B and one unit of which effects the disposition of digital asset B for payment of the transaction fees.
(
2
)
Analysis.
The withholding of 3 units of digital asset B is a disposition of digital assets for BEX's services within the meaning of paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(C) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, K has digital asset transaction costs of $3. Under paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(C) of this section, K must allocate such costs to the disposition of the 10 units of digital asset A. Under paragraphs (d)(5)(ii)(A) and (d)(5)(iv)(C) of this section, K's gross proceeds from the sale of the 10 units of digital asset A is $17, which is the excess of the fair market value of the 20 units of digital asset B received ($20) as of the date and time of the transaction over the allocated digital asset transaction costs ($3). K's gross proceeds from the sale of the 3 units of digital asset B used to pay digital asset transaction costs is $3, which is the fair market value of BEX's services received at the time of the transaction. Accordingly, BEX must report $17 as gross proceeds from K's sale of 10 units of digital asset A. Additionally, pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, BEX is not required to report K's sale of the 3 withheld units of digital asset B because the 3 units of digital asset B were units withheld from digital assets received by K to pay for K's digital asset transaction costs.

Example 4: Determination of gross proceeds

Facts.
CPP, a processor of digital asset payments, offers debit cards to its customers who hold digital asset FE in their accounts with CPP. The debit cards allow CPP's customers to use digital assets held in accounts with CPP to make payments to merchants who do not accept digital assets. CPP charges its card holders a 2% transaction fee for purchases made using the debit card and sets forth in its terms and conditions the process CPP will use to determine the exchange rate provided at the date and time of its customers' transactions. CPP has issued a debit card to B, an individual not otherwise exempt from reporting, who wants to make purchases using digital assets. B transfers 1,000 units of FE into B's account with CPP. B then uses the debit card to purchase merchandise from a U.S. merchant STR for $1,000. An exchange rate of 1 FE = $2 USD is applied to effect the transaction, based on the exchange rate at that date and time and pursuant to B's account agreement. To settle the transaction, CPP removes 510 units of FE from B's account equal to $1,020 ($1,000 plus a 2% transaction fee equal to $20). CPP then pays STR $1,000 in cash.
(

)
Analysis.
B paid $20 of digital asset transaction costs as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section, the gross proceeds amount that CPP must report with respect to B's sale of the 510 units of FE to purchase the merchandise is $1,000, which is the sum of the amount of cash paid by CPP to STR plus the $20 digital asset transaction costs withheld by CPP, reduced by the $20 digital asset transaction costs as allocated under paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(B) of this section. CPP's payment of cash to STR is also a payment card transaction under § 1.6050W-1(b) subject to reporting under § 1.6050W-1(a).

Example 5: Determination of gross proceeds
—(

)
Facts.
STR, a U.S. merchant corporation, advertises that it accepts digital asset FE as payment for its merchandise that is not digital assets. Customers making purchases at STR using digital asset FE are directed to create an account with CXX, a processor of digital asset payments, which, pursuant to a preexisting agreement with STR, accepts digital asset FE in return for payments in cash made to STR. CXX charges a 2% transaction fee, which is paid by STR and not STR's customers. S, an individual not otherwise exempt from reporting, seeks to purchase merchandise from STR for $10,000. To effect payment, S is directed by STR to CXX, with whom S has an account. An exchange rate of 1 FE = $2 USD is applied to effect the purchase transaction. Pursuant to this exchange rate, S then transfers 5,000 units of FE to CXX, which, in turn, pays STR $9,800 ($10,000 less a 2% transaction fee equal to $200).

Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section, the gross proceeds amount that CXX must report with respect to this sale is $10,000, which is the sum of the amount in U.S. dollars paid by CPP to STR ($9,800) plus the $200 digital asset transaction costs withheld from the payment due to STR. Because S does not have any digital asset transaction costs, the $9,800 amount is not reduced by any digital asset transaction costs charged to STR because that fee was not paid by S. In addition, CXX's payment of cash to STR (plus the withheld transaction fee) may be reportable under § 1.6050W-1(a) as a third party network transaction under § 1.6050W-1(c) if CXX is a third party settlement organization under the definition in § 1.6050W-1(c)(2).

Example 6: Determination of gross proceeds in a real estate transaction
—(

)
Facts.
J, an unmarried individual not otherwise exempt from reporting, enters into a contractual agreement with B, an individual not otherwise exempt from reporting, to exchange J's principal residence, Blackacre, which has a fair market value of $300,000, for cash in the amount of $75,000 and units of digital asset DE with a value of $225,000. Prior to closing, B transfers the digital asset portion of the payment directly from B's wallet to J's wallet. At closing, J certifies to the closing agent (CA) that J received the DE units required to be paid under the contractual agreement. CA is also a real estate reporting person under § 1.6045-4, and a digital asset middleman under paragraph (a)(21) of this section with respect to the transaction.
(
2
)
Analysis.
CA is required to report on Form 1099-DA the gross proceeds received by B in exchange for B's sale of digital assets in this transaction. The gross proceeds amount to be reported under paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A) of this section is equal to $225,000, which is the $300,000 value of Blackacre less $75,000 that B paid in cash. In addition, under § 1.6045-4, CA is required to report on Form 1099-S the $300,000 of gross proceeds received by J ($75,000 cash and $225,000 in digital assets) as consideration for J's disposition of Blackacre.

Adjusted basis
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the adjusted basis of a specified security is determined from the initial basis under paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section as of the date the specified security is acquired in an account, increased by the commissions and transfer taxes related to its sale to the extent not accounted for in gross proceeds as described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. A broker is not required to consider transactions or events occurring outside the account except for an organizational action taken by an issuer of a specified security other than a digital asset during the period the broker holds custody of the security (beginning with the date that the broker receives a transferred security) reported on an issuer statement (as described in § 1.6045B-1) furnished or deemed furnished to the broker. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (n) of this section, a broker is not required to consider customer elections. For rules related to the adjusted basis of a debt instrument,
see
paragraph (n) of this section.
(ii)
Initial basis
—(A)
Cost basis for specified securities acquired for cash.
For a specified security acquired for cash, the initial basis generally is the total amount of cash paid by the customer
or credited against the customer's account for the specified security, increased by the commissions, transfer taxes, and digital asset transaction costs related to its acquisition. A broker may, but is not required to, take option premiums into account in determining the initial basis of securities purchased or acquired pursuant to the exercise of an option granted or acquired before January 1, 2014. For rules related to options granted or acquired on or after January 1, 2014,
see
paragraph (m) of this section. A broker may, but is not required to, increase initial basis for income recognized upon the exercise of a compensatory option or the vesting or exercise of other equity-based compensation arrangements, granted or acquired before January 1, 2014. A broker may not increase initial basis for income recognized upon the exercise of a compensatory option or the vesting or exercise of other equity-based compensation arrangements, granted or acquired on or after January 1, 2014, or upon the vesting or exercise of a digital asset-based compensation arrangement granted or acquired on or after January 1, 2025. A broker must report the basis of identical stock (within the meaning of § 1.1012-1(e)(4)) by averaging the basis of each share if the stock is purchased at separate times on the same calendar day in executing a single trade order and the broker executing the trade provides a single confirmation to the customer that reports an aggregate total price or an average price per share. However, a broker may not average the basis if the customer timely notifies the broker in writing of an intent to determine the basis of the stock by the actual cost per share in accordance with § 1.1012-1(c)(1)(ii).
(B)
Basis of transferred securities
—(
1
)
In general.
The initial basis of a security transferred to an account is generally the basis reported on the transfer statement (as described in § 1.6045A-1).
(
2
)
Securities acquired by gift.
If a transfer statement indicates that the security is acquired as a gift, a broker must apply the relevant basis rules for property acquired by gift in determining the initial basis, but is not required to adjust basis for gift tax. A broker must treat the initial basis as equal to the gross proceeds from the sale determined under paragraph (d)(5) of this section if the relevant basis rules for property acquired by gift prevent recognizing both gain and loss, or if the relevant basis rules treat the initial basis of the security as its fair market value as of the date of the gift and the broker neither knows nor can readily ascertain this value. If the transfer statement did not report a date for the gift, the broker must treat the settlement date for the transfer as the date of the gift.
(C)
Digital assets acquired in exchange for property
—(
1
)
In general.
This paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) applies solely for purposes of this section. For a digital asset acquired in exchange for property that is not a debt instrument described in § 1.1012-1(h)(1)(v) or another digital asset differing materially in kind or extent, the initial basis of the digital asset is the fair market value of the digital asset received at the time of the exchange, increased by any digital asset transaction costs allocable to the acquisition of the digital asset. The fair market value of the digital asset received must be determined using a reasonable valuation method as of the date and time the exchange transaction was effected. In valuing the digital asset received, the broker may perform its own valuations or rely on valuations performed by a digital asset data aggregator as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, provided such valuations apply a reasonable valuation method for digital assets as described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)(
3
) of this section. If the broker or digital asset data aggregator reasonably determines that the fair market value of the digital asset received cannot be determined with reasonable accuracy, the fair market value of the digital asset received must be determined by reference to the property transferred at the time of the exchange. If the broker or digital asset data aggregator reasonably determines that neither the value of the digital asset received nor the value of the property transferred can be determined with reasonable accuracy, the fair market value of the received digital asset must be treated as zero. For a digital
asset acquired in exchange for another digital asset differing materially in kind or extent,
see
paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section. For a digital asset acquired in exchange for a debt instrument described in § 1.1012-1(h)(1)(v), the initial basis of the digital asset attributable to the debt instrument is the amount determined under § 1.1012-1(h)(1)(v).
(
2
)
Allocation of digital asset transaction costs.
Except as provided in the following sentence, in the case of a sale of one digital asset in exchange for another digital asset differing materially in kind or extent, the total digital asset transaction costs paid by the customer are allocable to the digital assets disposed. In the case of a transaction described in paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(C) of this section, the digital asset transaction costs paid by the customer to acquire the digital assets received are allocable as provided therein.
(iii)
Adjustments for wash sales
—(A)
Securities in the same account or wallet
—(
1
)
In general.
A broker must apply the wash sale rules under section 1091 if both the sale and purchase transactions are of covered securities, other than covered securities reportable as digital assets after the application of paragraph (c)(8) of this section, with the same CUSIP number or other security identifier number that the Secretary may designate by publication in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). When reporting the sale transaction that triggered the wash sale, the broker must report the amount of loss that is disallowed by section 1091 in addition to gross proceeds and adjusted basis. The broker must increase the basis of the purchased covered security by the amount of loss disallowed on the sale transaction.
(
2
)
Special rules for covered securities that are also digital assets.
In the case of a purchase or sale of a tokenized security described in paragraph (c)(8)(i)(D) of this section that is a stock or security for purposes of section 1091, a broker must apply the wash sale rules under section 1091 if both the sale and purchase transactions are of covered securities with the same CUSIP number or other security identifier number that the Secretary may designate by publication in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). When reporting the sale transaction that triggered the wash sale, the broker must report the amount of loss that is disallowed by section 1091 in addition to gross proceeds and adjusted basis. The broker must increase the basis of the purchased covered security by the amount of loss disallowed on the sale transaction.
(B)
Covered securities in different accounts or wallets.
A broker is not required to apply paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(A) of this section if the covered securities are purchased and sold from different accounts or wallets, if the purchased covered security is transferred to another account or wallet before the wash sale, or if the covered securities are treated as held in separate accounts under § 1.1012-1(e). A covered security is not purchased in an account or wallet if it is purchased in another account or wallet and transferred into the account or wallet.
(C)
Effect of election under section 475(f)(1).
A broker is not required to apply paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(A) of this section to securities in an account if a customer has in writing both informed the broker that the customer has made a valid and timely election under section 475(f)(1) and identified the account as solely containing securities subject to the election. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(C), a writing may be in electronic format. If a customer subsequently informs a broker that the election no longer applies to the customer or the account, the broker must prospectively apply paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(A) of this section but is not required to apply paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(A) of this section for the period covered by the customer's prior instruction to the broker. A taxpayer that is not a trader in securities within the meaning of section 475(f)(1) does not become a trader in securities, or create an inference that it is a trader in securities, by notifying a broker that it has made a valid and timely election under section 475(f)(1).
(D)
Reporting at or near the time of sale.
If a wash sale occurs after a
broker has completed a return or statement reporting a sale of a covered security, the broker must redetermine adjusted basis under this paragraph (d)(6)(iii) and, if the return or statement included information inconsistent with this redetermination, correct the return or statement by the applicable original due date set forth in this section for the return or statement.
(iv)
Certain adjustments not taken into account.
A broker is not required to apply section 1259 (regarding constructive sales), section 475 (regarding the mark-to-market method of accounting), section 1296 (regarding the mark-to-market method of accounting for marketable stock in a passive foreign investment company), or section 1092 (regarding straddles) when reporting adjusted basis.
(v)
Average basis method adjustments.
For a covered security for which basis may be determined by the average basis method, a broker must compute basis using the average basis method if a customer validly elects that method for the covered securities sold or, in the absence of any instruction from the customer, if the broker chooses that method as its default basis determination method.
See
§ 1.1012-1(e). The previous sentence applies to any stock that is also a tokenized security described in paragraph (c)(8)(i)(D) of this section.
(vi)
Regulated investment company and real estate investment trust adjustments.
A broker must adjust the basis of a covered security issued by a regulated investment company or real estate investment trust for the effects of undistributed capital gains reported to or by the broker under section 852(b)(3)(D) or section 857(b)(3)(D).
(vii)
Treatment of de minimis errors.
For purposes of this section, a customer's adjusted basis generally must be determined by treating any incorrect dollar amount that is not required to be corrected by reason of section 6721(c)(3) or 6722(c)(3) as the correct amount. However, if a broker, upon identifying a dollar amount as incorrect, voluntarily or is required to file a corrected information return and furnish the corresponding corrected payee statement showing the correct dollar amount, then regardless of any provision under section 6721 or 6722, the adjusted basis for purposes of this section must be based on and consistent with the correct dollar amount as reported on the corrected information return and corrected payee statement.
(viii)
Examples.
The following examples, in which all the securities are covered securities, illustrate the rules of this paragraph (d)(6):
(A)
Example 1.
—
1
) On September 21, 2012, P purchases 100 shares of stock in an account with J, a broker. On December 14, 2012, P purchases 100 shares of stock with the same CUSIP number in the same account. On January 4, 2013, P sells the 100 shares purchased on September 21, 2012, at a loss.
(
2
) Because the sale of stock on January 4, 2013, and the purchase of stock on December 14, 2012, are of covered securities with the same CUSIP number, under paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(A) of this section, J must report the amount of loss disallowed by section 1091 in addition to the gross proceeds of the sale and the adjusted basis of the September 21, 2012, stock.
(
3
) P later sells the stock acquired on December 14, 2012. When reporting the sale of the stock, under paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(A) of this section, J must increase the adjusted basis of the stock acquired on December 14, 2012, by the amount of loss disallowed on the January 4, 2013, sale.
(B)
Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (d)(6)(viii)(A)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1
) except that the December 14, 2012, purchase occurs in another account P maintains with J. Because the December 14, 2012, purchase does not occur in the same account as the sale of the September 21, 2012, stock, under paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(B) of this section, J is not required to apply the wash sale rules in reporting the sale of stock acquired on September 21, 2012, or December 14, 2012. Under paragraphs (d)(2)(iii) and (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, J may choose to apply the wash sale rules as if the transactions occurred in the same account. The result is the same whether P keeps the stock purchased on December 14, 2012, in the other account or transfers the stock into the account from which P sells the stock sold on January 4, 2013.
(C)
Example 3.
—(
1
) K, a regulated investment company, offers two funds for sale, Fund D and Fund E. On April 22, 2012, Q purchases shares of Fund D and pays a separate load charge. By paying the load charge, Q acquires a reinvestment right in shares of Fund E. On April 23, 2012, at the request of Q, Fund D redeems the shares. Q uses the proceeds to purchase shares of Fund E in a separate account. As a result of the reinvestment right, Q pays no load charge in purchasing the Fund E shares.(
2
) Under paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, when reporting adjusted basis of the Fund D and Fund E shares at the time of their redemption, K is not required to adjust basis for any deferral of the load charge under section 852(f), because the transactions concerning Fund D and Fund E occur in separate accounts. Under paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, K may choose to apply the provisions of section 852(f).
(D)
Example 4.
R, an employee of C, a corporation, participates in C's stock option plan. On April 2, 2014, C grants R a nonstatutory option under the plan to buy 100 shares of stock. The option becomes substantially vested on April 2, 2015. On October 2, 2015, R exercises the option and purchases 100 shares. On December 2, 2015, R sells the 100 shares. Under paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(A) of this section, C is required to determine adjusted basis from the amount R pays under the terms of the option. Under paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(A) of this section, C is not permitted to adjust basis for any amount R must include as wage income with respect to the October 2, 2015, stock purchase.
(ix)
Applicability date.
Paragraph (d)(6)(vii) of this section applies with respect to information returns required to be filed and payee statements required to be furnished on or after January 1, 2024.
(x)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (d)(5) of this section and this paragraph (d)(6) as applied to digital assets. Unless otherwise indicated, all events and transactions in the following examples occur using the services of CRX, an entity that owns and operates a digital asset trading platform and provides digital asset broker and hosted wallet services. In performing these services, CRX holds and records all customer purchase and sale transactions using CRX's centralized omnibus account. CRX does not record any of its customer's purchase or sale transactions on the relevant cryptographically secured distributed ledgers. Additionally, unless otherwise indicated, all events and transactions in the following examples occur on or after January 1, 2026.
(A)
Example 1: Determination of gross proceeds and basis in digital assets
—(
1
)
Facts.
As a digital asset broker, CRX generally charges transaction fees equal to 1 unit of CRX's proprietary digital asset CM per transaction. CRX does not, however, charge transaction fees for the purchase of CM. On March 9, Year 1, K, an individual not otherwise exempt from reporting, purchases 20 units of CM for $20 in cash in K's account at CRX. A week later, on March 16, Year 1, K uses CRX's services to purchase 10 units of digital asset DE for $80 in cash. To pay for CRX's transaction fee, K directs CRX to debit 1 unit of CM (worth $1 at the time of transfer) from K's account.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section, CRX must report the gross proceeds from K's sale of 1 unit of CM. Additionally, because the units of CM were purchased in K's account at a broker providing custodial services for digital assets that are specified securities described in paragraph (a)(14)(v) of this section, the units of CM purchased by K are covered securities under paragraph (a)(15)(i)(J) of this section. Accordingly, under paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(D)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section, CRX must report K's adjusted basis in the 1 unit of CM and whether any gain or loss with respect to the CM unit sold is long-term or short-term. The gross proceeds from that sale is equal to the fair market value of the CM units on March 16, Year 1 ($1), and the adjusted basis of that unit is equal to the amount K paid in cash for the CM unit on March 9, Year 1 ($1). This reporting is required regardless of the fact that there is $0 of gain or loss associated with this sale. Additionally, K's adjusted basis in the 10 units of DE acquired is equal to the $81 initial basis in DE, which is $80 plus the $1 value of
1 unit of CM paid as a digital asset transaction cost for the purchase of the DE units.
(B)
Example 2: Determination of gross proceeds and basis in digital assets
—(

)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(6)(x)(A)(
1
) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that on June 12, Year 2, K instructs CRX to exchange K's 10 units of DE for 50 units of digital asset ST. CRX effects this exchange using its own omnibus account holdings of ST at an exchange rate of 1 DE = 5 ST. The total value of the 50 units of ST received by K is $100. K directs CRX to debit 1 CM unit (worth $2 at the time of the transfer) from K's account to pay CRX for the transaction fee.
(
2
)
Analysis.
K has digital asset transaction costs of $2 as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, which is the value of 1 unit of CM. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section, CRX must report the gross proceeds from K's exchange of DE for ST (as a sale of K's 10 units of DE) and the gross proceeds from K's disposition of 1 unit of CM for CRX's services. Additionally, because the units of DE and CM were purchased in K's account at a broker providing custodial services for digital assets that are specified securities described in paragraph (a)(14)(v) of this section, the units of DE and CM are covered securities under paragraph (a)(15)(i)(J) of this section, and, pursuant to paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(D)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section, CRX must report K's adjusted basis in the 10 units of DE and 1 unit of CM and whether any gain or loss with respect to the those units is long-term or short-term. Under paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, the gross proceeds from K's sale of the DE units is $98 (the fair market value of the 50 units of ST that K received less the $2 digital asset transaction costs paid by K using 1 unit of CM), that is allocable to the sale of the DE units. Under this paragraph (d)(6), K's adjusted basis in the 10 units of DE is $81 (which is $80 plus the $1 value of 1 unit of CM paid as a digital asset transaction cost for the purchase of the DE units), resulting in a long-term capital gain to K of $17 ($98-$81). The gross proceeds from K's sale of the single unit of CM is $2, and K's adjusted basis in the single unit of CM is $1, resulting in a long-term capital gain to K of $1 ($2-$1). K's adjusted basis in the ST units under paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) of this section is equal to the initial basis in ST, which is $100.
(C)
Example 3: Determination of gross proceeds and basis when digital asset transaction costs are withheld from transferred digital assets
—(
1
)
Facts.
K has an account with digital asset broker BEX. On December 20, Year 1, K acquired 10 units of digital asset A, for $2 per unit, and 100 units of digital asset B, for $0.50 per unit. (Assume that K did not incur any digital asset transaction costs on the units acquired on December 20, Year 1.) On July 20, Year 2, K directs BEX to effect the exchange of 10 units of digital asset A for 50 units of digital asset B. At the time of the exchange, each unit of digital asset A has a fair market value of $5 per unit and each unit of digital asset B has a fair market value of $1 per unit. For the exchange of 10 units of digital asset A for 50 units of digital asset B, BEX charges K a transaction fee equal to 2 units of digital asset B, which BEX withholds from the units of the digital asset B credited to K's account on July 20, Year 2. For the disposition of 2 units of digital asset B withheld, BEX charges an additional transaction fee equal to 1 unit of digital asset B, which BEX also withholds from the units of digital asset B credited to K's account on July 20, Year 2. K has a standing order with BEX for the specific identification of digital assets as from the earliest units acquired.
(
2
)
Reporting with respect to the disposition of the A units.
The withholding of 3 units of digital asset B is a disposition of digital assets for BEX's services within the meaning of paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(C) of this section. Under paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, K has digital asset transaction costs of $3. Under paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(C) of this section, the exchange of 10 units of digital asset A for 50 units of digital asset B is the original transaction. Accordingly, BEX must allocate the digital asset transaction costs of $3 exclusively to the disposition of the 10 units of digital asset A. Additionally, because the units of A are specified securities described in paragraph (a)(14)(v)
of this section and were purchased in K's account at BEX by a broker providing custodial services for such specified securities, the units of A are covered securities under paragraph (a)(15)(i)(J) of this section, and BEX must report K's adjusted basis in the 10 units of A. Under paragraphs (d)(5)(ii)(A) and (d)(5)(iv)(C) of this section, K's gross proceeds from the sale of the 10 units of digital asset A is $47, which is the excess of the fair market value of the 50 units of digital asset B received ($50) as of the date and time of the transaction over the allocated digital asset transaction costs ($3). Under this paragraph (d)(6), K's adjusted basis in the 10 units of A is $20, resulting in a short-term capital gain to K of $27 ($47-$20).
(
3
)
Reporting with respect to the disposition of the withheld B units.
K's gross proceeds from the sale of the 3 units of digital asset B used to pay digital asset transaction costs is $3, which is the fair market value of the digital assets used to pay for such transaction costs. Pursuant to the special rule for the identification of units withheld from digital assets received in a transaction to pay a customer's digital asset transaction costs under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
3
) of this section and regardless of K's standing order, the withheld units sold are treated as from the units received in the original (A for B) transaction. Accordingly, the basis of the 3 withheld units of digital asset B is $3, which is the fair market value of the 3 units of digital asset B received. Finally, pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, BEX is not required to report K's sale of the 3 withheld units of digital asset B because the 3 units of digital asset B were units withheld from digital assets received by K to pay for K's digital asset transaction costs.
(D)
Example 4: Determination of gross proceeds and basis for digital assets
—(
1
)
Facts.
On August 26, Year 1, Customer P purchases 10 units of digital asset DE for $2 per unit in cash in an account at CRX. CRX charges P a fixed transaction fee of $5 in cash for the exchange. On October 26, Year 2, P directs CRX to exchange P's 10 units of DE for units of digital asset FG. At the time of the exchange, CRX determines that each unit of DE has a fair market value of $100 and each unit of FG has a fair market value of $50. As a result of this determination, CRX effects an exchange of P's 10 units of DE for 20 units of FG. CRX charges P a fixed transaction fee of $20 in cash for the exchange.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(B) of this section, P has digital asset transaction costs of $20 associated with the exchange of DE for FG which must be allocated to the sale of the DE units. For the transaction that took place on October 26, Year 2, under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section, CRX must report the amount of gross proceeds from the sale of DE in the amount of $980 (the $1,000 fair market value of FG received on the date and time of transfer, less all of the digital asset transaction costs of $20 allocated to the sale). Under paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) of this section, the adjusted basis of P's DE units is equal to $25, which is the $20 paid in cash for the 10 units increased by the $5 digital asset transaction costs allocable to that purchase. Finally, P's adjusted basis in the 20 units of FG is equal to the fair market value of the FG received, $1,000, because none of the $20 transaction fee may be allocated under paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section to the acquisition of P's FG units.
(7)
Long-term or short-term gain or loss
—(i)
In general.
In determining whether any gain or loss on the sale of a covered security is long-term or short-term within the meaning of section 1222 for purposes of this section, the following rules apply:
(A) A broker must consider the information reported on a transfer statement (as described in § 1.6045A-1).
(B) A broker is not required to consider transactions, elections, or events occurring outside the account except for an organizational action taken by an issuer during the period the broker holds custody of the covered security (beginning with the date that the broker receives a transferred security) reported on an issuer statement (as described in § 1.6045B-1) furnished or deemed furnished to the broker.
(C) A broker is required to apply the relevant rules for property acquired
from a decedent or by gift for all covered securities.
(ii)
Adjustments for wash sales
—(A)
Securities in the same account or wallet
—(
1
)
In general.
A broker must apply the wash sale rules under section 1091 if both the sale and purchase transactions are of covered securities, other than covered securities reportable as digital assets after the application of paragraph (c)(8) of this section, with the same CUSIP number or other security identifier number that the Secretary may designate by publication in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(
2
)
Special rules for covered securities that are also digital assets.
In the case of a purchase or sale of a tokenized security described in paragraph (c)(8)(i)(D) of this section that is a stock or security for purposes of section 1091, a broker must apply the wash sale rules under section 1091 if both the sale and purchase transactions are of covered securities with the same CUSIP number or other security identifier number that the Secretary may designate by publication in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(B)
Covered securities in different accounts or wallets.
A broker is not required to apply paragraph (d)(7)(ii)(A) of this section if the covered securities are purchased and sold from different accounts or wallets, if the purchased covered security is transferred to another account or wallet before the wash sale, or if the covered securities are treated as held in separate accounts under § 1.1012-1(e). A covered security is not purchased in an account or wallet if it is purchased in another account or wallet and transferred into the account or wallet.
(C)
Effect of election under section 475(f)(1).
A broker is not required to apply paragraph (d)(7)(ii)(A) of this section to securities in an account if a customer has in writing both informed the broker that the customer has made a valid and timely election under section 475(f)(1) and identified the account as solely containing securities subject to the election. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(7)(ii)(C), a writing may be in electronic format. If a customer subsequently informs a broker that the election no longer applies to the customer or the account, the broker must prospectively apply paragraph (d)(7)(ii)(A) of this section but is not required to apply paragraph (d)(7)(ii)(A) of this section for the period covered by the customer's prior instruction to the broker. A taxpayer that is not a trader in securities within the meaning of section 475(f)(1) does not become a trader in securities, or create an inference that it is a trader in securities, by notifying a broker that it has made a valid and timely election under section 475(f)(1).
(D)
Reporting at or near the time of sale.
If a wash sale occurs after a broker has completed a return or statement reporting a sale of a covered security, the broker must redetermine whether gain or loss on the sale is long-term or short-term under this paragraph (d)(7)(ii) and, if the return or statement included information inconsistent with this redetermination, correct the return or statement by the applicable original due date set forth in this section for the return or statement.
(iii)
Constructive sale and mark-to-market adjustments.
A broker is not required to apply section 1259 (regarding constructive sales), section 475 (regarding the mark-to-market method of accounting), or section 1296 (regarding the mark-to-market method of accounting for marketable stock in a passive foreign investment company) when determining whether any gain or loss on the sale of a security is long-term or short-term.
(iv)
Regulated investment company and real estate investment trust adjustments.
A broker is not required to apply sections 852(b)(4)(A) and 857(b)(8) (regarding effect of distributed and undistributed capital gain dividends on a loss on sale of regulated investment company or real estate investment trust shares held six months or less) or section 852(b)(4)(B) (regarding loss disallowance on sale of regulated investment company shares held six months or less due to receipt of tax-exempt dividends) when determining whether any gain or loss on the sale of a security is long-term or short-term.
(v)
No adjustments for hedging transactions or offsetting positions.
A broker is not required to apply section 1092 (regarding straddles), section 1233(b)(2) (regarding effect of short sale on holding period of substantially identical property), or § 1.1221-2(b) (regarding hedging transactions) when determining whether any gain or loss on the sale of a security is long-term or short-term.
(8)
Conversion into United States dollars of amounts paid or received in foreign currency
—(i)
Conversion rules.
(A) When a payment other than a payment of interest is made in a foreign currency, a broker must determine the U.S. dollar amount of the payment by converting the foreign currency into U.S. dollars on the date it receives, credits, or makes the payment, as applicable, at the spot rate (as defined in § 1.988-1(d)(1)) or pursuant to a reasonable spot rate convention. (For interest payments, see paragraph (n)(4)(v) of this section concerning a customer's spot rate election.) When reporting the sale of a security traded on an established securities market, however, a broker must determine the U.S. dollar amounts at the spot rate or pursuant to a reasonable spot rate convention as of the settlement date of the purchase or sale, as applicable.
(B) A reasonable spot rate convention includes a month-end spot rate or a monthly average spot rate. A spot rate convention must be used consistently for all non-dollar amounts reported and from year to year. The convention may not be changed without the consent of the Commissioner or his or her delegate.
(ii)
Effect of identification under § 1.988-5(a), (b), or (c) when the taxpayer effects a sale and a hedge through the same broker.
In lieu of the amounts reportable under paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section, the gross proceeds and adjusted basis must each be the integrated amount computed under § 1.988-5(a), (b) or (c) if—
(A) A taxpayer effects through a broker a sale or exchange of nonfunctional currency (as defined in § 1.988-1(c)) and hedges all or a part of the sale as provided in § 1.988-5(a), (b) or (c) with the same broker; and
(B) The taxpayer complies with the requirements of § 1.988-5(a), (b) or (c) and so notifies the broker prior to the end of the calendar year in which the sale occurs.
(iii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (d)(8):

# Example.
(i) Z, an individual, is a U.S. citizen. On July 4, 2012, Z purchases stock of C, SA, a French corporation traded on an established securities market, in an account with Q, a broker. Q uses a daily spot rate for converting euro and U.S. dollars. Z pays €1,200 for the stock. On the settlement date for the purchase, the spot rate is €1 = $1.30. On October 4, 2012, Z sells the stock for €1,000. On the settlement date for the sale, the spot rate is €1 = $1.35. On October 5, 2012, Z purchases additional shares of C, SA, that cause the €200 loss on the stock sold on October 4, 2012, to be disallowed under section 1091.
(ii) Under paragraph (d)(8)(i)(A) of this section, Q must determine adjusted basis by converting the €1,200 paid on behalf of Z into U.S. dollars using the €1 = $1.30 spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase. Q must convert the €1,000 gross proceeds into U.S. dollars using the €1 = $1.35 spot rate on the settlement date for the sale. Thus, Q must report adjusted basis equal to $1,560, gross proceeds equal to $1,350, and $210 in loss disallowed by section 1091.
(9)
Coordination with the reporting rules for widely held fixed investment trusts under § 1.671-5.
Information required to be reported under section 6045(a) for a sale of a security or a digital asset in a widely held fixed investment trust (WHFIT) (as defined under § 1.671-5) and the sale of an interest in a WHFIT must be reported as provided by this section unless the information is also required to be reported under § 1.671-5. To the extent that this section requires additional information under section 6045(g), those requirements are deemed to be met through compliance with the rules in § 1.671-5.

Optional reporting methods for qualifying stablecoins and specified nonfungible tokens.
This paragraph (d)(10) provides optional reporting rules for sales of qualifying stablecoins as defined in paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of this section and sales of specified nonfungible tokens as defined in paragraph (d)(10)(iv) of this section. A broker may report sales of qualifying stablecoins or
report sales of specified nonfungible tokens under the optional method provided in this paragraph (d)(10) instead of under paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(B) and (D) of this section for some or all customers and may change its reporting method for any customer from year to year; however, the method chosen for a particular customer must be applied for the entire year of that customer's sales.
(i)
Optional reporting method for qualifying stablecoins
—(A)
In general.
In lieu of reporting all sales of qualifying stablecoins under paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(B) and (D) of this section, a broker may report designated sales of qualifying stablecoins, as defined in paragraph (d)(10)(i)(C) of this section, on an aggregate basis as provided in paragraph (d)(10)(i)(B) of this section. A broker reporting under this paragraph (d)(10)(i) is not required to report sales of qualifying stablecoins under this paragraph (d)(10)(i) or under paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(B) through (D) of this section if such sales are non-designated sales of qualifying stablecoins or if the gross proceeds (after reduction for the allocable digital asset transaction costs) from all designated sales effected by that broker of qualifying stablecoins by the customer do not exceed $10,000 for the year as described in paragraph (d)(10)(i)(B) of this section.
(B)
Aggregate reporting method for designated sales of qualifying stablecoins.
If a customer's aggregate gross proceeds (after reduction for the allocable digital asset transaction costs) from all designated sales effected by that broker of qualifying stablecoins exceed $10,000 for the year, the broker must make a separate return for each qualifying stablecoin that includes the information set forth in this paragraph (d)(10)(i)(B). If the aggregate gross proceeds reportable under the previous sentence exceed $10,000, reporting is required with respect to each qualifying stablecoin for which there are designated sales even if the aggregate gross proceeds for a particular qualifying stablecoin does not exceed $10,000. A broker reporting under this paragraph (d)(10)(i)(B) must report the following information with respect to designated sales of each qualifying stablecoin on a separate Form 1099-DA or any successor form in the manner required by such form or instructions—
(
1
) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the customer;
(
2
) The name of the qualifying stablecoin sold;
(
3
) The aggregate gross proceeds for the year from designated sales of the qualifying stablecoin (after reduction for the allocable digital asset transaction costs as defined and allocated pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section);
(
4
) The total number of units of the qualifying stablecoin sold in designated sales of the qualifying stablecoin;
(
5
) The total number of designated sale transactions of the qualifying stablecoin; and
(
6
) Any other information required by the form or instructions.
(C)
Designated sale of a qualifying stablecoin.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(10), the term
designated sale of a qualifying stablecoin
means: any sale as defined in paragraphs (a)(9)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section of a qualifying stablecoin other than a sale of a qualifying stablecoin in exchange for different digital assets that are not qualifying stablecoins. In addition, the term
designated sale of a qualifying stablecoin
includes the delivery of a qualifying stablecoin pursuant to the settlement of any executory contract which would be treated as a designated sale of the qualifying digital asset under the previous sentence if the contract had not been executory. Finally, the term
non-designated sale of a qualifying stablecoin
means any sale of a qualifying stablecoin other than a designated sale of a qualifying stablecoin as defined in this paragraph (d)(10)(i)(C).
(D)
Examples.
For purposes of the following examples, assume that digital asset WW and digital asset YY are qualifying stablecoins, and digital asset DL is not a qualifying stablecoin. Additionally, assume that the transactions set forth in each example include all sales of qualifying stablecoins on behalf of the customer during Year 1, and that no transaction costs were imposed on the sales described therein.

Example 1: Optional reporting method for qualifying stablecoins
—(

)
Facts.
CRX is a digital asset broker that provides services to customer K, an individual not otherwise exempt from reporting. CRX effects the following sales on behalf of K: sale of 1,000 units of WW in exchange for cash of $1,000; sale of 5,000 units of WW in exchange for YY, with a value of $5,000; sale of 10,000 units of WW in return for DL, with a value of $10,000; and sale of 3,000 units of YY in exchange for cash of $3,000.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
In lieu of reporting all of K's sales of WW and YY under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section, CRX may report K's designated sales of WW and YY under the optional reporting method set forth in paragraph (d)(10)(i)(B) of this section. In this case, K's designated sales of qualifying stablecoins resulted in total gross proceeds of $9,000, which is the total of $1,000 from sale of WW for cash, $5,000 from the sale of WW in exchange for YY, and $3,000 from the sale of YY for cash. Because K's designated sales of WW and YY did not exceed $10,000, CRX is not required to make a return of information under this section for any of K's qualifying stablecoin sales. The $10,000 of gross proceeds from the sale of WW for DL, which is not a qualifying stablecoin, is not included in this calculation to determine if the
de minimis
threshold has been exceeded because that sale is not a designated sale and, as such, is not reportable.

Example 2: Optional reporting method for qualifying stablecoins
—(

)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(10)(i)(D)(
1
)(
i
) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that CRX also effects an additional sale of 4,000 units of YY in exchange for cash of $4,000 on behalf of K.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
In lieu of reporting all of K's sales of WW and YY under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section, CRX may report K's designated sales of WW and YY under the optional reporting method set forth in paragraph (d)(10)(i)(B) of this section. In this case, K's designated sales of qualifying stablecoins resulted in total gross proceeds of $13,000, which is the total of $1,000 from sale of WW for cash, $5,000 from the sale of WW for YY, $3,000 from the sale of YY for cash, and $4,000 from the sale of YY for cash. Because K's designated sales of all types of qualifying stablecoins exceeds $10,000, CRX must make two returns of information under this section: one for all of K's designated sales of WW and another for all of K's designated sales of YY.
(ii)
Qualifying stablecoin.
For purposes of this section, the term
qualifying stablecoin
means any digital asset that satisfies the conditions set forth in paragraphs (d)(10)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section for the entire calendar year.
(A)
Designed to track certain other currencies.
The digital asset is designed to track on a one-to-one basis a single convertible currency issued by a government or a central bank (including the U.S. dollar).
(B)
Stabilization mechanism.
Either:
(
1
) The digital asset uses a stabilization mechanism that causes the unit value of the digital asset not to fluctuate from the unit value of the convertible currency it was designed to track by more than 3 percent over any consecutive 10-day period, determined using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), during the calendar year; or
(
2
) The issuer of the digital asset is required by regulation to redeem a unit of the digital asset at any time on a one-to-one basis for the same convertible currency that the digital asset was designed to track.
(C)
Accepted as payment.
The digital asset is generally accepted as payment by persons other than the issuer. A digital asset that satisfies the conditions set forth in paragraphs (d)(10)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section that is accepted by a broker pursuant to a sale of another digital asset, or that is accepted by a second party pursuant to a sale effected by a processor of digital asset payments described in paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D) of this section, meets the condition set forth in this paragraph (d)(10)(ii)(C).

Examples

Example 1
—(
i
)
Facts.
Y is a privately held corporation that issues DL1, a digital asset designed to track the value of the U.S. dollar. Pursuant to regulatory requirements, DL1 is backed in full by U.S. dollars and other liquid short-term U.S. dollar-denominated assets held by Y, and Y offers to redeem units of DL1 for U.S. dollars at par at any time. Y's retention of U.S. dollars and other liquid
short-term U.S. dollar-denominated assets as collateral and Y's offer to redeem units of DL for U.S. dollars at par at any time are intended to cause DL1 to track the U.S. dollar on a one-to-one basis. Broker B accepts DL1 as payment in return for sales of other digital assets.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
DL1 satisfies the three conditions set forth in paragraphs (d)(10)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. First, DL1 was designed to track on a one-to-one basis the U.S. dollar, which is a single convertible currency issued by a government or a central bank. Second, DL1 uses a stabilization mechanism, as described in paragraph (d)(10)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section, that pursuant to regulatory requirements requires Y to offer to redeem one unit of DL1 for one U.S. dollar at any time. Finally, because B accepts DL1 as payment for sales of other digital assets, DL1 is generally accepted as payment by persons other than Y. Accordingly, DL1 is a qualifying stablecoin under this paragraph (d)(10)(ii).
(

)
Example 2
—(
i
)
Facts.
Z is a privately held corporation that issues DL2, a digital asset designed to track the value of the U.S. dollar on a one-to-one basis that has a mechanism that is intended to effect that tracking. On April 28, Year X, Broker B effects the sale of units of DL2 for cash on behalf of customer C. During Year X, the unit value of DL2 did not fluctuate from the U.S. dollar by more than 3 percent over any consecutive 10-day period. Merchant M accepts payment in DL2 in return for goods and services in connection with sales effected by processors of digital asset payments.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
DL2 satisfies the three conditions set forth in paragraphs (d)(10)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section. First, DL2 was designed to track on a one-to-one basis the U.S. dollar, which is a single convertible currency issued by a government or a central bank. Second, DL2 uses a stabilization mechanism, as described in paragraph (d)(10)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section, that results in the unit value of DL2 not fluctuating from the U.S. dollar by more than 3 percent over any consecutive 10-day period during the calendar year (Year X). Third, Merchant M accepts payment in DL2 in return for goods and services in connection with sales effected by processors of digital asset payments DL2 is generally accepted as payment by persons other than Z. Accordingly, DL2 is a qualifying stablecoin under this paragraph (d)(10)(ii).
(iii)
Optional reporting method for specified nonfungible tokens
—(A)
In general
. In lieu of reporting sales of specified nonfungible tokens under the reporting rules provided under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section, a broker may report sales of specified nonfungible tokens as defined in paragraph (d)(10)(iv) of this section on an aggregate basis as provided in this paragraph (d)(10)(iii). Other digital assets, including nonfungible tokens that are not specified nonfungible tokens, are not eligible for the optional reporting method in this paragraph (d)(10)(iii).
(B)
Reporting method for specified nonfungible tokens.
A broker reporting under this paragraph (d)(10)(iii) must report sales of specified nonfungible tokens if the customer's aggregate gross proceeds (after reduction for the allocable digital asset transaction costs) from all sales of specified nonfungible tokens exceed $600 for the year. If the customer's aggregate gross proceeds (after reduction for the allocable digital asset transaction costs) from such sales effected by that broker do not exceed $600 for the year, no report is required. A broker reporting under this paragraph (d)(10)(iii)(B) must report on a Form 1099-DA or any successor form in the manner required by such form or instructions the following information with respect to the customer's sales of specified nonfungible tokens—
(
1
) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the customer;
(
2
) The aggregate gross proceeds for the year from all sales of specified nonfungible tokens (after reduction for the allocable digital asset transaction costs as defined and allocated pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section);
(
3
) The total number of specified nonfungible token sales;
(
4
) To the extent ordinarily known by the broker, the aggregate gross proceeds that is attributable to the first sale by a creator or minter of the specified nonfungible token; and
(
5
) Any other information required by the form or instructions.
(C)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (d)(10)(iii).

)
Example 1: Optional reporting method for specified nonfungible tokens
—(
i
)
Facts.
CRX is a digital asset broker that provides services to customer J, an individual not otherwise exempt from reporting. In Year 1, CRX sells on behalf of J, ten specified nonfungible tokens for a gross proceeds amount equal to $1,500. CRX does not sell any other specified nonfungible tokens for J during Year 1.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
In lieu of reporting J's sales of the ten specified nonfungible tokens under paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section, CRX may report these sales under the reporting method set forth in this paragraph (d)(10)(iii). In this case, J's sales of the ten specified nonfungible tokens gave rise to total gross proceeds of $1,500 for Year 1. Because the total gross proceeds from J's sales of the ten specified nonfungible tokens exceeds $600, CRX must make a single return of information under this section for these sales.
(
2
)
Example 2: Optional reporting method for specified nonfungible tokens
—(
i
)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(10)(iii)(C)(
1
)(
i
) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that the total gross proceeds from the sale of J's ten specified nonfungible tokens is $500.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
Because J's sales of the specified nonfungible tokens result in total gross proceeds of $500, CRX is not required to make a return of information under this section for J's sales of the specified nonfungible tokens.
(iv)
Specified nonfungible token.
For purposes of this section, the term
specified nonfungible token
means a digital asset that satisfies the conditions set forth in paragraphs (d)(10)(iv)(A) through (C) of this section.
(A)
Indivisible.
The digital asset cannot be subdivided into smaller units without losing its intrinsic value or function.
(B)
Unique.
The digital asset itself includes a unique digital identifier, other than a digital asset address, that distinguishes that digital asset from all other digital assets.
(C)
Excluded property.
The digital asset is not and does not directly or through one or more other digital assets that satisfy the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(10)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section, provide the holder with any interest in any of the following excluded property—
(
1
) A security under paragraph (a)(3) of this section;
(
2
) A commodity under paragraph (a)(5) of this section;
(
3
) A regulated futures contract under paragraph (a)(6) of this section;
(
4
) A forward contract under paragraph (a)(7) of this section; or
(
5
) A digital asset that does not satisfy the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(10)(iv)(A) and (B) of this section.
(D)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (d)(10)(iv).

Facts.
Individual J is an artist in the business of creating and selling digital assets that reference J's artwork. J creates a unique digital asset (DA-J) that represents J's artwork. The digital asset includes a unique digital identifier, other than a digital asset address, that distinguishes DA-J from all other digital assets. DA-J cannot be subdivided into smaller units.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
DA-J is a digital asset that satisfies the three conditions described in paragraphs (d)(10)(iv)(A) through (C) of this section. DA-J cannot be subdivided into smaller units without losing its intrinsic value or function. Additionally, DA-J includes a unique digital identifier that distinguishes DA-J from all other digital assets. Finally, DA-J does not provide the holder with any interest in excluded property listed in paragraphs (d)(10)(iv)(C)(
1
) through (
5
) of this section Accordingly, DA-J is a specified nonfungible token under this paragraph (d)(10)(iv).

Facts.
K creates a unique digital asset (DA-K) that provides the holder with the right to redeem DA-K for 100 units of digital asset DE. Units of DE can be subdivided into smaller units and do not include a unique digital identifier, other than a digital
asset address, that distinguishes one unit of DE from any other unit of DE. DA-K cannot be subdivided into smaller units and includes a unique digital identifier, other than a digital asset address, that distinguishes DA-K from all other digital assets.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
DA-K provides its holder with an interest in 100 units of digital asset DE, which is excluded property, as described in paragraph (d)(10)(iv)(C)(
5
) of this section, because DE units can be subdivided into smaller units and do not include unique digital identifiers that distinguishes one unit of DE from any other unit of DE. Accordingly, DA-K is not a specified nonfungible token under this paragraph (d)(10)(iv).

Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(10)(iv)(D)(

Example 2
) except that in addition to providing its holder with an interest in the 100 units of DE, DA-K also provides rights to or access to a unique work of art.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
Because DA-K provides its holder with an interest in excluded property described in paragraph (d)(10)(iv)(C)(
5
) of this section, it is not a specified nonfungible token under paragraph this (d)(10)(iv) without regard to whether it also references property that is not excluded property.

B creates a unique digital asset (DA-B) that provides the holder with the right to redeem DA-B for physical merchandise in B's store. DA-B cannot be subdivided into smaller units and includes a unique digital identifier, other than a digital asset address, that distinguishes DA-B from all other digital assets.
(
ii
)
Analysis.
DA-B is a digital asset that satisfies the three conditions described in paragraphs (d)(10)(iv)(A) through (C) of this section. DA-B cannot be subdivided into smaller units without losing its intrinsic value or function. Additionally, DA-B includes a unique digital identifier that distinguishes DA-B from all other digital assets. Finally, DA-B does not provide the holder with any interest in excluded property listed in paragraphs (d)(10)(iv)(C)(
1
) through (
5
) of this section. Accordingly, DA-B is a specified nonfungible token under this paragraph (d)(10)(iv).
(v)
Joint accounts.
For purposes of determining if the gross proceeds thresholds set forth in paragraphs (d)(10)(i)(B) and (d)(10)(iii)(B) of this section have been met for the customer, the customer is the person whose tax identification number would be required to be shown on the information return (but for the application of the relevant threshold) after the application of the backup withholding rules under § 31.3406(h)-2(a) of this chapter.
(11)
Collection and retention of additional information with respect to the sale of a digital asset.
A broker required to make an information return under paragraph (c) of this section with respect to the sale of a digital asset must collect the following additional information, retain it for seven years from the date of the due date for the information return required to be filed under this section, and make it available for inspection upon request by the Internal Revenue Service:
(i) The transaction ID as defined in paragraph (a)(24) of this section in connection with the sale, if any; and the digital asset address as defined in paragraph (a)(20) of this section (or digital asset addresses if multiple) from which the digital asset was transferred in connection with the sale, if any;
(ii) For each sale of a digital asset that was held by the broker in a hosted wallet on behalf of a customer and was previously transferred into an account at the broker (transferred-in digital asset), the transaction ID of such transfer in and the digital asset address (or digital asset addresses if multiple) from which the digital asset was transferred, if any.

Requirement of reporting.
A barter exchange shall, except as otherwise provided, report in the manner prescribed in this section.
(2)
Exchanges required to be reported
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (g) of this section, a barter exchange must make a return of information for exchanges of personal property or services through the barter exchange during the calendar year among its members or clients or between these persons and the
barter exchange. For this purpose, property or services are exchanged through a barter exchange if payment for property or services is made by means of a credit on the books of the barter exchange or scrip issued by the barter exchange or if the barter exchange arranges a direct exchange of property or services among its members or clients or exchanges property or services with a member or client.
(ii)
Exemption.
A barter exchange through which there are fewer than 100 exchanges during the calendar year is not required to report for, or make a return of information with respect to exchanges during, such calendar year. The Commissioner may require multiple barter exchanges to be combined for purposes of the proceeding sentence upon a determination that a material purpose for the formation or continuation of one or more of the barter exchanges to be combined was to receive one or more exemptions pursuant to this subparagraph.
(iii)
Coordination rules for exchanges of digital assets made through barter exchanges.
Exchange transactions involving the exchange of one digital asset held by one customer of a broker for a different digital asset held by a second customer of the same broker must be treated as a sale under paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section subject to reporting under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, and not as an exchange of personal property through a barter exchange subject to reporting under this paragraph (e) and paragraph (f) of this section, with respect to both customers involved in the exchange transaction. In the case of an exchange transaction that involves the transfer of a digital asset for personal property or services that are not also digital assets, if the digital asset payment also is a reportable payment transaction subject to reporting by the barter exchange under § 1.6050W-1(a)(1), the exchange transaction must be treated as a reportable payment transaction and not as an exchange of personal property through a barter exchange subject to reporting under this paragraph (e) and paragraph (f) of this section with respect to the member or client disposing of personal property or services. Additionally, an exchange transaction described in the previous sentence must be treated as a sale under paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(D) of this section subject to reporting under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and not as an exchange of personal property through a barter exchange subject to reporting under this paragraph (e) and paragraph (f) of this section with respect to the member or client disposing of the digital asset. Nothing in this paragraph (e)(2)(iii) may be construed to mean that any broker is or is not properly classified as a barter exchange.
(f)
Information required
—(1)
In general.
A person that is a barter exchange during a calendar year shall report on Form 1096 showing the information required thereon for such year.
(2)
Transactional reporting
—(i)
In general.
As to each exchange for which a barter exchange is required to make a return of information under this section, the barter exchange must show on Form 1099-B, “Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions,” or any successor form the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each member or client providing property or services in the exchange, the property or services provided, the amount received by the member or client for the property or services, the date on which the exchange occurred, and other information required by the form in the manner and number of copies required by the form.
(ii)
Exception for corporate member or client.
As to each corporate member or client providing property or services in an exchange for which a return of information is required under this section, the barter exchange may report the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the corporate member or client, the aggregate amount received by the corporate member or client during the reporting period for property or services provided by such corporate member or client in exchange for which a return of information is required, and such other information as may be required by Form 1099, in the form, manner, and number of copies required by Form 1099.
(iii)
Definition.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the term “corporate member or client” means a member or client of a barter exchange
which is a corporation as defined in section 7701(a)(3) (including an insurance company). The term corporation includes a pool, syndicate, partnership, or unincorporated association composed exclusively of corporations. A barter exchange may treat a member or client as a corporation (and therefore as a corporate member or client) if such member or client provides an exemption certificate as described in § 31.3406(h)-3(a) of this chapter or provided that—
(A) The name of the member or client contains the term “insurance company,” “indemnity company,” “reinsurance company,” or “assurance company”;
(B) The name of the member or client contains one of the following unambiguous expressions of corporate status: Incorporated, Inc., Corporation, Corp., or P.C., but not Company or Co.; or
(C) The member or client is known to the barter exchange to be a corporation through a corporate resolution or similar document on file with the barter exchange clearly indicating corporate status.
(3)
Exchange date.
For purposes of this section an exchange is considered to occur with respect to a member or client of a barter exchange on the date cash, property, a credit, or scrip is actually or constructively received by the member or client as a result of the exchange. (See § 1.451-2 for rules pertaining to constructive receipt.)
(4)
Amount received.
The amount received by a member or client in an exchange includes cash received, the fair market value of any property or services received, and the fair market value of any credits to the account of the member or client on the books of the barter exchange or scrip issued to the member or client by the barter exchange, but does not include any amount received by the member or client in a subsequent exchange of credits or scrip. For purposes of this section, the fair market value of a credit or scrip is the value assigned to such credit or scrip by the issuing barter exchange for the purpose of exchanges unless the Commissioner requires the use of a different value that the Commissioner determines more accurately reflects fair market value.
(5)
Meaning of terms.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)—
(i) A credit is an amount on the books of the barter exchange that is transferable from one member or client of the barter exchange to another such member or client, or to the barter exchange in payment for property or services;
(ii) Scrip is a token issued by the barter exchange that is transferable from one member or client, of the barter exchange to another such member or client, or to the barter exchange, in payment for property or services; and
(iii) Property does not include a credit or scrip.
(6)
Reporting period.
A barter exchange shall use the calendar year as the reporting period.

Exempt foreign persons
—(1)
Brokers.
No return of information is required to be made by a broker with respect to a customer who is considered to be an exempt foreign person under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (iii) or paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
See
paragraph (a)(1) of this section for when a person is not treated as a broker under this section for a sale effected at an office outside the United States.
See
paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (g)(3) of this section for rules relating to sales as defined in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section and
see
paragraph (g)(4) of this section for rules relating to sales of digital assets as defined in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
(i) With respect to a sale as defined in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section (relating to sales other than sales of digital assets) that is effected at an office of a broker either inside or outside the United States, the broker may treat the customer as an exempt foreign person if the broker can, prior to the payment, reliably associate the payment with documentation upon which it can rely in order to treat the customer as a foreign beneficial owner in accordance with § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii), as made to a foreign payee in accordance with § 1.6049-5(d)(1), or presumed to be made to a foreign payee under § 1.6049-5(d)(2) or (3). For purposes of this paragraph (g)(1)(i), the provisions in § 1.6049-5(c) regarding rules applicable to documentation of foreign status shall apply with respect to a sale when the broker
completes the acts necessary to effect the sale at an office outside the United States, as described in paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, and no office of the same broker within the United States negotiated the sale with the customer or received instructions with respect to the sale from the customer. The provisions in § 1.6049-5(c) regarding the definitions of
U.S. payor, U.S. middleman,
non-U.S. payor,
and
non-U.S. middleman
shall also apply for purposes of this paragraph (g)(1)(i). The provisions of § 1.1441-1 shall apply by substituting the terms
broker
and
customer
for the terms
withholding agent
and
payee,
respectively, and without regard for the fact that the provisions apply to amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code. The provisions of § 1.6049-5(d) shall apply by substituting the terms
broker
and
customer
for the terms
payor
and
payee,
respectively. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(1)(i), a broker that is required to obtain, or chooses to obtain, a beneficial owner withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i) from an individual may rely on the withholding certificate only to the extent the certificate includes a certification that the beneficial owner has not been, and at the time the certificate is furnished, reasonably expects not to be present in the United States for a period aggregating 183 days or more during each calendar year to which the certificate pertains. The certification is not required if a broker receives documentary evidence under § 1.6049-5(c)(1) or (4).
(ii) With respect to a redemption or retirement of stock or an obligation (the interest or original issue discount on, which is described in § 1.6049-5(b)(6), (7), (10), or (11) or the dividends on, which are described in § 1.6042-3(b)(1)(iv)) that is effected at an office of a broker outside the United States by the issuer (or its paying or transfer agent), the broker may treat the customer as an exempt foreign person if the broker is not also acting in its capacity as a custodian, nominee, or other agent of the payee.
(iii) With respect to a sale as defined in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section (relating to sales other than sales of digital assets) that is effected by a broker at an office of the broker either inside or outside the United States, the broker may treat the customer as an exempt foreign person for the period that those proceeds are assets blocked as described in § 1.1441-2(e)(3). For purposes of this paragraph (g)(1)(iii) and section 3406, a sale is deemed to occur in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section. The exemption in this paragraph (g)(1)(iii) shall terminate when payment of the proceeds is deemed to occur in accordance with the provisions of § 1.1441-2(e)(3).
(2)
Barter exchange.
No return of information is required by a barter exchange under the rules of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section with respect to a client or a member that the barter exchange may treat as an exempt foreign person pursuant to the procedures described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(3)
Applicable rules
—(i)
Joint owners.
Amounts paid to joint owners for which a certificate or documentation is required as a condition for being exempt from reporting under paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (g)(2) of this section are presumed made to U.S. payees who are not exempt recipients if, prior to payment, the broker or barter exchange cannot reliably associate the payment either with a Form W-9 furnished by one of the joint owners in the manner required in §§ 31.3406(d)-1 through 31.3406(d)-5 of this chapter, or with documentation described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section furnished by each joint owner upon which it can rely to treat each joint owner as a foreign payee or foreign beneficial owner. For purposes of applying this paragraph (g)(3)(i), the grace period described in § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(ii) shall apply only if each payee qualifies for such grace period.
(ii)
Special rules for determining who the customer is.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the determination of who the customer is shall be made on the basis of the provisions in § 1.6049-5(d) by substituting in that section the terms
payor
and
payee
with the terms
broker
and
customer.
(iii)
Place of effecting sale
—(A)
Sale outside the United States.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), a sale as defined in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section
(relating to sales other than sales of digital assets) is considered to be effected by a broker at an office outside the United States if, in accordance with instructions directly transmitted to such office from outside the United States by the broker's customer, the office completes the acts necessary to effect the sale outside the United States. The acts necessary to effect the sale may be considered to have been completed outside the United States without regard to whether—
(
1
) Pursuant to instructions from an office of the broker outside the United States, an office of the same broker within the United States undertakes one or more steps of the sale in the United States; or
(
2
) The gross proceeds of the sale are paid by a draft drawn on a United States bank account or by a wire or other electronic transfer from a United States account.
(B)
Sale inside the United States.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), a sale that is considered to be effected by a broker at an office outside the United States under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) of this section shall nevertheless be considered to be effected by a broker at an office inside the United States if either—
(
1
) The customer has opened an account with a United States office of that broker;
(
2
) The customer has transmitted instructions concerning this and other sales to the foreign office of the broker from within the United States by mail, telephone, electronic transmission or otherwise (unless the transmissions from the United States have taken place in isolated and infrequent circumstances);
(
3
) The gross proceeds of the sale are paid to the customer by a transfer of funds into an account (other than an international account as defined in § 1.6049-5(e)(4)) maintained by the customer in the United States or mailed to the customer at an address in the United States;
(
4
) The confirmation of the sale is mailed to a customer at an address in the United States; or
(
5
) An office of the same broker within the United States negotiates the sale with the customer or receives instructions with respect to the sale from the customer.
(iv)
Special rules where the customer is a foreign intermediary or certain U.S. branches.
A foreign intermediary, as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(13), is an exempt foreign person, except when the broker has actual knowledge (within the meaning of § 1.6049-5(c)(3)) that the person for whom the intermediary acts is a U.S. person that is not exempt from reporting under paragraph (c)(3) of this section or the broker is required to presume under § 1.6049-5(d)(3) that the payee is a U.S. person that is not an exempt recipient. If a foreign intermediary, as described in § 1.1441-1(c)(13), or a U.S. branch that is not treated as a U.S. person receives a payment from a payor or middleman (as defined in § 1.6049-4(a) and (f)(4)), which payment the payor or middleman can reliably associate with a valid withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii), (iii) or (v), respectively, furnished by such intermediary or branch, then the intermediary or branch is not required to report such payment when it, in turn, pays the amount, unless, and to the extent, the intermediary or branch knows that the payment is required to be reported under this section and was not so reported. For example, if a U.S. branch described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) fails to provide information regarding U.S. persons that are not exempt from reporting under paragraph (c)(3) of this section to the person from whom the U.S. branch receives the payment, the U.S. branch must report the payment on an information return.
See,
however, paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section for when reporting under section 6045 is coordinated with reporting under chapter 4 of the Code or an applicable IGA (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(7)). The exception of this paragraph (g)(3)(iv) for amounts paid by a foreign intermediary shall not apply to a qualified intermediary that assumes reporting responsibility under chapter 61 of the Code except as provided under the agreement described in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(iii).
(4)
Rules for sales of digital assets.
The rules of this paragraph (g)(4) apply to a sale of a digital asset as defined in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section.
See
paragraph (a)(1) of this section for
when a person is treated as a broker under this section with respect to a sale of a digital asset.
See
paragraph (c) of this section for rules requiring brokers to report sales.
See
paragraph (g)(1) of this section providing that no return of information is required to be made by a broker effecting a sale of a digital asset for a customer who is considered to be an exempt foreign person under this paragraph (g)(4).

2
) of this section provides presumption rules that apply if the broker does not have documentation on which the broker may rely to determine a customer's status. Paragraph (g)(4)(vi)(A)(

)
Documentation of foreign status.
A broker may treat a customer as an exempt foreign person when the broker obtains valid documentation permitted to support a customer's foreign status as described in paragraph (g)(4)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section (as applicable) that the broker can reliably associate (within the meaning of § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)(A)) with a payment of gross proceeds, provided that the broker is not required to treat the documentation as unreliable or incorrect under paragraph (g)(4)(vi)(B) or (C) of this section. For rules regarding the validity period of a withholding certificate, or of documentary evidence (when permitted to be relied upon under paragraph (g)(4)(vi)(C) of this section), retention of documentation, electronic transmission of documentation, information required to be provided on a withholding certificate, who may sign a withholding certificate, when a substitute withholding certificate may be accepted, and general reliance rules on documentation (including when a prior version of a withholding certificate may be relied upon), the provisions of §§ 1.1441-1(e)(4)(i) through (ix) and 1.6049-5(c)(1)(ii) apply, with the following modifications—
(
i
) The provisions in § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(i) through (ix) apply by substituting the terms
broker
and
customer
for the terms
withholding agent
and
payee,
respectively, and disregarding the fact that the provisions under § 1.1441-1 apply only to amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code;
(
ii
) The provisions of § 1.6049-5(c)(1)(ii) (relating to general requirements for when a payor may rely upon and must maintain documentary evidence with respect to a payee) apply (as applicable to the broker) by substituting the terms
broker
and
customer
for the terms
payor
and
payee,
respectively;
(
iii
) To apply § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(viii) (reliance rules for documentation), the reference to § 1.1441-7(b)(4) through (6) is replaced by the provisions of paragraph (g)(4)(vi)(B) or (C) of this section, as applicable, and the reference to § 1.1441-6(c)(2) is disregarded; and
(
iv
) To apply § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(viii) (reliance rules for documentation) and (ix) (certificates to be furnished to a withholding agent for each obligation unless an exception applies), the provisions applicable to a financial institution apply to a broker described in this paragraph (g)(4) whether or not it is a financial institution.

Presumption rules
—(
i
)
In general.
If a broker is not permitted to treat a customer as an exempt foreign person under paragraph (g)(4)(vi)(A)(
1
) of this section because the broker has not collected the documentation permitted to be collected under this paragraph (g)(4) or is not permitted to rely on the documentation it has collected, the broker must determine the classification of a customer (as an individual, entity, etc.) by applying the presumption rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii), except that references in § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(B) to exempt recipient categories under section 6049 are replaced by the exempt recipient categories in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. With respect to a customer that a broker has classified as an entity, the broker must determine the status of the customer as U.S. or foreign by applying §§ 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(A) and 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6), except that § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(A)(
1
)(
iv
) does not apply. For presumption rules to treat a payment as made to an intermediary or flow-through entity and whether the payment is also treated as made to an exempt foreign person,
see
paragraph (g)(4)(vi)(E) of this
section. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (g)(4)(vi)(A)(
2
), a broker may not treat a customer as a foreign person under this paragraph (g)(4)(vi)(A)(
2
) if the broker has actual knowledge or reason to know that the customer is a U.S. person. For purposes of applying the presumption rules of this paragraph (g)(4)(vi)(A)(
2
), a broker must identify its customer by applying the rules of § 1.6049-5(d)(1), substituting the terms
customer
and
broker
for the terms
payee
and
payor,
respectively.
(
ii
)
Presumption rule specific to U.S. digital asset brokers.
With respect to a customer that a U.S. digital asset broker has classified as an individual, the broker must treat the customer as a U.S. person.
(
3
)
Grace period to collect valid documentation in the case of indicia of a foreign customer.
If a broker has not obtained valid documentation that it can reliably associate with a payment of gross proceeds to a customer to treat the customer as an exempt foreign person, or if the broker is unable to rely upon documentation under the rules described in paragraph (g)(4)(vi)(A)(
1
) of this section or is required to treat documentation obtained for a customer as unreliable or incorrect (after applying paragraphs (g)(4)(vi)(B) and (C) of this section), the broker may apply the grace period described in § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(ii) (generally allowing in certain circumstances a payor to treat an account as owned by a foreign person for a 90 day period). In applying § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(ii), references to
securities described in § 1.1441-6(c)(2)
are replaced with
digital assets.
(
4
)
Blocked income.
A broker may apply the provisions in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section to treat a customer as an exempt foreign person when the proceeds are blocked income as described in § 1.1441-2(e)(3).
(B)
Reliance on beneficial ownership withholding certificates to determine foreign status.
For purposes of determining whether a customer may be treated as an exempt foreign person under this section, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (g)(4)(vi)(B), a broker may rely on a beneficial owner withholding certificate described in paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(B) of this section unless the broker has actual knowledge or reason to know that the certificate is unreliable or incorrect. With respect to a U.S. digital asset broker described in paragraph (g)(4)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section, reason to know is limited to when the broker has any of the U.S. indicia set forth in paragraph (g)(4)(iv)(B)(
2
)(
i
) or (
ii
) of this section in its account opening files or other files pertaining to the account (account information), including documentation collected for purposes of an AML program or the beneficial owner withholding certificate. A broker will not be considered to have reason to know that a certificate is unreliable or incorrect based on documentation collected for an AML program until the date that is 30 days after the account is opened. A broker may rely, however, on a beneficial owner withholding certificate notwithstanding the presence of any of the U.S. indicia set forth in paragraph (g)(4)(iv)(B)(
2
)(
i
) or (
ii
) of this section on the withholding certificate or in the account information for a customer in the circumstances described in paragraphs (g)(4)(vi)(B)(

) and (
2
) of this section.

—(
i
)
In general.
With respect to any of the U.S. indicia described in paragraph (g)(4)(iv)(B)(
2
)(
i
) of this section, the broker has in its possession for a customer who is an individual documentary evidence establishing foreign status (as described in § 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)) that does not contain a U.S. address and the customer provides the broker with a reasonable explanation (as defined in § 1.1441-7(b)(12)) from the customer, in writing, supporting the claim of foreign status. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in a case in which the broker classified an individual customer as a U.S. person in its account information, the broker may treat the customer as an exempt foreign person only if it has in its possession documentary evidence described in § 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i)(B) evidencing citizenship in a country other than the United States. In the case of a customer that is an entity, the broker may treat the customer as an exempt foreign person if it has in its possession documentation establishing foreign status that substantiates that
the entity is actually organized or created under the laws of a foreign country.

In the case of amounts paid to customers that are joint account holders for which a certificate or documentation is required as a condition for being exempt from reporting under this paragraph (g)(4), such amounts are presumed made to U.S. payees who are not exempt recipients (as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section) when the conditions of paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section are met.
(E)
Special rules for customer that is a foreign intermediary, a flow-through entity, or certain U.S. branches
—(

)
Foreign intermediaries in general.
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(4), a broker may determine the status of a customer as a foreign intermediary (as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(13)) by reliably associating (under § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) a payment of gross proceeds with a valid foreign intermediary withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii) or (iii), without regard to whether the withholding certificate contains a withholding statement and withholding certificates or other documentation for each account holder. In the case of a payment of gross proceeds from a sale of a digital asset that a broker treats as made to a foreign intermediary under this paragraph (g)(4)(vi)(E)(
1
), the broker must treat the foreign intermediary as an exempt foreign person except to the extent required by paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section (rules for when a broker is required to treat a payment as made to a U.S. person that is not an exempt recipient under paragraph (c)(3) of this section and for reporting that may be required by the foreign intermediary).
(

)
Presumption rule specific to U.S. digital asset brokers.
A U.S. digital asset broker that does not have a valid foreign intermediary withholding certificate or a valid beneficial owner withholding certificate described in paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(B) of this section for the customer applies the presumption rules in § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(B) (which would presume that the entity is not an intermediary). For purposes of applying the presumption rules referenced in the preceding sentence, a U.S. digital asset broker must identify its customer by applying the rules of § 1.6049-5(d)(1), substituting the terms
customer
and
U.S. digital asset broker
for the terms
payee
and
payor,
respectively.
See
§ 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) for presumption rules relating to the U.S. or foreign status of a customer.

Foreign flow-through entities.
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(4), a broker may determine the status of a customer as a foreign flow-through entity (as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(23)) by reliably associating (under § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) a payment of gross proceeds with a valid foreign flow-through withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-5(c)(3)(iii) (relating to nonwithholding foreign partnerships) or § 1.1441-5(e)(5)(iii) (relating to foreign simple trusts and foreign grantor trusts that are nonwithholding foreign trusts), without regard to whether the withholding certificate contains a withholding statement and withholding certificates or other documentation for each partner. A broker may alternatively determine the status of a customer as a foreign flow-through entity based on the presumption rules in §§ 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(B) (relating to entity classification), 1.1441-5(d) (relating to partnership status as U.S. or foreign) and 1.1441-5(e)(6) (relating to the status of trusts and estates as U.S. or foreign). For purposes of applying the presumption rules referenced in the preceding sentence, a broker must identify its customer by applying the rules of § 1.6049-5(d)(1), substituting the terms
customer
and
broker
for the terms
payee
and
payor,
respectively. In the case of a payment of gross proceeds from a sale of a digital asset that a broker treats as made to a foreign flow-through entity under this paragraph (g)(4)(vi)(E)(
2
), the broker must treat the foreign flow-through entity as an exempt foreign person except to the extent required by § 1.6049-5(d)(3)(ii) (rules for when a broker is required to treat a payment as made to a U.S. person other than an exempt recipient (substituting
exempt recipient under § 1.6045-1(c)(3)
for
exempt recipient described in § 1.6049-4(c)
)).
(

)
U.S. branches that are not beneficial owners.
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(4), a broker may determine the status of a customer as a U.S. branch (as described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)) that is not a beneficial owner (as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(6)) of a payment of gross proceeds by reliably associating (under § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) the payment with a valid U.S. branch withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(v) without regard to whether the withholding certificate contains a withholding statement and withholding certificates or other documentation for each person for whom the branch receives the payment. If a U.S. branch certifies on a U.S. branch withholding certificate described in the preceding sentence that it agrees to be treated as a U.S. person under § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)(A), the broker provided the certificate must treat the U.S. branch as an exempt foreign person. If a U.S. branch does not certify as described in the preceding sentence on its U.S. branch withholding certificate, the broker provided the certificate must treat the U.S. branch as an exempt foreign person except to the extent required by paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section (rules for when a broker is required to treat a payment as made to a U.S. person that is not an exempt recipient under paragraph (c)(3) of this section and for reporting that may be required by the U.S. branch). In a case in which a broker cannot reliably associate a payment of gross proceeds made to a U.S. branch with a U.S. branch withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(v) or a valid beneficial owner withholding certificate described in paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(B) of this section,
see
paragraph (g)(4)(vi)(E)(
1
) of this section for determining the status of the U.S. branch as a beneficial owner or intermediary.
(F)
Transition rule for obtaining documentation to treat a customer as an exempt foreign person.
Notwithstanding the rules of this paragraph (g)(4) for determining the status of a customer as an exempt foreign person, for a sale of a digital asset effected before January 1, 2027, that was held in an account established for the customer by a broker before January 1, 2026, the broker may treat the customer as an exempt foreign person provided that the customer has not previously been classified as a U.S. person by the broker, and the information that the broker has in the account opening files or other files pertaining to the account, including documentation collected for purposes of an AML program, includes a residence address for the customer that is not a U.S. address.
(vii)
Barter exchanges.
No return of information is required by a barter exchange under the rules of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section with respect to a client or a member that the barter exchange may treat as an exempt foreign person pursuant to the procedures described in this paragraph (g)(4).
(5)
Examples.
The application of the provisions of paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:
(i)
Example 1.
FC is a foreign corporation that is not a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman described in § 1.6049-5(c)(5) that regularly issues and retires its own debt obligations. A is an individual whose residence address is inside the United States, who holds a bond issued by FC that is in registered form (within the meaning of section 163(f) and the regulations under that section). The bond is retired by FP, a foreign corporation that is a broker within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the designated paying agent of FC. FP mails the proceeds to A at A's U.S. address. The sale would be considered to be effected at an office outside the United States under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) of this section except that the proceeds of the sale are mailed to a U.S. address. For that reason, the sale is considered to be effected at an office of the broker inside
the United States under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. Therefore, FC is a broker under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to this transaction because, although it is not a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, as described in § 1.6049-5(c)(5), it is deemed to effect the sale in the United States. FP is a broker for the same reasons. However, under the multiple broker exception under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, FP, rather than FC, is required to report the payment because FP is responsible for paying the holder the proceeds from the retired obligations. Under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, FP may not treat A as an exempt foreign person and must make an information return under section 6045 with respect to the retirement of the FC bond, unless FP obtains the certificate or documentation described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.
(ii)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
) except that FP mails the proceeds to A at an address outside the United States. Under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, the sale is considered to be effected at an office of the broker outside the United States. Therefore, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, neither FC nor FP is a broker with respect to the retirement of the FC bond. Accordingly, neither is required to make an information return under section 6045.
(iii)
Example 3.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section (the facts in
Example 2
) except that FP is also the agent of A. The result is the same as in paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section (
Example 2
). Neither FP nor FC are brokers under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to the sale since the sale is effected outside the United States and neither of them are U.S. payors (within the meaning of § 1.6049-5(c)(5)).
(iv)
Example 4.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
) except that the registered bond held by A was issued by DC, a domestic corporation that regularly issues and retires its own debt obligations. Also, FP mails the proceeds to A at an address outside the United States. Interest on the bond is not described in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section. The sale is considered to be effected at an office outside the United States under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) of this section. DC is a broker under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section. DC is not required to report the payment under the multiple broker exception under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. FP is not required to make an information return under section 6045 because FP is not a U.S. payor described in § 1.6049-5(c)(5) and the sale is effected outside the United States. Accordingly, FP is not a broker under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(v)
Example 5.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(5)(iv) of this section (the facts in
Example 4
) except that FP is also the agent of A. DC is a broker under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. DC is not required to report under the multiple broker exception under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. FP is not required to make an information return under section 6045 because FP is not a U.S. payor described in § 1.6049-5(c)(5) and the sale is effected outside the United States and therefore FP is not a broker under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(vi)
Example 6.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(5)(iv) of this section (the facts in
Example 4
) except that the bond is retired by DP, a broker within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the designated paying agent of DC. DP is a U.S. payor under § 1.6049-5(c)(5). DC is not required to report under the multiple broker exception under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section. DP is required to make an information return under section 6045 because it is the person responsible for paying the proceeds from the retired obligations unless DP obtains the certificate or documentary evidence described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.
(vii)
Example 7
—(A)
Facts.
Customer A owns U.S. corporate bonds issued in registered form after July 18, 1984, and carrying a stated rate of interest. The bonds are held through an account with foreign bank, X, and are held in street name. X is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a U.S. company and is not a qualified intermediary within the meaning of § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(ii). X has no
documentation regarding A. A instructs X to sell the bonds. In order to effect the sale, X acts through its agent in the United States, Y. Y sells the bonds and remits the sales proceeds to X. X credits A's account in the foreign country. X does not provide documentation to Y and has no actual knowledge that A is a foreign person but it does appear that A is an entity (rather than an individual).
(B)
Analysis with respect to Y's obligations to withhold and report.
Y treats X as the customer, and not A, because Y cannot treat X as an intermediary because it has received no documentation from X. Y is not required to report the sales proceeds under the multiple broker exception under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, because X is an exempt recipient. Further, Y is not required to report the amount of accrued interest paid to X on Form 1042-S under § 1.1461-1(c)(2)(ii) because accrued interest is not an amount subject to reporting under chapter 3 unless the withholding agent knows that the obligation is being sold with a primary purpose of avoiding tax.
(C)
Analysis with respect to X's obligations to withhold and report.
Although X has effected, within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the sale of a security at an office outside the United States under paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section, X is treated as a broker, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, because as a wholly-owned subsidiary of a U.S. corporation, X is a controlled foreign corporation and therefore is a U.S. payor.
See
§ 1.6049-5(c)(5). Under the presumptions described in § 1.6049-5(d)(2) (as applied to amounts not subject to withholding under chapter 3), X must apply the presumption rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(i) through (iii), with respect to the sales proceeds, to treat A as a partnership that is a U.S. non-exempt recipient because the presumption of foreign status for offshore obligations under § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(D) does not apply.
See
paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section. Therefore, unless X is an FFI (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(47)) that is excepted from reporting the sales proceeds under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the payment of proceeds to A by X is reportable on a Form 1099 under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. X has no obligation to backup withhold on the payment based on the exemption under § 31.3406(g)-1(e) of this chapter, unless X has actual knowledge that A is a U.S. person that is not an exempt recipient. X is also required to separately report the accrued interest (
see
paragraph (d)(3) of this section) on Form 1099 under section 6049 because A is also presumed to be a U.S. person who is not an exempt recipient with respect to the payment because accrued interest is not an amount subject to withholding under chapter 3 and, therefore, the presumption of foreign status for offshore obligations under § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(D) does not apply.
See
§ 1.6049-5(d)(2)(i).
(viii)
Example 8
—(A)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(5)(vii) of this section (the facts in
Example 7
) except that X is a foreign corporation that is not a U.S. payor under § 1.6049-5(c).
(B)
Analysis with respect to Y's obligations to withhold and report.
Y is not required to report the sales proceeds under the multiple broker exception under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, because X is the person responsible for paying the proceeds from the sale to A.
(C)
Analysis with respect to X's obligations to withhold and report.
Although A is presumed to be a U.S. payee under the presumptions of § 1.6049-5(d)(2), X is not considered to be a broker under paragraph (a)(1) of this section because it is a not a U.S. payor under § 1.6049-5(c)(5). Therefore, X is not required to report the sale under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(h)
Identity of customer
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, a broker or barter exchange shall treat the person who appears on the books and records of the broker or barter exchange with respect to property or services as the principals with respect thereto.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rule of this paragraph (h):

# Example 1.
The records of A, a broker, show an account in the name of “B”. B is a nominee for C. All reporting with respect to such account shall treat B as the customer.

# Example 2.
J, an individual, places an order with H, a broker, to sell J's stock that is held by P, a broker/dealer, in an account for J with P designated as nominee for J, and to credit the gross proceeds from the sale to J's account with P. The account is in the name of P, so that H's customer is P.

(j)
Time and place for filing; cross-references to penalty and magnetic media filing requirements.
Forms 1096 and 1099 required under this section shall be filed after the last calendar day of the reporting period elected by the broker or barter exchange and on or before February 28 of the following calendar year with the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Center, the address of which is listed in the instructions for Form 1096. For a digital asset sale effected prior to January 1, 2025, for which a broker chooses under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section to file an information return, Form 1096 and the Form 1099-B,
Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions,
or the Form 1099-DA,
Digital Asset Proceeds from Broker Transactions,
must be filed on or before February 28 of the calendar year following the year of that sale.
See
paragraph (l) of this section for the requirement to file certain returns on magnetic media. For provisions relating to the penalty provided for the failure to file timely a correct information return under section 6045(a),
see
§ 301.6721-1 of this chapter.
See
§ 301.6724-1 of this chapter for the waiver of a penalty if the failure is due to reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect.
(k)
Requirement and time for furnishing statement; cross-reference to penalty
—(1)
General requirements.
A broker or barter exchange making a return of information under this section must furnish to the person whose identifying number is (or is required to be) shown on the return a written statement showing the information required by paragraph (c)(5), (d), or (f) of this section and containing a legend stating that the information is being reported to the Internal Revenue Service. If the return of information is not made on magnetic media, this requirement may be satisfied by furnishing to the person a copy of all Forms 1099 or any successor form for the person filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center. A statement is considered to be furnished to a person to whom a statement is required to be made under this paragraph (k) if it is mailed to the person at the last address of the person known to the broker or barter exchange.
(2)
Time for furnishing statements.
A broker or barter exchange may furnish the statements required under this paragraph (k) yearly, quarterly, monthly, or on any other basis, without regard to the reporting period the broker or barter exchange elects; however, all statements required to be furnished under this paragraph (k) for a calendar year must be furnished on or before February 15 of the following calendar year.
(3)
Consolidated reporting.
(i) The term
consolidated reporting statement
means a grouping of statements the same broker or barter exchange furnishes to the same customer or group of customers on the same date for the same reporting year that includes a statement required under this section. A consolidated reporting statement is limited to statements based on the same relationship of broker or barter exchange to customer as the statement required to be furnished under this section. For purposes of this paragraph (k)(3)(i), a broker may treat a shareholder of a broker as a customer of the broker and may treat a grouping of statements for a customer as including a statement required to be furnished under this section if the customer has an account with the broker for which a statement would be required to be furnished under this section if the customer purchased and sold stock in a corporation in the account during the year.
(ii) A consolidated reporting statement must be furnished on or before February 15 of the year following the calendar year reported. Any statement that otherwise must be furnished on or before January 31 must be furnished on or before February 15 if it is furnished in the consolidated reporting statement.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (k)(3):

# Example 1.
D has a taxable account with B, a broker, consisting solely of stock in a single corporation. In 2010, D receives reportable dividends from this stock and sells the
stock. Under this section and § 1.6042-4, B must furnish a Form 1099-B, “Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions,” and Form 1099-DIV, “Dividends and Distributions,” to D in 2011 for the sale and the dividends. Under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, B is required to furnish the required statement under this section to D by February 15, 2011. B must furnish the statement reporting the dividends by the January 31, 2011, due date provided in § 1.6042-4. However, under paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section, B must furnish the statement reporting the dividends by February 15, 2011, if furnished in a consolidated reporting statement as defined in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this section.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that D has invested solely in a money market fund for which sales are excepted from the reporting required under this section. B therefore is not required to issue a statement under this section if D sells an interest in the money market fund. Under paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this section, B may treat a grouping of statements for D as including a required statement under this section because D has an account for which a statement would be required under this section if D purchased and sold stock in a corporation in the account during the year. Therefore, under paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section, B must furnish the statement reporting the dividends by February 15, 2011.

# Example 3.
E has a nontaxable IRA account with B, a broker. This account is the only account E holds with B. E sells stock in 2010 in this account. E also receives a cash distribution from the account in 2010. The cash distribution from the IRA is reportable on Form 1099-R, “Distributions From Pensions, Annuities, Retirement or Profit-Sharing Plans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc.,” under § 1.408-7. Because the account is not taxable, sales in the account are not subject to reporting under this section. Therefore, because no statement is required under this section, under paragraph (k)(3) of this section, B may not furnish any statements to E in a consolidated reporting statement. B must furnish the Form 1099-R by the date required under § 1.408-7.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3
except that E and F have a joint taxable account with B. Because sales in the joint taxable account are subject to reporting under this section, under paragraph (k)(3) of this section, B must furnish by February 15, 2011, all customer statements for 2010 that B otherwise must furnish jointly to E and F on or before January 31, 2011, if furnished on the same date in a consolidated reporting statement with the required statements under this section for any sales in the joint taxable account. However, B may not include any statement for E's IRA account in the consolidated reporting statement furnished jointly to E and F because the statements are not furnished to the same customer or group of customers.
(4)
Cross-reference to penalty.
For provisions for failure to furnish timely a correct payee statement,
see
§ 301.6722-1 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations).
See
§ 301.6724-1 of this chapter for the waiver of a penalty if the failure is due to reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect.
(l)
Use of magnetic media or electronic form. See
§ 301.6011-2 of this chapter for rules relating to filing information returns on magnetic media or in electronic form and for rules relating to waivers granted for undue hardship. A broker or barter exchange that fails to file a proper Form 1099 electronically, when required, may be subject to a penalty under section 6721 for each such failure.
See
paragraph (j) of this section.
(m)
Additional rules for option transactions
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (m) provides rules for a broker to determine and report the information required under this section for an option that is a covered security under paragraph (a)(15)(i)(E) or (H) of this section.
(2)
Scope
—(i)
In general.
Paragraph (m) of this section applies to the following types of options granted or acquired on or after January 1, 2014:
(A) An option on one or more specified securities (which includes an index substantially all the components of which are specified securities);
(B) An option on financial attributes of specified securities, such as interest rates or dividend yields; or
(C) A warrant or a stock right.
(ii)
Delayed effective date for certain options
—(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section, if an option, stock right, or warrant is issued as part of an investment unit described in § 1.1273-2(h), paragraph (m) of this section applies to the option, stock right, or warrant if it is acquired on or after January 1, 2016.
(B) Notwithstanding paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section, if the property referenced by an option (that is, the property underlying the option) is a debt instrument that is issued by a non-U.S. person or that provides for one or more payments denominated in,
or determined by reference to, a currency other than the U.S. dollar, paragraph (m) of this section applies to the option if it is granted or acquired on or after January 1, 2016.
(C) Notwithstanding paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section, if an option is an option on a digital asset or an option on derivatives with a digital asset as an underlying property, this paragraph (m) applies to the option if it is granted or acquired on or after January 1, 2026.
(iii)
Compensatory option.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (m)(2)(i) and (m)(2)(ii) of this section, paragraph (m) of this section does not apply to compensatory options.
(3)
Option subject to section 1256.
If an option described in paragraph (m)(2) of this section is also described in section 1256(b), a broker must apply the rules described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section by treating the option as if it were a regulated futures contract and must report the information required under paragraph (c)(5) of this section. A broker is permitted, but not required, to report the amounts for options and the amounts for regulated futures contracts determined under paragraph (c)(5) of this section as a net amount for each reportable item.
(4)
Option not subject to section 1256.
The following rules apply to an option that is described in paragraph (m)(2) of this section but is not also described in paragraph (m)(3) of this section:
(i)
Physical settlement.
For purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, if a specified security (other than an option) is acquired or disposed of pursuant to the exercise of an option, the broker must adjust the basis of the acquired asset or the gross proceeds amount as appropriate to account for any payment related to the option, including the premium.
(ii)
Cash settlement.
For purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, for an option that is settled for cash, a broker must reflect on Form 1099-B all payments made or received on the option. For a purchased option, a broker must report as basis the premium paid plus any costs (for example, commissions) related to the acquisition of the option and must report as proceeds the gross proceeds from settlement minus any costs related to the settlement of the option. For a written option, a broker must report as proceeds the premium received decreased by any amounts paid on the option and report $0 as the basis of the option.
(iii)
Rules for warrants and stock rights acquired in a section 305 distribution.
For a right (including a warrant) to acquire stock received in the same account as the underlying security in a distribution that is described in section 305(a), a broker is permitted, but not required, to apply the rules described in sections 305 and 307 when reporting or accounting for the basis of the option and the underlying equity. If a stock right or warrant is acquired from the initial distributee, the buyer or transferee must treat it as an option covered by either paragraph (m)(4)(i) or (m)(4)(ii) of this section.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules in this paragraph (m)(4):

# Example 1.
(i) On January 15, 2014, C, an individual who is neither a dealer nor a trader in securities, writes a 2-year exchange-traded option on 100 shares of Company X through Broker D. C receives a premium for the option of $100 and pays no commission. In C's hands, the option produces capital gain or loss and Company X stock is a capital asset. On December 16, 2014, C pays $110 to close out the option.
(ii) D is required to report information about the closing transaction because the option is a covered security as described in paragraph (a)(15)(i)(E) of this section and was part of a closing transaction described in paragraph (a)(8) of this section. Under paragraph (m)(4)(ii) of this section, D must report as gross proceeds on C's Form 1099-B -$10 (the $100 received as option premium minus the $110 C paid to close out the option) and report $0 in the basis box on the Form 1099-B. Under section 1234(b)(1) and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, D must also report the loss on the closing transaction as a short-term capital loss.

# Example 2.
(i) On January 15, 2014, E, an individual who is neither a dealer nor a trader in securities, buys a 2-year exchange-traded option on 100 shares of Company X through Broker F. E pays a premium of $100 for the option and pays no commission. In E's hands, both the option and Company X stock are capital assets. On December 16, 2014, E receives $110 to close out the option.
(ii) F is required to report information about the closing transaction because the option is a covered security as described in paragraph (a)(15)(i)(E) of this section and was
part of a closing transaction described in paragraph (a)(8) of this section. Because the option is on the shares of a single company, it is an equity option described in section 1256(g)(6) and is not described in section 1256(b)(1)(C). Therefore, the rules of paragraph (m)(3) of this section do not apply, and F must report under paragraph (m)(4) of this section. Under paragraph (m)(4)(ii) of this section, F must report $110 as gross proceeds on the Form 1099-B for the gross proceeds E received and $100 in the basis box on the Form 1099-B to reflect the $100 option premium paid. Under section 1234(b)(1) and paragraph (d)(2) of this section, F must also report the gain on the closing transaction as a short-term capital gain.
(5)
Multiple options documented in a single contract.
If more than one option described in paragraph (m)(2) of this section is documented in a single contract, a broker must separately report the required information for each option as that option is sold.
(6)
Determination of index status.
Penalties will not be asserted under sections 6721 and 6722 if a broker in good faith determines that an index is, or is not, a narrow-based index described in section 1256(g)(6) and reports in a manner consistent with this determination.
(n)
Reporting for debt instrument transactions
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, this paragraph (n) provides rules for a broker to determine and report information for a debt instrument that is a covered security under paragraph (a)(15)(i)(C) or (D) of this section. Neither a debt instrument subject to section 1272(a)(6) nor a short-term obligation described in section 1272(a)(2)(C) is subject to this paragraph (n) because neither is a specified security under paragraph (a)(14)(ii) of this section (a requirement for a debt instrument to be a covered security).
(2)
Debt instruments subject to January 1, 2014, reporting
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(15)(i)(C) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (n)(2)(ii) of this section, a debt instrument is described in this paragraph (n)(2)(i) if the debt instrument is one of the following:
(A) A debt instrument that provides for a single fixed payment schedule for which a yield and maturity can be determined for the instrument under § 1.1272-1(b);
(B) A debt instrument that provides for alternate payment schedules for which a yield and maturity can be determined for the instrument under § 1.1272-1(c); or
(C) A debt instrument for which the yield of the debt instrument can be determined under § 1.1272-1(d).
(ii)
Exceptions.
A debt instrument is not described in paragraph (n)(2)(i) of this section if the debt instrument is one of the following:
(A) A debt instrument that provides for more than one rate of stated interest (including a debt instrument that provides for stepped interest rates);
(B) A convertible debt instrument described in § 1.1272-1(e);
(C) A stripped bond or stripped coupon subject to section 1286;
(D) A debt instrument that requires payment of either interest or principal in a currency other than the U.S. dollar;
(E) A debt instrument that, at one or more times in the future, entitles a holder to a tax credit;
(F) A debt instrument that provides for a payment-in-kind (PIK) feature (that is, under the terms of the debt instrument, a holder may receive one or more additional debt instruments of the issuer);
(G) A debt instrument issued by a non-U.S. issuer;
(H) A debt instrument for which the terms of the instrument are not reasonably available to the broker within 90 days of the date the debt instrument was acquired by the customer;
(I) A debt instrument that is issued as part of an investment unit described in § 1.1273-2(h); or
(J) A debt instrument evidenced by a physical certificate unless such certificate is held (whether directly or through a nominee, agent, or subsidiary) by a securities depository or by a clearing organization described in § 1.1471-1(b)(18).
(iii)
Remote or incidental.
For purposes of paragraphs (n)(2)(i) and (n)(2)(ii) of this section, a remote or incidental contingency (as determined under § 1.1275-2(h)) is ignored.
(iv)
Penalty rate.
For purposes of paragraph (n)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, a debt instrument does not provide for more than one rate of stated interest
merely because the instrument provides for a penalty interest rate or an adjustment to the stated interest rate in the event of a default or similar event.
(3)
Debt instruments subject to January 1, 2016, reporting.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(15)(i)(D) of this section, a debt instrument is described in this paragraph (n)(3) if it is described in paragraph (n)(2)(ii) of this section or it otherwise is not described in paragraph (n)(2)(i) of this section. For example, this paragraph (n)(3) applies to variable rate debt instruments, inflation-indexed debt instruments, and contingent payment debt instruments because these instruments are not described in paragraph (n)(2)(i) of this section.
(4)
Holder elections.
For purposes of this section, a broker is required to take into account an election described in this paragraph (n)(4), and the broker must take the election into account in accordance with the rules in paragraph (n)(5) of this section. A broker, however, may not take into account any other election.See paragraph (n)(11) of this section for the treatment of an election described in paragraph (n)(4)(iii) of this section (election to accrue market discount based on a constant yield) and an election described in paragraph (n)(4)(iv) of this section (election to treat all interest as OID).
(i)
Election to amortize bond premium.
An election under section 171 and § 1.171-4 to amortize bond premium on a taxable debt instrument (this election applies to all taxable debt instruments held by a taxpayer during the taxable year the election is effective and thereafter; this election may be revoked with the consent of the Commissioner).
(ii)
Election to currently include accrued market discount.
An election under section 1278(b) to include market discount in income as it accrues (this election applies to all debt instruments acquired by a taxpayer during the taxable year the election is effective and thereafter; this election may be revoked with the consent of the Commissioner).
(iii)
Election to accrue market discount based on a constant yield.
An election under section 1276(b)(2) to compute accruals of market discount using a constant yield method (this election is generally made on an instrument-by-instrument basis and must be made for the earliest taxable year for which the taxpayer is required to determine accrued market discount on the debt instrument; this election may not be revoked).
(iv)
Election to treat all interest as OID.
An election under § 1.1272-3 to treat all interest on a taxable debt instrument (adjusted for any acquisition premium or premium) as original issue discount (this election is generally made on an instrument-by-instrument basis and must be made for the taxable year the debt instrument is acquired by the taxpayer; this election may be revoked with the consent of the Commissioner). However, see paragraph (n)(11)(i)(A) of this section for a debt instrument acquired on or after January 1, 2014.
(v)
Election to translate interest income and expense at the spot rate.
An election under § 1.988-2(b)(2)(iii)(B) to translate interest income and expense at the spot rate on the last day of the interest accrual period or, in the case of a partial accrual period, the last day of the taxable year (this election applies to all taxable debt instruments held by a taxpayer during the taxable year the election is effective and thereafter; this election may be revoked with the consent of the Commissioner).
(5)
Broker assumptions and customer notice to brokers
—(i)
Broker assumptions if the customer does not notify the broker.
Except as provided in paragraph (n)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, a broker must report the information required under paragraph (d) of this section by assuming that a customer has made the election to amortize bond premium described in paragraph (n)(4)(i) of this section. In addition, except as provided in paragraph (n)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, a broker must report the information required under paragraph (d) of this section by assuming that a customer has not made an election described in paragraph (n)(4)(ii), (n)(4)(iii), (n)(4)(iv), or (n)(4)(v) of this section. However, see paragraph (n)(11) of this section for the treatment of an election described in paragraph (n)(4)(iii) of this section (election to accrue market discount based on a constant yield) and an election described
in paragraph (n)(4)(iv) of this section (election to treat all interest as OID).
(ii)
Effect of customer notification of an election or revocation
—(A)
Election to amortize bond premium.
If a customer notifies a broker in writing that the customer does not want the broker to take into account the election to amortize bond premium, the broker must report the information required under paragraph (d) of this section without taking into account the election to amortize bond premium. The customer must provide this notification to the broker by the end of the calendar year for which the customer does not want to amortize bond premium. If for a subsequent calendar year, the customer wants the broker to take into account the election to amortize bond premium, the customer must notify the broker in writing by the end of the calendar year that the customer wants to amortize bond premium. If the customer provides such notification, the broker must report the information required under paragraph (d) of this section as if the customer made the election to amortize bond premium for that year.
(B)
Other debt elections.
If a customer notifies a broker in writing that the customer has made or will make an election described in paragraph (n)(4)(ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section, the broker must report the information required under paragraph (d) of this section by taking into account the election. A customer must notify the broker in writing of the election by the end of the calendar year in which a debt instrument subject to the election is acquired in, or transferred into, an account with the broker or, if later, by the end of the calendar year for which the election is effective. If a customer has revoked or will revoke an election described in paragraph (n)(4)(ii), (n)(4)(iv), or (n)(4)(v) of this section for a calendar year, the customer must notify the broker of the revocation in writing by the end of the calendar year for which the revocation is effective. If the customer provides such notification, the broker must report the information required under paragraph (d) of this section by taking into account the revocation.
(iii)
Electronic notification.
For purposes of paragraph (n)(5)(ii) of this section, the written notification to the broker includes a writing in electronic format.
(6)
Reporting of accrued market discount.
In addition to the information required to be reported under paragraph (d) of this section, if a debt instrument is subject to the market discount rules in sections 1276 through 1278, a broker also must report the information described in paragraph (n)(6)(i) or (n)(6)(ii) of this section, whichever is applicable. Such information must be shown in the manner and at the time required by Form 1099 and section 6045.
(i)
Sale.
A broker must report the amount of market discount that has accrued on a debt instrument as of the date of the instrument's sale, as defined in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section.
See
paragraphs (n)(5) and (n)(11)(i)(B) of this section to determine whether the amount reported should take into account a customer election under section 1276(b)(2).
See
paragraph (n)(8) of this section to determine the accrual period to be used to compute the accruals of market discount. This paragraph (n)(6)(i) does not apply if the customer notifies the broker under the rules in paragraph (n)(5) of this section that the customer elects under section 1278(b) to include market discount in income as it accrues.
(ii)
Current inclusion election.
If a customer notifies a broker under the rules in paragraph (n)(5) of this section that the customer elects under section 1278(b) to include market discount in income as it accrues, the broker is required to report to the customer the amount of market discount that accrued on a debt instrument during a taxable year while held by the customer in the account. The broker also must adjust basis in accordance with section 1278(b)(4). If a customer notifies a broker under the rules in paragraph (n)(5) of this section that the customer is revoking its election under section 1278(b), the broker will not report the market discount accrued during the taxable year of the revocation and thereafter and will cease to adjust basis in accordance with section
1278(b)(4). See paragraph (n)(8) of this section to determine the accrual period to be used to compute the accruals of market discount. See paragraphs (n)(5) and (n)(11)(i)(B) of this section to determine whether the amount reported should take into account a customer election under section 1276(b)(2).
(7)
Adjusted basis.
For purposes of this section, a broker must use the rules in paragraph (n) of this section to determine the adjusted basis of a debt instrument.
(i)
Original issue discount.
If a debt instrument is subject to the original issue discount rules in sections 1271 through 1275, section 1286, or section 1288, a broker must increase a customer's basis in the debt instrument by the amount of original issue discount that accrued on the debt instrument while held by the customer in the account. See paragraph (n)(8) of this section to determine the accrual period to be used to compute the accruals of original issue discount.
(ii)
Amortizable bond premium
—(A)
Taxable bond.
A broker is required to adjust the customer's basis for any taxable bond acquired at a premium and held in the account in accordance with § 1.1016-5(b). If a customer, however, informs a broker under the rules in paragraph (n)(5)(ii)(A) of this section that the customer does not want to amortize bond premium, the broker must not adjust the customer's basis for any premium.
(B)
Tax-exempt bonds.
A broker is required to adjust the customer's basis for any tax-exempt obligation acquired at a premium and held in the account in accordance with § 1.1016-5(b).
(iii)
Acquisition premium.
If a debt instrument is acquired at an acquisition premium (as determined under § 1.1272-2(b)(3)), a broker must decrease the customer's basis in the debt instrument by the amount of acquisition premium that is taken into account each year to reduce the amount of the original issue discount that is otherwise includible in the customer's income for that year.
See
§ 1.1272-2(b)(4) to determine the amount of the acquisition premium taken into account each year. However, if a broker took into account a customer election under § 1.1272-3 in 2014, the broker must decrease the customer's basis in the debt instrument by the amount of acquisition premium that is taken into account each year to reduce the amount of the original issue discount that is otherwise includible in the customer's income for that year in accordance with §§ 1.1272-2(b)(5) and 1.1272-3.
(iv)
Market discount.
See paragraph (n)(6) of this section for rules to determine the adjusted basis of a debt instrument with market discount.
(v)
Principal and certain other payments.
A broker must decrease the customer's basis in a debt instrument by the amount of any payment made to the customer during the period the debt instrument is held in the account, other than a payment of qualified stated interest as defined in § 1.1273-1(c).
(8)
Accrual period.
For purposes of this section, a broker generally must use the same accrual period that is used to report any original issue discount or stated interest to a customer under section 6049 for a debt instrument. In any other situation, a broker must use a semi-annual accrual period or, if a debt instrument provides for scheduled payments of principal or interest at regular intervals of less than six months over the entire term of the debt instrument, a broker must use an accrual period equal in length to this shorter interval. For example, if a debt instrument provides for monthly payments of interest over the entire term of the debt instrument, the broker must use a monthly accrual period. The rules in § 1.1272-1(b)(4)(iii) apply for purposes of an initial short accrual period. In computing the length of an accrual period, any reasonable counting convention may be used (for example, 30 days per month/360 days per year, or actual days per month/365 days per year).
(9)
Premium on convertible bond.
If a customer acquires a convertible bond (as defined in § 1.171-1(e)(1)(iii)(C)) at a premium (as determined under § 1.171-1(d)), then, solely for purposes of this section and § 1.6049-9, a broker must assume that the premium is attributable to the conversion feature. Based on this assumption, no portion of the premium is amortizable for purposes of this section and § 1.6049-9.
(10)
Effect of broker assumptions on customer.
The rules in this paragraph (n) only apply for purposes of a broker's reporting obligation under section 6045. A customer is not bound by the assumptions that the broker uses to satisfy the broker's reporting obligations under section 6045. In addition, a notification to the broker under paragraph (n)(5) of this section does not constitute an effective election or revocation under the applicable rules for the election.
(11)
Additional rules for certain holder elections
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the rules in this paragraph (n)(11) apply notwithstanding any other rule in paragraph (n) of this section.
(A)
Election to treat all interest as OID.
A broker must report the information required under paragraph (d) of this section without taking into account any election described in paragraph (n)(4)(iv) of this section (the election to treat all interest as OID in § 1.1272-3). As a result, for example, a broker must determine the amount of any acquisition premium taken into account each year for purposes of this section in accordance with § 1.1272-2(b)(4). This paragraph (n)(11)(i)(A) applies to a debt instrument acquired on or after January 1, 2015. A broker, however, may rely on this paragraph (n)(11)(i)(A) for a debt instrument acquired on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015.
(B)
Election to accrue market discount based on a constant yield.
A broker must report the information required under paragraph (d) of this section by assuming that a customer has made the election described in paragraph (n)(4)(iii) of this section (the election to accrue market discount based on a constant yield). However, if a customer notifies a broker in writing that the customer does not want the broker to take into account this election, the broker must report the information required under paragraph (d) of this section without taking into account this election. The customer must provide this notification to the broker by the end of the calendar year in which the customer acquired the debt instrument in an account with the broker. This paragraph (n)(11)(i)(B) applies to a debt instrument acquired on or after January 1, 2015. A broker, however, may rely on this paragraph (n)(11)(i)(B) to report accrued market discount for a debt instrument that is a covered security acquired on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, if the customer had not informed the broker that the customer had made a section 1278(b) election and there were no principal payments on the debt instrument during this period.
(ii) [Reserved].
(12)
Certain debt instruments treated as noncovered securities
—(i)
In general.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(15) of this section, a debt instrument is treated as a noncovered security for purposes of this section if the terms of the debt instrument are not reasonably available to the broker within 90 days of the date the debt instrument was acquired by the customer and the debt instrument is either—
(A) A debt instrument issued by a non-U.S. issuer; or
(B) A tax-exempt obligation issued before January 1, 2014.
(ii)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (n)(12)(i) of this section applies to a debt instrument described in paragraph (n)(12)(i)(A) or (B) of this section that is acquired on or after February 18, 2016. However, a broker may rely on paragraph (n)(12)(i) of this section for a debt instrument described in paragraph (n)(12)(i)(A) or (B) of this section acquired before February 18, 2016.
(o)
Additional reporting by stock transfer agents.
[Reserved]
(p)
Electronic filing.
Notwithstanding the time prescribed for filing in paragraph (j) of this section, Forms 1096 and 1099 required under this section for reporting periods ending during a calendar year shall, if filed electronically, be filed after the last calendar day of the reporting period elected by the broker or barter exchange and on or before March 31 of the following calendar year.
(q)
Applicability dates.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d)(6)(ix), (m)(2)(ii), and (n)(12)(ii) of this section, and in this paragraph (q), this section applies on or after January 6, 2017. Paragraphs (k)(4) and (l) of this section apply with respect to information returns required to be filed and payee statements required to be furnished on
or after January 1, 2024. (For rules that apply after June 30, 2014, and before January 6, 2017,
see
26 CFR 1.6045-1, as revised April 1, 2016.) Except in the case of a sale of digital assets for real property as described in paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(B) of this section, this section applies to sales of digital assets on or after January 1, 2025. In the case of a sale of digital assets for real property as described in paragraph (a)(9)(ii)(B) of this section, this section applies to sales of digital assets on or after January 1, 2026. For assets that are commodities pursuant to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's certification procedures described in 17 CFR 40.2, this section applies to sales of such commodities on or after January 1, 2025, without regard to the date such certification procedures were undertaken. Paragraphs (a)(21), (b)(2)(ix) through (xi), and (b)(24) and (25) of this section apply to sales of digital assets on or after January 1, 2027. (For sales of digital assets before January 1, 2027,
see
26 CFR 1.6045-1, as revised September 9, 2024.)

(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the definition of a substitute payment in lieu of tax-exempt interest found in paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section.

# Example 1.
On September 1, 1984, L, a broker, borrows 200 State Q Bonds (the interest upon which is exempt from tax under section 103) held in street name for customer R and transfers the bonds to W for use in a short sale. The bonds each have a face value of $100 and bear 12% stated annual interest paid semiannually on January 1 and July 1 of each year. The bonds were not issued with original issue discount. On November 1, 1984, W closes the short sale and returns State Q Bonds to L. On January 1, 1985, L receives a $1200 interest payment (6% × $100 × 200 bonds = $1200) from State Q with respect to R's bonds. Four hundred dollars (2 months the bonds were on loan/6 months in the interest period =
1/3
× $1200 = $400) of the interest payment represents accrued interest on the obligations for the period during which the short sale was open and is a substitute payment in lieu of tax-exempt interest within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section. L must furnish a statement under paragraph (a) of this section to R for calendar year 1985 with respect to the $400 substitute payment.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that W closes the short sale on February 1, 1985. On January 1, 1985, L receives a $1200 payment from W with respect to R's bonds. Eight hundred dollars (4 months the bonds were on loan prior to January 1, 1985/6 months in the interest period =
2/3
× $1200 = $800) of the payment represents accrued interest on the obligation for the period during which the short sale was open and is a substitute payment in lieu of tax-exempt interest. On July 1, 1985, L receives a $1200 payment from State Q. Two hundred dollars (1 month the bonds were on loan after December 31, 1984/6 months in the interest period =
1/6
× $1200 = $200) of the payment represents accrued interest on the obligation for the period during which the short sale was open and is a substitute payment in lieu of the tax-exempt interest. Because both payments are received by L in 1985, L must furnish a statement under paragraph (a) of this section to R for that year with respect to both payments.
(b)
Exceptions
—(1)
Minimal payments.
No statement is required to be furnished under section 6045(d) or this section to any customer if the aggregate amount of the substitute payments received by a broker on behalf of the customer during a calendar year for which a statement must be furnished is less than $10.
(2)
Exempt recipients
—(i)
In general.
A statement shall not be required to be furnished with respect to substitute payments made to a broker on behalf of—

(d)
Time for furnishing statements
—(1)
General requirements.
A broker must furnish the statements required by paragraph (a) of this section for each calendar year. The statements must be furnished after April 30th of the calendar year but in no case before the final substitute payment for the calendar year is made, and on or before February 15 of the following calendar year.
(2)
Consolidated reporting.
(i) The term
consolidated reporting statement
means a grouping of statements the same broker furnishes to the same customer or group of customers on the same date for the same reporting year that includes a statement required under this section. A consolidated reporting statement is limited to statements based on the same relationship of broker to customer as the statement required to be furnished under this section.
(ii) A consolidated reporting statement must be furnished on or before February 15 of the year following the calendar year reported. Any statement that otherwise must be furnished on or before January 31 must be furnished on or before February 15 if it is furnished in the consolidated reporting statement.
(e)
When substitute payment deemed received.
A Broker is deemed to have received a substitute payment on behalf of a customer when the amount is paid or deemed paid to the broker (or as it accrues in the case of original issue discount deemed a payment in lieu of tax-exempt interest).
(f)
Identification of customer and recordkeeping with respect to substitute payments
—(1)
Payments in lieu of tax-exempt interest and exempt-interest dividends.
A broker that receives substitute payments in lieu of tax-exempt interest, exempt-interest dividends, or other items (to the extent specified in a rule-related notice published pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(i)(C) of this section) on behalf of a customer and is required to furnish a statement under paragraph (a) of this section must determine the identity of the customer whose security was transferred and on whose behalf the broker received such substitute payments by specific identification of the record owner of the security so transferred. A broker must keep adequate records of the determination so made.
(2)
Payments in lieu of dividends other than exempt-interest dividends
—(i)
Requirements and methods.
A broker that receives substitute payments in lieu of dividends, other than exempt-interest
dividends, on behalf of a customer and is required to furnish a statement under paragraph (a) of this section must make a determination of the identity of the customer whose stock was transferred and on whose behalf such broker receives substitute payments. Such determination must be made as of the record date with respect to the dividend distribution, and must be made in a consistent manner by the broker in accordance with any of the following methods:
(A) Specific identification of the record owner of the transferred stock;
(B) The method of allocation and selection specified in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section; or
(C) Any other method, with the prior approval of the Commissioner.
A broker must keep adequate records of the determination so made.
(ii)
Method of allocation and selection
—(A)
Allocation to borrowed shares and individual and nonindividual pools.
With respect to each substitute payment in lieu of a dividend received by a broker, the broker must allocate the transferred shares (
i.e.,
the shares giving rise to the substitute payment) among all shares of stock of the same class and issue as the transferred shares which were (
1
) borrowed by the broker, and (
2
) which the broker holds (or has transferred in a transaction described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) and is authorized by its customers to transfer (including shares of stock of the same class and issue held for the broker's own account) (“loanable shares”). The broker may first allocate the transferred shares to any borrowed shares. Then to the extent that the number of transferred shares exceeds the number of borrowed shares (or if the broker does not allocate to the borrowed shares first), the broker must allocate the transferred shares between two pools, one consisting of the loanable shares of all individual customers (the “individual pool”) and the other consisting of the loanable shares of all nonindividual customers (the “nonindividual pool”). The transferred shares must be allocated to the individual pool in the same proportion that the number of loanable shares held by individual customers bears to the total number of loanable shares available to the broker. Similarly, the transferred shares must be allocated to the nonindividual pool in the same proportion that the number of loanable shares held by nonindividual customers bears to the total number of loanable shares available to the broker.
(B)
Selection of deemed transferred shares within the nonindividual pool.
The broker must select which shares within the nonindividual pool are deemed transferred for use in a short sale (the “deemed transferred shares”). Selection of deemed transferred shares may be made either by purely random lottery or on a first-in-first-out (“FIFO”) basis.
(C)
Selection of deemed transferred shares within the individual pool.
The broker must select which shares within the individual pool are deemed transferred shares (in the manner described in the preceding paragraph) only with respect to substitute payments as to which a statement is required to be furnished under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the identification of customer rules of paragraph (f)(2):

# Example 1.
A, a broker, holds X corporation common stock (of which there is only a single class) in street name for five customers: C, a corporation; D, a partnership; E, a corporation; F, an individual; and G, a corporation. C owns 100 shares of X stock, D owns 50 shares of X stock, E owns 100 shares of X stock, F owns 50 shares of X stock, and G owns 100 shares of X stock. A is authorized to loan all of the X stock of C, D, E, and F. G, however, has not authorized A to loan its X stocks. A does not hold any X stock in its trading account nor has A borrowed any X stock from another broker. A transfers 150 shares of X stock to H for use in a short sale on July 1, 1985. A dividend of $2 per share is declared with respect to X stock on August 1, 1985, payable to the owners of record as of August 15, 1985 (the “record” date). A receives $2 per transferred share as a payment in lieu of a dividend with respect to X stock or a total of $300 on September 15, 1985. H closes the short sale and returns X stock to A on January 2, 1986. A's records specifically identify the owner of each loanable share of stock held in street name. From A's records it is determined that the shares transferred to H consisted of 100 shares owned by C, 25 shares owned by D, and 25 shares owned by F. The substitute payment in lieu of dividends
with respect to X stock is therefore attributed to C, D and F based on the actual number of their shares that were transferred to H. Accordingly, C receives $200 (100 shares × $2 per share), and D and F each receive $50 (25 shares each × $2 per share). A must furnish statements identifying the payments as being in lieu of dividends to both C and D, unless they are exempt recipients as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section or exempt foreign persons as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Assuming that A had no reason to know on the record date of the payment that the dividend paid by X is of a type described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, A need not furnish F with a statement under section 6045(d) because F is an individual. (However, A may be required to furnish F with a statement in accordance with section 6042 and the regulations thereunder. See paragraph (h) of this section.) By recording the ownership of each share transferred to H, A has complied with the identification requirement of paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that A's records do not specifically identify the record owner of each share of stock. Rather, all shares of X stock held in street name are pooled together. When A receives the $2 per share payment in lieu of a dividend, A determines the identity of the customers to which the payment relates by the method of allocation and selection prescribed in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. First, the transferred shares are allocated proportionately between the individual pool and the nonindividual pool. One-sixth of the transferred shares or 25 shares are allocated to the individual pool (50 loanable shares owned by individuals/300 total loanable shares-
1/6
;
1/6
× 150 transferred shares = 25 shares). Assuming A has no reason to know by the record date of the payment that the payment is in lieu of a dividend of a type described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, no selection of deemed transferred shares within the individual customer pool is required. (However, A may be required to furnish F with a statement under section 6042 and the regulations thereunder. See paragraph (h) of this section.) Five-sixths of the transferred shares or 125 shares are allocated to the nonindividual pool (250 loanable shares owned by nonindividuals/300 total loanable shares =
5/6
;
5/6
× 150 transferred shares = 125 shares). A must select which 125 shares within the nonindividual pool are deemed to have been transferred. Using a purely random lottery, A selects 100 shares identified as being owned by C, and 25 shares identified as being owned by D. Accordingly, A is deemed to have transferred 100 shares and 25 shares owned by C and D respectively, and received substitute payments in lieu of dividends of $200 (100 shares × $2 per share) and $50 (25 shares × $2 per share) on behalf of C and D respectively. A must furnish statements to both C and D identifying such payments as being in lieu of dividends unless they are exempt recipients as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section or exempt foreign persons as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. A has complied with the identification requirement of paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
(g)
Reporting by brokers
—(1)
Requirement of reporting.
Any broker required to furnish a statement under paragraph (a) of this section shall report on Form 1096 showing such information as may be required by Form 1096, in the form, manner, and number of copies required by Form 1096. With respect to each customer for which a broker is required to furnish a statement, the broker shall make a return of information on Form 1099, in the form, manner and number of copies required by Form 1099.
(2)
Reporting in electronic form.
For information returns filed after December 31, 1996, see § 301.6011-2 of this chapter for rules relating to filing information returns in electronic form and for rules relating to waivers granted for undue hardship. A broker or barter exchange that fails to file a Form 1099 electronically, when required, may be subject to a penalty under section 6721 for each such failure. See paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
(3)
Time and place of filing.
The returns required under this paragraph (g) for any calendar year shall be filed after September 30 of such year, but not before the final substitute payment for the year is received by the broker, and on or before February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically) of the following year with any of the Internal Revenue Service Centers, the addresses of which are listed in the instructions for Form 1096.
(4)
Cross-reference to penalties.
For provisions relating to the penalty provided for failure to file timely a correct information return required under section 6045(d) and § 1.6045-2(g)(1), including a failure to file on magnetic media, see § 301.6721-1 of this chapter. For provisions relating to the penalty provided for failure to furnish timely a correct payee statement required under section 6045(d) and § 1.6045-2(a), see § 301.6722-1 of this chapter. See § 301.6724-1 of this chapter for the waiver of a penalty if
the failure is due to reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect.
(h)
Coordination with section 6042.
In cases in which reporting is required by both sections 6042 and 6045(d) with respect to the same substitute payment in lieu of a dividend, the provisions of section 6045(d) control, and no report or statement under section 6042 need be made. If reporting is not required under section 6045(d) with respect to a substitute payment in lieu of a dividend, a report under section 6042 must be made if required in accordance with the rules of section 6042 and the regulations thereunder. Thus, if a broker receives a substitute payment in lieu of a dividend on behalf of an individual customer and the broker does not have reason to know by the record date of the payment that the payment is in lieu of a dividend of a type described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, the broker must report with respect to the substitute payment if required in accordance with section 6042 and the regulations thereunder.
(i)
Applicability date.
This section applies to substitute payments received by a broker after December 31, 1984. Section 1.6045-2(c) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised July 15, 2014) applies to payee statements due after December 31, 2014. For payee statements due before January 1, 2015, § 1.6045-2(c) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2013) applies.

§ 1.6045-3
Information reporting for an acquisition of control or a substantial change in capital structure.
(a)
In general.
Any broker (as defined in § 1.6045-1(a)(1)) that holds shares on behalf of a customer in a corporation that the broker knows or has reason to know based on readily available information (including, for example, information from a clearing organization or from information published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)) has engaged in a transaction described in § 1.6043-4(c) (acquisition of control) or § 1.6043-4(d) (substantial change in capital structure) shall file a return of information with respect to the customer, unless the customer is an exempt recipient as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)

General requirements.
A broker must furnish Form 1099-B to the customer on
or before February 15 of the year following the calendar year in which the customer receives stock, cash or other property. An IRS truncated taxpayer identifying number (TTIN) may be used as the identifying number of the customer. For provisions relating to the use of TTINs, see § 301.6109-4 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations).
(2)
Consolidated reporting.
(i) The term
consolidated reporting statement
means a grouping of statements the same broker furnishes to the same customer or group of customers on the same date for the same reporting year that includes a statement required under this section. A consolidated reporting statement is limited to statements based on the same relationship of broker to customer as the statement required to be furnished under this section.
(ii) A consolidated reporting statement must be furnished on or before February 15 of the year following the calendar year reported. Any statement that otherwise must be furnished on or before January 31 must be furnished on or before February 15 if it is furnished in the consolidated reporting statement.

[T.D. 9230, 70 FR 72380, Dec. 5, 2005, as amended by T.D. 9504, 75 FR 64097, Oct. 18, 2010; T.D. 9675, 79 FR 41130, July 15, 2014]
§ 1.6045-4
Information reporting on real estate transactions.
(a)
Requirement of reporting.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, a real estate reporting person (“reporting person”) must make an information return with respect to a real estate transaction and, under paragraph (m) of this section, must furnish a statement to the transferor. A reporting person may also report with respect to transactions otherwise excepted in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. However, if the reporting person so elects, the return must be filed and the statement furnished in accordance with the provisions of this section. For the definition of a real estate transaction for purposes of these reporting requirements, see paragraph (b) of this section. For rules for determining the reporting person with respect to a real estate transaction, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)
Definition of real estate transaction
—(1)
In general.
A transaction is a
real estate transaction
under this section if the transaction consists in whole or in part of the sale or exchange of
reportable real estate
(as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) for money, indebtedness, property other than money, or services. The term
sale or exchange
shall include any transaction properly treated as a sale or exchange for Federal income tax purposes, whether or not the transaction is currently taxable. Thus, for example, a sale or exchange of a principal residence is a real estate transaction under this section even though the transferor may be entitled to the special exclusion of gain up to $250,000 (or $500,000 in the case of married persons filing jointly) from the sale or exchange of a principal residence provided by section 121 of the Code.
(2)(i)
Definition of reportable real estate.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the term “reportable real estate” means any present or future ownership interest in—
(A) Land (whether improved or unimproved), including air space;
(B) Any inherently permanent structure, including any residential, commercial or industrial building;
(C) Any condominium unit, including appurtenant fixtures and common elements (including land); or
(D) Any stock in a cooperative housing corporation (as defined in section 216).
(E) Any non-contingent interest in standing timber.
(ii) For purposes of this section, the term “ownership interest” includes fee simple interests, life estates, reversions, remainders, and perpetual easements. In addition, the term “ownership interest” includes any previously created rights to possession or use for all or a portion of any particular year (
i.e.,
a leasehold, easement, or “timeshare”), with a remaining term of at least 30 years, including any period for which such rights may be renewed at the option of the holder of the rights, as determined on the date of closing (as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section). Thus, for example, a pre-existing leasehold on a building with an original term of 99 years is an ownership interest in real estate for purposes of this section if it has a remaining term of 35 years as of the date of closing, but not if it has a remaining term of only 10 years as of the date of closing. However, the term “ownership interest” does not include an option to acquire otherwise reportable real estate. Further, the term “ownership interest” includes any contractual interest in a sale or exchange of standing timber for a lump-sum payment that is fixed and not contingent.
(c)
Exception for certain exempt transactions
—(1)
Certain transfers.
No return of information is required with respect to—
(i) A transaction that is not a sale or exchange (such as a gift (including a transaction treated as a gift under section 1041) or bequest, or a financing or refinancing that is not related to the acquisition of reportable real estate), even if the transaction involves reportable real estate, as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;
(ii) A transfer in full or partial satisfaction of any indebtedness secured by the property so transferred including a foreclosure, a transfer in lieu of foreclosure or an abandonment; or
(iii) A transaction (a “de minimis transfer”) in which it can be determined with certainty that the total consideration (in money, services and property), received or to be received in connection with the transaction is less than $600 in value (determined without regard to any allocation of gross proceeds among multiple transferors under paragraph (i)(5) of this section) as of the date of the closing (as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section), even if the transaction involves reportable real estate. Thus, for example, if a contract for sale of reportable real estate recites total consideration of “$1.00 plus other valuable consideration,” the transfer is not a de minimis transfer unless the reporting person can determine that the “other valuable consideration” received or to be received is less than $599 in value as measured on the date of closing.
(2)
Certain property.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, no return of information is required with respect to a sale or exchange of an interest in any of the following property—provided the sale or exchange of such property is not related to the sale or exchange of reportable real estate—
(i) An interest in surface or subsurface natural resources (for example, water, ores, and other natural deposits) or crops, whether or not such natural resources or crops are severed from the land. For purposes of this section, the terms “natural resources” and “crops” do not include standing timber;
(ii) A burial plot or vault;
(iii) A manufactured structure used as a dwelling that is manufactured and assembled at a location different from that where it is used, but only if such structure is not affixed, at the date of closing (as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section), to a foundation. Thus, a transfer of an unaffixed mobile home that is unrelated to the sale or exchange of reportable real estate is excepted from the reporting requirements of this section; or
(iv) A principal residence (including stock in a cooperative housing corporation) provided the reporting person obtain from the transferor a written certification consistent with guidance that the Secretary has designated or may designate by publication in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal
Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). If a residence has more than one owner, a real estate reporting person must either obtain a certification from each owner (whether married or not) or file an information return and furnish a payee statement for any owner that does not make the certification. The certification must be retained by the reporting person for four years after the year of the sale or exchange of the residence to which the certification applies. A reporting person who relies on a certification made in compliance with this paragraph (c)(2)(iv) will not be liable for penalties under section 6721 of the Code for failure to file an information return, or under section 6722 of the Code for failure to furnish a payee statement to the transferor, unless the reporting person has actual knowledge or reason to know that any assurance is incorrect.
(d)
Exception for certain exempt transferors
—(1)
General rule.
No return of information is required with respect to a transferor that is a corporation under section 7701(a)(3) or section 7704(a) or is considered under paragraph (d)(2) of this section to be—
(i) A corporation;
(ii) A governmental unit; or
(iii) An exempt volume transferor.
In the case of a real estate transaction with respect to which there is one or more exempt transferor(s) and one or more non-exempt transferor(s), the reporting person is required to report with respect to any non-exempt transferor. The special rule for allocation of gross proceeds, as provided in paragraph (i)(5) of this section, applies to such a transaction.
(2)
Treatment as exempt transferor.
Absent actual knowledge to the contrary, a reporting person may treat a transferor as—
(i) A corporation if—
(A) The name of the transferor contains an unambiguous expression of corporate status, such as Incorporated, Inc., Corporation, Corp., or P.C. (but not Company or Co.);
(B) The name of the transferor contains the term “insurance company,” “reinsurance company,” or “assurance company”; or
(C) The transfer or loan documents clearly indicate the corporate status of the transferor;
(ii) A governmental unit if the transferor is—
(A) The United States or a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, or American Samoa, a political subdivision of any of the foregoing, or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing; or
(B) A foreign government, a political subdivision thereof, an international organization, as defined in section 7701(a)(18), or any wholly-owned agency or instrumentality of the foregoing; or
(iii) An exempt volume transferor if, and only if, the reporting person receives a certification of exempt status under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(3)
Certification of exempt status
—(i)
In general.
A certification of exempt status must contain—
(A) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the transferor (the address must be that of the permanent residence (in the case of an individual), that of the principal office (in the case of a corporation or partnership), or that of the permanent residence or principal office of any fiduciary (in the case of a trust or estate));
(B) Sufficient information to identify any otherwise reportable real estate not reported by virtue of the exempt status of the transferor; and
(C) A declaration that the transferor has sold or exchanged during either of the prior two calendar years, or previously sold or exchanged during the current calendar year, or, as of the date of closing (as defined in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section), reasonably expects to sell or exchange during the current calendar year at least 25 separate items of reportable real estate (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) to at least 25 separate transferees, and that each such item, at the date of closing of the sale of such item was or will be held primarily for sale or resale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. For example, the declaration may be worded as follows:
[Insert name of transferor]
[check one or more]:
(1) __ has sold or exchanged during either of the prior two calendar years,
(2) __ previously sold or exchanged during the current calendar year,
(3) __ on the date of closing expects to sell or exchange during the current calendar year,
at least 25 separate items of reportable real estate to at least 25 separate transferees and each such item, at the date of closing of such item was or will be held primarily for sale or resale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.
(ii)
Additional requirements.
A certification of exempt status must be—
(A) Signed under penalties of perjury by the transferor or any person who is authorized to sign a declaration under penalties of perjury in behalf of the transferor as described in section 6061 and the regulations thereunder;
(B) Received by the reporting person no later than the time of closing; and
(C) Retained by the reporting person for four years following the close of the calendar year in which the date of closing (as determined under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section) occurs.
(iii)
Reporting person may accept or disregard certification.
A reporting person may solicit or merely accept a certification of exempt status. Moreover, notwithstanding a transferor's furnishing of such certification, a reporting person may disregard the certification and, instead, report with respect to the transaction. See paragraph (a) of this section for the requirement that such elective reporting must be in compliance with the provisions of this section.
(e)
Person required to report
—(1)
In general.
Although there may be other persons involved in a real estate transaction, only the reporting person is required to report with respect to any real estate transaction. Except as provided in a designation agreement under paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the reporting person with respect to a real estate transaction is—
(i) The person responsible for closing the transaction, as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section; or
(ii) If there is no person responsible for closing the transaction, the person determined to be the reporting person under paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
A person may be the reporting person with respect to a transaction whether or not such person performs or is licensed to perform real estate brokerage services for a commission or fee.
(2)
Employees, agents, and partners.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), if an employee, agent, or partner (other than an employee, agent, or partner of the transferor or the transferee) acting within the scope of such person's employment, agency, or partnership participates in a real estate transaction—
(i) Such participation shall be attributed to such person's employer, principal, or partnership; and
(ii) Only the employer, principal, or partnership (and not such person) may be the reporting person with respect to such transaction as a result of such participation.
However, the participation of a person described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section (
i.e.,
a person listed on the Uniform Settlement Statement as the settlement agent) acting as an agent of another is not attributed to the principal.
(3)
Person responsible for closing the transaction
—(i)
Uniform Settlement Statement used.
If a Uniform Settlement Statement prescribed under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. 2601
et seq.
(a “Uniform Settlement Statement”), is used with respect to the real estate transaction and a person is listed as settlement agent on the statement, such person is the person responsible for closing the transaction. For purposes of this section, a Uniform Settlement Statement shall include any amendments or variations thereto, or substitutions therefore that may hereafter be prescribed under RESPA, provided that any such amended, varied, or substituted form requires disclosure of the parties to the transaction, the application of the proceeds of the transaction, and the identity of the settlement agent or other person responsible for preparing the form.
(ii)
Other closing statement used.
If a Uniform Settlement Statement is not used, or if a Uniform Settlement Statement is used, but no person is listed as settlement agent, the person responsible for closing the transaction is the
person who prepares a closing statement presented to the transferor and transferee at, or in connection with, the closing of the real estate transaction. For purposes of this section, a closing statement is any closing statement, settlement statement (including a Uniform Settlement Statement), or other written document that identifies the transferor and transferee, reasonably identifies the transferred real estate, and describes the manner in which the proceeds payable to the transferor are to be (or were) disbursed at, or in connection with, the closing.
(iii)
No closing statement used or multiple closing statements used.
If no closing statement is used or multiple closing statements are used, the person responsible for closing the transaction is the first-listed of the persons that participate in the transaction as—
(A) The attorney for the transferee who is present at the occasion of the delivery of either the transferee's note or a significant portion of the cash or digital asset proceeds to the transferor, or who prepares or reviews the preparation of the document(s) transferring legal or equitable ownership of the real estate;
(B) The attorney for the transferor who is present at the occasion of the delivery of either the transferee's note or a significant portion of the cash or digital asset proceeds to the transferor, or who prepares or reviews the preparation of the document(s) transferring legal or equitable ownership of the real estate; or
(C) The disbursing title or escrow company that is most significant in terms of gross proceeds disbursed.
If more than one attorney would be the person responsible for closing the transaction under the preceding sentence, the person among such attorneys who is considered responsible for closing the transaction under this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) is the person whose involvement in the transaction is most significant.
(4)
Determination of the real estate reporting person in the absence of a person responsible for closing the transaction.
If no person is responsible for closing the transaction (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3) of this section), the reporting person with respect to the real estate transaction is the person first-listed below of the persons that participate in the transaction as—
(i) The mortgage lender (as defined in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section);
(ii) The transferor's broker (as defined in paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section);
(iii) The transferee's broker (as defined in paragraph (e)(6)(iii) of this section); or
(iv) The transferee (as defined in paragraph (e)(6)(iv) of this section).
(5)
Designation agreement
—(i)
In general.
If a written designation agreement executed at or prior to the time of closing designates one of the persons described in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section as the reporting person with respect to the transaction and the designated person is a party to the agreement, the designated person is the reporting person with respect to the transaction. It is not necessary that all parties to the transaction (or that more than one party) be parties to the agreement.
(ii)
Persons eligible.
A person may be designated as the reporting person under this paragraph (e)(5) only if the person is—
(A) The person responsible for closing the transaction (as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section);
(B) A person described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) (A), (B) or (C) of this section (whether or not such person is responsible for closing the transaction); or
(C) The mortgage lender (as defined in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section).
(iii)
Form of designation agreement.
A designation agreement may be in any form that is consistent with the requirements of this paragraph (e)(5), and may be included on a closing statement with respect to the transaction. The designation agreement must, however, include the name and address of the transferor and transferee and the address and any additional information necessary to identify the real estate transferred. The agreement must identify, by name and address, the person designated as the reporting person with respect to the transaction, and all other parties (if any) to the agreement. All parties to the agreement must date
and sign the agreement and must retain the agreement for four years following the close of the calendar year in which the date of closing (as determined under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section) occurs. Upon request by the Internal Revenue Service, or any person involved in the transaction who did not participate in the designation agreement, the agreement must be made available for inspection.
(6)
Meaning of terms
—(i)
Mortgage lender.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term “mortgage lender” means the person who lends new funds in connection with the transaction, but only if the repayment of such funds is secured in whole or in part by the real estate transferred. If new funds are advanced by more than one person, the mortgage lender is the person who advances the largest amount of new funds. If two or more persons advance equal amounts of new funds and no other person advances a greater amount of new funds, the mortgage lender among the persons advancing such equal amounts is the person with the security interest that is most senior in terms of priority. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(6)(i), any amounts advanced by the transferor are not treated as new funds.
(ii)
Transferor's broker.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term “transferor's broker” means only the broker that contracts with the transferor and is compensated in connection with the transaction.
(iii)
Transferee's broker.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term “transferee's broker” means only the broker that participates to a significant extent in the preparation of the transferee's offer to acquire the real estate or that presents such offer to the transferor. If more than one person is so described, the transferee's broker is the person whose participation in the preparation of the transferee's offer to acquire the real estate is most significant or, in the event there is no such person, the person whose participation in the presentation of the offer is most significant.
(iv)
Transferee.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term “transferee” means the person who acquires the greatest interest in the real estate. If there is no such person, the transferee is the person listed first on the document(s) transferring legal or equitable ownership of the real estate.
(f)
Multiple transferors
—(1)
General rule.
In the case of multiple transferors, each of which transfers an interest in the same reportable real estate, the reporting person shall make a separate information return with respect to each transferor. Paragraph (i)(5) of this section provides rules for the determination of gross proceeds to be reported in the case of multiple transferors.
(2)
Rules for spouses.
Transferors who are husband and wife at the time of closing and hold the reportable real estate as tenants in common, joint tenants, tenants by the entirety, or community property are treated as a single transferor for purposes of paragraphs (f)(1), (h)(1)(i), (i)(5) and (l)(1)(i) of this section, unless the reporting person receives, at or prior to the time of closing, an uncontested allocation of gross proceeds between them. In the case of a husband and wife treated as a single transferor, the reporting person may treat either as the transferor for purposes of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) and (l)(1) of this section, relating to reporting and soliciting taxpayer identification numbers.
(g)
Prescribed form.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (k) of this section, the information return required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be made on Form 1099-S,
Proceeds From Real Estate Transactions
or any successor form.
(h)
Information required
—(1)
In general.
The following information must be set forth on the Form 1099-S required by this section:
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the transferor (
see
also paragraph (f)(2) of this section);

(v) To the extent required by the Form 1099-S and its instructions, an indication that the transferor—
(A) Received (or will, or may, receive) property (other than cash, consideration treated as cash, and digital assets in computing gross proceeds) or services as part of the consideration for the transaction; or
(B) May receive property (other than cash and digital assets) or services in satisfaction of an obligation having a stated principal amount; or
(C) May receive, in connection with a contingent payment transaction, an amount of gross proceeds that cannot be determined with certainty using the method described in paragraph (i)(3)(iii) of this section and is therefore not included in gross proceeds under paragraphs (i)(3)(i) and (iii) of this section;
(vi) The real estate reporting person's name, address, and TIN;
(vii) In the case of a payment made to the transferor using digital assets, the name and number of units of the digital asset, and the date the payment was made;
(viii) [Reserved]
(ix) Any other information required by the Form 1099-S or its instructions.
(2)
Meaning of terms
—(i)
General description of the real estate transferred.
A general description of the real estate transferred includes the complete address of the property. If the address would not sufficiently identify the property, a general description of the real estate also includes a legal description (e.g., section, lot, and block) of the property.
(ii)
Date of closing.
In the case of a real estate transaction with respect to which a Uniform Settlement Statement is used, the date of closing shall be the date (if any) properly described as the “Settlement Date” on such statement. In all other cases, the date of closing shall be the earlier of the date on which title is transferred or the date on which the economic burdens and benefits of ownership of the real estate shift from the transferor to the transferee.
(iii)
Digital assets.
For purposes of this section, a digital asset has the meaning set forth in § 1.6045-1(a)(19).
(3)
Limitation on information provided.
The information required in the case of payment made to the transferor using digital assets under paragraph (h)(1)(vii) of this section and the portion of any gross proceeds attributable to that payment required to be reported by paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section is not required unless the real estate reporting person has actual knowledge or ordinarily would know that digital assets were received by the transferor as payment. For purposes of this limitation, a real estate reporting person is considered to have actual knowledge that payment was made to the transferor using digital assets if the terms of the real estate contract provide for payment using digital assets.
(i)
Gross proceeds
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (i), the term
gross proceeds
means the total cash received, including cash received from a processor of digital asset payments as described in § 1.6045-1(a)(22), consideration treated as cash received, and the value of any digital asset received by or on behalf of the transferor in connection with the real estate transaction.
(i)
Consideration treated as cash.
For purposes of this paragraph (i), consideration treated as cash received by or on behalf of the transferor in connection with the real estate transaction includes the following amounts:
(A) The stated principal amount of any obligation to pay cash to or for the benefit of the transferor in the future (including any obligation having a stated principal amount that may be satisfied by the delivery of property (other than cash) or services);
(B) The amount of any liability of the transferor assumed by the transferee as part of the consideration for the transfer or of any liability to which the real estate acquired is subject (whether or not the transferor is personally liable for the debt); and
(C) In the case of a contingent payment transaction, as defined in paragraph (i)(3)(ii) of this section, the maximum determinable proceeds, as defined in paragraph (i)(3)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Digital assets received.
For purposes of this paragraph (i), the value of any digital asset received means the fair market value in U.S. dollars of the digital asset actually received. Additionally, if the consideration received by the transferor includes an obligation to pay a digital asset to, or for the benefit of, the transferor in the future, the value of any digital asset received includes the fair market value, as of the date and time the obligation is entered into, of the digital assets to be paid as stated principal under such obligation. The fair market value of any digital asset received must be determined based on the valuation rules provided in § 1.6045-1(d)(5)(ii).
(iii)
Other property.
Gross proceeds does not include the value of any property (other than cash, consideration treated as cash, and digital assets) or services received by, or on behalf of, the transferor in connection with the real estate transaction.
See
paragraph (h)(1)(v) of this section for the information that must be included on the Form 1099-S required by this section in cases in which the transferor receives (or will, or may, receive) property (other than cash, consideration treated as cash, and digital assets) or services as part of the consideration for the transfer.
(2)
Treatment of sales commissions and similar expenses.
In computing gross proceeds, the total cash, consideration treated as cash, and digital assets received by or on behalf of the transferor shall not be reduced by expenses borne by the transferor (such as sales commissions, amounts paid or withheld from consideration received to effect the digital asset transfer as described in § 1.1001-7(b)(2), expenses of advertising the real estate, expenses of preparing the deed, and the cost of legal services in connection with the transfer).
(3)
Special rules for contingent payments
—(i)
In general.
If a real estate transaction is a contingent payment transaction, gross proceeds consist of the maximum determinable proceeds, if any.
(ii)
Contingent payment transaction.
For purposes of this section, the term
contingent payment transaction
means a real estate transaction with respect to which the receipt, by or on behalf of the transferor, of cash, consideration treated as cash under paragraph (i)(1)(i)(A) of this section, or digital assets under paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section is subject to a contingency.
(iii)
Maximum determinable proceeds.
For purposes of this section, the term “maximum determinable proceeds” means the gross proceeds determined by assuming that all of the contingencies contemplated by the documents available at closing are met or otherwise resolved in a manner that will maximize the gross proceeds. If the maximum amount of gross proceeds cannot be determined with certainty using this method, the maximum determinable proceeds are the greatest amount that can be determined with certainty using this method. See paragraph (h)(1)(v)(C) of this section for the information that must be included on the Form 1099 required by this section in cases in which the maximum amount of gross proceeds cannot, by using the method described in this paragraph (i)(3)(iii), be determined with certainty.
(4)
Uniform Settlement Statement used.
If a Uniform Settlement Statement is used with respect to a real estate transaction involving a transfer of reportable real estate solely for cash and consideration treated as cash in computing gross proceeds, the gross proceeds generally will be the same amount as the contract sales price properly shown on that statement.
(5)
Special rules for multiple transferors
—(i)
General rules.
In the case of multiple transferors (within the meaning of paragraph (f) of this section) each of which transfers an interest in the same reportable real estate, the reporting person must request the transferors to provide an allocation of the gross proceeds among the transferors. The request must be made at or before the time of closing. Neither the request nor the response is required to be in writing. The reporting person must make a reasonable effort to contact all
transferors of whom the reporting person has actual knowledge. The reporting person may, however, rely on the unchallenged response of any transferor and need not make additional efforts to contact other transferors after at least one complete allocation (whether or not contained in a single response) is received. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (i)(5), the reporting person shall report the gross proceeds in accordance with any allocation received at or before the time of closing. The reporting person may (but is not required to) report the gross proceeds in accordance with any allocation received after the time of closing and before the date (determined without regard to extensions) the Forms 1099 are required to be filed. The reporting person may not report the gross proceeds in accordance with any allocation received on or after the date (determined without regard to extensions) the Forms 1099 are required to be filed. If no gross proceeds are allocated to a transferor because no allocation or an incomplete allocation is received by the reporting person, the reporting person shall report the entire unallocated gross proceeds (if any) on the return of information made with respect to such transferor. If the reporting person receives conflicting allocations from the transferors, the reporting person shall report the entire gross proceeds on each return of information made with respect to the transaction.
(ii)
Rules for spouses.
The reporting person need not request an allocation of gross proceeds if the only transferors are husband and wife at the time of closing. If there are other transferors, the reporting person need only make a reasonable effort to contact either the husband or wife in connection with the request for an allocation. See paragraph (f)(2) of this section for rules that treat a husband and wife as multiple transferors if an uncontested allocation of gross proceeds is received by the reporting person at or prior to the time of closing.
(6)
Multiple asset transactions.
In the case of a real estate transaction reportable under this section that involves the transfer of reportable real estate and other assets, the amount attributable to both the real estate and other assets is treated as the gross proceeds with respect to that real estate transaction. No allocation of gross proceeds is made among the assets.
(j)
Time and place for filing.
A reporting person shall file the information returns required by this section with respect to a real estate transaction after December 31 of the calendar year that includes the date of closing (as determined under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section) and on or before February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically) of the following calendar year. The returns shall be filed with the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Center at the address listed in the Instructions to Form 1099.
(k) [Reserved]
(l)
Requesting taxpayer identification numbers (TINS)
—(1)
Solicitation
—(i)
General requirements.
A reporting person who is required to make an information return with respect to a real estate transaction under this section must solicit a TIN from the transferor at or before the time of closing. The solicitation may be made in person or in a mailing that includes other items. Any person whose TIN is solicited under this paragraph (l) must furnish such TIN to the reporting person and certify that the TIN is correct. See paragraph (f)(2) of this section for rules that treat a husband and wife as a single transferor (and provide for the TIN solicitation of either) in the absence of an allocation of gross proceeds under paragraph (i)(5) of this section.
(ii)
Content of solicitation.
The solicitation shall be made by providing to the person from whom the TIN is solicited a written statement that the person is required by law to furnish a correct TIN to the reporting person, and that the person may be subject to civil or criminal penalties for failing to furnish a correct TIN. For example, the solicitation may be worded as follows:
You are required by law to provide [insert name of reporting person] with your correct taxpayer identification number. If you do not provide [insert name of reporting person] with your correct taxpayer identification number, you may be subject to civil or criminal penalties imposed by law.
The solicitation shall contain space for the name, address, and TIN of the person from whom the TIN is solicited and
for the person to certify under penalties of perjury that the TIN furnished is that person's correct TIN. The wording of the certification must be substantially similar to the following: “Under penalties of perjury, I certify that the number shown on this statement is my correct taxpayer identification number.” The requirements of this paragraph (l)(1)(ii) may be met by providing to the transferor a copy of Form W-9. In the case of a real estate transaction for which a Uniform Settlement Statement is used, the requirements of this paragraph (l)(1)(ii) may be met by providing to the transferor a copy of such statement that is modified to conform to the requirements of this paragraph (l)(1)(ii).
(iii)
Retention requirement.
The solicitation shall be retained by the reporting person for four years following the close of the calendar year that includes the date of closing (as determined under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section). Such solicitation must be made available for inspection upon request by the Internal Revenue Service.
(2)
No TIN provided.
A reporting person that does not receive the transferor's TIN will not be subject to any penalty cross-referenced in paragraph (n) of this section by reason of failure to report such TIN if the reporting person has complied with the requirements of paragraph (l)(1) of this section in good faith (determined with proper regard for a course of conduct and the overall results achieved for the year).
(m)
Furnishing statements to transferors
—(1)(i)
Requirement of furnishing statements.
A reporting person who is required to make a return of information under paragraph (a) of this section shall furnish to the transferor whose TIN is required to be shown on the return a written statement of the information required to be shown on such return. The written statement must bear either the legend shown on the recipient copy of Form 1099 or the following: “This is important tax information and is being furnished to the Internal Revenue Service. If you are required to file a return, a negligence penalty or other sanction may be imposed on you if this item is required to be reported and the IRS determines that it has not been reported.”
(ii) This requirement may be satisfied by furnishing to the transferor a copy of a completed Form 1099 (or substitute Form 1099 that complies with current revenue procedures). An IRS truncated taxpayer identifying number (TTIN) may be used as the identifying number of the transferor in lieu of the identifying number appearing on the information return filed with the Internal Revenue Service. For provisions relating to the use of TTINs, see § 301.6109-4 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations).
(iii) In the case of a real estate transaction for which a Uniform Settlement Statement is used, this requirement also may be satisfied by furnishing to the transferor a copy of a completed statement that is modified to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (m), and by designating on the Uniform Settlement Statement the items of information (such as gross proceeds or allocated gross proceeds) required to be set forth on the Form 1099. For purposes of this paragraph (m), a statement shall be considered furnished to a transferor if it is given to the transferor in person, either at the closing or thereafter, or is mailed to the transferor at the transferor's last known address.
(2)
Time for furnishing statement.
The statement required under this paragraph (m) must be furnished to the transferor on or after the date of closing and on or before February 15 of the following calendar year.
(3)
Consolidated reporting.
(i) The term
consolidated reporting statement
means a grouping of statements the same reporting person furnishes to the same transferor or group of transferors on the same date for the same reporting year that includes a statement required under this section. A consolidated reporting statement is limited to statements based on the same relationship of reporting person to transferor as the statement required to be furnished under this section.
(ii) A consolidated reporting statement must be furnished on or before February 15 of the year following the calendar year reported. Any statement that otherwise must be furnished on or before January 31 must be furnished on or before February 15 if it is furnished
in the consolidated reporting statement.
(n)
Cross-reference to penalties.
See the following sections regarding penalties for failure to comply with the requirements of section 6045(e) and this section:
(1) Section 6721 for failure to file a correct information return;
(2) Section 6722 for failure to furnish a correct statement to the transferor;
(3) Section 6723 for failure to comply with other information reporting requirements (including the requirement to furnish a TIN);
(4) Section 6724 for definitions and rules relating to waiver and payment; and
(5) Section 7203 for willful failure to supply information (including a taxpayer identification number).
(o)
No separate charge.
A reporting person may not separately charge any person involved in a real estate transaction for complying with any requirements of this section. A reporting person may, however, take into account its cost of complying with such requirements in establishing its fees (other than in charging a separate fee for complying with such requirements) to any customer for performing services in the case of a real estate transaction.
(p)
Backup withholding requirements.

(q)
Federally-subsidized indebtedness.

(r)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section:
(1)
Example 1. Sale or exchange.
(i) On June 1, 1991, A, an individual, buys a house from B, an individual, for $200,000. The entire $200,000 is financed by B under an “installment land contract,” whereby A takes possession and assumes all significant economic benefits and burdens of ownership of the house, and B retains legal title to the property until A fully performs under the contract. On June 1, 1994, A refinances his purchase of the house with Z, a financial institution. The balance owed to B is repaid and B relinquishes title to the house. A retains possession and the benefits and burdens of ownership of the house.
(ii) For federal income tax purposes, the transaction occurring on June 1, 1991 is considered a sale of the house by B, notwithstanding his retention of legal title to the property. B's sale is subject to information reporting under this section. However, the transaction occurring on June 1, 1994 is not a sale or exchange for federal income tax purposes, and notwithstanding the change in legal title upon the deeding over of the property, that transaction is not subject to information reporting under this section.
(2)
Example 2. Sale or exchange.
On August 10, 1991, C, an individual, accepts an offer from Y, a corporation that acts on behalf of T (C's employer) to facilitate moves of T's transferred employees from one part of the country to another. Under the offer, C transfers his residence to Y for $250,000 by executing a deed to the property in blank and giving Y a power of attorney to dispose of the residence. C also immediately vacates the residence, whereupon Y begins paying all costs associated with the residence and is entitled to all income from the residence, including sales proceeds. On October 1, 1991, Y sells the residence to D and inserts C's name in the deed previously executed by C. Thus, neither Y nor T ever become record owners of the residence. C's transfer of the residence to Y on August 10, 1991 is a sale of reportable real estate and is subject to information reporting under this section; however, the sale on October 1, 1991 is not required to be reported because Y (the transferor in that sale) is a corporation. See paragraph (d) of this section.
(3)
Example 3. Definition of ownership interest.
E, an individual, owns a perpetual timeshare interest in a residential unit of real property at an oceanfront resort. For consideration, on November 15, 1991, E sells her rights in the property for the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992 to F. The transfer of E's property interest is not the transfer of an ownership interest, as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and therefore is not reportable real estate under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Accordingly, the transfer is not a real estate transaction under paragraph (b)(1) of this section,
and no return of information is required with respect to E's property transfer.
(4)
Example 4. Gross proceeds (exchange).
(i) G, an individual, agrees to transfer Blackacre, which has a fair market value of $100,000, plus $10,000 cash to H, an individual, in exchange for Whiteacre, which as a fair market value of $120,000 and is encumbered by a $10,000 liability (which is assumed by G). No other liabilities are involved in the transaction. P is the reporting person with respect to both sides of the transaction.
(ii) With respect to the transfer of Blackacre by G to H, P must report gross proceeds of $-0- (even though the exchange agreement may recite total exchange value of $120,000). See paragraph (i)(1) of this section. In addition, (to the extent required by the Form 1099 and its instructions) P must indicate that G will receive property as part of the consideration for the transaction. See paragraph (h)(v)(A) of this section.
(iii) With respect to the transfer of Whiteacre by H to G, P must report gross proceeds of $20,000 (the amount received by H consisting of cash ($10,000) and consideration treated as cash ($10,000) under paragraph (i) of this section). No other amount is reported under paragraph (i)(1) of this section even though the exchange agreement may recite total exchange value of $120,000. In addition, (to the extent required by the Form 1099 and its instructions) P must indicate that H will receive property as part of the consideration for the transaction. See paragraph (h)(v)(A) of this section.
(5) [Reserved]
(6)
Example 6. Gross proceeds (contingencies).
K, an individual, sells an unencumbered apartment building to L for $500,000, payable at closing, plus an amount equal to 2% of gross rents from the apartment building for each of the next 5 years, the contingent payments to be made annually with adequate stated interest. The agreement provides that the maximum amount K may receive (including the downpayment but excluding the interest) is $600,000. Under paragraph (i)(3)(ii) of this section the real estate transaction is a “contingent payment transaction.” Under paragraph (i)(3)(iii) of this section, the maximum amount of gross proceeds determined by assuming all contingencies are satisfied is $600,000. Thus, $600,000 is the “maximum determinable proceeds” and is the amount reported.
(7)
Example 7: Gross proceeds (contingencies).
The facts are the same as in paragraph (r)(6) of this section (the facts in
Example 6
), except that the agreement does not provide for adequate stated interest. The result is the same as in paragraph (r)(6) of this section (the results in
Example 6
).
(8)
Example 8. Gross proceeds (contingencies).
The facts are same as in paragraph (r)(6) of this section (the facts in
Example 6
), except that no maximum amount is stated in the agreement (or any other document available at closing). Under paragraph (i)(3)(iii) of this section, assuming all contingencies are satisfied, the maximum amount of gross proceeds cannot be determined with certainty. The greatest amount that can be determined with certainty at the time of the closing, assuming all contingencies are satisfied, is $500,000, the cash downpayment. Therefore, $500,000 is the “maximum determinable proceeds” under paragraph (i)(3)(iii) of this section and is the amount reported. In addition, (to the extent required by the Form 1099 and its instructions) the reporting person must indicate that the gross proceeds cannot be determined with certainty. See paragraph (h)(1)(iv)(C) of this section.
(9)
Example 9. Gross proceeds (contingencies).
The facts are the same as in paragraph (r)(8) of this section (the facts in
Example 8
), except that the agreement provides that the minimum amount K will receive (including the downpayment) is $570,000. Thus, under paragraph (i)(3)(iii) of this section, assuming all contingencies are satisfied, the maximum amount of gross proceeds cannot be determined with certainty. The greatest amount that can be determined with certainty at the time of the closing, assuming all contingencies are satisfied, is $570,000, the minimum amount stated in the agreement. Therefore, $570,000 is the “maximum determinable proceeds” under paragraph (i)(3)(iii) of this section and is the amount reported. In addition, (to
the extent required by the Form 1099 and its instructions) the reporting person must indicate that the gross proceeds cannot be determined with certainty. See paragraph (h)(1)(iv)(C) of this section.
(10)
Example 10: Gross proceeds (exchange involving digital assets)
—(i)
Facts.
K, an individual, agrees in a contract for sale to pay 140 units of digital asset DE with a total fair market value of $280,000 to J, an unmarried individual who is not an exempt transferor, in exchange for Whiteacre, which has a fair market value of $280,000. No liabilities are involved in the transaction. P is the reporting person with respect to both sides of the transaction.
(ii)
Analysis.
P has actual knowledge that payment was made to J using digital assets because the terms of the real estate contract provide for payment using digital assets. Accordingly, with respect to the payment by K of 140 units of digital asset DE to J, P must report gross proceeds received by J of $280,000 (140 units of DE) on Form 1099-S,
Proceeds From Real Estate Transactions.
Additionally, to the extent K is not an exempt recipient under § 1.6045-1(c) or an exempt foreign person under § 1.6045-1(g), P is required to report gross proceeds paid to K on Form 1099-DA,
Digital Asset Proceeds from Broker Transactions,
with respect to K's sale of 140 units of digital asset DE, in the amount of $280,000 pursuant to § 1.6045-1.
(s)
Applicability date.
This section applies for real estate transactions with dates of closing (as determined under paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section) that occur on or after January 1, 1991. Section 1.6045-4(b)(2)(i)(E), (b)(2)(ii), and (c)(2)(i) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised May 28, 2009) applies to sales or exchanges of standing timber for lump-sum payments completed after May 28, 2009. Section 1.6045-4(m)(1) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised July 15, 2014) applies to payee statements due after December 31, 2014. For payee statements due before January 1, 2015, § 1.6045-4(m)(1) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 2013) applies.

§ 1.6045-5
Information reporting on payments to attorneys.
(a)
Requirement of reporting

In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, every payor engaged in a trade or business who, in the course of that trade or business, makes payments aggregating $600 or more during a calendar year to an attorney in connection with legal services (whether or not the services are performed for the payor) must file an information return for such payments. The information return must be filed on the form and in the manner required by the Commissioner. For the time and place for filing the form, see § 1.6041-6. For definitions of the terms under this section, see paragraph (d) of this section. The requirements of this paragraph (a)(1) apply whether or not—

(iii) The amount of the payment or payments (as defined in paragraph (d)(5) of this section); and
(iv) Any other information required by the Commissioner in forms, instructions or publications.
(3)
Requirement to furnish statement
—(i)
General requirements.
A person required to file an information return under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must furnish to the attorney a written statement of the information required to be shown on the return. This requirement may be met by furnishing a copy of the return to the attorney. An IRS truncated taxpayer identifying number (TTIN) may be used as the identifying number of the attorney in lieu of the identifying number appearing on the information return filed with the Internal Revenue Service. For provisions relating to the use of TTINs, see § 301.6109-4 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations). The written statement must be furnished to the attorney on or before February 15 of the year following the calendar year in which the payment was made.
(ii)
Consolidated reporting.
(A) The term
consolidated reporting statement
means a grouping of statements the same payor furnishes to the same payee or group of payees on the same date for the same reporting year that includes a statement required under this section. A consolidated reporting statement is limited to statements based on the same relationship of payor to payee as the statement required to be furnished under this section.
(B) A consolidated reporting statement must be furnished on or before February 15 of the year following the calendar year reported. Any statement that otherwise must be furnished on or before January 31 must be furnished on or before February 15 if it is furnished in the consolidated reporting statement.
(b)
Special rules
—(1)
Joint or multiple payees
—(i)
Check delivered to one payee attorney.
If more than one attorney is listed as a payee on a check, an information return must be filed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to the payee attorney to whom the check is delivered.
(ii)
Check delivered to payee nonattorney.
If an attorney is listed as a payee on a check but the check is delivered to a nonattorney who is a payee on the check, an information return must be filed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to the payee attorney listed on the check. If more than one attorney is listed as a payee on a check but the check is delivered to a nonattorney who is a payee on the check, the information return must be filed with respect to the first-listed payee attorney on the check.
(iii)
Check delivered to nonpayee.
If two or more attorneys are listed as payees on a check, but the check is delivered to a person who is not a payee on the check, an information return must be filed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to the first-listed payee attorney on the check.
(2)
Attorney required to report payments made to other attorneys.
If an information return is required to be filed with respect to a payee attorney under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the attorney with respect to whom the information return is required to be filed (tier-one attorney) must file an information return under this section for any payment that the tier-one attorney makes to other payee attorneys with respect to that check, regardless of whether the tier-one attorney is a payor under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(c)
Exceptions.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a return of information is not required under section 6045(f) with respect to the following payments:
(1) Payments of wages or other compensation paid to an attorney by the attorney's employer.
(2) Payments of compensation or profits paid or distributed to its partners by a partnership engaged in providing legal services.
(3) Payments of dividends or corporate earnings and profits paid to its shareholders by a corporation engaged in providing legal services.
(4) Payments made by a person to the extent that the person is required to report with respect to the same payee the payments or portions thereof under section 6041(a) and § 1.6041-1(a) (or would be required to so report the payments or portions thereof but for the dollar amount limitation contained in section 6041(a) and § 1.6041-1(a)).
(5) Payments made to a nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation that is not engaged in trade or business within the United
States, and does not perform any labor or personal services in the United States, in the taxable year to which the payment relates. For how a payor determines whether a payment is subject to this exception, see § 1.6041-4(a)(1).
(6) Payments made to an attorney in the attorney's capacity as the person responsible for closing a transaction within the meaning of § 1.6045-4(e)(3) for the sale or exchange or financing of any present or future ownership interest in real estate described in § 1.6045-4(b)(2)(i) through (iv).
(7) Payments made to an attorney in the attorney's capacity as a trustee in bankruptcy under title 11, United States Code.
(d)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:
(1)
Attorney
means a person engaged in the practice of law, whether as a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or joint venture.
(2)
Legal services
means all services related to, or in support of, the practice of law performed by, or under the supervision of, an attorney.
(3)
Payor
means a person who makes a payment if that person is an obligor on the payment, or the obligor's insurer or guarantor. For example, a payor includes—
(i) A person who pays a settlement amount to an attorney of a client who has asserted a tort, contract, violation of law, or workers' compensation claim against that person; and
(ii) The person's insurer if the insurer pays the settlement amount to the attorney.
(4)
Payments to an attorney
include payments by check or other method such as cash, wire or electronic transfer. Payment by check to an attorney means a check on which the attorney is named as a sole, joint, or alternative payee. The attorney is the payee on a check written to the attorney's client trust fund. However, the attorney is not a payee when the attorney's name is included on the payee line as “in care of,” such as a check written to “client c/o attorney,” or if the attorney's name is included on the check in any other manner that does not give the attorney the right to negotiate the check.
(5)
Amount of the payment
means the amount tendered (e.g., the amount of a check) plus the amount required to be withheld from the payment under section 3406(a)(1), because a condition for withholding exists with respect to the attorney for whom an information return is required to be filed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(e)
Attorney to furnish TIN.
A payor that is required to file an information return under this section must solicit a TIN from the attorney at or before the time the payor makes a payment to the attorney. The attorney must furnish the correct TIN to the payor, but is not required to certify the TIN. A payment for which a return of information is required under this section is subject to backup withholding under section 3406 and the regulations thereunder.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section. The examples assume that P is not a payor with respect to A, the attorney, under section 6041. See section 6041 and the regulations thereunder for rules regarding whether P is required under section 6041 to file information returns with respect to C. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1. One check—joint payees—taxable to claimant.
Employee C, who sues employer P for back wages, is represented by attorney A. P settles the suit for $300,000. The $300,000 represents taxable wages to C under existing legal principles. P writes a settlement check payable jointly to C and A in the amount of $200,000, net of income and FICA tax withholding with respect to C. P delivers the check to A. A retains $100,000 of the payment as compensation for legal services and disburses the remaining $100,000 to C. P must file an information return with respect to A for $200,000 under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. P also must file an information return with respect to C under sections 6041 and 6051, in the amount of $300,000. See §§ 1.6041-1(f) and 1.6041-2.

# Example 2. One check—joint payees—excludable to claimant.
C, who sues corporation P for damages on account of personal physical injuries, is represented by attorney A. P settles the suit for a $300,000 damage payment that is excludable from C's gross income under section 104(a)(2). P writes a $300,000 settlement check payable jointly to C and A and delivers the check to A. A retains $120,000 of the payment as compensation for legal services and remits the remaining
$180,000 to C. P must file an information return with respect to A for $300,000 under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. P does not file an information return with respect to tax-free damages paid to C.

# Example 3. Separate checks—taxable to claimant.
C, an individual plaintiff in a suit for lost profits against corporation P, is represented by attorney A. P settles the suit for $300,000, all of which will be includible in C's gross income. A requests P to write two checks, one payable to A in the amount of $100,000 as compensation for legal services and the other payable to C in the amount of $200,000. P writes the checks in accordance with A's instructions and delivers both checks to A. P must file an information return with respect to A for $100,000 under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Pursuant to § 1.6041-1(a) and (f), P must file an information return with respect to C for the $300,000.

# Example 4. Check made payable to claimant, but delivered to nonpayee attorney.
Corporation P is a defendant in a suit for damages in which C, the plaintiff, has been represented by attorney A throughout the proceeding. P settles the suit for $300,000. Pursuant to a request by A, P writes the $300,000 settlement check payable solely to C and delivers it to A at A's office. P is not required to file an information return under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to A, because there is no payment to an attorney within the meaning of paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

# Example 5. Multiple attorneys listed as payees.
Corporation P, a defendant, settles a lost profits suit brought by C for $300,000 by issuing a check naming C's attorneys, Y, A, and Z, as payees in that order. Y, A, and Z do not belong to the same law firm. P delivers the payment to A's office. A deposits the check proceeds into a trust account and makes payments by separate checks to Y of $30,000 and to Z of $15,000, as compensation for legal services, pursuant to authorization from C to pay these amounts. A also makes a payment by check of $155,000 to C. A retains $100,000 as compensation for legal services. P must file an information return for $300,000 with respect to A under paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1)(i) of this section. A, in turn, must file information returns with respect to Y of $30,000 and to Z of $15,000 under paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(2) of this section because A is not required to file information returns under section 6041 with respect to A's payments to Y and Z because A's role in making the payments to Y and Z is merely ministerial. See § 1.6041-1(e)(1), (e)(2) and (e)(5)
Example 7
for information reporting requirements with respect to A's payments to Y and Z. As described in
Example 3
, P must also file an information return with respect to C, pursuant to § 1.6041-1(a) and (f).

# Example 6. Amount of the payment—attorney does not provide TIN.
(i) Corporation P, a defendant, settles a suit brought by C for $300,000 of damages. P will pay the damages by a joint check to C and his attorney, A. A failed to furnish P with A's TIN. P is required to deduct and withhold 28 percent tax from the $300,000 under section 3406(a)(1)(A) and paragraph (e) of this section. P writes the check to C and A as joint payees, in the amount of $216,000. P also must file an information return with respect to A under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the amount of $300,000, as prescribed in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. If the damages are reportable under section 6041 because they are not excludable from gross income under existing legal principles, and are not subject to any exception under section 6041, P must also file an information return with respect to C pursuant to § 1.6041-1(a) and (f) in the amount of $300,000.
(ii) Rather than paying by joint check to C and A, P will pay the damages by a joint check to C and F, A's law firm. F failed to furnish its TIN to P. P is required to deduct and withhold 28 percent tax from the $300,000 under section 3406(a)(1)(A) and paragraph (e) of this section. P writes the check to C and F as joint payees, in the amount of $216,000. P also must file an information return with respect to F under paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the amount of $300,000, as prescribed in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. If the damages are reportable under section 6041 because they are not excludable from gross income under existing legal principles, and are not subject to any exception under section 6041, P must also file an information return with respect to C pursuant to § 1.6041-1(a) and (f) in the amount of $300,000.

# Example 7. Home mortgage lending transaction.
(i) Individual P agrees to purchase a house that P will use solely as a residence. P obtains a loan from lender L to finance a portion of the cost of acquiring the house. L disburses loan proceeds of $300,000 to attorney A, who is the settlement agent, by a check naming A as the sole payee. A, in turn, writes checks from the loan proceeds and from other funds provided by P to the persons involved in the purchase of the house, including a check for $800 to attorney B, whom P hired to provide P with legal services relating to the closing.
(ii) P, not L, is the payor of the payment to A under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. P, however, is not required to file an information return with respect to A under paragraph (a)(1) of this section because the payment was not made in the course of P's trade or business. Even if P made the payment in the course of P's trade or business, P would not be required to file an information return under section 6045(f) with respect to A because P is excepted under paragraph (c)(6) of this section.
(iii) A is not required to file an information return under paragraph (a)(1) of this
section with respect to the payment to B because A is not the payor as that term is defined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. A is not required to file an information return under paragraph (b)(2) with respect to the payment to B because A was listed as sole payee on the check it received from P. See section 6041 and § 1.6041-1(e) for whether A or L must file information returns under that section. See section 6045(e) and § 1.6045-4 for whether A is required to file an information return under that section.

# Example 8. Business mortgage lending transaction.
The facts are the same as in
Example 7
except that P buys real property that P will use in a trade or business. P, not L, is the payor of the payment to A under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. P, however, is not required to file an information return under section 6045(f) with respect to A because P is excepted under paragraph (c)(6) of this section. A is not required to file an information return under paragraphs (a) or (b)(2) of this section with respect to the payment to B. See section 6041 and § 1.6041-1(e) to determine whether P or L must file an information return under that section with respect to the payment to A, and whether P or A must file a return with respect to the payment to B. See section 6045(e) for rules regarding whether A is required to file information returns under that section.

# Example 9. Qualified settlement fund.
Corporation P agrees to settle for $300,000 a class action lawsuit brought by attorney A on behalf of a claimant class. Pursuant to the settlement agreement and a preliminary order of approval by a court, A establishes a bank account in the name of Q Settlement Fund, which is a qualified settlement fund (QSF) under § 1.468B-1. A is also designated by the court as the administrator of the QSF. Corporation P transfers $300,000 by wire in Year 1 to A, who deposits the funds into the Q Settlement Fund. In Year 2, the court approves an award of attorney's fees of $105,000 for A. In Year 2, Q Settlement Fund delivers $105,000 to A. P is required to file an information return under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to A for Year 1 for the $300,000 payment it made to A. The Q Settlement Fund is required to file an information return under section 6041(a) and § 1.468B-2(l)(2) with respect to A for Year 2 for the $105,000 payment it made to A.

§ 1.6045A-1
Statements of information required in connection with transfers of securities.
(a)
Duty to furnish transfer statement
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Transfers between accounts.
Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) through (vi) of this section, every applicable person (transferor) (as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section) that transfers custody of a specified security to a broker (as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section) must furnish to the receiving broker a transfer statement that includes the information described in paragraph (b) of this section with respect to the transferred security. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(vii) and (b)(3) of this section (relating to noncovered securities and certain securities for which basis is determined under an average basis method), a transferor must furnish a separate statement for each security and, if transferring custody of the same security acquired on different dates or at different prices, for each acquisition.
(ii)
Cash on delivery accounts and multiple broker arrangements
—(A)
Sales.
A custodian or other transferor that transfers custody of a security to a broker solely to effect a sale must furnish a transfer statement only to the broker that effects the sale. However, no transfer statement is required if the transferor itself either effects the sale or is required to report the sale of the security under § 1.6045-1.
(B)
Purchases.
A broker that effects a purchase but does not receive custody of the security must furnish a transfer statement to the broker receiving custody. However, no transfer statement is required if the broker effects the purchase solely at the instruction of the broker receiving custody.
(iii)
Exempt recipients and exempt foreign payees.
A transferor is not required to furnish a transfer statement for a security that, after the transfer, is held for a customer that is an exempt recipient under § 1.6045-1(c)(3)(i) or an exempt foreign person under § 1.6045-1(g)(1)(i).
(iv)
Securities lending transactions—transferor as principal.
A transferor that lends or borrows securities as a principal is not required to furnish a transfer statement for a security that is transferred pursuant to such lending or borrowing arrangement (for example, when a customer opens or closes a short sale). This exception does not apply when a transferor transfers a security under a lending or borrowing arrangement of the customer. This exception also does not apply when a transferor transfers a previously borrowed security to another account of the same customer (for example, to satisfy an existing short sale obligation).
See
paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(v)
Certain money market funds.
A transferor of stock in a regulated investment company described in § 1.6045-1(c)(3)(vi) is not required to furnish a transfer statement.
(vi)
Exception for transfers of specified securities that are reportable as digital assets.
No transfer statement is required under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section with respect to a specified security, the sale of which is reportable as a digital asset after the application of the special coordination rules under § 1.6045-1(c)(8). A transferor that chooses to provide a transfer statement with respect to a specified security described in the preceding sentence that is a tokenized security described in § 1.6045-1(c)(8)(i)(D) that reports some or all of the information described in paragraph (b) of this section is not subject to penalties under section 6722 of the Code for failure to report this information correctly.
(2)
Format of transfer statement.
The transfer statement must be furnished in writing unless both the transferor and the receiving broker agree to a different format or method before the transfer. If a transfer occurs between accounts at the same or affiliated entities, a transfer statement is deemed to have been furnished and received if the required information, including any required adjustments, is incorporated into the records for the recipient account.
(3)
Time for furnishing statement.
A transferor must furnish a transfer statement within fifteen days after the date of settlement for the transfer.
(4)
Applicable person effecting transfer. Applicable person
means any transferor who is a person described in § 1.6045-1(a)(1), a person that acts as a custodian of securities in the ordinary course of a trade or business, an issuer of securities, a trustee or custodian of an individual retirement plan, or any agent of these persons. Applicable person does not include the beneficial owner of a security or any agent substituted for an undisclosed beneficial owner, any governmental unit or agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit holding escheated securities, or any organization that holds and transfers obligations among members of the organization as a service to its members.

Solely for purposes of this section,
broker
means any person described in § 1.6045-1(a)(1), any person that acts as a custodian of securities in the ordinary course of a trade or business, any issuer of securities, and any agent of these persons. Broker does not include the beneficial owner of a security or any agent substituted for an undisclosed beneficial owner, any governmental unit or agency or instrumentality of a governmental unit holding escheated securities, or any organization that holds and transfers obligations among members of the organization as a service to its members.
(6)
Other terms.
For purposes of this section, the terms sale, specified security, covered security, noncovered security, and customer have the same meaning as in § 1.6045-1(a)(9), (a)(14), (a)(15), (a)(16), and (h)(1).

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (a). Unless otherwise stated, in each example the customer is not treated as an exempt recipient under § 1.6045-1(c)(3)(i) or an exempt foreign person under § 1.6045-1(g)(1)(i). The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
V, an entity treated as an exempt recipient under § 1.6045-1(c)(3)(i), owns a security in an account with E, a broker. On February 1, 2012, V instructs E to transfer custody of the security to an account V maintains with F, another broker. Because E may treat V as an exempt recipient under § 1.6045-1(c)(3)(i), under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, E is not required to furnish a transfer statement.

# Example 2.
W maintains an account with G, a custodial broker. On August 1, 2012, W instructs G to purchase a security. G places an order to purchase the security with H, a broker with which G has a clearing agreement. W does not maintain a direct account with H. H executes the purchase and has the security delivered to G. Under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, H is not required to furnish a transfer statement because G received custody of the security and H purchased the security solely at the instruction of G.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2
except that W later instructs G to sell the security. G places an order with H to sell the security. H executes the sale. G delivers the security to settle the sale. G is required to report the sale of the security under § 1.6045-1. Therefore, under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, G is not required to furnish a transfer statement.

# Example 4.
(i) X maintains an account with J, an introducing broker. J contracts with K, a clearing broker, to allow K to execute trades on J's behalf under a clearing agreement. K uses L, a custodian of securities in the ordinary course of a trade or business, to hold custody of the securities of K's customers. K maintains a separate disclosed account for X as a clearing broker with custody at L. On May 1, 2012, X instructs J to purchase a security for X as the beneficial owner. J instructs K to purchase the security. K effects the purchase and has the security delivered to L.
(ii) K is a broker and therefore is an applicable person that is a transferor within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. L acts as a custodian of securities in the ordinary course of a trade or business and therefore is a broker within the meaning of paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Because K effects the purchase of the security but does not receive custody of the security, under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, K must furnish a transfer statement to L.

# Example 5.
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example 4
except that X later instructs J to sell the security. J instructs K to sell the security. K sells the security. L transfers custody of the security to settle X's sale in accordance with its custody arrangement with K by delivering the security to the purchasing broker. K deposits the sale proceeds in X's account with K. K is required to report the sale of the security under § 1.6045-1.
(ii) L acts as a custodian of securities in the ordinary course of a trade or business and therefore is an applicable person that is a transferor within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Because L transfers custody of the security to the purchaser's broker solely to effect the sale, under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, L must furnish a transfer statement to K.
(iii) If the terms of their custody arrangement so provide, K may furnish the transfer statement as L's agent and satisfy L's duty to furnish the transfer statement under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, K may satisfy this duty by maintaining the information required on the transfer statement, including all required adjustments, in its records for X's account.

# Example 6.
(i) Y, an investment advisor, wants to purchase shares of stock in C, a corporation, for several of Y's customers. Y establishes a delivery-on-payment account with M, a broker, and provides M a standing instruction to deliver stock purchased in the account to Y's account at N, a custodian of securities in the ordinary course of a trade or business. On November 1, 2012, Y enters into a cash-on-delivery transaction by instructing M to purchase shares of C stock. M executes the purchase and effects delivery of the C stock to N.
(ii) M is a broker and therefore is an applicable person that is a transferor within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. N acts as a custodian of securities in the ordinary course of a trade or business and therefore is a broker within the meaning of paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Because M effects the purchase of the stock and N receives custody of the stock, under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, M must furnish a transfer statement to N.

# Example 7.
(i) Z owns shares of stock in C, a corporation, in an account with O, a broker. On February 1, 2013, Z instructs O to transfer the C stock to C so that ownership is held on the books of the issuer. C has an arrangement with D, a transfer agent, to keep records of ownership of the company's stock, how that stock is held, and how many shares each investor owns. O transfers the stock to D.
(ii) O is a broker and therefore is an applicable person that is a transferor within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. D is an agent of C, the issuer of the stock, and therefore is a broker within the meaning of paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Because O transfers custody of the stock to D, under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, O must furnish a transfer statement to D.

# Example 8.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 7
except that Z later instructs D to transfer the stock to an account Z maintains with P, another broker. D transfers the stock to P. D is an agent of C, the issuer of the stock, and therefore is an applicable person that is a transferor within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Because P is a broker and D transfers custody of the stock to P, under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, D must furnish a transfer statement to P.
(b)
Information required
—(1)
In general.
For all specified securities, each transfer statement must include the information described in this paragraph (b)(1).
(i)
Statement date.
The date the statement is furnished.
(ii)
Applicable person effecting transfer.
The name, address, and telephone number of the applicable person furnishing the statement.
(iii)
Broker receiving custody.
The name, address, and telephone number of the broker receiving custody of the security.
(iv)
Customers.
The name and account number of the customer or customers for the account from which the security is transferred and, if different, the name and account number of the customer or customers for the account to which the security is transferred.
(v)
Security identifiers.
The Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures (CUSIP) number of the security transferred (if applicable) or other security identifier number that the Secretary may designate by publication in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), quantity of shares, units, or amounts, and classification of the security (such as stock or debt).
(vi)
Transfer dates.
The date the transfer was initiated and the settlement date of the transfer (if known when furnishing the statement).
(vii)
Adjusted basis and acquisition date.
The total adjusted basis of the security, the original acquisition date of the security, and, if applicable, the holding period adjustment required by section 1091. The transferor must determine this information as provided under §§ 1.6045-1(d), 1.6045-1(m), and 1.6045-1(n), including reporting the adjusted basis of the security in U.S. dollars. If the basis of the transferred security is determined using an average basis method (as described in § 1.1012-1(e)), the transferor may report any securities acquired more than five years before the transfer on a single statement on which the original acquisition date is reported as “VARIOUS” if the other information reported on the statement applies to all of the securities.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (b)(1) of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) In a single account with P, a broker, Q purchases three lots of 100 shares of stock each in C, a corporation, at different prices on April 2, 2012, July 2, 2012, and October 2, 2012. Q instructs P to enroll the shares of the C stock in P's dividend reinvestment plan and to average the basis of the shares of the C stock. All of the C stock purchased by P has the same CUSIP number. On September 13, 2013, less than five years after the acquisition dates for all three lots, Q transfers all 300 shares of the C stock to an account with another broker.
(ii) Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, P must furnish three transfer statements. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, one statement must report the transfer of 100 shares with an original acquisition date of April 2, 2012, one statement must report the transfer of 100 shares with an original acquisition date of July 2, 2012, and one statement must report the transfer of 100 shares with an original acquisition date of October 2, 2012.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that Q transfers the shares to the account with the other broker on September 13, 2017. For the 100 shares purchased on April 2, 2012, and the 100 shares purchased on July 2, 2012, under paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section, P may furnish a single transfer statement reporting the transfer of 200 shares with the original acquisition date as “VARIOUS” instead of furnishing two separate transfer statements.

# Example 3.
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that, on June 15, 2012, Q sells the 100 shares purchased on April 2, 2012, at a loss.
(ii) Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, P must furnish two transfer statements. Under paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this
section and § 1.6045-1(d)(6)(iii) and (d)(7)(ii), P must determine the average basis for the 200 transferred shares and the date for computing whether any gain or loss with respect to the stock purchased on July 2, 2012, is long-term or short-term by applying the rules for broker reporting of wash sales to the stock purchased on July 2, 2012. Therefore, on both transfer statements, P must increase the average basis of the stock by the amount of loss disallowed under section 1091 on the sale of the 100 shares purchased on April 2, 2012. On the transfer statement reporting the transfer of the 100 shares purchased on July 2, 2012, P must adjust the holding period of the July 2, 2012, shares in accordance with section 1091.

# Example 4.
(i) R, an employee of C, a corporation, participates in C's employee stock purchase program that satisfies the requirements of section 423. D administers the plan. R purchases stock in the plan at a 15 percent discount to the fair market value of the stock determined on the date of purchase. R purchases stock through the plan during 2012 until R terminates employment on October 15, 2012. R later instructs D to transfer the plan shares to S, a broker.
(ii) D is the agent of C, the issuer of the securities, and therefore is an applicable person within the meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Because S is a broker and D transfers custody of the stock to S, under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, D must furnish a transfer statement to S.
(iii) Under paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section and § 1.6045-1(d)(6)(ii)(A), D must report adjusted basis on the transfer statement based on the amount paid by R. Under paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section and § 1.6045-1(d)(6)(ii)(A), D is permitted, but is not required, to increase the adjusted basis for the amount (if any) includible as wage income by R for R's purchases of the stock.
(3)
Additional information required for a transfer of a debt instrument.
In addition to the information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for a transfer of a debt instrument that is a covered security, the following additional information is required:
(i) A description of the payment terms used by the broker to compute any basis adjustments under § 1.6045-1(n);
(ii) The issue price of the debt instrument;
(iii) The issue date of the debt instrument (if different from the original acquisition date of the debt instrument);
(iv) The adjusted issue price of the debt instrument as of the transfer date;
(v) The customer's initial basis in the debt instrument;
(vi) Any market discount that has accrued as of the transfer date (as determined under § 1.6045-1(n));
(vii) Any bond premium that has been amortized as of the transfer date (as determined under § 1.6045-1(n));
(viii) Any acquisition premium that has been amortized as of the transfer date (as determined under § 1.6045-1(n));
(ix) Whether the transferring broker has computed any of the information described in this paragraph (b)(3) by taking into account one or more elections described in § 1.6045-1(n), and, if so, which election or elections were taken into account by the transferring broker; and
(x) For a transfer that occurs on or after January 1, 2016, the last date on or before the transfer date that the transferor made an adjustment for a particular item (for example, the last date on or before the transfer date that bond premium was amortized). A broker, however, may rely on this paragraph (b)(3)(x) for a transfer of a covered security that occurs on or after June 30, 2015, and before January 1, 2016.
(4)
Additional information required for option transfers.
In addition to the information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for a transfer of an option that is a covered security, the following additional information is required:
(i) The date of grant or acquisition of the option;
(ii) The amount of premium paid or received;
(iii) Any other information required to fully describe the option, which may include a security identifier used by option exchanges, or details about the underlying asset, quantity covered, exercise type, strike price, and maturity date; and
(iv) For a transfer of an option described in § 1.6045-1(m)(3) (section 1256 option) that occurs on or after January 1, 2016, the original basis of the option and the fair market value of the option as of the end of the prior calendar year.
(5)
Format of identification.
An applicable person furnishing a transfer statement and a broker receiving the transfer statement may agree to combine the information required in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this
section in any format or to use a code in place of one or more required items. For example, a transferor and a receiving broker may agree to use a single code to represent the broker instead of the broker's name, address, and telephone number, or may use a security symbol or other identification number or scheme instead of the security identifier required by paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section. As another example, a transferor and a receiving broker may agree to use a security identifier for an exchange-traded option if that information would be sufficient to inform the receiving broker of the terms for that option.
(6)
Transfers of noncovered securities.
The information described in paragraphs (b)(1)(vii), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(8), and (b)(9) of this section is not required for a transfer of a noncovered security if the transfer statement identifies the security as a noncovered security. A transferor that chooses to report nonrequired information is not subject to penalties under section 6722 for failure to report this information correctly if the transfer statement identifies the security as a noncovered security. A single transfer statement may report the transfer of multiple noncovered securities if the transfer statement clearly conveys, either specifically or generally, the information described in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section to identify each security. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(6), a transferor must treat a security for which a broker makes a single-account election described in § 1.1012-1(e)(11)(i) as a covered security.
(7)
Transfers of borrowed securities.
The transfer statement must indicate that a transferred security is borrowed if the transferor knows that the security is transferred pursuant to a lending or borrowing arrangement. The transfer statement must not report an adjusted basis If the transferor knows that the transferred security is lent or borrowed pursuant to a short sale. The receiving broker may be subject to special transfer reporting rules upon receipt of a borrowed security if the security is used to satisfy an existing short sale obligation.
See
§ 1.6045-1(c)(3)(xi)(C).
(8)
Transfers pursuant to an inheritance
—(i)
In general.
A transfer statement for a transfer of a security from a decedent or decedent's estate must indicate that the security is inherited. The transfer statement must report the date of death as the original acquisition date and must report adjusted basis according to the instructions or valuations furnished by an authorized representative of the estate, including any required adjustments to basis for property acquired from a decedent. If a transferor has not received instructions or valuations from an authorized representative, the transferor must report basis as the fair market value of the security on the date of death.
However, if the transferor neither knows nor can readily ascertain the fair market value of the security on the date of death at the time the transfer statement is prepared, the transfer statement must indicate that the transfer consists of an inherited security but may otherwise report the security as if it were a noncovered security. If the transferor cannot identify which securities in a joint account have been transferred from the decedent, the transferor must treat each security in the account as if it were a noncovered security but must not indicate that any security is an inherited security.
(ii)
Transfers of securities to satisfy a cash legacy.
If a security is transferred from a decedent or a decedent's estate to satisfy a cash legacy, paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section apply and paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section does not apply.
(iii)
Subsequent transfers of inherited securities.
A transfer statement must indicate that the transfer consists of an inherited security if a prior transfer statement reported the security as inherited.
(9)
Gift or deemed gift transfers
—(i)
In general.
A transfer statement for a security transferred to a different owner (other than a transfer that the transferor knows is pursuant to a lending or borrowing arrangement or is from a decedent or decedent's estate) must indicate that the security is a gift and must report the date of the gift (if known when furnishing the statement) and the fair market value of the gift on
that date (if known or readily ascertainable at the time the transfer statement is prepared). The transfer statement must report the adjusted basis and original acquisition date of the security in the hands of the donor. However, if the transfer is between persons for whom gift-related basis adjustments are inapplicable or between accounts that share at least one common customer, the transferor must apply paragraph (b)(1) of this section as if the security were not a gift or deemed gift.
(ii)
Subsequent transfers of gifts by the same customer.
If a transferor transfers to a different account of the same customer a security that a prior transfer statement reported as a gifted security, the transferor must include on the transfer statement the information described in paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section for the date of the gift to the customer. If the prior transfer statement did not report a date for the gift, the transferor must treat the settlement date for the prior transfer as the date of the gift.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (b)(9):

# Example 1.
X instructs S, a broker, to give to Y stock in a publicly traded company that X holds in an account with S. The stock is a covered security. On X's instruction, S transfers custody of the stock to T, Y's broker. The transfer settles on August 15, 2013. Under paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section, S must provide a transfer statement to T that identifies the securities as gifted securities and indicates X's adjusted basis and original acquisition date. If S knows the settlement date, the transfer statement must also indicate that the date of the gift was August 15, 2013, and, because S can readily ascertain the fair market value of the stock on August 15, 2013, the fair market value of the stock on that date.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that, one year later, Y transfers the stock to an account in his name with U, another broker. Under paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section, T must provide a transfer statement to U that identifies the securities as gifted securities and indicates X's adjusted basis and original acquisition date of the stock. The transfer statement must also indicate the date of the gift, August 15, 2013, and the fair market value of the stock on that date either by reporting the value that S reported to T or, because T can readily ascertain the fair market value of the stock on August 15, 2013, by determining the fair market value of the stock on that date.
(10)
Specific identification of securities.
Except as provided in § 1.1012-1(e)(7)(ii), a transfer statement must report a transfer of less than the entire position in an account of a security that was acquired on different dates or at different prices consistently with a customer's adequate and timely identification of the security to be transferred.
See
§ 1.1012-1(c). If the customer does not provide an adequate and timely identification for the transfer, a transferor must first report the transfer of any securities in the account for which the transferor does not know the acquisition or purchase date followed by the earliest securities purchased or acquired, whether covered securities or noncovered securities.
(11)
Information from other parties and other accounts
—(i)
Transfer and issuer statements and transfers pursuant to an inheritance.
When reporting a transfer of a covered security, a transferor must take into account all information, other than the classification of the security (such as stock), furnished on a transfer statement, all information furnished or deemed furnished on an issuer statement (as described in § 1.6045B-1), and all instructions and valuations furnished by an authorized representative of the estate of a decedent, unless the statement or instructions are incomplete or the broker has actual knowledge that they are incorrect. A transferor may treat a customer as a minority shareholder when taking the information on an issuer statement into account unless the transferor knows that the customer is a majority shareholder and the issuer statement reports the action's effect on the basis of majority shareholders. Any failure to report correct information that arises solely from reliance on information furnished on a transfer statement or issuer statement or by an authorized representative of the estate is deemed to be due to reasonable cause for purposes of penalties under section 6722.
See
§ 301.6724-1(a)(1) of this chapter.
(ii)
Other information.
A transferor is permitted, but not required, to take
into account information about a covered security other than what is furnished on a transfer statement or issuer statement or by an authorized representative of the estate of a decedent, including any information the transferor has about securities held by the same customer in other accounts with the transferor. For purposes of penalties under section 6722, a transferor that takes into account information received from a customer or third party other than information furnished on a transfer statement or issuer statement or by an authorized representative of the estate of a decedent is deemed to have relied upon this information in good faith if the transferor neither knows nor has reason to know that the information is incorrect.
See
§ 301.6724-1(c)(6) of this chapter.
(12)
Failure to receive a complete transfer statement
—(i)
In general.
A receiving broker that has not received a complete transfer statement as required under paragraph (a)(3) of this section for the transfer must request a complete statement from the transferor unless, under paragraph (a) of this section, the transferor has no duty to furnish a transfer statement for the transfer. The receiving broker is only required to make this request once. If the receiving broker does not receive a complete transfer statement after requesting it, the receiving broker may treat the security as a noncovered security upon its subsequent sale or transfer. A transfer statement for a covered security is complete if, in the view of the receiving broker, it provides sufficient information to comply with § 1.6045-1 when reporting the sale of the security. A transfer statement for a noncovered security is complete if it indicates that the security is a noncovered security.
(ii)
Transition rules for transfers of debt instruments, options, and securities futures contracts.
If an option described in § 1.6045-1(a)(14)(iii), a securities futures contract described in § 1.6045-1(a)(14)(iv), or a debt instrument described in § 1.6045-1(a)(15)(i)(C) is transferred in 2014 and no transfer statement is received, the receiving broker is not required to request a transfer statement from the transferor and may treat the security as a noncovered security. If a debt instrument described in § 1.6045-1(a)(15)(i)(D) is transferred in 2016 and no transfer statement is received, the receiving broker is not required to request a transfer statement from the transferor and may treat the security as a noncovered security.
(c)
Reporting by other parties after a transfer
—(1)
In general.
A transferor that has furnished a transfer statement must furnish a corrected statement for a covered security within fifteen days of receiving a transfer statement, an issuer statement (as described in § 1.6045B-1), or instructions or valuations from an authorized representative of an estate, that provides information under paragraph (b) of this section that was not reported on the initial transfer statement.
(2)
Exception.
A transferor is not required to furnish a corrected transfer statement for a covered security under this paragraph (c) if the transferor receives the transfer statement or issuer statement or receives the instructions or valuations from an authorized representative of an estate more than eighteen months after the transferor furnished the transfer statement.
(d)
Effective/applicability dates.
This section applies to:
(1) A transfer on or after January 1, 2011, of stock other than stock in a regulated investment company within the meaning of § 1.1012-1(e)(5);
(2) A transfer on or after January 1, 2012, of stock in a regulated investment company;
(3) A transfer on or after January 1, 2015, of an option described in § 1.6045-1(a)(14)(iii), a securities futures contract described in § 1.6045-1(a)(14)(iv), or a debt instrument described in § 1.6045-1(a)(15)(i)(C); and
(4) A transfer on or after January 1, 2017, of a debt instrument described in § 1.6045-1(a)(15)(i)(D).
[T.D. 9504, 75 FR 64097, Oct. 18, 2010, as amended by T.D. 9616, 78 FR 23132, Apr. 18, 2013; T.D. 9713, 80 FR 13238, Mar. 13, 2015; T.D. 9750, 81 FR 8154, Feb. 18, 2016; 81 FR 24702, Apr. 27, 2016; T.D. 10000, 89 FR 56580, July 9, 2024]
§ 1.6045B-1
Returns relating to actions affecting basis of securities.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Information required.
Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section, an issuer of a specified security within the meaning of § 1.6045-1(a)(14)(i) through (iv) that takes an organizational action that affects the basis of the security must file an issuer return setting forth the following information and any other information specified in the return form and instructions:
(i)
Reporting issuer.
The name and taxpayer identification number of the reporting issuer.
(ii)
Security identifiers.
The identifiers of each security involved in the organizational action including, as applicable, the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures (CUSIP) number or other security identifier number that the Secretary may designate by publication in the
Federal Register
or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), classification of the security (such as stock), account number, serial number, and ticker symbol, as well as any descriptions about the class of security affected.
(iii)
Contact at reporting issuer.
The name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number of a contact person at the issuer.
(iv)
Information about action.
The type or nature of the organizational action including, as applicable, the date of the action or the date against which shareholders' ownership is measured for the action.
(v)
Effect of the action.
The quantitative effect of the organizational action on the basis of the security in the hands of a U.S. taxpayer as an adjustment per share or as a percentage of old basis, including a description of the calculation, the applicable Internal Revenue Code section and subsection upon which the tax treatment is based, the data supporting the calculation such as the market values of securities and valuation dates, any other information necessary to implement the adjustment including the reportable taxable year, and whether any resulting loss may be recognized.
(2)
Time for filing the return
—(i)
In general.
An issuer must file an issuer return with the IRS pursuant to the prescribed form and instructions on or before the 45th day following the organizational action, or, if earlier, January 15 of the year following the calendar year of the organizational action. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2), a redemption occurs on the last day a holder may redeem a security. The issuer may file the return before the organizational action if the quantitative effect on basis is determinable beforehand.
(ii)
Reasonable assumptions.
To report the quantitative effect on basis by the due date in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, an issuer may make reasonable assumptions about facts that cannot be determined before the due date. An issuer must file a corrected return within forty-five days of determining facts that result in a different quantitative effect on basis from what the issuer previously reported. However, for purposes of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii), an issuer must treat a payment that may be a dividend consistently with its treatment of the payment under section 6042(b)(3) and § 1.6042-3(c).
(3)
Exception for public reporting.
An issuer is not required to file a return with the IRS under this paragraph (a) if, by the due date described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the issuer posts the return with the required information in a readily accessible format in an area of its primary public Web site dedicated to this purpose and keeps the return accessible for ten years to the public on its primary public Web site or the primary public Web site of any successor organization. An issuer may electronically sign a return that is publicly reported in accordance with this paragraph (a)(3). The electronic signature must identify the individual who attests to the declaration in the jurat.
(4)
Exception when holders are exempt recipients.
No reporting is required under this paragraph (a) if the issuer reasonably determines that all of the holders of the security are exempt recipients under paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
(5)
Exception for certain money market funds.
No reporting is required under
this paragraph (a) by a regulated investment company described in § 1.6045-1(c)(3)(vi).

Reporting for certain specified securities that are digital assets.
Unless otherwise excepted under this section, an issuer of a specified security described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is required to report under this section without regard to whether the specified security is also described in § 1.6045-1(a)(14)(v) or (vi). If a specified security is described in § 1.6045-1(a)(14)(v) or (vi) but is not also described in § 1.6045-1(a)(14)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), the issuer of that specified security is permitted, but not required, to report under this section. An issuer that chooses to provide the reporting and furnish statements for a specified security described in the previous sentence is not subject to penalties under section 6721 or 6722 of the Code for failure to report this information correctly.
(b)
Statements to nominees and certificate holders
—(1)
In general.
An issuer required to file an information return under this section must furnish a written statement with the same information to each holder of record of the security or to the holder's nominee. This issuer statement must indicate that the information is being reported to the IRS. An issuer may satisfy this requirement by furnishing a copy of the information return.
(2)
Time for furnishing statements.
An issuer must furnish each issuer statement on or before January 15 of the year following the calendar year of the organizational action. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), a redemption occurs on the last day a holder may redeem a security. An issuer may furnish the statement before the organizational action if the quantitative effect on basis is determinable beforehand. An issuer must furnish a statement that corresponds to a corrected return described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section by the later of the due date described in this paragraph (b)(2) or forty-five days after determining the facts that result in a different quantitative effect on basis from what the issuer previously reported on the return.
(3)
Recipients of statements.
An issuer must furnish a separate statement to each holder of record of the security as of the date of the organizational action and all subsequent holders of record up to the date the issuer furnishes the statement required under this section. If the issuer records the security on its books in the name of a nominee, the issuer must furnish the statement to the nominee in lieu of the holder. However, if the nominee is the issuer, an agent of the issuer, or a plan operated by the issuer, the issuer must furnish the statement to the holder.
(4)
Exception for public reporting.
An issuer is deemed to furnish an issuer statement under this paragraph (b) to all holders and nominees if the issuer satisfies the public reporting requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(5)
Exempt recipients
—(i)
In general.
An issuer is not required to furnish an issuer statement to a holder or its nominee if the holder is an exempt recipient under § 1.6045-1(c)(3)(i)(B), provided the issuer has actual knowledge that the holder is described in that section or has a properly completed exemption certificate from the holder asserting that the holder is an exempt recipient (as provided in § 31.3406(h)-3 of this chapter). An issuer may treat a holder as an exempt recipient based on the applicable indicators described in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(A) through (M).
(ii)
Limitation for corporate holders.
For an organizational action occurring on or after January 1, 2012, an issuer may treat a holder as an exempt recipient based on the indicator described in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(A) only if one of the following applies:
(A) The name of the holder contains the term “insurance company,” “indemnity company,” “reinsurance company,” or “assurance company.”
(B) The name of the holder indicates that it is an entity listed as a per se corporation under § 301.7701-2(b)(8)(i) of this chapter.
(C) The issuer receives a properly completed exemption certificate (as provided in § 31.3406(h)-3 of this chapter) that asserts that the holder is not an S corporation as defined in section 1361(a).
(D) The issuer receives a withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i) that includes a certification that the
person whose name is on the certificate is a foreign corporation.
(iii)
Foreign holders.
An issuer may treat a holder as an exempt recipient if the issuer, prior to the transaction, associates the holder with documentation upon which the issuer may rely in order to treat payments to the holder as made to a foreign beneficial owner in accordance with § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii) or as made to a foreign payee in accordance with § 1.6049-5(d)(1) or presumed to be made to a foreign payee under § 1.6049-5(d)(2) or (3). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(iii), the provisions in § 1.6049-5(c) (regarding rules applicable to documentation of foreign status and definition of U.S. payor and non-U.S. payor) apply. Rules similar to the rules of § 1.1441-1 apply by substituting the terms “issuer” and “holder” in place of the terms “withholding agent” and “payee” and without regard to the limitation to amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code. Rules similar to the rules of § 1.6049-5(d) apply by substituting the terms “issuer” and “holder” in place of the terms “payor” and “payee.”
(c)
Special rule for S corporations.
An S corporation (as defined in section 1361(a)) is deemed to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for any organizational action affecting the basis of its stock if the corporation reports the effect of the organizational action on a timely filed Schedule K-1 (Form 1120S), “Shareholder's Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc.,” for each shareholder and timely furnishes copies of these schedules to all proper parties.
(d)
Special rule for certain regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts.
A regulated investment company (RIC) that reports undistributed capital gains to shareholders under section 852(b)(3)(D) or a real estate investment trust (REIT) that reports undistributed capital gains to shareholders under section 857(b)(3)(D) is deemed to have satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for undistributed capital gains affecting the basis of its stock if the RIC or REIT timely files and furnishes the information returns required under section 852(b)(3)(D) or section 857(b)(3)(D) to all proper parties for the organizational action.
(e)
Acquiring and successor entities.
An acquiring or successor entity of an issuer that fails to satisfy the reporting obligations of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section must satisfy these reporting obligations. If neither the issuer nor the acquiring or successor entity satisfies these reporting obligations, both parties are jointly and severally liable for any applicable penalties.
(f)
Penalties.
An issuer may use an agent to satisfy the requirements of this section for the issuer. Nonetheless, the issuer remains liable for penalty for any failure to comply unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.
See
sections 6721 through 6724.
(g)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) C, a corporation, distributes stock to shareholders on March 31, 2013.
(ii) Under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, C must file an issuer return with the IRS on or before May 15, 2013 (45 days after the distribution date), reporting the quantitative effect of this distribution on the basis of C's stock. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, C must furnish issuer statements to its nominees and certificate holders on or before January 15, 2014.
(iii) Alternatively, under paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, C may post by May 15, 2013, and maintain for ten years, the return with the required information in a readily accessible format in an area of its primary public Web site dedicated to this purpose.

# Example 2.
(i) D, a corporation, makes a cash distribution to shareholders on December 10, 2013.
(ii) Under paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (b)(2) of this section, D is required to file an issuer return with the IRS and furnish issuer statements to its nominees and certificate holders on or before January 15, 2014.
(iii) On January 15, 2014, D is unsure whether the distribution will exceed its earnings and profits for the fiscal year. For purposes of section 6042(b)(3) and § 1.6042-3(c), D must treat the distribution as a dividend. Therefore, under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, D is not required to file an issuer return. If D later determines that dividend treatment was incorrect, D must file an issuer return reporting the correct quantitative effect on basis.

# Example 3.
E, a corporation, undertakes a stock split as of April 1, 2014. E furnishes issuer statements under paragraph (b) of this
section on April 1, 2014, at which time the books and records of E show that 90 percent of its outstanding stock is owned by shareholders through a clearing organization as their nominee, 7 percent is owned by 5,000 individuals, and the remaining 3 percent is owned by a dividend reinvestment plan operated by E that has 1,000 members. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, E must furnish statements to the clearing organization, the 5,000 individuals, and the 1,000 members of the dividend reinvestment plan.
(h)
Rule for options
—(1)
In general.
For an option granted or acquired on or after January 1, 2014, if the original contract is replaced by a different number of option contracts, the following rules apply:
(i) If the option is an exchange-traded option, any clearinghouse or clearing facility that serves as a counterparty is treated as the issuer of the option for purposes of section 6045B.
(ii) If the option is not an exchange-traded option, the option writer is treated as the issuer of the option for purposes of section 6045B.
(2)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph (h)(1) of this section:

# Example 1.
On January 15, 2014, F, an individual, purchases a one-year exchange-traded call option on 100 shares of Company X stock, with a strike price of $110. The call option is cleared through Clearinghouse G. Company X executes a 2-for-1 stock split as of April 1, 2014. Due to the stock split, the terms of F's option are altered, resulting in two option contracts, each on 100 shares of Company X stock with a strike price of $55. All other terms remain the same. Under paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, Clearinghouse G is required to prepare an issuer report for F.

# Example 2.
On January 31, 2014, J, an individual, purchases from K a non-exchange traded 7-month call option on 100 shares of Company X stock, with a strike price of $110. Company X executes a 2-for-1 stock split as of April 1, 2014. Due to the stock split, the terms of J's option are altered, resulting in one option contract on 200 shares of Company X stock with a strike price of $55. All other terms of the option remain the same. Under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, because the number of option contracts did not change, K is not required to prepare an issuer report for J.

(
a
) Acquires (whether in one or more transactions) outstanding stock of such corporation which equals, or which when added to any such stock then owned by him equals, 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the foreign corporation entitled to vote or the total value of the stock of the foreign corporation;
(
b
) Acquires (whether in one or more transactions) an additional 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the foreign corporation entitled to vote or the total value of the stock of the foreign corporation; or

(3)
Application of rules.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a United States citizen, is, on January 1, 1963, a director of M, a foreign corporation. X, on January 1, 1963, is a United States person owning 5 percent in value of the outstanding stock of M Corporation. A must file a return under the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
A, a United States citizen, is, on January 1, 2014, a director of M Corporation, a foreign corporation. X, on January 1, 2014, is a United States person owning 4% of the outstanding stock of M Corporation. On July 1, 2014, X acquires 4% of the outstanding stock of M Corporation and on September 1, 2014, he acquires an additional 4% of such stock.
(ii)
Results.
The July 1, 2014, transaction does not give rise to liability for A to file a return; however, A must file a return as a result of the September 1, 2014, transaction because X's holdings now exceed 10%.

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
and, on September 15, 2014, X acquires an additional 8% in value of the outstanding stock of M Corporation. (X's total holdings are now 20%.) On November 1, 2014, X acquires an additional 4% of the outstanding stock of M Corporation.
(ii)
Results.
The September 15, 2014, transaction does not give rise to liability to file a return since X has not acquired 10% in value of the outstanding stock of M Corporation since A last became liable to file a return. However, A must file a return as a result of the November 1, 2014, transaction because X has now acquired an additional 10% of the outstanding stock of M Corporation.

# Example 4.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Examples 2
and
3
and, in addition, B, a United States citizen, becomes an officer of M Corporation on September 10, 2014.
(ii)
Results.
B is not required to file a return either as a result of the facts set forth in
Example 2
or as a result of the September 15, 2014, transaction described in
Example 3.
However, B is required to file a return as a result of the November 1, 2014, transaction described in
Example 3
because X has acquired an additional 10% in value of the outstanding stock of M Corporation while B is an officer or director.
(b)
Returns required of U.S. persons when liability to file arises on January 1, 1963.
Each U.S. person who, on January 1, 1963, owns 5 percent or more in value of the outstanding stock of a foreign corporation, shall make a return on Form 959 with respect to such foreign corporation setting forth the following information:

This paragraph (e)(5) does not apply to persons excepted from filing a return by reason of the provisions of paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
(f)
Meaning of terms.
For purposes of this section:
(1)
Acquisition.
Stock in a foreign corporation shall be considered acquired when a person has an unqualified right to receive such stock even though such stock is not actually issued. For example, when under the law of a foreign country, all the necessary steps for incorporation are completed but stock in the corporation will not be issued within 30 days, every United States citizen or resident who is an officer or a director of such corporation, provided a United States person has an interest of 10 percent or more in such corporation, and every such United States person shall, within 90 days of the date of incorporation, file the returns required under section 6046 and this section. In the case of a reorganization, new stock may be acquired, depending on the type of reorganization, whether or not any stock certificates are surrendered or exchanged or the designation of such stock is altered.
(2)
Reorganization.
With respect to a foreign corporation, the term “reorganization” shall mean not only a transaction described in section 368(a)(1) and the regulations thereunder but also any other transaction or series of transactions which has the same effect.
(3)
U.S. person
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of section 6046 and this section, the term
United States person
has the meaning assigned to it by section 7701(a)(30), except as provided in paragraphs (f)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
(ii)
Special rule for individuals residing in certain possessions.
(A) With respect to an individual who is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico, the term
United States person
has the meaning assigned to it by § 1.957-3 except that the rules of § 1.937-2(g)(1) will apply.
(B) With respect to individuals who are bona fide residents of any section 931 possession, as defined in § 1.931-1(c)(1), the term
United States person
has the meaning assigned to it by § 1.957-3.
(iii)
Special rule for certain nonresident aliens.
An individual for whom an election under section 6013(g) or (h) is in effect will, subject to the exceptions contained in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, be considered a United States person for purposes of section 6046 and this section.
(4) [Reserved]
(5)
Accounting period and taxable year.
In the case of a specified foreign corporation (as defined in section 898), the taxable year of such corporation shall be treated as its annual accounting period.
(g)
Method of reporting.
All amounts furnished in returns prescribed under this section shall be expressed in United States currency with a statement of the exchange rates used. All statements required to be submitted on or with returns under this section shall be rendered in the English language. For taxable years ending after December 31, 1994, with respect to returns
filed after December 31, 1995, all amounts furnished under paragraph (c) of this section shall be expressed in United States dollars computed and translated in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Amounts furnished under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section shall also be furnished in the foreign corporation's functional currency as required on the form. Information described in paragraphs (b)(10) and (c)(3) of this section shall be submitted in such form or manner as the form shall prescribe. If an individual who is a United States person required to make a return with respect to a foreign corporation under section 6046 is entitled under a treaty to be treated as a nonresident of the United States, and if the individual claims this treaty benefit, and if there are no other United States persons that are required to furnish information under section 6046 with respect to the foreign corporation, then the individual may satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(10), (11) and (12), (c)(3)(ii)(
d
), and (g) of this section by filing the audited foreign financial statements of the foreign corporation with the individual's return required under section 6046.
(h)
Actual ownership of stock.
If any shareholder, referred to in this section, is not the actual owner of the stock of the foreign corporation, the information required under this section shall be furnished in the name of and by such actual owner. For example, in the case of stock held by a nominee, the information required under this section shall be furnished by the actual owner of such stock.
(i)
Constructive ownership of stock
—(1)
In general.
Stock owned directly or indirectly by or for a foreign corporation or a foreign partnership shall be considered as being owned proportionately by its shareholders or partners. Thus, any United States person who is a member of a nonresident foreign partnership which becomes a shareholder in a foreign corporation shall be considered to be a shareholder in such foreign corporation to the extent of his proportionate share in such partnership.
(2)
Members of family.
An individual shall be considered as owning the stock owned directly or indirectly by or for his brothers and sisters (whether by the whole or half blood), his spouse, his ancestors, and his lineal descendants. However, when stock is treated as owned by an individual under the rule provided in this subparagraph, it shall not be treated as owned by him for the purpose of again applying such rule in order to make another the constructive owner of such stock. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
H, W, and HF are United States citizens. W, wife of H, owns 20 percent of the value of the outstanding stock of X, a foreign corporation. X Corporation owns 90 percent of the value of the outstanding stock of Y Corporation, a foreign corporation. Y Corporation becomes the owner of 50 percent of the value of the outstanding stock of each of two newly organized foreign corporations, M and N. In applying the “members of family” rule, H is considered to own 20 percent of the value of the outstanding stock of X Corporation, and 18 percent of the value of the outstanding stock of Y Corporation, and 9 percent of M Corporation and N Corporation. However, HF, the father of H, is not considered to own stock of X, Y, M, or N since his son, H, is not treated as the owner of such stock for purposes of again applying the “members of family” rule.
(j)
Time and place for filing return
—(1)
Time for filing.
Any return required by section 6046 and this section shall be filed on or before the 90th day after the date on which a United States citizen, resident, or person becomes liable to file such return under any provision of section 6046(a) and of paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section. With respect to returns filed after September 3, 1982, such return shall be filed on or before such later date (if any) as may be authorized by the return form.

§ 1.6046A-1
Return requirement for United States persons who acquire or dispose of an interest in a foreign partnership, or whose proportional interest in a foreign partnership changes substantially.
(a)
Return requirement
—(1)
General rule.
If a United States person has a reportable event (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) during the person's tax year, then, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the United States person is required to complete and file Form 8865, “Return of U.S. Persons With Respect to Certain Foreign Partnerships,” containing the information described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Separate return for each partnership.
If a United States person has a reportable event with respect to an interest in more than one foreign partnership, the United States person must file a separate Form 8865 for each foreign partnership.
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Reportable event.
There are three categories of reportable events under section 6046A: acquisitions, dispositions, and changes in proportional interests.
(i)
Acquisitions.
A United States person that acquires a foreign partnership interest has a reportable event if—
(A) The person did not own a ten-percent or greater direct interest in the partnership and as a result of the acquisition the person owns a ten-percent or greater direct interest in the partnership. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A), an acquisition includes an increase in a person's direct proportional interest; or
(B) Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, compared to the person's direct interest when the person last had a reportable event, after the acquisition the person's direct interest has increased by at least a ten-percent interest.
(ii)
Dispositions.
A United States person that disposes of a foreign partnership interest has a reportable event if—
(A) The person owned a ten-percent or greater direct interest in the partnership before the disposition and as a result of the disposition the person owns less than a ten-percent direct interest. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A), a disposition includes a decrease in a person's direct proportional interest; or
(B) Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, compared to the person's direct interest when the person last had a reportable event, after the disposition the person's direct interest has decreased by at least a ten-percent interest.
(iii)
Changes in proportional interests not otherwise reportable as acquisitions or dispositions under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) or (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section.
A United States person has a reportable event if, subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, compared to the person's direct proportional interest the last time the person had a reportable event, the person's direct proportional interest has increased or decreased by at least the equivalent of a ten-percent interest.
(2)
Special rule for foreign partnership interests owned on December 31, 1999.
If a United States person owned a ten-percent or greater direct interest in a foreign partnership on December 31, 1999, then to determine whether the person has a reportable event under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B), (b)(1)(ii)(B), or (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the comparison should be
made to the person's direct interest on December 31, 1999. Once the person has a reportable event after December 31, 1999, future comparisons should be made by reference to the last reportable event.
(3)
Change in a proportional interest.
A partner's proportional interest in a foreign partnership may change for a number of reasons, for example, the change may be caused by changes in other partners' interests resulting from a partner withdrawing from the partnership. A proportional change may also occur by operation of the partnership agreement, for example, if the partnership agreement provides that a partner's interest in profits will change on a set date or when the partnership has earned a specified amount of profits and one of those events occurs.
(4)
Ten-percent interest.
Under section 6046A(d) and this section, a
ten-percent interest
in a foreign partnership, as described in section 6038(e)(3)(C) and the regulations thereunder, means an interest equal to ten percent of the capital interest in such partnership, an interest equal to ten percent of the profits interest in such partnership, or an interest to which ten percent of the deductions or losses of such partnership are allocated.
(5)
United States person. United States person
means a person described in section 7701(a)(30).
(6)
Foreign partnership. Foreign partnership
means any partnership that is a foreign partnership under sections 7701(a)(2) and (5).
(7)
Examples.
The rules of paragraph (a) of this section and this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Acquisition of an indirect interest. FP, a foreign partnership, has two partners,
FC1
and
FC2,
both foreign corporations.
FC1
owns a 40% interest in
FP,
and
FC2
owns a 60% interest in
FP.
No United States person owns an interest in
FP,
either directly, or constructively under section 6038(e)(3)(C) and section 267(c). On January 1, 2001,
US,
a United States person and calendar year taxpayer, acquires by purchase 100% of
FC2's
stock.
US
has acquired an indirect interest of 60% in
FP.
See sections 6038(e)(3)(C) and 267(c)(1). However,
US
is not required to report the January 1, 2001 indirect acquisition under section 6046A.
US
did not own a 10% or greater direct interest in
FP
before the acquisition, and
US
does not own a 10% or greater direct interest as a result of the acquisition. (
US
must, however, comply with the reporting requirements under section 6038 (controlled foreign corporation and controlled foreign partnership reporting) with respect to
FC2
and
FP.
)

# Example 2.
Acquisition of direct interests. (i) Assume the same facts as
Example 1.
In addition, on June 1, 2001,
US
purchases a 5% direct interest in
FP
from
FC1. US
did not own a 10% or greater direct interest in
FP
before the acquisition. After the acquisition,
US
does not own a direct interest of 10% or more.
US
owns a 10% or greater total interest (direct and indirect), but only a 5% direct interest. Therefore,
US
is not required to report the June 1, 2001, acquisition under section 6046A.
(ii) On September 1, 2001,
US
purchases a 7% direct interest in
FP
from
FC1.
The September 1, 2001 acquisition constitutes a reportable event under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section. Before the September 1 acquisition, US did not own a 10% or greater direct interest in
FP.
After the September 1 acquisition,
US
owns a 12% direct interest, and therefore, as a result of the September 1 acquisition,
US
now owns a 10% or greater direct interest in
FP.
Consequently,
US
must report its September 1 acquisition under section 6046A on Form 8865 filed with
US's
2001 income tax return.
(iii) On December 1, 2001,
US
acquires an additional 4% direct interest in
FP
from
FC1,
so that
US's
total direct interest has increased from 12% to 16%. This acquisition does not constitute a reportable event. Compared to
US's
direct interest when
US
last had a reportable event (12% on September 1, 2001), after acquiring the 4% interest
US's
direct interest has not increased by at least a 10% direct interest (i.e., its direct interest increased by only 4%). Therefore,
US
does not have to report the December 1, 2001, acquisition under section 6046A. On April 1, 2002,
FC2
distributes a 6% direct interest in
FP
to
US. US
now owns a 22% direct interest in
FP.
Compared to
US's
direct interest when
US
last had a reportable event (12% on September 1, 2001), after the April 1 acquisition
US's
direct interest has increased by at least a 10% interest (12% to 22%).
US
must report the April 1, 2002 acquisition on a Form 8865 attached to
US's
2002 income tax return.

# Example 3.
Change in proportional interest resulting from withdrawal of a partner. Assume the same facts as
Example 3.
In addition, on January 5, 2003,
FC2
withdraws entirely from
FP.
As a result, the direct interests of
US
and
FC1
in
FP
each increase by at least the equivalent of 10% interests. Compared to
US's
direct interest the last time
US
had a reportable event (22% on April 1, 2002),
US's
direct interest has increased by at least the equivalent of a ten percent interest. Therefore,
US
has had a reportable event
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, and
US
must report the change in its interest resulting from
FC2's
withdrawal from the partnership on
US's
Form 8865 filed with
US's
2003 tax year income tax return.

# Example 4.
Change in proportional interest constituting an acquisition.
FP
is a foreign partnership that has no United States persons as direct or constructive partners.
US
is a United States person and a calendar year taxpayer. On January 1, 2001,
US
purchases an 8% direct interest in
FP. US
is not required to report this acquisition. US did not own a 10% or greater direct interest in
FP,
and
US
does not own a 10% or greater direct interest as a result of the acquisition. On March 1, 2001,
FC,
a foreign partner of
FP,
withdraws from
FP,
and as result,
US's
direct interest in
FP
increases by a 7% interest. The increase in
US's
direct interest is considered an acquisition of an interest under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section.
US
did not own a 10% or greater direct interest in
FP
before
FC
withdrew, and as a result of the increase in
US's
direct interest because of
FC's
withdrawal from
FP, US
now owns a 10% or greater direct interest in
FP.
Therefore,
US
must report under section 6046A the increase in
US's
direct interest resulting from the withdrawal of
FC
from
FP
on Form 8865 filed with
US's
tax return for
US's
2001 tax year.
(c)
Content of return.
The Form 8865 that must be filed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must contain the following information in such form and manner and to the extent that Form 8865 and its instructions prescribe—
(1) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the United States person required to file the return;
(2) Information about other persons (foreign or domestic) whose interests in the foreign partnership the person reporting under section 6046A is considered to own under section 6038(e)(3)(C) and section 267(c);
(3) Information about all foreign entities that were disregarded as entities separate from their owners under §§ 301.7701-2 and 301.7701-3 of this chapter that were owned by the foreign partnership during the partnership's tax year ending with or within the tax year of the person filing Form 8865 pursuant to section 6046A;
(4) For each reportable event, the date of the event, the type of event (acquisition, disposition, or change in proportional interest), and the United States person's direct percentage interest in the foreign partnership immediately before and immediately after the event;
(5) The fair market value of the interest acquired or disposed of;
(6) Information about partnerships (foreign and domestic) in which the foreign partnership owned a direct interest, or a constructive interest of ten percent or more under sections 267(c)(1) and (5) and the regulations thereunder, during the partnership's tax year ending with or within the tax year of the person filing Form 8865 pursuant to section 6046A; and
(7) Any other information required to be submitted by Form 8865 and its instructions.
(d)
Time and manner for filing returns.
The Form 8865 must be filed with the timely filed (including extensions) income tax return of the United States person for the tax year in which the reportable event occurs. If the United States person is not required to file an income tax return for its tax year in which the reportable event occurs, but is required to file an information return for that year (for example, Form 1065, “U.S. Partnership Return of Income,” or Form 990, “Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax”), the United States person should attach the Form 8865 to its information return filed for that tax year.
(e)
Duplicate returns.
If required by the instructions to Form 8865, a duplicate Form 8865 (including attachments and schedules) must also be filed.
(f)
Persons excepted from filing return
—(1)
Section 6038B overlap.
If a United States person acquires an interest in a foreign partnership as a result of a section 721 contribution required to be reported under section 6038B, and the person properly reports the contribution under section 6038B, then the United States person is not required to report the acquisition of the partnership interest under section 6046A(a) should it constitute a reportable event under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The acquisition will still constitute a reportable event for purposes of making future comparisons pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(B), (b)(1)(ii)(B) and (b)(1)(iii) of this section. A person that fails to properly report the section 721 contribution under section 6038B and the regulations thereunder and that
fails to properly report the acquisition of the partnership interest under section 6046A may be subject to the penalties applicable to a failure to comply with the requirements of section 6038B, as well as the penalties applicable for a failure to comply with the requirements of section 6046A. See paragraph (h) of this section for more information about the penalties for failure to comply with the requirements of section 6046A.

Such a report must be filed for each calendar year beginning with the year in which premiums for a contract are first paid and ending with the earlier of the year in which the individual in whose name the contract has been purchased attains age 85 (as adjusted pursuant to § 1.401(a)(9)-6(q)(4)(ii)(B)) or dies.
(2)
Surviving spouse.
If the individual dies and the sole beneficiary under the contract is the individual's spouse (in which case the spouse's annuity would not be required to commence until the individual would have commenced benefits under the contract had the individual survived), the report must continue to be filed for each calendar year until the calendar year in which the distributions to the spouse commence or in which the spouse dies, if earlier.

[T.D. 9673, 79 FR 37643, July 2, 2014, as amended by T.D. 10001, 89 FR 58906, July 19, 2024]
§ 1.6049-1
Returns of information as to interest paid in calendar years before 1983 and original issue discount includible in gross income for calendar years before 1983.
(a)
Requirement of reporting
—(1)
In general.
(i) Every person who makes payments of interest (as defined in § 1.6049-2) aggregating $10 or more to any other person during a calendar year before 1983 shall make an information return on Forms 1096 and 1099 for such calendar year showing the aggregate amount of such payments, the name and address of the person to whom paid, the total of such payments for all persons, and such other information as is required by the forms. In the case of interest paid during calendar years beginning with 1963 and continuing until such time as the Commissioner determines that it is feasible to aggregate payments on two or more accounts, insurance contracts, or investment certificates and this subdivision is amended accordingly to provide for reporting on an aggregate basis, the requirement of this subdivision for the
filing of Form 1099 will be met if a person making payments of interest to another person on two or more such accounts, insurance contracts, or investment certificates, files a separate Form 1099 with respect to each such account, contract, or certificate on which $10 or more of interest is paid to such other person during the calendar year. In the case of evidences of indebtedness described in section 6049(b)(1)(A), separate Forms 1099 may be filed as provided in the preceding sentence with respect to holdings in different issues. Thus, if a bank pays to a person interest totaling $15 on one account and $20 on a second account, it may file separate Forms 1099 with respect to the payments of $15 and $20. If the interest on the second account totaled $5 instead of $20, no return would be required with respect to the $5.
(ii)(
a
) Every person which is a corporation that has outstanding any bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness (referred to in this section and § 1.6049-2 as an obligation) in “registered form” (as defined in paragraph (d) of § 1.6049-2) issued after May 27, 1969 (other than an obligation issued by a corporation pursuant to a written commitment which was binding on May 27, 1969, and at all times thereafter) and on or before December 31, 1982, as to which there is during any calendar year before 1983 an amount of original issue discount (as defined in § 1.6049-2) aggregating $10 or more includible as interest in the gross income for such calendar year of any holder (determined, if semiannual record date reporting is being used under (
b
)(
1
) of this subdivision, by treating each holder as holding the obligation on every day it was outstanding during the calendar year), shall make an information return on Forms 1096 and 1099-OID for such calendar year showing the following:
(
1
) The name and address of each record holder for whom such aggregate amount of original issue discount is $10 or more and, for calendar years subsequent to 1972, the account, serial, or other identifying number of each obligation for which a return is being made.
(
2
) The aggregate amount of original issue discount includible by each such holder for the period during the calendar year for which the return is made (or, if the aggregation rules of (
b
)(
2
) of this subdivision are being used, that he held the obligations). If however, the semiannual record date reporting rules are being used under (
b
)(
1
) of this subdivision, such aggregate amount shall be determined by treating each such record date holder as if he held each such obligation on every day it was outstanding during the calendar year. For purposes of this section, an obligation shall be considered to be outstanding from the date of original issue (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.1232-3). In the case of a time deposit open account arrangement to which paragraph (e)(5) of § 1.1232-3A applies, for example, the amount to be shown under this subdivision (
2
) on the Forms 1096 and 1099-OID is the sum (computed under such paragraph (e)(5)) of the amounts separately computed for each deposit made pursuant to the arrangement.
(
3
) The issue price of the obligation (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.1232-3).
(
4
) The stated redemption price of the obligation at maturity (as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of § 1.1232-3).
(
5
) The ratable monthly portion of original issue discount with respect to the obligation as defined in section 1232(a)(3)(A) (determined without regard to a reduction for a purchase allowance or whether the holder purchased at a premium).
(
6
) The name and address of the person filing the form.
(
7
) Such other information as is required by the form. And,
(
8
) The sum, for all such holders of the aggregate amounts of such original issue discount includible for such calendar year for each such holder.
(
b
) With respect to any obligation (other than an obligation to which paragraph (e) or (f) of § 1.1232-3A applies (relating respectively to deposits in banks and similar financial institutions and to face-amount certificates)), the issuing corporation (or an agent acting on its behalf):
(
1
) Shall be permitted (until this subdivision (
1
) is amended) to prepare a Form 1099-OID only for each person
who is a holder of record of the obligation on the semiannual record date (if any) used by the corporation (or agent) for the payment of stated interest or, if there is no such date, the semiannual record dates shall be considered to be June 30, and December 31.
(
2
) Shall be permitted to aggregate all original issue discount with respect to 2 or more obligations of the same issue for which the amounts specified in (
a
)(
2
), (
a
)(
3
), (
a
)(
4
), and (
a
)(
5
) of this subdivision are proportional and, therefore, may file one Form 1099-OID for all such obligations being aggregated, except that for calendar year 1971 this aggregation rule shall apply only where such specified amounts are identical. For an illustration of proportional aggregation, see example (4) in (
d
) of this subdivision.
(
c
) In any case in which any one holder of a particular obligation for the calendar year held such obligation on more than one record date, only one Form 1099-OID shall be filed for that year with respect to that holder and that obligation. This provision applies only in the case in which any corporation prepares Forms 1099-OID in accordance with the record date reporting rule of (
b
)(
1
) of this subdivision.
(
d
) The requirements of (
a
)(
3
), (
a
)(
4
), and (
a
)(
5
) of this subdivision shall not apply to a time deposit open account arrangement to which paragraph (e)(5) of § 1.1232-3A applies, or to a face-amount certificate to which paragraph (f) of § 1.1232-3A applies.
(
e
) The provisions of this subdivision (ii) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On January 1, 1971, a corporation issued a 10-year bond in registered form which pays stated interest to the holder of record on June 30 and December 31. The bond has an issue price (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.1232-3) of $7,600, a stated redemption price (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.1232-3) at maturity of $10,000, and a ratable monthly portion of original issue discount (as defined in section 1232(a)(3)(A)) of $20. The corporation's books indicate that A was the holder of record on June 30, 1971, and B was the holder on December 31, 1971. Under (
b
)(
1
) of this subdivision, the corporation is permitted to file separate Forms 1099-OID for both A and B showing, on each form, all items required by (
a
) of this subdivision, including the total original issue discount of $240 for the entire calendar year (which includes original issue discount for all holders), the issue price of $7,600, the stated redemption price at maturity of $10,000, and the ratable monthly portion of original issue discount of $20.

# Example 2.
Assume the facts stated in Example (1), except that A is recorded on the books of the corporation as holding the bond on June 30 and December 31, 1971. The corporation shall complete and file only one Form 1099-OID for A.

# Example 3.
Assume the facts stated in Example (1), except that the books of the corporation show that A held 2 of the bonds at all times in 1971. The amounts of the items listed in (
a
)(
2
), (
a
)(
3
), (
a
)(
4
), and (
a
)(
5
) of this subdivision are identical for the 2 bonds. Under (
b
)(
2
) of this subdivision, the corporation is permitted to treat the 2 bonds as one for purposes of completing and filing a Form 1099-OID for 1971 and aggregate the amounts being reported.

# Example 4.
On January 1, 1972, a corporation issued to C 3 bonds in registered form of the same issue with stated redemption prices of $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000. The aggregate amounts of original issue discount for each year, the issue prices, the stated redemption prices, and the monthly portions of original issue discount are the same for each $1,000 of stated redemption price. Thus, all relevant amounts for any one bond are proportional to such amounts for any other bond. Therefore, so long as C holds the bonds the corporation shall be permitted to aggregate on one Form 1099-OID all original issue discount with respect to such obligations in accordance with (
b
)(
2
) of this subdivision.

# Example 5.
On June 1, 1971, a corporation issues a 10-year bond to D, for which the ratable monthly portion of original issue discount is $10. For 1971, the corporation uses the record date reporting system permitted by (
b
)(

) of this subdivision. The corporation's books show that E held the bond on June 30, 1971, and that F held the bond on December 31, 1971, the dates on which the corporation pays stated interest on the bond. The corporation shall file a Form 1099-OID for both E and F showing on each form the aggregate amount of original issue discount includible for 1971 or $70 since E and F are each treated as if each held the bond every day it was outstanding and it was outstanding 7 months in 1971. As to D, the corporation is not required to file a Form 1099-OID since D did not hold the bond on either of the 2 record dates.
(iii) Every person who during a calendar year before 1983 receives payments of interest as a nominee on behalf of another person aggregating $10 or more shall make an information return on Forms 1096 and 1087 for such calendar year showing the aggregate
amount of such interest, the name and address of the person on whose behalf received, the total of such interest received on behalf of all persons, and such other information as is required by the forms.
(iv) Except with respect to an obligation to which paragraph (e) or (f) of § 1.1232-3A applies (relating respectively to deposits in banks and similar financial institutions and to face-amount certificates), every person who is a nominee on behalf of the actual owner of an obligation as to which there is original issue discount aggregating $10 or more includible in the gross income of such owner during a calendar year before 1983, regardless of whether he receives a Form 1099-OID with respect to such discount, shall make an information return on Forms 1096 and 1087-OID for such calendar year showing in the manner prescribed on such forms the same information for the actual owner as is required or permitted in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph for the record holder.
(v) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (iii) and (iv) of this subparagraph, the filing of Form 1087 or Form 1087-OID is not required if:
(
a
) The record owner is required to file a fiduciary return on Form 1041 disclosing the name, address, and identifying number of the actual owner;
(
b
) The record owner is a nominee of a banking institution or trust company exercising trust powers, and such banking institution or trust company is required to file a fiduciary return on Form 1041 disclosing the name, address, and identifying number of the actual owner; or
(
c
) The record owner is a banking institution or trust company exercising trust powers, or a nominee thereof, and the actual owner is an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) for which such banking institution or trust company files an annual return,
but only if the name, address, and identifying number of the record owner are included on or with the Form 1041 fiduciary return filed for the estate or trust or the annual return filed for the tax exempt organization.
(vi) Every person carrying on the banking business who makes payments of interest to another person (whether or not aggregating $10 or more) during a calendar year with respect to a certificate of deposit issued in bearer form (other than such a certificate issued in an amount of $100,000 or more) shall make an information return on Forms 1096 and 1099-BCD for such calendar year. The preceding sentence applies whether such payments are made during the term of the certificate or at its redemption. The information return required by this subdivision for the calendar year shall show the following:
(
a
) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person to whom the interest is paid;
(
b
) The aggregate amount of interest paid to such person during the calendar year with respect to the certificate of deposit;
(
c
) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person to whom the certificate was originally issued;
(
d
) The portion of the interest with respect to the certificate reported under (
b
) that is attibutable to the current calendar year; and
(
e
) Such other information as is required by the form.
The application of this subdivision (vi) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On June 1, 1978, X Bank issues a $1,000 bearer certificate of deposit to A. The certificate of deposit is not redeemable until May 31, 1979, and no interest is to be paid on the instrument until its redemption. On September 1, 1978. A transfers the bearer certificate to B and on May 31, 1979, B presents the certificate to X for payment and receives the $1,000 principal amount plus all the accrued interest. Under paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section, X is not required to make an information return for 1978 with respect to the bearer certificate of deposit because no interest is actually paid to a holder of the certificate during 1978. X is required to file an information return for 1979 with respect to the certificate, identifying B as the payee of the entire amount of the interest and A as the original purchaser of the certificate. (For rules relating to statements to be made to recipients of interest payments, see § 1.6049-3.)

# Example 2.
On July 1, 1978, Y Bank issues a $5,000 bearer certificate of deposit to C. The certificate of deposit is not redeemable until June 30, 1981, and no interest is to be paid on the instrument until its redemption. C holds
the certificate for the entire term and on June 30, 1981, presents it to Y for payment and receives the $5,000 principal amount plus the accrued interest. Under paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section, Y is not required to file an information return for calendar years 1978, 1979, or 1980 with respect to this bearer certificate of deposit because no interest is acutally paid to C during those calendar years. Y is required to file an information return for 1981 with respect to the certificate identifying C as the payee of the entire amount of the interest and as the original purchaser. (Although Y is not required to file an information return for interest paid on the certificate until its redemption in 1981, C must report as income on his tax returns for 1978, 1979, 1980, and 1981 the ratable portion of such interest includible in income under section 1232.)
(2)
Definitions.
(i) The term “person” when used in this section does not include the United States, a State, the District of Columbia, a foreign government, a political subdivision of a State or of a foreign government, or an international organization. Therefore, interest paid by or to one of these entities need not be reported. Similarly, original issue discount in respect of an obligation issued by or to one of these entities need not be reported.
(ii) For purposes of this section, a person who receives interest shall be considered to have received it as a nominee if he is not the actual owner of such interest and if he was required under § 1.6109-1 to furnish his identifying number to the payer of the interest (or would have been so required if the total of such interest for the year had been $10 or more), and such number was (or would have been) required to be included on an information return filed by the payer with respect to the interest. However, a person shall not be considered to be a nominee as to any portion of an interest payment which is actually owned by another person whose name is also shown on the information return filed by the payer or nominee with respect to such interest payment. Thus, in the case of a savings account jointly owned by a husband and wife, the husband will not be considered as receiving any portion of the interest on that account as a nominee for his wife if his wife's name is included on the information return filed by the payer with respect to the interest.
(iii) For purposes of this section, in the case of a person who receives a Form 1099-OID, the determination of who is considered a nominee shall be made in a manner consistent with the principles of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.
(iv) For purposes of this section and § 1.6049-3, the term “Form 1099-OID” means the appropriate Form 1099 for original issue discount prescribed for the calendar year.
(3)
Determination of person to whom interest is paid or for whom it is received.
For purposes of applying the provisions of this section, the person whose identifying number is required to be included by the payer of interest on an information return with respect to such interest shall be considered the person to whom the interest is paid. In the case of interest received by a nominee on behalf of another person, the person whose identifying number is required to be included on an information return made by the nominee with respect to such interest shall be considered the person on whose behalf such interest is received by the nominee. Thus, in the case of interest made payable to a person other than the record owner of the obligation with respect to which the interest is paid, the record owner of the obligation shall be considered the person to whom the interest is paid for purposes of applying the reporting requirements of this section, since his identifying number is required to be included on the information return filed under such section by the payer of the interest. Similarly, if a stockbroker receives interest on a bond held in street name for the joint account of a husband and wife, the interest is considered as received on behalf of the husband since his identifying number should be shown on the information return filed by the nominee under this section. Thus, if the wife has a separate account with the same stockbroker, any interest received by the stockbroker for her separate account should not be aggregated with the interest received for the joint account for purposes of information reporting. For regulations relating to the use of identifying numbers, see § 1.6109-1.
(4)
Determination of person by whom original issue discount is includible or for whom a Form 1099-OID showing original issue discount is received.
For purposes of applying the provisions of this section, the determination of the person by whom original issue discount is includible or for whom a Form 1099-OID is received shall be made in a manner consistent with the principles of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(5)
Inclusion of other payments.
The Form 1099 filed by any person with respect to payments of interest to another person during a calendar year prior to 1972 may, at the election of the maker, include payments other than interest made by him to such other person during such year which are required to be reported on Form 1099. Similarly, the Form 1087 filed by a nominee with respect to payments of interest received by him on behalf of any other person during a calendar year prior to 1972 may include payments of dividends received by him on behalf of such person during such year which are required to be reported on Form 1087. However, except as provided in subparagraph (1)(ii)(
b
) of this paragraph, a separate Form 1087-OID or 1099-OID shall be filed for each obligation in respect of which original issue discount is required to be reported for any calendar year before 1983. In addition, any person required to report payments on both Forms 1087, 1087-OID, 1099, and 1099-OID, for any calendar year may use one Form 1096 to summarize and transmit such forms.
(b)
When payment deemed made.
For purposes of section 6049, interest is deemed to have been paid when it is credited or set apart to a person without any substantial limitation or restriction as to the time or manner of payment or condition upon which payment is to be made, and is made available to him so that it may be drawn at any time, and its receipt brought within his own control and disposition.
(c)
Time and place for filing
—(1)
Payment of interest.
The returns required under this section for any calendar year for the payment of interest shall be filed after September 30 of such year, but not before the payer's final payment for the year, and on or before February 28 of the following year with any of the Internal Revenue Service Centers, the addresses of which are listed in the instructions for Form 1096. For extensions of time for filing returns under this section, see § 1.6081-1.
(2)
Original issue discount.
(i) The returns required under this section for any calendar year for original issue discount shall be filed after December 31 of such year and on or before February 28 of the following year with any of the Internal Revenue Service Centers, the addresses of which are listed in the instructions for Form 1096. For extensions of time for filing returns under this section, see § 1.6081-1.
(ii) The time for filing returns for the calendar year 1971 required under this section for original issue discount in respect of obligations to which paragraph (e) of § 1.1232-3A applies (relating to deposits in banks and other similar financial institutions) is extended to April 15, 1972.
(d)
Penalty.
For penalty for failure to file the statements required by this section, see § 301.6652-1 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
(e)
Permission to submit information required by Form 1087 or 1099 on magnetic tape.
For rules relating to permission to submit the information required by Form 1087 or 1099 on magnetic tape or other media, see § 1.9101-1.

§ 1.6049-2
Interest and original issue discount subject to reporting in calendar years before 1983.
(a)
Interest in general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the term “interest” when used in this section and §§ 1.6049-1 and 1.6049-3 means:
(1) Interest on evidences of indebtedness issued by a corporation in “registered form” (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section). The phrase “evidences of indebtedness” includes bond, debentures, notes, certificates and other similar instruments regardless of how denominated.
(2) Interest on deposits (except deposits evidenced by negotiable time certificates of deposit issued in an amount of $100,000 or more) paid (or credited) by persons carrying on the banking business. In the case of a certificate of deposit issued in bearer form, the term “interest”, as used in the preceding sentence and in paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of § 1.6049-1, has the same meaning as in § 1.61-7 (regardless of whether taxable to the payee in the year the information return is made).
(3) Amounts, whether or not designated as interest, paid (or credited) by mutual savings banks, savings and loan associations, building and loan associations, cooperative banks, homestead associations, credit unions, or similar organizations in respect of deposits, face amount certificates, investment certificates, or withdrawable or repurchasable shares. Thus, even though amounts paid or credited by such organizations with respect to deposits are designated as “dividends”, such amounts are included in the definition of interest for purposes of section 6049.
(4) Interest on amounts held by insurance companies under agreements to pay interest thereon. This includes interest paid by insurance companies with respect to policy “dividend” accumulations (see sections 61 and 451 and the regulations thereunder for rules as to when such interest is considered paid), and interest paid with respect to the proceeds of insurance policies left with the insurer. The so-called “interest element” in the case of annuity or installment payments under life insurance or endowment contracts does not constitute interest for purposes of this section.
(5) Interest on deposits with stockbrokers, bondbrokers, and other persons engaged in the business of dealing in securities.
(b)
Exceptions.
The term “interest” when used in section 6049 does not include:
(1) Interest on obligations described in section 103(a) (1) or (3), relating to certain governmental obligations.
(2) Any payment by:
(i) A foreign corporation,
(ii) A nonresident alien individual, or
(iii) A partnership composed in whole or in part of nonresident aliens,
if such corporation, individual, or partnership is not engaged in trade or business within the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal or paying agent in the United States.
(3) Any interest which is subject to withholding under section 1441 or 1442 (relating to withholding of tax on nonresident aliens and foreign corporations, respectively) by the person making the payment, or which would be so subject to withholding but for the provisions of a treaty, or for the fact that under section 861(a)(1) it is not from sources within the United States, or for the fact that withholding is not required by reason of paragraph (a) or (f) of § 1.1441-4.
(4) In the case of a nominee, any interest which he receives and with respect to which he is required to withhold under section 1441 or 1442, or would be so required to withhold but for the provisions of a treaty, or for the fact that under section 861(a)(1) it is not from sources within the United States, or for the fact that withholding is not required by reason of paragraph (a) or (f) of § 1.1441-4.
(5) Any amount on which the person making the payment is required to deduct and withhold a tax under section 1451 (relating to tax-free covenant bonds), or would be so required but for section 1451(d) (relating to benefit of personal exemptions).
(6) Any amount which is subject to reporting as original issue discount.
(c)
Original issue discount
—(1)
In general.
The term “original issue discount” when used in this section and §§ 1.6049-1 and 1.6049-3 means original issue discount subject to the ratable inclusion rules of paragraph (a) of § 1.1232-3A, determined without regard to any reduction by reason of a purchase allowance under paragraph
(a)(2)(ii) of § 1.1232-3A or a purchase at a premium as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of § 1.1232-3.
(2)
Coordination with interest reporting.
In the case of an obligation issued after May 27, 1969 (other than an obligation issued pursuant to a written commitment which was binding on May 27, 1969, and at all times thereafter) and on or before December 31, 1982, original issue discount which is not subject to the reporting requirements of paragrah (a)(1)(ii) of § 1.6049-1 is interest within the meaning of pargraph (a) of this section. Original issue discount which is subject to the reporting requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of § 1.6049-1 is not interest within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section.
(3)
Exceptions.
Reporting of original issue discount is not required in respect of an obligation which paragraph (b)(2) of this section except from interest reporting.
(d)
Definition of “in registered form.”
For purposes of § 1.6049-1 and this section, an evidence of indebtedness is in registered form if it is registered as to both principal and interest (or, for purposes of reporting with respect to original issue discount, if it is registered as to principal) and if its transfer must be effected by the surrender of the old instrument and either the reissuance by the corporation of the old instrument to the new holder or the issuance by the corporation of a new instrument to the new holder.

§ 1.6049-4
Return of information as to interest paid and original issue discount includible in gross income after December 31, 1982.

—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an information return shall be made by a payor, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, of amounts of interest and original issue discount paid after December 31, 1982. Such return shall contain the information described in paragraph (b) of this section.

For payments made after December 31, 2002, a payor is a person described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(i) Every person who makes a payment of the type and of the amount subject to reporting under this section (or under an applicable section under this chapter) to any other person during a calendar year.
(ii) Every person who collects on behalf of another person payments of the type and of the amount subject to reporting under this section (or under an applicable section under this chapter), or who otherwise acts as a middleman (as defined in paragraph (f)(4) of this section) with respect to such payment.
(b)
Information to be reported
—(1)
Interest payments.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (5) of this section, in the case of interest other than original issue discount treated as interest under § 1.6049-5(f), an information return on Form 1099 shall be made for the calendar year showing the aggregate amount of the payments, the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person to whom paid, the amount of tax deducted and withheld under section 3406 from the payments, if any, and such other information as required by the forms. An information return is generally not required if the amount of interest paid to a person aggregates less than $10 or if the payment is made to a person who is an exempt recipient described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, unless the payor backup withholds under section 3406 on such payment (because, for example, the payee (
i.e.,
exempt recipient) has failed to furnish a Form W-9 on request), in which case the payor must make a return under this section, unless the payor refunds the amount withheld pursuant to § 31.6413(a)-3 (Employment Tax Regulations). For reporting interest paid to certain nonresident alien individuals, see § 1.6049-8.
(2)
Original issue discount.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) and (b)(5) of this section, in the case of original issue discount, an information return on Forms 1096 and 1099 shall be made for each calendar year of any holder of an obligation as to which there is original issue discount includible in gross income aggregating $10 or more. For calendar years before 1992, semiannual record date reporting under § 1.6049-1(a)(1)(ii)(
b
)(
1
) may be used, and if it is used, the original issue discount includible in gross income is determined by treating each holder as holding the obligation on every day it was outstanding during the calendar year. An information return shall be made, however, in any case in which an amount of tax is required to be deducted and withheld under section 3406. In such case, the amount required to be reported is the amount subject to withholding even if the amount of original issue discount includible in gross income is less than $10. With respect to an obligation described in § 1.1232-3A (e) or (f) (relating respectively to deposits in banks and similar financial institutions and to face-amount certificates), § 1.6049-1(a)(1)(ii)(
d
) and the last sentence of § 1.6049-1(a)(1)(ii)(

) shall apply. The information return shall show:
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each record holder for whom an amount of original issue discount is includible in gross income;
(ii) The account, serial, or other identifying number of each obligation with respect to which a return is being made;
(iii) The aggregate amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of each holder for the period during the calendar year for which the return is made (or, if the aggregation rules of § 1.6049-1(a)(1)(ii)(
b
)(

) may be used, and if it is used, the original issue discount includible in gross income is determined by treating each holder as holding the obligation on every day it was outstanding during the calendar year. For purposes of this section, an obligation shall be considered to be outstanding from the date of original issue (as defined in § 1.1232-3(b)(3));
(iv) The amount of tax withheld under section 3406, if any;
(v) The name and address of the person filing the return: and
(vi) Such other information as is required by the forms.

(3)
Returns made by middleman
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, every person acting as a middleman (as defined in paragraph (f)(4) of this section) shall make an information return for the calendar year. In the case of interest payments (other than original issue discount and other than interest described in § 1.6049-8), the information return shall be made on Form 1099 and shall show the aggregate amount of the interest, the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person on whose behalf received, the amount of tax withheld under section 3406, if any, and such other information as required by the forms. In the case of original issue discount, the information return shall show the information required to be shown for the person on whose behalf received, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. See § 1.6049-5(f) to determine whether a middleman is required to make an information return with respect to original issue discount. A middleman shall make an information return regardless of whether the middleman receives a Form 1099. A middleman shall not be required to make an information return if the payment of interest aggregates less than $10 or if the payment is made to an exempt recipient described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, unless the payor backup withholds under section 3406 on such payment (because, for example, the payee has failed to furnish a Form W-9 on request), in which case the payor must make a return under this section, unless the payor refunds the amount withheld pursuant to § 31.6413(a)-3 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations).
(ii)
Forwarding of interest coupons and original issue discount obligations.
In the case of a middleman who, from within the United States, forwards an interest coupon or discount obligation on behalf of a payee for presentation, collection or payment outside the United States, the middleman shall make an information return on Form 1099 for the calendar year showing, in the case of an interest coupon, the information required under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section and, in the case of a discount obligation, information required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), a middleman is considered to forward an interest coupon or discount obligation on behalf of a payee for presentation, collection or payment outside the United States if the middleman forwards the coupon or obligations outside the United States on or after the date when the payee is entitled to be paid or at an earlier date that is within 90 days of such date or if the middleman has actual knowledge that the coupon or obligation is being forwarded outside the United States for presentation, collection, or payment outside the United States. However, the transfer, although subject to information reporting under this section, is not subject to backup withholding under section 3406.
(iii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section:

# Example.
Individual F, who is entitled to payment on an interest coupon, instructs an office of Bank M in the United States to forward the coupon to Bank N for collection by Bank N outside the United States. Bank M in the United States forwards the interest coupon to Bank N outside the United States. Bank M is required to make an information return for the calendar year under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section showing the aggregate amount of the interest coupon forwarded, the name, address of the permanent residence, and the taxpayer identification number, if any, of Individual F and such other information as the form requires.
(4)
Returns made with respect to payments on certificates of deposit issued in bearer form.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, every person carrying on the banking business who makes payments of interest to another person (whether or not aggregating $10 or more) during a calendar year with respect to a certificate of deposit issued in bearer form shall make an information return on Forms 1096 and 1099. The information return shall show the information required in § 1.6049-1(a)(1)(vi) (
a
) through (
e
) inclusive and a statement as to the amount of tax withheld under section 3406, if any.
(5)
Interest payments to certain nonresident alien individuals
—(i)
General rule.
In the case of interest aggregating $10 or more paid to a nonresident alien individual (as defined in section 7701(b)(1)(B)) that is reportable under § 1.6049-8(a), the payor shall make an information return on Form 1042-S, “Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding,” for the calendar year in which the interest is paid. The payor or middleman shall prepare and file Form 1042-S at the time and in the manner prescribed by section 1461 and the regulations under that section and by the form and its accompanying instructions. See §§ 1.1461-1(b) (rules regarding the preparation of a Form 1042) and 1.6049-6(e)(4) (rules for furnishing a copy of the Form 1042-S to the recipient). To determine whether an information return is required for original issue discount, see §§ 1.6049-5(f) and 1.6049-8(a).
(ii)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section shall be applicable for payments made on or after January 1, 2013. (For interest paid to a Canadian nonresident alien individual on or before December 31, 2012, see paragraph (b)(5) of this section as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2000.)
(c)
Information returns not required
—(1)
Payment to exempt recipient
—(i)
In general.
No information return is required with respect to any payment made to an exempt recipient described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, except to the extent otherwise provided in § 1.6049-5(d)(3) (ii) and (iii). However, if the payor backup withholds under section 3406 on such payment (because, for example, the payee has failed to furnish a Form W-9 on request), then the payor is required to make a return under this section, unless the payor refunds the amount withheld in accordance with § 31.6413(a)-3 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations).
(ii)
Exempt recipient defined.
The term
exempt recipient
means any person described in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(A) through (Q) of this section. An exempt recipient is generally exempt from information reporting without filing a certificate claiming exempt status unless the provisions of this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) require a payee to file a certificate.
A payor may, in any case, require a payee that is a U.S. person not otherwise required to file a certificate under this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) to file a certificate in order to qualify as an exempt recipient. See § 31.3406(h)-3(a)(1)(iii) and (c)(2) of this chapter for the certificate that a payee that is a U.S. person must provide when a payor requires the certificate to treat the payee as an exempt recipient under this paragraph (c)(1)(ii). A payor may treat a payee as an exempt recipient based upon a properly completed form as described in § 31.3406(h)-3(e)(2) of this chapter, its actual knowledge that the payee is a person described in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii), or the indicators described in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii).
(A)
Corporation.
A corporation, as defined in section 7701(a)(3), whether domestic or foreign, is an exempt recipient. In addition, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), the term
corporation
includes a partnership all of whose members are corporations described in this paragraph (c)(1), but only if the partnership files with the payor a certificate stating that each member of the partnership meets one of the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) (
1
) through (
4
) of this section. Absent actual knowledge otherwise, a payor may treat a payee as a corporation (and, therefore, as an exempt recipient) if one of the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) (
1
), (
2
), (
3
), or (
4
), of this section are met before a payment is made.
(
1
) The name of the payee contains an unambiguous expression of corporate status that is Incorporated, Inc., Corporation, Corp., P.C., (but not Company or Co.) or contains the term
insurance company, indemnity company, reinsurance company,
or
assurance company,
or its name indicates that it is an entity listed as a per se corporation under § 301.7701-2(b)(8)(i) of this chapter.
(
2
) The payor has on file a corporate resolution or similar document clearly indicating corporate status. For this purpose, a similar document includes a copy of Form 8832, filed by the entity to elect classification as an association under § 301.7701-3(b) of this chapter.
(
3
) The payor receives a Form W-9 which includes an EIN and a statement from the payee that it is a domestic corporation.
(
4
) The payor receives a withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i), that includes a certification that the person whose name is on the certificate is a foreign corporation.
(B)
Tax exempt organization
—(
1
)
In general.
Any organization that is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) is an exempt recipient. A custodial account under section 403(b)(7) shall be considered an exempt recipient under this paragraph. A payor may treat an organization as an exempt recipient under this paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) without requiring a certificate if the organization's name is listed in the compilation by the Commissioner of organizations for which a deduction for charitable contributions is allowed, if the name of the organization contains an unambiguous indication that it is a tax-exempt organization, or if the organization is known to the payor to be a tax-exempt organization.
(
2
)
Examples.
The application of the provisions of this paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The following persons maintain accounts at M Bank: N College, O University, and P Church. M may treat N, O, and P as exempt recipients even though such persons have not filed an exemption certificate with M because the names of the organizations contain an unambiguous indication that they are tax exempt organizations.

# Example 2.
Q is listed in the current edition of Internal Revenue Service Publication 78 as an organization for which deductions are permitted for charitable contributions under section 170(c). Such listing has not been revoked by an announcement published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter). A payor may treat Q as an exempt recipient even though Q has not filed an exemption certificate with the payor.

# Example 3.
Employer R maintains a section 403(b)(7) custodial account with Regulated Investment Company S on behalf of R's employees. S may treat the account as an exempt recipient even though R or its employees have not filed an exemption certificate with S.
(C)
Individual retirement plan.
An individual retirement plan as defined in section 7701(a)(37) is an exempt recipient. A payor may treat any such plan of which it is the trustee or custodian as an exempt recipient under this paragraph (c)(1) without requiring a certificate.
(D)
United States.
The United States Government and any wholly-owned agency or instrumentality thereof are exempt recipients. A payor may treat a person as an exempt recipient under this paragraph (c)(1) without requiring a certificate if the name of such person reasonably indicates it is described in this paragraph (c)(1).
(E)
State.
A State, the District of Columbia, a possession of the United States, a political subdivision of any of the foregoing, wholly-owned agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, and a pool or partnership composed exclusively of any of the foregoing are exempt recipients. A payor may treat a person as an exempt recipient under this paragraph (c)(1) without requiring a certificate if the name of such person reasonably indicates it is described in this paragraph (c)(1) or if such person is known generally in the community to be a State, the District of Columbia, a possession of the United States or a political subdivision or a wholly-owned agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing (for example, an account held in the name of “Town of S” or “County of T” may be treated as held by an exempt recipient under this paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(E)).
(F)
Foreign government.
A foreign government, a political subdivision of a foreign government, and any wholly-
owned agency or instrumentality of either of the foregoing are exempt recipients. A payor may treat a foreign government or a political subdivision thereof as an exempt recipient under this paragraph (c)(1) without requiring a certificate provided that its name reasonably indicates that it is a foreign government or provided that it is known to the payor to be a foreign government or a political subdivision thereof (for example, an account held in the name of the “Government of V” may be treated as held by a foreign government).
(G)
International organization.
An international organization and any wholly-owned agency or instrumentality thereof are exempt recipients. The term
international organization
shall have the meaning ascribed to it in section 7701(a)(18). A payor may treat a payee as an international organization without requiring a certificate if the payee is designated as an international organization by executive order (pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 288 through 288(f)).
(H)
Foreign central bank of issue.
A foreign central bank of issue is an exempt recipient. A foreign central bank of issue is a bank which is by law or government sanction the principal authority, other than the government itself, issuing instruments intended to circulate as currency. See § 1.895-1(b)(1). A payor may treat a person as a foreign central bank of issue (and, therefore, as an exempt recipient) without requiring a certificate provided that such person is known generally in the financial community as a foreign central bank of issue or if its name reasonably indicates that it is a foreign central bank of issue.
(I)
Securities or commodities dealer.
A dealer in securities, commodities, or notional principal contracts, that is registered as such under the laws of the United States or a State or under the laws of a foreign country is an exempt recipient. A payor may treat a dealer as an exempt recipient under this paragraph (c)(1) without requiring a certificate if the person is known generally in the investment community to be a dealer meeting the requirements set forth in this paragraph (c)(1) (for example, a registered broker-dealer or a person listed as a member firm in the most recent publication of members of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.).
(J)
Real estate investment trust.
A real estate investment trust, as defined in section 856 and § 1.856-1, is an exempt recipient. A payor may treat a person as a real estate investment trust (and, therefore, as an exempt recipient) without requiring a certificate if the person is known generally in the investment community as a real estate investment trust.
(K)
Entity registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
An entity registered at all times during the taxable year under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a-1), (or during such portion of the taxable year that it is in existence), is an exempt recipient. An entity that is created during the taxable year will be treated as meeting the registration requirement of the preceding sentence provided that such entity is so registered at all times during the taxable year for which such entity is in existence. A payor may treat such an entity as an exempt recipient under this paragraph (c)(1) without requiring a certificate if the entity is known generally in the investment community to meet the requirements of the preceding sentence.
(L)
Common trust fund.
A common trust fund, as defined in section 584(a), is an exempt recipient. A payor may treat the fund as an exempt recipient without requiring a certificate provided that its name reasonably indicates that it is a common trust fund or provided that it is known to the payor to be a common trust fund.
(M)
Financial institution.
A financial institution such as a bank, mutual savings bank, savings and loan association, building and loan association, cooperative bank, homestead association, credit union, industrial loan association or bank, or other similar organization, whether organized in the United States or under the laws of a foreign country is an exempt recipient. A financial institution also includes a clearing organization defined in § 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(
8
) and the Bank for International Settlements. A payor may
treat any person described in the preceding sentence as an exempt recipient without requiring a certificate if the person's name (including a foreign name, such as “Banco” or “Banque”) reasonably indicates the payee is a financial institution described in the preceding sentence. In the case of a foreign person, a payor may also treat a person on such list as the Internal Revenue Service may publish or approve (such as in the Thomson Bank Directory or a list approved by the Federal Reserve Board).
(N)
Trust.
A trust which is exempt from tax under section 664(c) (i.e., a charitable remainder annuity trust or a charitable remainder unitrust) or is described in section 4947(a)(1) (relating to certain charitable trusts) is an exempt recipient. A payor which is a trustee of the trust may treat the trust as an exempt recipient without requiring a certificate.
(O)
Nominees or custodians.
A nominee or custodian.
(P)
Brokers.
A broker as defined in section 6045(c) and § 1.6045-1(a)(1).
(Q)
Swap dealers.
A dealer in notional principal contracts as defined in § 1.446-3(c)(4)(iii).
(iii)
Exempt recipient no longer exempt.
Any person who ceases to be an exempt recipient shall, no later than 10 days after such cessation, notify the payor in writing when it ceases to be an exempt recipient unless it reasonably appears that the person formerly qualifying as an exempt recipient will not thereafter receive a reportable payment from the payor. If a payor treats a person as an exempt recipient by requiring the exempt recipient to file a certificate claiming exempt status, that person shall revoke the certificate as provided in the preceding sentence. If the exempt recipient terminates its relationship with the payor prior to the time that the notice of change in status is otherwise required, the exempt recipient is not required to notify the payor. If, however, the person who formerly qualified as an exempt recipient later reinstates the relationship with the payor, the person must, prior to receiving a reportable payment from such relationship, notify the payor that it no longer qualifies as an exempt recipient in case the payor relies upon the previous treatment.
(2)
Payments by certain middlemen.
An information return shall not be required if:
(i) The record owner is required to file a fiduciary return on Form 1041 disclosing the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the actual owner, and furnishes Form K-1 to each actual owner containing the information required to be shown on the form, including amounts withheld under section 3406;
(ii) The record owner is a nominee of a banking institution or trust company exercising trust powers, and such banking institution or trust company is required to file a fiduciary return on Form 1041 disclosing the name, address, and identifying number of the actual owner, and furnishes Form K-1 to each actual owner containing the information required to be shown on the form, including amounts withheld under section 3406;
(iii) The record owner is a banking institution or trust company exercising trust powers, or a nominee thereof, and the actual owner is an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) for which such banking institution or trust company files an annual return, but only if the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the record owner is included on or with the Form 1041 fiduciary return filed for the estate or trust or the annual return filed for the tax exempt organization.
(3)
Coordination with reporting rules for widely held fixed investment trusts under § 1.671-5 of this chapter.
See § 1.671-5 for the reporting rules for widely held fixed investment trusts (as defined under that section).
(4)
Coordination of reporting with chapter 4 reporting or an applicable IGA
—(i)
U.S. accounts reported by FFIs that are non-U.S. payors.
An information return shall not be required with respect to an interest payment made by a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI), that is a non-U.S. payor (as defined in § 1.6049-5(c)(5)) to an account holder of an account maintained by the FFI, when the payment is not
subject to withholding under chapter 4 or to backup withholding under section 3406, and the conditions of paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section, as applicable, are met. See paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section for circumstances in which an FFI may allocate a payment described in this paragraph (c)(4)(i) to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees.
(A) The FFI is a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) reporting the account holder of the U.S. account (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(133)) pursuant to either § 1.1471-4(d)(3) or (5) for the year in which the payment is made (including reporting of the account holder's TIN).
(B) The FFI is a registered deemed-compliant FFI (other than a reporting Model 1 FFI) reporting the account holder of the U.S. account pursuant to the conditions of its applicable deemed-compliant status under § 1.1471-5(f)(1) for the year in which the payment is made (including reporting of the account holder's TIN).
(C) The FFI is a reporting Model 1 FFI reporting the account holder of the reportable U.S. account pursuant to an applicable Model 1 IGA for the year in which the payment is made (including reporting of the account holder's TIN).
(ii)
Other accounts reported by FFIs under chapter 4.
An information return shall not be required under this section with respect to a payment that is not subject to withholding under chapter 3 (as defined in § 1.1441-2(a)) or backup withholding under § 31.3406(g)-1(e) and that is made to a recalcitrant account holder of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (or non-consenting U.S. account of a reporting Model 2 FFI), provided that the FFI reports such account holder in accordance with the classes of account holders described in § 1.1471-4(d)(6) for the year in which the payment is made. See paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section for circumstances in which an FFI may allocate a payment described in this paragraph (c)(4)(ii) to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees. In the case of a payment made by an FFI that is a reporting Model 1 FFI, an information return shall not be required with respect to a payment that is not subject to withholding under chapter 3 or backup withholding under § 31.3406(g)-1(e) and that is made to an account holder of the FFI if the account—
(A) Has U.S. indicia for which appropriate documentation sufficient to treat the account as held by other than a specified U.S. person has not been provided pursuant to the due diligence requirements described in an applicable Model 1 IGA, and
(B) Is therefore treated as a U.S. reportable account that the FFI is required to report pursuant to the applicable Model 1 IGA.
(iii)
Coordination of reporting exceptions with reporting of chapter 4 withholding rate pools.
For purposes of paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI) receiving a payment from another payor may provide a withholding statement to the payor allocating the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate of pool of U.S. payees only if the payment is excepted from reporting under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section or if the payment is both excepted from reporting under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section and not subject to withholding under chapter 4. See § 1.6049-5(b)(14) (providing an exception from reporting under section 6049 to a payor that has been furnished a withholding statement from an participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI) and that allocates the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool). Thus, for example, a U.S. payor that is a participating FFI may not allocate a payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees on a withholding statement described in § 1.6049-5(b)(14) when the payment is made to a U.S. account maintained by the FFI, regardless of whether the FFI reports the account in accordance with § 1.1471-4(d)(3) because the U.S. payor is not excepted from reporting under this section pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.
(iv)
Example.
The application of the provisions of paragraphs (c)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
USP is a payor that makes an interest payment that is not a withholdable payment (as defined in paragraph (f)(15) of this section) to RM2, a U.S. payor and reporting Model 2 FFI. The payment is paid and received outside of the United States and is not an amount subject to withholding under chapter 3. RM2 receives the payment as an intermediary with respect to a preexisting account held by A. RM2 has account information with respect to A which includes U.S. indicia as described in § 1.1441-7(b)(5) or (8). A does not provide consent for RM2 to report A's account. Under the presumption rules described in § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(i), RM2 is required to treat A as a U.S. non-exempt recipient. Despite this presumption rule, and because backup withholding does not apply under § 31.3406(g)-1(e), no information return shall be required with respect to the payment under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section if A is reported by RM2 consistent with § 1.1471-4(d)(6) as a non-consenting account holder. Additionally, RM2 may include A in the chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees on the withholding statement provided to USP consistent with the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section.
(d)
Special rules
—(1)
Aggregation of payments.
For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, until such time as the Commissioner determines that it is feasible to require aggregation of payments on two or more accounts, insurance contracts, or investment certificates, and, until this section is amended accordingly to provide for reporting on an aggregate basis, the requirement for filing Form 1099 under this section will be met if a person making payments of interest subject to reporting files a separate Form 1099 with respect to each account, insurance contract, or investment certificate. In the case of obligations described in section 6049(b)(1)(A), separate Forms 1099 may be filed as provided in the preceding sentence with respect to holdings in different issues.
(2)
Treatment of original issue discount.
The amount of original issue discount subject to reporting under section 6049 shall be the amount of original issue discount includible in the gross income of any holder that is treated as paid under § 1.6049-5(f).
(3)
Conversion into United States dollars of amounts paid in foreign currency
—(i)
Conversion rules.
When a payment is made in foreign currency, the U.S. dollar amount of the payment shall be determined by converting such foreign currency into U.S. dollars on the date of payment at the spot rate (as defined in § 1.988-1(d)(1)) or pursuant to a reasonable spot rate convention. For example, a withholding agent may use a month-end spot rate or a monthly average spot rate. A spot rate convention must be used consistently with respect to all non-dollar amounts withheld and from year to year. Such convention cannot be changed without the consent of the Commissioner or the Commissioner's delegate.
(ii)
Special rule for § 1.988-5(a) transactions where the payor on both components of a qualified hedging transaction is the same person
—(A)
In general.
Interest or original issue discount on a qualified debt instrument that is part of a qualified hedging transaction under § 1.988-5(a) shall be computed for section 6049 reporting purposes under the rules described in § 1.988-5(a)(9)(ii) if—
(
1
) The payor on the qualified debt instrument and the counterparty to the § 1.988-5(a) hedge are the same person; and
(
2
) The payee complies with the requirements of § 1.988-5(a) and so notifies its payor prior to the date required for filing Form 1099 as required by this section.
(B)
Effective date.
The provisions of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) apply to transactions entered into after December 31, 2000.
(4)
Determination of person to whom interest or original issue discount is paid or for whom it is received.
Section 1.6049-1(a)(3) and (4) shall apply with respect to payments of interest and original issue discount after December 31, 1982.
(5)
Payments by governmental units.
In the case of payments made by any governmental unit or any agency or instrumentality thereof, the officer or employee having control of the payment of interest or original issue discount (or the person appropriately designated for purposes of this section) shall make the returns and statements required under section 6049.
(6)
When payment deemed made
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this section, for purposes of section 6049, interest is deemed to have been paid when it is credited or set apart to a person without any substantial limitation or restriction as to
the time or manner of payment or condition upon which payment is to be made, and is made available to him so that it may be drawn at any time, and its receipt brought within his own control and disposition.
(ii)
Instruments paid on presentment or demand.
In the case of a payment made on an obligation described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section (relating to transactional reporting), interest is deemed to have been paid at the time the obligation is presented for payment. For example, interest represented by a coupon detached from a bond is considered paid for purposes of section 6049 when the coupon is presented for payment.
(7)
Magnetic media requirement.
For rules relating to permission to submit the information required by Form 1099 on magnetic tape or other media, see § 1.9101-1. For the requirement to submit the information required by Form 1099 on magnetic media for payments after December 31, 1983, see section 6011(e) and § 301.6011-2 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
(8)
Obligations that are not exempt from taxation.
When an issuer of an obligation that is not exempt from taxation receives an envelope or “shell”, signed by the payee, stating that interest on the obligation is exempt from taxation under section 103(a) (as described in § 1.6049-5(b)(2), the issuer shall make an information return under section 6049. The information return shall show the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person who signed the statement claiming that interest on the obligation is exempt from taxation, the amount of interest paid, and such other information as is required by the form. An information return is required regardless of the amount of interest. The issuer shall also furnish a written statement to such person showing the information required by § 1.6049-6(b).
(9)
Savings bonds
—(i)
In general.
A person who makes payment on a United States savings bond when the bond is presented for payment shall report the difference between the amount to be paid and the amount paid for the bond. The amount subject to reporting shall not be reduced to take into account:
(A) Amounts previously included in the income of a holder as a result of an election under section 454 to include annually the increase in the redemption price of the bond; or
(B) Amounts accrued prior to transfer of the bond where the bond has been reissued in the name of the person presenting the bond for payment.
With respect to a savings bond that is reissued in another person's name, the amount subject to reporting when the bond is reissued is the amount of interest that has accrued. With respect to a savings bond that is exchanged in a tax-deferred transaction (as described in section 1037), the amount subject to reporting is the amount of cash paid to the holder at the time of the transaction.
(ii)
Examples.
The application of the provisions of paragraph (d)(9)(i) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On June 10, 1943, A purchases a $50 Series E savings bond. The amount paid for the savings bond is $37.50. A elects under section 454 to include the increase in the redemption price of the bond annually in income. A presents the bond to Bank M to be cashed on July 1, 1983. The amount to be paid on the bond on that date is $204.96. Bank M is required to make an information return under section 6049 showing that it paid $167.46 (the difference between $204.96 and $37.50) of interest, without regard to A's election to include annually the increase in the redemption price of the bond.

# Example 2.
On December 1, 1970, B purchases a $500 Series E savings bond. The amount paid for the bond is $375. On August 1, 1984, the bond is reissued by the Bureau of Public Debt by deleting B's name and inserting the name of B's child. At the time of reissue, the redemption value of the bond is $1,015.80. The accrued interest is $640.80 (the difference between $1,015.80 and $375). The reissue is a taxable transaction, and B must include in income the accrued interest at the time of reissue. The Bureau of Public Debt is required to make an information return under section 6049 showing that it paid $640.80 of interest to B.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2) except that B exchanges the bond for a Series HH savings bond in the amount of $1,000 issued in B's name. The exchange is tax-deferred under section 1037. The Bureau of Public Debt stamps a legend on the bond stating that interest of $625 has been deferred. The amount of $15.80 is paid to B. The Bureau of the Public Debt must make an
informatiion return showing that it paid $15.80 of interest to B.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in example (3) except that the exchange is not a tax-deferred exchange. The Bureau of the Public Debt must make an information return showing that it paid $640.80 of interest to B.
(e)
Transactional reporting
—(1)
In general.
An information return required to be made under paragraph (b) of this section may be made on a transaction-by-transaction basis, rather than on an annual aggregation basis, if payment described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section is made by a person described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(2)
Payments subject to transactional reporting.
An information return may be made on a transactional basis if payment is made on:
(i) A United States savings bond,
(ii) An interest coupon (but see § 1.6049-5(b) which provides that no information return is required to be made with respect to an interest coupon that is exempt from taxation),
(iii) A discount obligation having a maturity at issue of 1 year or less, including commercial paper and short-term government obligations defined in section 1232(a)(3), and
(iv) Any obligation similar to those described in subdivisions (i) through (iii).
The information return with respect to payments on the types of obligations described in this paragraph shall be made on Form 1099-INT. A payor may include all interest paid in one transaction on one information return, irrespective of whether obligations of different issuers are paid as part of the transaction.
(3)
Persons subject to transactional reporting.
A person may make a return on a transactional basis if the person is:
(i) A middleman (as defined in paragraph (f)(4) of this section) who is required to make an information return under paragraph (b)(3) of this section with respect to any payment described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, or
(ii) A Federal agency making payments on a United States savings bond.
(4)
Transaction defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), a transaction means a payment at one time on one or more obligations. For example, if an individual who is exempt from withholding under section 3406 presents at one time five Series EE bonds on each of which $3 of interest has accrued, $15 of interest will be paid as part of the transaction. Accordingly, an information return is required under § 1.6049-4 (a)(2)(iii) because the interest paid in the transaction exceeds $10. If only three of the savings bonds were presented, however, no return would be required even if the remaining two bonds were redeemed the following day. See paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for the requirement that an information return be made if any amount of tax is withheld under section 3406.
(5)
Information required.
The information return for any transaction under paragraph (e) of this section shall show the following:
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person to whom the interest is paid;
(ii) The name and address of the person filing the form;
(iii) The amount of interest paid;
(iv) The amount of tax withheld under section 3406, if any; and
(v) Such other information as is required by the form.
(f)
Definitions.
For purposes of section 6049, this section, and §§ 1.6049-5 and 1.6049-6:
(1)
Person.
The term
person
includes any governmental unit, international organization, and any agency or instrumentality thereof. Therefore, interest paid by one of these entities must be reported unless one of the exceptions under section 6049 applies.
(2)
Natural person.
The term
natural person
means any individual, but shall not include a partnership (whether of not composed entirely of individuals), a trust, or an estate.
(3)
Obligation.
The term
obligation
includes bonds, debentures, notes, certificates, and other evidences of indebtedness regardless of how denominated. For the definition of the term
offshore obligation,

(4)
Middleman
—(i)
In general.
The term
middleman

6045(c), or a nominee, who makes payment of interest for, or collects interest on behalf of, another person, or otherwise acts in a capacity as intermediary between a payor and a payee. For example, a person (other than an issuer of an obligation) who makes payment on an interest coupon of the obligation to another person is a middleman, irrespective of whether such person purchases the coupon for his own account, accepts the coupon as agent for the payee, or otherwise deals with the coupon. The term “middleman” also includes a trustee, including a corporate trustee of a trust where the trust is the payee. See § 1.6049-4(c)(2) providing that the trustee does not have to make an information return on Form 1099 to a beneficiary if the trustee is required to file Form 1041 and furnishes Form K-1 to the beneficiary showing the information required to be shown on the form, including amounts withheld under section 3406. A person shall be considered to be a middleman as to any portion of an interest payment made to such person which portion is actually owned by another person, whether or not the other person's name is also shown on the information return filed with respect to such interest payment, except that a husband or wife will not be considered as acting in the capacity of a middleman with respect to his or her spouse. A person who, from within the United States, forwards an interest coupon or discount obligation on behalf of a payee for presentation, collection or payment outside the United States is also a middleman for purposes of this section (but the transfer, although subject to information reporting under this section, does not make the payment subject to backup withholding under section 3406).
(ii)
Example.
The application of the provisions of paragraph (f)(4) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
In January 1984, Broker B, a U.S. payor, purchases on behalf of its customer, Individual A, an obligation issued by partnership in a public offering on that date. Broker B holds the obligation for A throughout 1984. Broker B is required to make an information return showing the amount of original issue discount treated as paid to A under § 1.6049-5(f).

(A) An amount is described in this paragraph (f)(16)(ii)(A) if it is paid by an issuer or the paying agent of the issuer with respect to an obligation that is—
(
1
) Issued by a U.S. payor, as defined in § 1.6049-5(c)(5);
(
2

In the case of an amount paid by a bank or other financial institution with respect to a deposit or an account that is considered paid at a branch or office outside the United States as described in § 1.6049-5(e)(2), the amount is not considered paid and received outside the United States if the institution has knowledge that the customer has transmitted instructions to an agent, branch, or office of the institution from inside the United States by mail, telephone, electronic transmission, or otherwise concerning the deposit or account (unless the transmission from the United States has taken place in isolated and infrequent circumstances).
(iv)
Examples.
The application of the provisions of paragraph (f)(16) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
FC is a foreign corporation that is not a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, as defined in § 1.6049-5(c)(5). A holds FC coupon bonds that are not in registered form under section 163(f) and the regulations . FB, a foreign branch of DC, a domestic corporation, is the designated paying agent with respect to the bonds issued by FC. A does not have an account with FB. A presents a coupon to FB at its office outside the United States with instructions to transfer funds to a bank account maintained by A in the United States. FB transfers the funds in accordance with A's instructions. Even though the amount is credited to an account in the United States, the interest on the FC bonds is paid and received outside the United States under paragraph (f)(16)(ii) of this section and § 1.6049-5(e)(3) because the coupon is presented for payment outside the United States; because FC is a foreign person that is not a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, as defined in § 1.6049-5(d)(1); because FB is not acting as A's agent; and because the obligation is not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a), listed on a securities exchange that is registered as a national securities exchange in the United States, or included in an interdealer quotation system.

# Example 2.
FC is a foreign corporation that is not a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, as defined in § 1.6049-5(d)(1). B, a United States citizen, holds a bond issued by FC in registered form under section 163(f) and the regulations thereunder and registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a). The bond is not a foreign-targeted registered obligation as defined in § 1.871-14(e)(2). DB, a United States branch of a foreign corporation engaged in the commercial banking business, is the registrar of the bonds issued by FC. DB supplies FC with a list of the holders of the FC bonds. Interest on the FC bonds is paid to B and other bondholders by checks prepared by FC at its principal office outside the United States, and B's check is mailed from there to his designated address in the United States. The bond is described in paragraph (f)(16)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section. The interest on the FC bonds paid to B by FC is not paid and received outside the United States under paragraph (f)(16) of this section.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
except that the checks are prepared and mailed in the United States by DC, a U.S. corporation engaged in the commercial banking business that is the designated paying agent with respect to the bonds issued by FC, and B's check is mailed to his designated address outside the United States. For purposes of section 6049, the interest on the FC bonds paid by DC is not paid and received outside the United States under paragraph (f)(16)(i) of this section.
(g)
Time and place for filling a return for the payment of interest
—(1)
Annual return.
Except as provided in paragraph
(g)(2) of this section, the returns required under this section for any calendar year for the payment of interest shall be filed after September 30 of such year, but not before the payor's final payment to the payee for the year, and on or before February 28 (March 31 if filed electronically) of the following year. Such returns shall be filed with the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Center, the address of which is listed in the instructions for Form 1096. For extensions of time for filing returns under this section, see § 1.6081-1.

The return shall be filed with the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Center, the address of which is listed in the instructions for Form 1096. For extensions of time for filing returns under this section, see § 1.6081-1.
(3)
Cross-reference to penalty.
For provisions relating to the penalty provided for failure to file timely a correct information return required under section 6049(a) and § 1.6049-4(a)(1), see § 301.6721-1 of this chapter (Procedure and Administration Regulations). See § 301.6724-1 of this chapter for the waiver of a penalty if the failure is due to reasonable cause and is not due to willful neglect.
(h)
Effective/applicability dates.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) and (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, this section applies to payments made on or after January 6, 2017.

§ 1.6049-5
Interest and original issue discount subject to reporting after December 31, 1982.
(a)
Interest subject to reporting requirement.
For purposes of §§ 1.6049-4, 1.6049-6 and this section, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the term “interest” means:
(1) Interest on an obligation:
(i) In registered form (as defined in § 5f.103-1(c)), or
(ii) Of a type offered to the public. Principles consistent with § 5f.163-1 shall be applied to determine whether an obligation is of a type offered to the public.
(2) Interest on deposits with persons carrying on the banking business. Such term shall include deposits evidenced by time certificates of deposit issued in any amount whether negotiable or non-negotiable. The term “interest” includes payments to a mortgage escrow account and amounts paid with respect to repurchase agreements and banker's acceptances. Property which the payee receives from the payor as interest (or in lieu of a cash payment of interest) shall be interest for purposes of section 6049. The amount subject to reporting is the fair market value of such property.
(3) Amounts, whether or not designated as interest, paid or credited by mutual savings banks, savings and loan associations, building and loan associations, cooperative banks, homestead associations, credit unions, industrial loan associations or banks, or similar organizations, in respect of deposits, face amount certificates, investment certificates, or withdrawable or repurchasable shares. Thus, even though amounts paid or credited by such organizations with respect to deposits are designated as “dividends”, such amounts are included in the definition of interest for purposes of section 6049. The term “interest” includes payments to a mortgage escrow account and amounts paid with respect to repurchase agreements. Property which the payee receives from the payor as interest (or in lieu of a cash payment of interest) is “interest” for purposes of section 6049. The fair market value of such property is the amount subject ot reporting.
(4) Interest on amounts held by insurance companies under an agreement to pay interest thereon. Any increment in value of “advance premiums”, “prepaid premiums”, or “premium deposit funds” which is applied to the payment of premiums due on insurance policies, or made available for withdrawal by the policyholder, shall be considered interest subject to reporting. Interest that an insurance company pays pursuant to an agreement with the policyholder to a beneficiary because he payment due has been delayed is interest subject to reporting. Interest subject to reporting also includes interest paid by insurance companies with respect to policy “dividend” accumulations (see sections 61 and 451 and the regulations thereunder for rules as to when such interest is considered paid), and interest paid with respect to the proceeds of insurance policies left with the insurer. The so-called “interest element” in the case of annuity or installment payments under life insurance or endowment contracts does not constitute interest for purposes of section 6049.
(5) Interest on deposits with brokers as defined in section 6045(c) and the regulations thereunder. Any payment made in lieu of interest to a person whose obligation has been borrowed in connection with a short sale or other similar transaction is subject to reporting under section 6049. See § 1.6045-2T for reporting requirements with respect to payments in lieu of tax-exempt interest. See § 1.6045-2 for reporting requirements with respect to payments in lieu of tax-exempt interest.
(6) Interest paid on amounts held by investment companies as defined in section 3 of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. section 80-a) and on amounts paid on pooled funds or trusts. The interest to be reported with respect to a widely held fixed investment trust, as defined in § 1.671-5(b)(22), shall be the interest earned on the assets held by the trust. See § 1.671-5 for the reporting rules for widely held fixed investment trusts (as defined under that section).
(b)
Interest excluded from reporting requirement.
The term
interest
or
original issue discount
(OID) does not include—
(1) Interest on any obligation issued by a natural person as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(2), irrespective of whether such interest is collected on behalf of the holder of the obligation by a middleman.
(2) Interest on any obligation if such interest is exempt from taxation under section 103(a), relating to certain governmental obligations, or interest which is exempt from taxation under any other provision of law without regard to the identity of the holder. The holder of a tax exempt obligation that is not in registered form must provide written certification to the payor (other than the issuer of the obligation) that the obligation is exempt from taxation. A statement that interest coupons are tax exempt on the envelope or shell commonly used by financial institutions to process such coupons, signed by the payee, will be sufficient for this purpose if the envelope is properly completed (i.e., shows the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the payee). A payor may rely on such written certification in treating such interest as tax exempt for purposes of section 6049. See § 1.6049-4(d)(8) with respect to the requirement that the issuer of a taxable obligation shall make an information return if such issuer receives an envelope which improperly claims that the interest coupons contained therein are tax exempt.
(3) Interest on amounts held in escrow to guarantee performance on a contract or to provide security. However, interest on amounts held in escrow with a person described in paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section is interest subject to reporting under section 6049.
(4) Interest that a governmental unit pays with respect to tax refunds.
(5) Interest on deposits for security, such as deposits posted with a public utility company. However, interest on deposits posted for security with a person described in paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section is interest subject to reporting under section 6049.
(6) Amounts from sources outside the United States (determined under the provisions of part I, subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and the regulations under those provisions) paid by a non-U.S. payor or a non-U.S. middleman (as defined in
paragraph (c)(5) of this section) and paid and received outside the United States. See § 1.6049-4(f)(16) for circumstances in which a payment is considered to be paid and received outside the United States.
(7) Portfolio interest, as defined in § 1.871-14(b)(1), paid with respect to obligations in bearer form described in section 871(h)(2)(A), as in effect prior to the amendment by section 502 of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act of 2010 (HIRE Act), Public Law 111-147, or section 881(c)(2)(A), as in effect prior to the amendment by section 502 of the HIRE Act, that were issued prior to March 19, 2012, or with respect to a foreign-targeted registered obligation described in § 1.871-14(e)(2) that was issued prior to January 1, 2016, and for which the documentation requirements described in § 1.871-14(e)(3) and (4) have been satisfied (other than by a U.S. middleman (as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section) that, as a custodian or nominee of the payee, collects the amount for, or on behalf of, the payee, regardless of whether the middleman is also acting as agent of the payor).
(8) Portfolio interest described in § 1.871-14(c)(1)(ii), paid with respect to obligations in registered form described in section 871(h)(2) or 881(c)(2) that is not described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
(9) Any amount paid by an international organization described in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii)(G) (or its paying, transfer, or other agent that is not also a payee's agent) with respect to an obligation of which the international organization is the issuer.
(10)(i) Amounts paid and received outside the United States under § 1.6049-4(f)(16) (other than by a U.S. middleman (as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section) that are paid by a custodian or nominee or other agent of the payee, of amounts that that it receives for, or on behalf of, the payee, regardless of whether the middleman is also acting as agent of the payor) with respect to an obligation that: Has a face amount or principal amount of not less than $500,000 (as determined based on the spot rate on the date of issuance if in foreign currency); has a maturity (at issue) of 183 days or less; satisfies the requirements of sections 163(f)(2)(B)(i) and (ii)(I), as in effect prior to the amendment by section 502 of the HIRE Act, and the regulations thereunder (as if the obligation would otherwise be a registration-required obligation within the meaning of section 163(f)(2)(A)) (however, an original issue discount obligation with a maturity of 183 days or less from the date of issuance is not required to satisfy the certification requirement of § 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(
3
)) and is issued in accordance with the procedures of § 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D); and has on its face the following statement (or a similar statement having the same effect):
By accepting this obligation, the holder represents and warrants that it is not a United States person (other than an exempt recipient described in section 6049(b)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder) and that it is not acting for or on behalf of a United States person (other than an exempt recipient described in section 6049(b)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder).
(ii) If the obligation is in registered form, it must be registered in the name of an exempt recipient described in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(10), a middleman may treat an obligation as described in section 163(f)(2)(B)(i) and (f)(2)(B)(ii)(I), as in effect prior to the amendment by section 502 of the HIRE Act, and the regulations under that section if the obligation, or coupons detached therefrom, whichever is presented for payment, contains the statement described in this paragraph (b)(10). The exemption from reporting described in this paragraph (b)(10) shall not apply if the payor has actual knowledge that the payee is a U.S. person who is not an exempt recipient.
(11) Amounts paid with respect to an account or deposit with a U.S. or foreign branch of a domestic or foreign corporation or partnership that is paid with respect to an obligation described in either paragraph (b)(11)(i) or (ii) of this section, if the branch is engaged in the commercial banking business; and the interest or OID is paid and received outside the United States as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(16) (other than by a U.S. middleman (as defined in paragraph
(c)(5) of this section) that acts as a custodian, nominee, or other agent of the payee, and collects the amount for, or on behalf of, the payee, regardless of whether the middleman is also acting as agent of the payor). The exemption from reporting described in this paragraph (b)(11) shall not apply if the payor has actual knowledge that the payee is a U.S. person who is not an exempt recipient.
(i) An obligation is described in this paragraph (b)(11)(i) if it is not in registered form (within the meaning of section 163(f) and the regulations under that section), is described in section 163(f)(2)(B), as in effect prior to the amendment by section 502 of the HIRE Act, and issued in accordance with the procedures of § 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(C) or (D), and, in the case of a U.S. branch, is part of a larger single public offering of securities. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(11)(i), a middleman may treat an obligation as described in section 163(f)(2)(B), as in effect prior to the amendment by section 502 of the HIRE Act, if the obligation, and any detachable coupons, contains the statement described in section 163(f)(2)(B)(ii)(II), as in effect prior to the amendment by section 502 of the HIRE Act, and the regulations under that section.
(ii)(A) An obligation is described in this paragraph (b)(11)(ii) if it produces income described in section 871(i)(2)(A); has a face amount or principal amount of not less than $500,000 (as determined based on the spot rate on the date of issuance if in foreign currency); satisfies the requirements of sections 163(f)(2)(B)(i) and (ii)(I), as in effect prior to the amendment by section 502 of the HIRE Act, and the regulations thereunder (as if the obligation would otherwise be a registration-required obligation within the meaning of section 163(f)(2)(A)) and is issued in accordance with the procedures of § 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(C) or (D) (however, an original issue discount obligation with a maturity of 183 days or less from the date of issuance is not required to satisfy the certification requirement of § 1.163-5(c)(2)(i)(D)(
3
)). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(11)(ii), a middleman may treat an obligation as described in sections 163(f)(2)(B)(i) and (ii), as in effect prior to the amendment by section 502 of the HIRE Act, and the regulations under that section if the obligation, or any detachable coupon, contains the statement described in paragraph (b)(11)(ii)(B) of this section.
(B) The obligation must have on its face, and on any detachable coupons, the following statement (or a similar statement having the same effect):
By accepting this obligation, the holder represents and warrants that it is not a United States person (other than an exempt recipient described in section 6049(b)(4) and regulations under that section) and that it is not acting for or on behalf of a United States person (other than an exempt recipient described in section 6049(b)(4) and the regulations under that section).
(C) If the obligation is in registered form, it must be registered in the name of an exempt recipient described in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii).
(12) Payments that a payor can, prior to payment, reliably associate with documentation upon which it may rely to treat the payment as made to a foreign beneficial owner in accordance with § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii) or as made to a foreign payee in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section or presumed to be made to a foreign payee under paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section. However, such payments may be reportable under § 1.1461-1(b) and (c) or under § 1.1474-1(d)(2) (for a chapter 4 reportable amount (as described in § 1.1471-1(b)(18)). The provisions of § 1.1441-1 shall apply by substituting the term “payor” for the term “withholding agent” and without regard to the fact that the provisions apply only to amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of § 1.1441-1 and paragraph (d) of this section in determining the foreign status of the payee, the provisions of § 1.1441-1 shall govern for payments of amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section shall govern in other cases. This paragraph (b)(12) does not apply to interest paid on or after January 1, 2013, to a nonresident alien individual to the extent provided in § 1.6049-8.
(13) Amounts for the period that the debt obligation with respect to which the interest arises represents an asset
blocked as described in § 1.1441-2(e)(3). Payment of such amounts, including interest that is past due and OID on obligations that mature on or before the date that the assets are no longer blocked, is deemed to occur in accordance with the rules of § 1.1441-2(e)(3).
(14) Payments that a payor or middleman can, prior to payment, reliably associate with documentation upon which it may rely to treat as made to a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity in accordance with § 1.1441-1(b) if it obtains from the foreign intermediary or flow-through entity a withholding statement under § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(2) (describing an FFI withholding statement), § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(3) (describing a chapter 4 withholding statement), § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv) (describing a withholding statement provided by a non-qualified intermediary), § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(v) (describing a withholding statement provided by a qualified intermediary), or under § 1.1441-5 (describing a withholding statement provided by a foreign partnership, foreign simple trust, or foreign grantor trust), that allocates the payment (or portion of a payment) to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool or specific payees to which withholding applies under chapter 4. The provisions of each of the foregoing sections shall apply by substituting the term “payor” for the term “withholding agent.” A payor or middleman may rely on a withholding statement provided by a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity that identifies a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees (as described in § 1.6049-4(c)(4)) or, with respect to a withholdable payment, a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of recalcitrant account holders (as described in § 1.1471-4(d)(6)) provided that the payor or middleman identifies the foreign intermediary or flow-through entity that maintains the accounts (as described in § 1.1471-5(b)(5)) included in the chapter 4 withholding rate pool as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI) by applying the rules in § 1.1471-3(d)(4) or in § 1.1471-3(e)(4)(vi)(B), as applicable, for identifying the payee of a payment (by substituting the term “payor” for the term “withholding agent”). See, however, § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(v)(C)(
2
)(
i
) for when a qualified intermediary may provide a single pool of recalcitrant account holders (without the need to subdivide into the pools described in § 1.1471-4(d)(6)). Additionally, when a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity provides to a payor or middleman a withholding statement that allocates the payment (or portion of a payment) to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees, the payor or middleman may also rely on the withholding statement if the payor or middleman identifies the intermediary or flow-through entity as a qualified intermediary (as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(15) by applying the rules described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii)) that provides the certification described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii)(D) with respect to U.S. payees that hold accounts with a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity other than the qualified intermediary providing the certification.
(15) If a foreign intermediary, as described in § 1.1441-1(c)(13), or a U.S. branch that is not treated as a U.S. person receives a payment from a payor, which payment the payor can reliably associate with a valid withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(ii) or (iii), or § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(v), respectively, furnished by such intermediary or branch, then the intermediary or branch is not required to report such payment when it, in turn, pays the amount, unless, and to the extent, the intermediary or branch knows that the payment is required to be reported under this section and was not so reported. For example, if a U.S. branch described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) fails to provide information regarding U.S. persons that are not exempt from reporting under § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) to the person from whom the U.S. branch receives the payment, the amount paid by the U.S. branch to such person is interest or original issue discount. See, however, § 1.6049-4(c)(4) for when reporting under section 6049 is coordinated with reporting under chapter 4 or an applicable IGA (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(7)). The exception for payments described in this paragraph (b)(15) shall not apply to a qualified intermediary that assumes reporting
responsibility under chapter 61 of the Code for the payment under the agreement described in § 1.1441-1(e)(5)(iii).
(16) Amounts of interest as determined under the provisions of § 1.446-3(g)(4) (dealing with interest in the case of a significant non-periodic payment with respect to a notional principal contract). Such amounts are governed by the provisions of section 6041. See § 1.6041-1(d)(5).
(c)
Applicable rules
—(1)
Documentary evidence for offshore obligations and certain other obligations
—(i) A payor may rely on documentary evidence described in § 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i) instead of a beneficial owner withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i) in the case of an amount paid outside the United States (as described in paragraph (e) of this section) with respect to an offshore obligation, or, in the case of broker proceeds described in § 1.6045-1(c)(2), to the extent provided in § 1.6045-1(g)(1)(i). For purposes of this section, the term
offshore obligation
means—
(A) An account maintained at an office or branch of a bank or other financial institution located outside the United States; or
(B) An obligation as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(3) (other than an account described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section), contract, or other instrument with respect to which the payor is either engaged in business as a broker or dealer in securities or a financial institution (as defined in § 1.1471-5(e)) that engages in significant activities at an office or branch located outside the United States. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an office or branch of such payor shall be considered to engage in significant activities with respect to an obligation when it participates materially and actively in negotiating the obligation under the principles described in § 1.864-4(c)(5)(iii) (substituting the term “obligation” for the term “stock or security”).
(ii) A payor may rely on documentary evidence if the payor has established procedures to obtain, review, and maintain documentary evidence sufficient to establish the identity of the payee and the status of that person as a foreign person; and the payor obtains, reviews, and maintains such documentary evidence in accordance with those procedures. A payor maintains the documents reviewed for purposes of this paragraph (c)(1) by retaining an original, certified copy, or photocopy (including a microfiche, electronic scan, or similar means of electronic storage) of the documents reviewed for as long as it may be relevant to the determination of the payor's obligation to report under § 1.6049-4 and this section and noting in its records the date on which the document was received and reviewed. Documentary evidence furnished for a payment of an amount subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code or that is a chapter 4 reportable amount under § 1.1474-1(d)(2) must contain all of the information that is necessary to complete a Form 1042-S for that payment. See §§ 1.1471-3(c) and 1.1471-4(c) for additional documentation requirements to identify a payee or account holder for chapter 4 purposes that may apply in addition to the requirements under paragraph (c) of this section.
(iii) Even if an account or obligation (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(3)) is not maintained outside the United States (maintained in the United States), a payor may rely on documentary evidence associated with a withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iii) with respect to the persons for whom an entity acting as an intermediary collects the payment. A payor may also rely on documentary evidence associated with a flow-through withholding certificate for payments treated as made to foreign partners of a nonwithholding foreign partnership, as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(28), the foreign beneficiaries of a foreign simple trust, as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(24), or foreign owners of a foreign grantor trust, as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(26), even though the partnership or trust account is an obligation maintained in the United States.
(iv) For accounts opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, and for obligations entered into on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, a payor may continue to apply the rules of § 1.6049-5(c)(1) and (c)(4) as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2013, rather than this
paragraph (c)(1) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section. A payor that applies the rules of § 1.6049-5(c)(1) and (c)(4) as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 2013, to an account or obligation must also apply § 1.1441-6(c)(2) (to the extent applicable) and § 1.6049-5(e) both as in effect and contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April, 2013, with respect to the account or obligation.
(2)
Other applicable rules.
The provisions of § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(i) through (xii) (regarding who may sign a certificate, validity period of certificates and documentary evidence, retention of certificates, reliance rules, etc.) shall apply (by substituting the term “payor” for the term “withholding agent” and disregarding the fact that the provisions under § 1.1441-1(e)(4) only apply to amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code) to withholding certificates and documentary evidence furnished for purposes of this section. See § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii) for provisions dealing with reliable association of a payment with documentation.
(3)
Standards of knowledge.
A payor may not rely on a withholding certificate or documentary evidence described in paragraph (c)(1) or (4) of this section if it has actual knowledge or reason to know that any information or certification stated in the certificate or documentary evidence is unreliable. A payor has reason to know that information or certifications are unreliable only if the payor would have reason to know under the provisions of § 1.1441-7(b)(2) and (3) that the information and certifications provided on the certificate or in the documentary evidence are unreliable or, in the case of a Form W-9 (or an acceptable substitute), it cannot reasonably rely on the documentation as set forth in § 31.3406(h)-3(e) of this chapter (see the information and certification described in § 31.3406(h)-3(e)(2)(i) through (iv) of this chapter that are required in order for a payor reasonably to rely on a Form W-9). The provisions of § 1.1441-7(b)(2) and (3) shall apply for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3) irrespective of the type of income to which § 1.1441-7(b)(2) is otherwise limited. The exemptions from reporting described in paragraphs (b)(10) and (11) of this section shall not apply if the payor has actual knowledge that the payee is a U.S. person who is not an exempt recipient.
(4)
Special documentation rules for certain payments.
This paragraph (c)(4) modifies the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section for payments of amounts that are not subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code, other than amounts described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section (dealing with U.S. short-term OID and U.S. source deposit interest described in section 871(i)(2)(A) or 881(d)(3)). Amounts are not subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code if they are not included in the definition of amounts subject to withholding under § 1.1441-2(a) (
e.g.,
deposit interest with foreign branches of U.S. banks, foreign source income, or broker proceeds). A payor may rely upon documentation in lieu of documentary evidence (as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) or a written statement (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(150)) or another statement to the extent permitted in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, until the payor knows or has reason to know of a change in circumstance that makes the documentation unreliable or incorrect (as defined in § 1.1441-1(e)) when the payor does not have customer information for the payee that includes any of the U.S. indicia described in § 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(C)(
1
). Further, a payor may maintain such documentation or documentary evidence as required in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section.
(i)
Statement in lieu of documentary evidence with respect to accounts.
If under the local laws, regulations, or practices of a country in which an account is maintained, it is not customary to obtain documentary evidence described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to the type of account, the payor may, instead of obtaining a beneficial owner withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i) or documentary evidence described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, establish a payee's foreign status based on the statement described in this paragraph (c)(4)(i) (or such substitute statement as the Internal Revenue Service may prescribe) made on an account opening form. However, see, also
§ 1.1471-4(c) or an applicable IGA for additional documentation requirements that may apply to a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) for determining the status of its account holders for chapter 4 purposes. The statement referred to in this paragraph (c)(4)(i) must appear near the signature line and must state, “By opening this account and signing below, the account owner represents and warrants that he/she/it is not a U.S. person for purposes of U.S. Federal income tax and that he/she/it is not acting for, or on behalf of, a U.S. person. A false statement or misrepresentation of tax status by a U.S. person could lead to penalties under U.S. law. If your tax status changes and you become a U.S. citizen or a resident, you must notify us within 30 days.” Additionally, a payor may, instead of obtaining a beneficial owner withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(2)(i) or § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(ii) or documentary evidence described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, establish a payee's foreign status based on a written statement described in paragraph § 1.1471-1(b)(150) to the extent a payor uses such written statement to establish a payee's chapter 4 status and is permitted to use the written statement under § 1.1471-3(d) (by substituting the term “payor” for the term “withholding agent”) without any other documentary evidence.
(ii)
Documentation under IGA.
A payor that is a reporting Model 1 FFI or reporting Model 2 FFI may rely upon documentation or information establishing a payee's status that is permitted under an applicable IGA for determining whether the account of the payee is other than a U.S. account and regardless of whether such documentation or certification is described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or § 1.1441-1(e)(2).
(iii)
Maintenance of documentation and written statement.
A payor maintains documentation if it either maintains the documentary evidence as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section or retains a record of the documentary evidence reviewed if the payor is not required to retain copies of the documentation pursuant to the payor's AML due diligence (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(4)). A payor retains a record of documentary evidence reviewed by noting in its records the type of documentation reviewed, the date the document was reviewed, the document's identification number (if any), and whether such documentation contained any U.S. indicia described in § 1.1441-7(b)(8). Any statement described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, must be retained in accordance with § 1.1471-3(c)(6)(iii).
(5)
U.S. payor, U.S. middleman, non-U.S. payor, and non-U.S. middleman.
The terms
payor
and
middleman
have the meanings ascribed to them under § 1.6049-4(a). A
non-U.S. payor
or
non-U.S. middleman
means a payor or middleman other than a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman. The term
U.S. payor
or
U.S. middleman
means—
(i)
Definition.
(A) A person described in section 7701(a)(30) (including a foreign branch or office of such person);
(B) The government of the United States or the government of any State or political subdivision thereof (or any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing);
(C) A controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957, determined without applying section 318(a)(3)(A), (B), and (C) so as to consider a United States person as owning stock which is owned by a person who is not a United States person.
(D) A foreign partnership, if at any time during its tax year, one or more of its partners are U.S. persons (as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(2)) who, in the aggregate hold more than 50 percent of the income or capital interest in the partnership or if, at any time during its tax year, it is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States;
(E) A foreign person 50 percent or more of the gross income of which, from all sources for the three-year period ending with the close of its taxable year preceding the collection or payment (or such part of such period as the person has been in existence), was effectively connected with the conduct of trade or business within the United States; or
(F) A U.S. branch or territory financial institution described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) that is treated as a U.S. person.
(ii)
Reporting by U.S. payors in U.S. possessions.
U.S. payors are not required to report on Form 1099 income that is from sources within a possession of the United States and that is exempt from taxation under section 931, 932, or 933, each of which sections exempts certain income from sources within a possession of the United States paid to a bona fide resident of that possession. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(5)(ii), a U.S. payor may treat the beneficial owner as a bona fide resident of the possession of the United States from which the income is sourced if, prior to payment of the income, the U.S. payor can reliably associate the payment with valid documentation that supports the claim of residence in the possession of the United States from which the income is sourced. This paragraph (c)(5)(ii) shall not apply if the U.S. payor has actual knowledge or reason to know that the documentation is unreliable or incorrect or that the income does not satisfy the requirements for exemption under section 931, 932, or 933. For the rules determining whether income is from sources within a possession of the United States, see section 937(b) and the regulations thereunder.
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:

# Example 1.
FC is a foreign corporation that is not engaged in a trade or business in the United States during the current calendar year. D, an individual who is a resident and citizen of the United States, holds a registered obligation issued by FC in a public offering. Interest is paid on the obligation within the United States by DC, a U.S. corporation that is the designated paying agent of FC. D does not have an account with DC. Although interest paid on the obligation issued by FC is foreign source, the interest paid by DC to D is considered to be interest under paragraph (b)(6) of this section for purposes of information reporting under section 6049 because it is not paid and received outside the United States within the meaning of § 1.6049-4(f)(16).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that D is a nonresident alien individual who has furnished DC with a Form W-8 in accordance with the provisions of § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii). By reason of paragraph (b)(12) of this section, the payment of interest by DC to D is not considered to be a payment of interest for purposes of information reporting under section 6049. Therefore, DC is not required to make an information return under section 6049.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2
except that the obligation of FC is held in a custodial account for D by FB, a foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution. By reason of paragraph (c)(5) of this section, FB is considered to be a U.S. middleman. Therefore, FB is required to make an information return unless FB may treat D as a beneficial owner that is a foreign person in accordance with the provisions of § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii).

# Example 4.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3
except that the FC obligation is held for D by NC, in a custodial account at NC's foreign branch. NC is a foreign corporation that is a non-U.S. middleman described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The payment by NC to D is paid and received outside of the United States under § 1.6049-4(f)(16) and therefore is not considered to be a payment of interest for purposes of section 6049 pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Therefore, NC is not required to make an information return under section 6049 with respect to the payment.
(d)
Determination of status as U.S. or foreign payee and applicable presumptions in the absence of documentation
—(1)
Identifying the payee.
The provisions of §§ 1.1441-1(b)(2), 1.1441-5(c)(1) and (e)(2) and (3) shall apply (by substituting the term “payor” for the term “withholding agent”) to identify the payee (other than a payee included in a chapter 4 withholding rate pool described in paragraph (b)(14) of this section) for purposes of this section (and other sections of the regulations under this chapter to which this paragraph (d)(1) applies), except to the extent provided in this paragraph (d)(1) in the case of a payment of an amount that is not subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code and that is not a withholdable payment (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(15)). Amounts are not subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code if they are not included in the definition of amounts subject to withholding under § 1.1441-2(a) (
e.g.,
deposit interest with foreign branches of U.S. banks, foreign source income, or broker proceeds). The exceptions to the application of § 1.1441-1(b)(2) to amounts that are not subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code and that are not withholdable payments are as follows:
(i) The provisions of § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(ii), dealing with payments to a U.S. agent or intermediary of a foreign
person, shall not apply. Thus, a payment to a U.S. agent or intermediary of a foreign person is treated as a payment to a U.S. payee.
(ii) Payments to U.S. branches or territory financial institution described in § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) shall be treated as payments to a foreign payee, irrespective of the fact that the U.S. branch or territory financial institution is otherwise treated as a U.S. person for payments of amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 and withholdable payments, and irrespective of the fact that the branch or territory financial institution is treated as a U.S. payor for purposes of paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
(2)
Presumptions of U.S. or foreign status in the absence of documentation
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(2)(i), for purposes of this section (and other sections of regulations under this chapter 61 to which this paragraph (d)(2) applies), the provisions of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(i) through (ix) and § 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) shall apply (by substituting the term “payor” for the term “withholding agent”) to determine the classification (
e.g.,
individual, corporation, partnership, trust), status (
i.e.,
a U.S. or a foreign person), and other relevant characteristics (
e.g.,
beneficial owner or intermediary) of a payee if a payment cannot be reliably associated with valid documentation under § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii) irrespective of whether the payments are subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code or are withholdable payments. The provisions of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(D) and (vii)(B) (referencing presumption rules for payments with respect to offshore obligations) shall not apply to a payment of an amount not subject to withholding under chapter 3, unless it is an amount that is a withholdable payment made to a payee that is an entity. Thus, in the case of a withholdable payment made to an entity, the presumption rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(D) and (vii)(B) shall apply regardless of whether the payment is an amount subject to withholding under chapter 3. Additionally, in the case of an amount paid outside the United States with respect to an offshore obligation described in § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(D) or (vii)(B) of an amount not subject to withholding under chapter 3 and that is treated as made to a payee that is an individual, the presumption rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) shall not apply, and the payee shall be presumed a U.S. person only when the payee has any of the indicia of U.S. status that are described in § 1.1441-7(b)(5) or (8). In a case in which a withholding agent makes a withholdable payment that cannot reliably be associated with documentation, see § 1.1471-3(f)(4) and (5) for determining the status of the payee for chapter 4 purposes when the payment is treated as made to a foreign entity (by substituting the term “payor” for the term “withholding agent”). The rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii) shall apply for purposes of determining when a payment can reliably be associated with documentation, by substituting the term “payor” for the term “withholding agent.” For this purpose, the information, documentary evidence, statement, or other documentation described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section can be treated as documentation with which a payment can be associated.
(ii)
Grace period in the case of indicia of a foreign payee.
When the conditions of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) are satisfied, the 30-day grace period provisions under section 3406(e) shall not apply and the provisions of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) shall apply instead. A payor that, at any time during the grace period described in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), credits an account with payments described in § 1.1441-6(c)(2) (or credits an account with broker proceeds from securities described in § 1.1441-6(c)(2)), that are reportable under section 6042, 6045, 6049, or 6050N may, instead of treating the account as owned by a U.S. person and applying backup withholding under section 3406, if applicable, choose to treat the account as owned by a foreign person (and apply the grace period described in § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv)) if, at the beginning of the grace period, the address that the payor has in its records for the account holder is in a foreign country, the payor has been furnished the information contained in a withholding certificate described in § 1.1441-1(e)(2), or
the payor holds a withholding certificate that is no longer reliable other than because the validity period as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(A) has expired. In the case of a newly opened account, the grace period begins on the date that the payor first credits the account. In the case of an existing account for which the payor holds a Form W-8 or documentary evidence of foreign status, the payor may apply the provisions of the grace period described in § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iv), beginning on the date that the payor first credits the account after the existing documentation held with regard to the account can no longer be relied upon (other than because the validity period described in § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(A) has expired). A new account shall be treated as an existing account for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) if the account holder already holds an account at the branch location at which the new account is opened, or if the account is treated as a consolidated obligation as defined in § 1.1471-(1)(b)(23) for purpose of chapter 4 to the extent the account does not receive any amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3. A new account shall also be treated as an existing account for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) if an account is held at another branch location if the institution maintains an account information system described in § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(ix). The grace period terminates on the earlier of the close of the 90th day from the date on which the grace period begins or the date that valid documentation is provided. The grace period also terminates when the remaining balance in the account (due to withdrawals or otherwise) is equal to or less than 28 percent (or other statutory tax rate that is applicable to backup withholding) of the total amounts credited since the beginning of the grace period that would be subject to backup withholding if the provisions of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) did not apply. At the end of the grace period, the payor shall treat the amounts credited to the account, or paid with respect to an account, during the grace period as paid to a U.S. or foreign payee depending upon whether documentation has been furnished and the nature of any such documentation furnished upon which the payor may rely to treat the account as owned by a U.S. or foreign payee. If the documentation has not been received on or before the date of expiration of the grace period, the payor may also apply the presumptions described in this paragraph (d) to amounts credited to the account after the date on which the grace period expires (until such time as the payor can reliably associate the documentation with amounts credited). See § 31.6413(a)-3(a)(1)(iv) of this chapter for treating backup withheld amounts under section 3406 as erroneously withheld when the documentation establishing foreign status is furnished prior to the end of the calendar year in which backup withholding occurs. If the provisions of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii) apply, the provisions of § 31.3406(d)-3 of this chapter shall not apply. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), an account holder's reinvestment of gross proceeds of a sale into other instruments constitutes a withdrawal and a non-qualified electronic transmission of information on a withholding certificate is a transmission that is not in accordance with the provisions of § 1.1441-1(e)(4)(iv). See § 1.1092(d)-1 for a definition of the term actively traded for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii).
(iii)
Joint owners.
Amounts paid to accounts held jointly for which a certificate or documentation is required as a condition for being exempt from reporting under paragraph (b) of this section are presumed made to U.S. payees who are not exempt recipients if, prior to payment, the payor cannot reliably associate the payment either with a Form W-9 furnished by one of the joint owners in the manner required in §§ 31.3406(d)-1 through 31.3406(d)-5 of this chapter, or with documentation described in paragraph (b)(12) of this section furnished by each joint owner upon which it can rely to treat each joint owner as a foreign payee or foreign beneficial owner. In the case of an amount that is a withholdable payment made to a joint account, however, see § 1.1471-3(f)(7) for when the payment is treated as made to a foreign payee that is a nonparticipating FFI (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(82)). For purposes of applying this paragraph
(d)(2)(iii), the grace period described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section shall apply only if each payee qualifies for such grace period.
(3)
Payments to foreign intermediaries or flow-through entities
—(i)
Payments of amounts subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code or withholdable payments.
In the case of payments of amounts that the payor may treat as made to a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity in accordance with §§ 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(C) and (b)(3)(v)(A) and 1.1441-5(c) or (e) and that are subject to withholding under § 1.1441-2(a), the provisions of §§ 1.1441-1(b)(2)(v) and 1.1441-5(c)(1), (e)(2), and (3) shall apply (by substituting the term “payor” for the term “withholding agent”) to identify the payee. If a payment of an amount subject to withholding cannot be reliably associated with valid documentation from a payee in accordance with § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(vii), the presumption rules of §§ 1.1441-1(b)(3)(v) and 1.1441-5(d) and (e)(6) shall apply to determine the payee's status for purposes of this section (and other sections of regulations under this chapter to which this paragraph (d)(3) applies). In the case of an amount that is a withholdable payment, see § 1.1471-3(c)(3) for rules to identify the payee and see § 1.1471-3(f)(5) for the presumption rule that shall apply to amounts treated as made to a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity (by substituting the term “payor” for the term “withholding agent”). For example, where a withholdable payment is made to an intermediary under § 1.1471-3 that is treated as a nonparticipating FFI under § 1.1471-3(f)(5), the nonparticipating FFI shall be treated as the payee under § 1.1471-3(c)(3) and for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(i), therefore, no information return shall be required under this section.
(ii)
Payments of amounts not subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code and that are not withholdable payments.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, amounts that are not subject to withholding under chapter 3 of the Code and that are not withholdable payments that the payor may treat as paid to a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity shall be treated as made to an exempt recipient described in § 1.6049-4(c) except to the extent that the payor has actual knowledge that any person for whom the intermediary or flow-through entity is collecting the payment is a U.S. person who is not an exempt recipient. In the case of such actual knowledge, the payor shall treat the payment that it knows is allocable to such U.S. person as a payment to a U.S. payee who is not an exempt recipient and has actual knowledge of the amount allocable to such a person.
(iii)
Special rule for payments of certain short-term original issue discount
—(A)
General rule.
A payment of U.S. source bank deposit interest not subject to chapter 4 withholding or U.S. source interest or original issue discount on the redemption of an obligation with a maturity from the date of issue of 183 days or less (short-term OID) described in section 871(g)(1)(B) or 881(e) that the payor may treat as paid to a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity in accordance with the provisions of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(C), (b)(3)(v)(A), § 1.1441-5(d) or (e) (by substituting the term “payor” for the term “withholding agent”), shall be treated as paid to an undocumented U.S. payee that is not an exempt recipient under paragraph § 1.6049-4(c) unless the payor has documentation from the payees of the payment and the payment is allocated to foreign payees, as a group, and to each U.S. non-exempt recipient payee. See § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv)(C)(
2
). However, a payor may rely on a withholding statement provided by an intermediary described in § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(iv) (or similar withholding statement for a flow-through entity) that identifies a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees (as described in § 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii)) only if it identifies the foreign intermediary or flow-through entity as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI) under § 1.1471-3(d)(4) (by substituting the term “payor” for the term “withholding agent”). See also § 1.6049-4(c)(4)(iii) for when an FFI may provide a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees on a withholding statement.
(B)
Payee may be an intermediary.
If a payment is made to a person described
in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) that has not provided an intermediary withholding certificate under § 1.1441-1(e)(3)(i) but the payor knows or has reason to know that the payee may be an intermediary, the payor must apply the rules of paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A) of this section. A payor has reason to know that such a person may be an intermediary if that person has provided documentation as an intermediary for another account with the same payor.
(iv)
Short-term deposits and repurchase transactions.
The provisions of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section and not paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section shall apply to deposits with banks and other financial institutions that remain on deposit for a period of two weeks or less, to amounts of original issue discount arising from a sale and repurchase transaction that is completed within a period of two weeks or less, or to amounts described in paragraphs (b)(7), (10) and (11) of this section (relating to certain obligations issued in bearer form).
(4)
Examples.
The rules of paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section are illustrated by the examples in this paragraph (d)(4). Unless otherwise specified in an example, the following facts apply: all FFIs, such as a nonqualified intermediary that is an FFI, are treated as participating FFIs; all payees have been identified with chapter 4 statuses that do not require withholding under chapter 4; and none of the payments are withholdable payments.

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
USP is a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. USP pays interest from sources within the United States that is a withholdable payment to an account maintained in the United States by X. The interest is not deposit interest described in sections 871(i)(2)(A) or 881(d). USP does not have a Form W-9, or withholding certificate from X as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(16). Moreover, USP cannot treat X as an exempt recipient, as defined in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii), without documentation and there is no indication that X is an individual, trust, or estate.
(ii)
Analysis.
The U.S. source interest is an amount subject to withholding as defined in § 1.1441-2(a). Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, USP must apply the provisions of §§ 1.1441-1(b)(2) and 1.1441-5(c) and (e) to determine the payee of the interest. Under § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(i), X, the person to whom the payment is made, is considered to be the payee, unless X is determined to be a flow-through entity, in which case the rules of § 1.1441-5 apply to determine the payee. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii) apply to determine the classification of a payee as an individual, trust, estate, corporation, or partnership. Under § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(B), X is presumed to be a partnership, since X does not appear to be an individual, trust or estate, and X cannot be presumed to be an exempt recipient in the absence of documentation. Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section requires USP to apply the provisions of §§ 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d) to determine whether X is presumed to be a U.S. or foreign partnership. Under §§ 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d)(2), X is presumed to be a U.S. partnership in absence of any indicia of foreign partnership status. The presumption of U.S. status applies even though the payment is a withholdable payment (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section and § 1.1471-3(f)(2) cross referencing the presumption rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)). The U.S. source interest paid to X is reportable under section 6049 on Form 1099 and the interest is subject to backup withholding under section 3406 because X has not provided its TIN on a valid Form W-9. No withholding or reporting applies to the payment under chapter 3 or 4 of the Code.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the interest paid by USP is from sources outside the United States.
(ii)
Analysis.
Interest from sources outside the United States is not an amount subject to withholding, as defined in § 1.1441-2(a) or a withholdable payment. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, USP must apply the provisions of §§ 1.1441-1(b)(2) and 1.1441-5(c) and (e) to determine the payee. Under § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(i), X, the person to whom the payment is made, is considered to be the payee, unless X is determined to be a flow-through entity, in which case the rules of § 1.1441-5(c) or (e) apply to determine the payee. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii) apply to determine the classification of a payee as an individual, trust, estate, corporation, or partnership. These rules apply irrespective of whether the payment is an amount subject to withholding. Under § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(B), X is presumed to be a partnership, since X does not appear to be an individual, trust or estate, and X cannot be presumed to be an exempt recipient in the absence of documentation. Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section requires USP to apply the provisions of §§ 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d) to determine whether, X is presumed to be a U.S. or foreign partnership. Under §§ 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d)(2), X is presumed to be a U.S. partnership in absence of any indicia of foreign partnership status. The foreign source
interest is a payment subject to reporting on Form 1099 under § 1.6049-5(a). Further, because X is a non-exempt recipient that has failed to provide its TIN on a valid Form W-9, the foreign source interest is subject to backup withholding under section 3406.

# Example 3.
(i)
Facts.
USP is a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. USP makes a payment of U.S. source interest outside the United States to an offshore account of X. See paragraphs (c)(1) for a definition of offshore account and (e) for a payment outside the United States. USP does not have a withholding certificate from X as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(16) nor does it have documentary evidence as described in § 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii)(A)(
2
) and § 1.6049-5(c)(1).
(ii)
Analysis.
The interest is an amount subject to withholding as defined in § 1.1441-2(a). Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, USP must apply the provisions of § 1.1441-1(b)(2) and § 1.1441-5(c) and (e) to determine the payee. Under § 1.1441-1(b)(2)(i), X, the person to whom the payment is made, is considered to be the payee, unless X is determined to be a flow-through entity, in which case the rules of § 1.1441-5(c) or (e) apply to determine the payee. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the rules of § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii) apply to determine the classification of a payee as an individual, trust, estate, corporation, or partnership. Under § 1.1441-1(b)(3)(ii)(B), X is presumed to be a partnership, since X does not appear to be an individual, trust or estate, and X cannot be presumed to be an exempt recipient in the absence of documentation. Paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section requires USP to apply the provisions of §§ 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii) and 1.1441-5(d) to determine whether, X is presumed to be a U.S. or foreign partnership. Under §§ 1.1441-1(b)(3)(iii)(D) and 1.1441-5(d)(2), X is presumed to be a foreign partnership. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and § 1.1441-5(c)(1)(i)(E), the payees of the interest are presumed to be the partners of X. Under § 1.1441-5(d)(3), the partners are presumed to be undocumented foreign persons. Therefore, USP must withhold 30% of the interest payment under § 1.1441-1(b)(1) and report the payment on Form 1042-S in accordance with § 1.1461-1(c).

The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that the interest is paid by F, a non-U.S. payor.
(ii)
Analysis.
The analysis and result are the same as in
Example 3.
F is a withholding agent under § 1.1441-7 and its status as a non-U.S. payor under paragraph (c)(5) of this section is irrelevant.

# Example 5.
(i)
Facts.
USP is a U.S. payor as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section that is not an FFI. USP makes a payment outside the United States of interest from sources outside the United States with respect to an offshore obligation held by X. USP does not have a withholding certificate from X as defined in § 1.1441-1(c)(16) nor does it have documentary evidence as described in §§ 1.1471-3(c)(5)(i) and 1.6049-5(c)(1). USP does not have actual knowledge of an employer identification number for X. X does not appear to be an individual, trust, or estate and cannot be treated as an exempt recipient, as defined in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) in the absence of documentation.
