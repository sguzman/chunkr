# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 1.4
Discrimination prohibited.

General.
No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity to which this part 1 applies.
(b)
Specific discriminatory actions prohibited.
(1) A recipient under any program or activity to which this part 1 applies may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on the ground of race, color, or national origin:
(i) Deny a person any housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under the program or activity;
(ii) Provide any housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits to a person which are different, or are provided in a different manner, from those provided to others under the program or activity;
(iii) Subject a person to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits under the program or activity;
(iv) Restrict a person in any way in access to such housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits, or in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others in connection with such housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits under the program or activity;
(v) Treat a person differently from others in determining whether he satisfies any occupancy, admission, enrollment, eligibility, membership, or other requirement or condition which persons must meet in order to be provided any housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under the program or activity;
(vi) Deny a person opportunity to participate in the program or activity through the provision of services or otherwise, or afford him an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program or activity (including the opportunity to participate in the program or activity as an employee but only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this section).
(vii) Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of a planning or advisory body which is an integral part of the program.
(2)(i) A recipient, in determining the types of housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits which will be provided under any such program or activity, or the class of persons to whom, or the situations in which, such housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits will be provided under any such program or activity, or the class of persons to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program or activity, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have
the effect of subjecting persons to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity as respect to persons of a particular race, color, or national origin.
(ii) A recipient, in operating low-rent housing with Federal financial assistance under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1401
et seq.
), shall assign eligible applicants to dwelling units in accordance with a plan, duly adopted by the recipient and approved by the responsible Department official, providing for assignment on a community-wide basis in sequence based upon the date and time the application is received, the size or type of unit suitable, and factors affecting preference or priority established by the recipient's regulations, which are not inconsistent with the objectives of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and this part 1. The plan may allow an applicant to refuse a tendered vacancy for good cause without losing his standing on the list but shall limit the number of refusals without cause as prescribed by the responsible Department official.
(iii) The responsible Department official is authorized to prescribe and promulgate plans, exceptions, procedures, and requirements for the assignment and reassignment of eligible applicants and tenants consistent with the purpose of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, this part 1, and title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in order to effectuate and insure compliance with the requirements imposed thereunder.
(3) In determining the site or location of housing, accommodations, or facilities, an applicant or recipient may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this part 1 applies, on the ground of race, color, or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this part 1.
(4) As used in this part 1 the housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.
(5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.
(6)(i) In administering a program regarding which the recipient has previously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, or national origin, the recipient must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.
(ii) Even in the absence of such prior discrimination, a recipient in administering a program should take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color, or national origin.
Where previous discriminatory practice or usage tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this part 1 applies, the applicant or recipient has an obligation to take reasonable action to remove or overcome the consequences of the prior discriminatory practice or usage, and to accomplish the purpose of the Act.
(c)
Employment practices.
(1) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program or activity to which this part 1 applies is to provide employment, a recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, subject a person to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program or activity (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, employment, layoff, termination, upgrading, demotion, transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation and use of facilities). The requirements applicable to construction employment under such program or activity shall be those specified in or pursuant to part III of
Executive Order 11246 or any executive order which supersedes or amends it.
(2) Where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is not to provide employment, but discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this part 1 tends, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this part 1 applies, the provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to this part 1 to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to, and nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.
§ 1.5
Assurances required.
(a)
General.
(1) Every contract for Federal financial assistance to carry out a program or activity to which this part 1 applies, executed on or after January 3, 1965, and every application for such Federal financial assistance submitted on or after January 3, 1965, shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to such contract or application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program or activity will be conducted and the housing, accommodations, facilities, services, financial aid, or other benefits to be provided will be operated and administered in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part 1. In the case of a contract or application where the Federal financial assistance is to provide or is in the form of personal property or real property or interest therein or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the contract or application. The responsible Department official shall specify the form of the foregoing assurance for such program or activity, and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants in the program or activity. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.
(2) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, acquired through a program of Federal financial assistance the instrument effecting any disposition by the recipient of such real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. In the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interests therein from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain such a covenant.
(3) In program receiving Federal financial assistance in the form, or for the acquisition, of real property or an interest in real property, to the extent that rights to space on, over, or under any such property are included as part of the program receiving such assistance, the nondiscrimination requirements of this part 1 shall extend to any facility located wholly or in part in such space.
(b)
Preexisting contracts—funds not disbursed.
In any case where a contract for Federal financial assistance, to carry out a program or activity to which this part 1 applies, has been executed prior to January 3, 1965, and the funds have not been fully disbursed by the Department, the responsible Department official shall, where necessary to effectuate the purposes of this part 1, require an assurance similar to that provided in paragraph (a) of this section as
a condition to the disbursement of further funds.
(c)
Preexisting contracts—periodic payments.
In any case where a contract for Federal financial assistance, to carry out a program or activity to which this part 1 applies, has been executed prior to January 3, 1965, and provides for periodic payments for the continuation of the program or activity, the recipient shall, in connection with the first application for such periodic payments on or after January 3, 1965: (1) Submit a statement that the program or activity is being conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part 1 and (2) provide such methods of administration for the program or activity as are found by the responsible Department official to give reasonable assurance that the recipient will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part 1.
(d)

(b)
Noncompliance with § 1.5.
If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 1.5 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with the requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Department shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph, except that the Department shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to a contract therefor approved prior to January 3, 1965.
(c)
Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance.

(d)
Other means authorized by law.
No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) the responsible Department official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the applicant or recipient. During this period of at least 10 days additional efforts shall be made to persuade the applicant or recipient to comply with this part 1 and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.
§ 1.9
Hearings.
(a)
Opportunity for hearing.
Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 1.8(c), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient.

(1) Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible Department official that the matter be scheduled for hearing, or (2) advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated time and place. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph (a) or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 1.8(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.
(b)
Hearing procedures.
Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with 24 CFR part 180.

Effect on other regulations; forms and instructions.
(a)
Effect on other regulations.
All regulations, orders, or like directions heretofore issued by any officer of the Department which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against persons on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program or activity to which this part applies, and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance to any applicant or recipient for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to January 3, 1965. Nothing in this part, however, shall be deemed to supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof):
(1) Executive Orders 11246 and 11375 and regulations issued thereunder, or
(2) Executive Order 11063 and regulations issued thereunder, or any other order, regulations or instructions, insofar as such order, regulations, or instructions, prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in any program or activity or situation to which this part is inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground.
(b)
Forms and instructions.
The responsible Department official shall assure that forms and detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part are issued and promptly made available to interested persons.
(c)
Supervision and coordination.
The Secretary may from time to time assign to officials of the Department, or to officials of other departments or agencies of the Government with the consent of such department or agency, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of title VI of the Act and this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided in § 1.10), including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within the Department and within the Executive Branch of the Government in the application of title VI and this part to similar programs or activities and in similar situations. Any action taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this paragraph shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by the responsible official of this Department.

(2) The designated agency official will specify the extent to which such assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in interest.
§ 3.120
Transfers of property.
If a recipient sells or otherwise transfers property financed in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance to a transferee that operates any education program or activity, and the Federal share of the fair market value of the property is not upon such sale or transfer properly accounted for to the Federal Government, both the transferor and the transferee shall be deemed to be recipients, subject to the provisions of §§ 3.205 through 3.235(a).
§ 3.125
Effect of other requirements.
(a)
Effect of other Federal provisions.
The obligations imposed by these Title IX regulations are independent of, and do not alter, obligations not to discriminate on the basis of sex imposed by Executive Order 11246, 3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339; as amended by Executive Order 11375, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 684; as amended by Executive Order 11478, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 803; as amended by Executive Order 12087, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 230; as amended by Executive Order 12107, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 264; sections 704 and 855 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 295m, 298b-2); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e

(c)
Effect of rules or regulations of private organizations.
The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league, or association that would render any applicant or student ineligible to participate or limit the eligibility or participation of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, in any education program or activity operated by a recipient and that receives Federal financial assistance.
§ 3.130
Effect of employment opportunities.
The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated because employment opportunities in any occupation or profession are or may be more limited for members of one sex than for members of the other sex.

Such notification shall contain such information, and be made in such manner, as the designated agency official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by Title IX and these Title IX regulations, but shall state at least that the requirement not to discriminate in education programs or activities extends to employment therein, and to admission thereto unless §§ 3.300 through 3.310 do not apply to the recipient, and that inquiries concerning the application of Title IX and these Title IX regulations to such recipient may be referred to the employee designated pursuant to § 3.135, or to the designated agency official.

the designated agency official may consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex.
(d)
Adjustment period.
A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000.

(d)
Pregnancy leave.
In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its employees, or in the case of an employee with insufficient leave or accrued employment time to qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence without pay for a reasonable period of time, at the conclusion of which the employee shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began or to a comparable position, without decrease in rate of compensation or loss of promotional opportunities, or any other right or privilege of employment.
§ 3.535
Effect of state or local law or other requirements.
(a)
Prohibitory requirements.

(b)
Benefits.

§ 3.550
Sex as a bona fide occupational qualification.
A recipient may take action otherwise prohibited by §§ 3.500 through 3.550 provided it is shown that sex is a bona fide occupational qualification for that action, such that consideration of sex with regard to such action is essential to successful operation of the employment function concerned. A recipient shall not take action pursuant to this section that is based upon alleged comparative employment characteristics or stereotyped characterizations of one or the other sex, or upon preference based on sex of the recipient, employees, students, or other persons, but nothing contained in this section shall prevent a recipient from considering an employee's sex in relation to employment in a locker room or toilet facility used only by members of one sex.

It also includes any change requested by a recipient in the amount of assistance previously provided, except changes resulting from annual adjustments in Section 8 rents under Section 8(c)(2)(A) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f);
(2) Assistance to residential rental property receiving a tax credit under Federal, State or local law.
(3) For purposes of this definition, assistance includes assistance resulting from annual adjustments in Section 8 rents under Section 8(c)(2)(A) of the United States Housing Act of 1937, unless the initial assistance was made available before April 15, 1991, and no other assistance subject to this subpart A was made available on or after that date.
Housing project
means: (1) Property containing five or more dwelling units that is to be used for primarily residential purposes, including (but not limited to) living arrangements such as independent group residences, board and care facilities, group homes, and transitional housing, but excluding facilities that provide primarily non-residential services, such as intermediate care facilities, nursing homes, and hospitals.

Documentation of decisions.
HUD will make available for public inspection, for at least five (5) years, and beginning not less than 30 calendars days after it provides the assistance, all documentation and other information regarding the basis for the funding decision with respect to each application submitted to HUD for assistance. HUD will also make available any written indication of support that it received from any applicant. Recipients of HUD assistance must ensure, in accordance with HUD guidance, the public availability of similar information submitted by subrecipients of HUD assistance.

[61 FR 14449, Apr. 1, 1996, as amended at 80 FR 75934, Dec. 7, 2015]
§ 4.11
Updating of disclosure.
(a) During the period in which an application for assistance covered under Section 102(b) is pending, or in which such assistance is being provided, the applicant must report to the Department, or to the State or unit of general local government, as appropriate:
(1) Any information referred to in Section 102(b) that the applicant should have disclosed with respect to the application, but did not disclose;
(2) Any information referred to in Section 102(b) that initially arose after the time for making disclosures under that subsection, including the name and pecuniary interest of any person who did not have a pecuniary interest in the project or activity that exceeded the threshold in Section 102(b) at the time of the application, but that subsequently exceeded the threshold.
(b) With regard to changes in information that was disclosed under Sections 102(b) or 102(c):
(1) For programs administered by the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development:
(i) Any change in other government assistance covered by Section 102(b) that exceeds the amount of all assistance that was previously disclosed by the lesser of $250,000 or 10 percent of the assistance;
(ii) Any change in the expected sources or uses of funds that exceed the amount of all previously disclosed sources or uses by the lesser of $250,000 or 10 percent of previously disclosed sources;
(2) For all other programs:
(i) Any change in other government assistance under Section 102(b)(1) that exceeds the amount of assistance that was previously disclosed;
(ii) Any change in the pecuniary interest of any person under Section 102(b)(2) that exceeds the amount of all previously disclosed interests by the lesser of $50,000 or 10 percent of such interest;

(B) Any change in the expected sources of funds from all sources previously disclosed that exceeds the lesser of $250,000 or 10 percent of the amounts previously disclosed from all sources of funds;
(C) Any change in a single expected use of funds that exceeds the lesser of $250,000 or 10 percent of the previously disclosed use;
(D) Any change in the use of all funds that exceeds the lesser of $250,000 or 10 percent of the previously disclosed uses for all funds.
(c)
Period of coverage.
For purposes of updating of Section 102(c), an application for assistance will be considered to
be pending from the time the application is submitted until the Department communicates its decision with respect to the selection of the applicant.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2510-0011)
§ 4.13
Limitation of assistance subject to section 102(d).
(a) In making the certification for assistance subject to Section 102(d), the Secretary will consider the aggregate amount of assistance from the Department and from other sources that is necessary to ensure the feasibility of the assisted activity. The Secretary will take into account all factors relevant to feasibility, which may include, but are not limited to, past rates of returns for owners, sponsors, and investors; the long-term needs of the project and its tenants; and the usual and customary fees charged in carrying out the assisted activity.
(b) If the Department determines that the aggregate of assistance within the jurisdiction of the Department to a housing project from the Department and from other governmental sources exceeds the amount that the Secretary determines is necessary to make the assisted activity feasible, the Department will consider all options available to enable it to make the required certification, including reductions in the amount of Section 8 subsidies. The Department also may impose a dollar-for-dollar, or equivalent, reduction in the amount of HUD assistance to offset the amount of other government assistance. In grant programs, this could result in a reduction of any grant amounts not yet drawn down. The Department may make these adjustments immediately, or in conjunction with servicing actions anticipated to occur in the near future (
e.g.,
in conjunction with the next annual adjustment of Section 8 rents).
(c) If an applicant does not meet the $200,000 disclosure requirement in § 4.7(b), an applicant must certify whether there is, or is expected to be made, available with respect to the housing project any other governmental assistance. The Department may also require any applicant subject to this subpart A to submit such a certification in conjunction with the Department's processing of any subsequent servicing action on that project. If there is other government assistance for purposes of the two preceding sentences, the applicant must submit such information as the Department deems necessary to make the certification and subsequent adjustments under Section 102(d).
(d) The certification under Section 102(d) shall be retained in the official file for the housing project.

# Subpart B—Prohibition of Advance Disclosure of Funding Decisions
§ 4.20
Purpose.
The provisions of this subpart B are authorized under section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-235, approved December 15, 1989) (42 U.S.C. 3537a) (hereinafter, Section 103). Both the provisions of Section 103 and this subpart B apply for the purposes of Section 103. Section 103 proscribes direct or indirect communication of certain information during the selection process by HUD employees to persons within or outside of the Department who are not authorized to receive that information. The purpose of the proscription is to preclude giving an unfair advantage to applicants who would receive information not available to other applicants or to the public. Section 103 also authorizes the Department to impose a civil money penalty on a HUD employee who knowingly discloses protected information, if such a violation of Section 103 is material, and authorizes the Department to sanction the person who received information improperly by, among other things, denying assistance to that person.
§ 4.22
Definitions.
Application
means a written request for assistance regardless of whether the request is in proper form or format.
Assistance
does not include any contract (e.g., a procurement contract) that is subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR ch. 1).
Disclose
means providing information directly or indirectly to a person through any means of communication.
Employee
includes persons employed on a full-time, part-time, or temporary basis, and special government employees as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202. The term applies whether or not the employee is denoted as an officer of the Department. “Employee” is to be construed broadly to include persons who are retained on a contractual or consultative basis under an Office of Human Resources appointment. However, “employee” does not include an independent contractor, e.g., a firm or individual working under the authority of a procurement contract.
Material or materially
means in some influential or substantial respect or having to do more with substance than with form.
Person
means an individual, corporation, company, association, authority, firm, partnership, society, State, local government, or any other organization or group of people.
Selection process
means the period with respect to a selection for assistance that begins when the HUD official responsible for awarding the assistance involved, or his or her designee, makes a written request (which includes the selection criteria to be used in providing the assistance) to the Office of General Counsel (OGC) to prepare the NOFA, solicitation, or request for applications for assistance for publication in the
Federal Register.
The period includes the evaluation of applications, and concludes with the announcement of the selection of recipients of assistance.
§ 4.24
Scope.
(a)
Coverage.
The prohibitions against improper disclosure of covered selection information apply to any person who is an employee of the Department. In addition, the Department will require any other person who participates at the invitation of the Department in the selection process to sign a certification that he or she will be bound by the provisions of this part.
(b)
Applicability.
The prohibitions contained in this part apply to conduct occurring on or after June 12, 1991.
§ 4.26
Permissible and impermissible disclosures.
(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 103, an employee is permitted to disclose information during the selection process with respect to:
(1) The requirements of a HUD program or programs, including unpublished policy statements and the provision of technical assistance concerning program requirements, provided that the requirements or statements are disclosed on a uniform basis to any applicant or potential applicant. For purposes of this part, the term “technical assistance” includes such activities as explaining and responding to questions about program regulations, defining terms in an application package, and providing other forms of technical guidance that may be described in a NOFA. The term “technical assistance” also includes identification of those parts of an application that need substantive improvement, but this term does not include advising the applicant how to make those improvements.
(2) The dates by which particular decisions in the selection process will be made;
(3) Any information which has been published in the
Federal Register
in a NOFA or otherwise;
(4) Any information which has been made public through means other than the
Federal Register
;
(5) An official audit, inquiry or investigation, if the disclosure is made to an auditor or investigator authorized by the HUD Inspector General to conduct the audit or investigation;
(6) Legal activities, including litigation, if the disclosure is made to an attorney who is representing or is otherwise responsible to the Department in connection with the activities; or
(7) Procedures that are required to be performed to process an application, e.g., environmental or budget reviews, and technical assistance from experts in fields who are regularly employed by other government agencies, provided that the agency with which the expert is employed or associated is not an applicant for HUD assistance during the pending funding cycle.
(b) An authorized employee, during the selection process, may contact an applicant for the purpose of:
(1) Communication of the applicant's failure to qualify, after a preliminary review for eligibility and completeness with respect to his or her application, and the reasons for the failure to qualify, or the fact of the applicant's failure to be determined to be technically acceptable after a full review; or
(2) Clarification of the terms of the applicant's application. A clarification, for the purpose of this paragraph (b), may include a request for additional information consistent with regulatory requirements.
(c) Prohibition of advance disclosure of funding decisions. During the selection process an employee shall not knowingly disclose any covered selection information regarding the selection process to any person other than an employee authorized to receive that information.
(1) The following disclosures of information are, at any time during the selection process, a violation of Section 103:
(i) Information regarding any applicant's relative standing;
(ii) The amount of assistance requested by any applicant;
(iii) Any information contained in an application;
(2) The following disclosures of information, before the deadline for the submission of applications, shall be a violation of Section 103:
(i) The identity of any applicant; and
(ii) The number of applicants.
§ 4.28
Civil penalties.
Whenever any employee knowingly and materially violates the prohibition in Section 103, the Department may impose a civil money penalty on the employee in accordance with the provisions of 24 CFR part 30.
§ 4.30
Procedure upon discovery of a violation.
(a)
In general.
When an alleged violation of Section 103 or this subpart B comes to the attention of any person, including an employee, he or she may either:
(1) Contact the HUD Ethics Law Division to provide information about the alleged violation; or
(2) Contact the HUD Office of Inspector General to request an inquiry or investigation into the matter.
(b)
Ethics Law Division.
When the Ethics Law Division receives information concerning an alleged violation of Section 103, it shall refer the matter to the Inspector General stating the facts of the alleged violation and requesting that the Inspector General make an inquiry or investigation into the matter.
(c)
Inspector General.
When the Inspector General receives information concerning an alleged violation of Section 103 or this subpart B, he or she shall notify the Ethics Law Division when the Inspector General begins an inquiry or investigation into the matter.
(d)
Protection of employee complainants.
(1) No official of the Ethics Law Division, after receipt of information from an employee stating the facts of an alleged violation of this part, shall disclose the identity of the employee without the consent of that employee. The Inspector General, after receipt of information stating the facts of an alleged violation of this part, shall not disclose the identity of the employee who provided the information without the consent of that employee, unless the Inspector General determines that disclosure of the employee's identity is unavoidable during the course of an investigation. However, any employee who knowingly reports a false alleged violation of this part is not so protected and may be subject to disciplinary action.
(2) Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend or approve a personnel action is prohibited from threatening, taking, failing to take, recommending, or approving any personnel action as reprisal against another employee for providing information to investigating officials.
§ 4.32
Investigation by Office of Inspector General.
The Office of Inspector General shall review every alleged violation of Section 103. If after a review the Office of
Inspector General determines that further investigation is not warranted, it shall notify the Ethics Law Division of that determination. If, after a review, the Office of Inspector General determines that additional investigation is warranted, it shall conduct the investigation and upon completion issue a report of the investigation to the Ethics Law Division as to each alleged violation.
§ 4.34
Review of Inspector General's report by the Ethics Law Division.
After receipt of the Inspector General's report, the Ethics Law Division shall review the facts and circumstances of the alleged violations. In addition, the Ethics Law Division may:
(a) Return the report to the Inspector General with a request for further investigation;
(b) Discuss the violation with the employee alleged to have committed the violation; or
(c) Interview any other person, including employees who it believes will be helpful in furnishing information relevant to the inquiry.
§ 4.36
Action by the Ethics Law Division.
(a) After review of the Inspector General's report, the Ethics Law Division shall determine whether or not there is sufficient information providing a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of Section 103 or this subpart B has occurred.
(b) If the Ethics Law Division determines that there is no reasonable basis to believe that a violation of Section 103 or this subpart B has occurred, it shall close the matter and send its determination to the Office of Inspector General.
(c) If the Ethics Law Division determines that there is sufficient information to provide a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of Section 103 or this subpart B has occurred, it shall:
(1) Send its determination to the Office of Inspector General; and
(2) Refer the matter to the appropriate official for review as to whether to impose a civil money penalty in accordance with 24 CFR part 30; provided, however, that the Ethics Law Division shall not make a civil money penalty recommendation unless it finds the violation to have been knowing and material. The decision to impose a civil money penalty in a particular matter may be made only upon referral from the Ethics Law Division.
(d) In determining whether a violation is material, the Ethics Law Division shall consider the following factors, as applicable:
(1) The content of the disclosure and its significance to the person to whom the disclosure was made;
(2) The time during the selection process when the disclosure was made;
(3) The person to whom the disclosure was made;
(4) The dollar amount of assistance requested by the person to whom the disclosure was made;
(5) The dollar amount of assistance available for a given competition or program;
(6) The benefit, if any, received or expected by the employee, the employee's relatives or friends, or any other person with whom the employee is affiliated;
(7) The potential injury to the Department.
(e) If the Ethics Law Division determines that there is sufficient information to provide a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of Section 103 or this subpart B has occurred, it may, in addition to referring the matter under 24 CFR part 30, refer the matter to an appropriate HUD official for consideration of any other available disciplinary action. Any referral authorized by this paragraph (e) shall be reported to the Inspector General and may be reported to the employee's supervisor.

Audit requirements for non-profit organizations.
Non-profit organizations subject to regulations in the part 200 and part 800 series of title 24 of the CFR shall comply with the audit requirements of 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.

§ 5.109
Equal participation of faith-based organizations in HUD programs and activities.
(a)
Purpose.
Consistent with Executive Order 13279, entitled “Equal Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and Community Organizations,” as amended by Executive Order 13559, entitled “Fundamental Principles and Policymaking Criteria for Partnerships With Faith-Based and Other Neighborhood Organizations,” and as amended by Executive Order 14015, entitled “Establishment of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships,” this section describes requirements for ensuring the equal participation of faith-based organizations in HUD programs and activities. These requirements apply to all HUD programs and activities, including all of HUD's Native American Programs, except as may be otherwise noted in the respective program regulations in title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), or unless inconsistent with certain HUD program authorizing statutes.
(b)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply to this section:
Direct Federal financial assistance
means Federal financial assistance provided when a Federal Government agency or an intermediary, as defined in this section, selects the provider and either purchases services from that provider (
i.e.,
via a contract) or awards funds to that provider to carry out an activity (
e.g.,
via grant, sub-grant, sub-award, or cooperative agreement). The recipients of sub-grants or sub-awards that receive Federal financial assistance through State-administered programs (
e.g.,
flow-through programs) are considered recipients of direct Federal financial assistance. In general, Federal financial assistance shall be treated as direct, unless it meets the definition of indirect Federal financial assistance.
Federal financial assistance
means assistance that non-Federal entities receive or administer in the forms of grants, contracts, loans, loan guarantees, property, cooperative agreements, food commodities, direct appropriations, or other assistance, but does not include a tax credit, deduction, or exemption.
Indirect Federal financial assistance
means Federal financial assistance provided when the choice of the provider is placed in the hands of the beneficiary, and the cost of that service is paid through a voucher, certificate, or other similar means of Government-funded payment. Federal financial assistance provided to an organization is considered indirect when the Government program through which the beneficiary receives the voucher, certificate, or other similar means of Government-funded payment is neutral toward religion meaning that it is available to providers without regard to the religious or non-religious nature of the institution and there are no program incentives that deliberately skew for or against religious or secular providers; and the organization receives the assistance wholly as a result of a genuine and independent private choice of the beneficiary, not a choice of the Government. The availability of adequate secular alternatives is a significant factor in determining whether a program affords true private choice.
Intermediary
means an entity, including a nongovernmental organization, acting under a contract, grant, or other agreement with the Federal Government or with a State, tribal or local government that accepts Federal financial assistance and distributes that assistance to other entities that, in turn, carry out activities under HUD programs.
Religious exercise
has the meaning given to the term in 42 U.S.C. 2000cc-5(7)(A).
(c)
Equal participation of faith-based organizations in HUD programs and activities.
(1) Faith-based organizations are eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to participate in any HUD program or activity for which they are otherwise eligible. Neither the Federal Government, nor a State, Tribal, or local government, nor any other entity that administers any HUD program or activity, shall discriminate for or against an organization on the basis of the organization's religious character, motives, or affiliation, or lack thereof, or on the basis of conduct that would not be considered grounds to favor or disfavor a similarly situated secular organization.
(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude HUD from making an accommodation, including for religious exercise, with respect to one or more program requirements on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States.
(3) HUD shall not disqualify an organization from participating in any HUD program for which it is eligible on the basis of the organization's indication that it may request an accommodation with respect to one or more program requirements, unless the organization has made clear that the accommodation is necessary to its participation and, in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States, HUD has determined that it would deny the accommodation.
(4) In addition, decisions about awards of Federal financial assistance must be free from political interference or even the appearance of such interference and must be made on the basis of merit, not based on the organization's religious character, affiliation, or lack thereof, or based on the organization's religious exercise. Notices of funding opportunity, grant agreements, and cooperative agreements shall include language substantially similar to that in appendix A to this subpart, where faith-based organizations are eligible for such opportunities.
(d)
Independence and identity of faith-based organizations.
(1) A faith-based organization that applies for, or participates in, a HUD program or activity supported with Federal financial assistance retains its autonomy, right of expression, religious character, authority over its governance, and independence, and may continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs; provided that, it does not use direct Federal financial assistance, whether received through a prime award or sub-award, to support or engage in any explicitly religious activities, including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization.
(2) A faith-based organization that receives direct Federal financial assistance may use space (including a sanctuary, chapel, prayer hall, or other space) in its facilities (including a temple, synagogue, church, mosque, or other place of worship) to carry out activities under a HUD program without concealing, altering, or removing religious art, icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a faith-based organization participating in a HUD program or activity retains its authority over its internal governance, and may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board members on the basis of their acceptance of or adherence to the religious tenets of the organization consistent with paragraph (i) of this section, and include religious references in its organization's mission statements and other governing documents.
(e)
Explicitly religious activities.
If an organization engages in explicitly religious activities (including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization), the explicitly religious activities must be offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or activities supported by direct Federal financial assistance and participation must be voluntary for the beneficiaries of the programs or activities that receive direct Federal financial assistance. The use of indirect Federal financial assistance is not subject to this restriction. Nothing in this
part restricts HUD's authority under applicable Federal law to fund activities, that can be directly funded by the Government consistent with the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution.
(f)
Intermediary responsibilities to ensure equal participation of faith-based organizations in HUD programs.
If an intermediary—acting under a contract, grant, or other agreement with the Federal Government or with a State, tribal or local government that is administering a program supported by Federal financial assistance—is given the authority to select a nongovernmental organization to receive Federal financial assistance under a contract, grant, sub-grant, sub-award, or cooperative agreement, the intermediary must ensure that such organization complies with the requirements of this section. If the intermediary is a nongovernmental organization, it retains all other rights of a nongovernmental organization under the program's statutory and regulatory provisions.
(g)
Nondiscrimination and beneficiary notice requirements
—(1)
Nondiscrimination.
Any organization that receives Federal financial assistance under a HUD program or activity shall not, in providing services supported in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance, or in their outreach activities related to such services, discriminate against a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice. However, an organization that participates in a program funded by indirect Federal financial assistance need not modify its program or activities to accommodate a beneficiary who chooses to expend the indirect aid on the organization's program.
(2)
Beneficiary notice.
(i) An organization providing services under a program supported by direct Federal financial assistance from HUD, or an entity that administers indirect Federal financial assistance from HUD, must give written notice to beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries of certain protections in a manner and form prescribed by HUD, including by incorporating the notice into materials that are otherwise provided to beneficiaries. The required language for this written notice to beneficiaries is set forth in appendix C to this subpart.
(ii) For the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV), Project-Based Voucher (PBV), and Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation programs, the respective recipient (
i.e.,
Public Housing Agency) is required to provide the written beneficiary notice. For the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program, the grantee or project sponsor that is responsible for making eligibility determinations is required to provide the written beneficiary notice. For the Continuum of Care (CoC) and Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) programs, the recipient or subrecipient that is responsible for determining the eligibility of each family or individual is required to provide the written beneficiary notice. The participating or prospective providers (landlords) are not responsible for providing the written beneficiary notice for indirect aid recipients. The notice must include the following information:
(A) Nondiscrimination requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section;
(B) Notification that a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary may report an organization's violation of these protections, including any denials of services or benefits by an organization, by contacting or filing a written complaint with the Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships or the intermediary that awarded funds to the organization; and
(C) For direct Federal financial assistance only, prohibitions with respect to explicitly religious activities as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.
(3)
Notice timing.
The written notice described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section must be given to a prospective beneficiary prior to the time the prospective beneficiary enrolls in the program or receives services from the program. When the nature of the service provided or exigent circumstances make it impracticable to provide such written notice in advance of the actual service, an organization must advise beneficiaries of their protections at the earliest available opportunity.
(4)
Alternative option information.
HUD may determine that the notice described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section must inform each beneficiary or prospective beneficiary about how to obtain information from HUD, or a State agency or other entity administering the applicable program, about other federally funded service providers in their area that provide the services available under the applicable program.
(h)
No additional assurances from faith-based organizations.
A faith-based organization is not rendered ineligible by its religious nature to access and participate in HUD programs. Absent regulatory or statutory authority, no notice of funding opportunity, grant agreement, cooperative agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by HUD or a recipient or intermediary in administering Federal financial assistance from HUD shall require otherwise eligible faith-based organizations to provide assurances or notices where they are not required of similarly situated secular organizations. All organizations that participate in HUD programs or activities, including organizations with religious character, motives, or affiliation, must carry out eligible activities in accordance with all program requirements, including those prohibiting the use of direct financial assistance to engage in explicitly religious activities, subject to any accommodations that are granted to organizations on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States. No notice of funding opportunity, grant agreement, cooperative agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by HUD or a recipient or intermediary in administering financial assistance from HUD shall disqualify otherwise eligible faith-based organizations from participating in HUD's programs or activities on the basis of the organization's religious character, motives, or affiliation, or lack thereof, or on the basis of conduct that would not be considered grounds to disqualify a similarly situated secular organization.
(i)
Exemption from Title VII employment discrimination requirements.
A religious organization's exemption from the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion, set forth in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-1), is not forfeited when the organization participates in a HUD program. Some HUD programs, however, contain independent statutory provisions that impose certain nondiscrimination requirements on all grantees. Accordingly, grantees should consult with the appropriate HUD program office to determine the scope of applicable requirements.
(j)
Acquisition, construction, and rehabilitation of structures.
Direct Federal financial assistance may be used for the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of structures only to the extent that those structures are used for conducting eligible activities under a HUD program or activity. Where a structure is used for both eligible and explicitly religious activities (including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization), direct Federal financial assistance may not exceed the cost of the share of acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation attributable to eligible activities in accordance with the cost accounting requirements applicable to the HUD program or activity. However, acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of sanctuaries, chapels, or other rooms that a HUD-funded faith-based organization uses as its principal place of worship, may not be paid with direct Federal financial assistance. Disposition of real property by a faith-based organization after its use for an authorized purpose, or any change in use of the property from an authorized purpose, is subject to Government-wide regulations governing real property disposition (2 CFR part 200, subpart D) and the HUD program regulations, as directed by HUD.
(k)
Commingling of Federal and State, tribal, and local funds.
If a State, tribal, or local government voluntarily contributes its own funds to supplement direct Federal financial assistance for an activity, the State, tribal or local government has the option to segregate those funds or commingle them
with the direct Federal financial assistance. However, if the funds are commingled, the requirements of this section apply to all of the commingled funds. Further, if a State, tribal, or local government is required to contribute matching funds to supplement direct Federal financial assistance for an activity, the matching funds are considered commingled with the direct Federal financial assistance and, therefore, subject to the requirements of this section. Some HUD programs' requirements govern any activity assisted under those programs. Accordingly, recipients should consult with the appropriate HUD program office to determine the scope of applicable requirements.
(l)
Tax exempt organizations.
In general, HUD does not require that a recipient, including a faith-based organization, obtain tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code to be eligible for funding under HUD programs. Many grant programs, however, do require an organization to be a nonprofit organization in order to be eligible for funding. Notices of funding availability that require organizations to have nonprofit status will specifically so indicate in the eligibility section of the notice of funding availability. In addition, if any notice of funding availability requires an organization to maintain tax-exempt status, it will expressly state the statutory authority for requiring such status. Applicants should consult with the appropriate HUD program office to determine the scope of any applicable requirements. In HUD programs in which an applicant must show that it is a nonprofit organization but this is not statutorily defined, the applicant may do so by any of the following means:
(1) Proof that the Internal Revenue Service currently recognizes the applicant as an organization to which contributions are tax deductible under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code;
(2) A statement from a State or other governmental taxing body or the State secretary of State certifying that—
(i) The organization is a nonprofit organization operating within the State; and
(ii) No part of its net earnings may benefit any private shareholder or individual;
(3) A certified copy of the applicant's certificate of incorporation or similar document that clearly establishes the nonprofit status of the applicant; or
(4) Any item described in paragraphs (l)(1) through (3) of this section, if that item applies to a State or national parent organization, together with a statement by the State or parent organization that the applicant is a local nonprofit affiliate.
(m)
Rule of construction.
Neither HUD nor any recipient or other intermediary receiving funds under any HUD program or activity shall construe these provisions in such a way as to advantage or disadvantage faith-based organizations affiliated with historic or well-established religions or sects in comparison with other religions or sects.
[69 FR 41717, July 9, 2004, as amended at 80 FR 75934, Dec. 7, 2015; 81 FR 19416, Apr. 4, 2016; 85 FR 82315, Dec. 17, 2020; 89 FR 15711, Mar. 4, 2024]
§ 5.110
Waivers.
Upon determination of good cause, the Secretary may, subject to statutory limitations, waive any provision of this title and delegate this authority in accordance with section 106 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3535(q)).
§ 5.111
Housing counseling.
(a) Any housing counseling, including homeownership counseling or rental housing counseling, as defined in § 5.100, required under or provided in connection with any program administered by HUD shall be provided only by organizations and counselors certified by the Secretary under 24 CFR part 214 to provide housing counseling, consistent with 12 U.S.C. 1701x.
(b) For purposes of this section,
required under or provided in connection with any program administered by HUD
means:
(1) Housing counseling required by statute, regulation, Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA), or otherwise required by HUD;
(2) Housing counseling that is funded under a HUD program;
(3) Housing counseling that is required by a grantee or subgrantee of a HUD program as a condition of receiving assistance under the HUD program; or
(4) Housing counseling to which a family assisted under a HUD program is referred, by a grantee or subgrantee of the HUD program.

§ 5.150
Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing: Purpose.
Link to an amendment published at 90 FR 11023, Mar. 3, 2025.
Pursuant to the affirmatively furthering fair housing mandate in section 808(e)(5) of the Fair Housing Act, and in subsequent legislative enactments, the purpose of the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) regulations is to provide program participants with a substantive definition of the AFFH requirement, as well as to provide access to an effective planning approach to aid those program participants that wish to avail themselves of it in taking meaningful actions to overcome historic patterns of segregation, promote fair housing choice, and foster inclusive communities that are free from discrimination.
[86 FR 30790, June 10, 2021]

# Effective Date Note:
At 90 FR 11023, Mar. 3, 2025, § 5.150 was amended by revising § 5.150, effective Apr. 2, 2025. For the convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:
§ 5.150
Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing: Definitions.
(a) The phrase “fair housing” in 42 U.S.C. 5304(b)(2), 5306(d)(7)(B), 12705(b)(15), and 1437c-1(d)(16) means housing that, among other attributes, is affordable, safe, decent, free of unlawful discrimination, and accessible as required under civil rights laws.
(b) The phrase “affirmatively further” in 42 U.S.C. 5304(b)(2), 5306(d)(7)(B), 12705(b)(15), and 1437c-1(d)(16) means to take any action rationally related to promoting any attribute or attributes of fair housing as defined in the preceding subsection.
§ 5.151
Affirmatively Further Fair Housing: Definitions.
Link to an amendment published at 90 FR 11023, Mar. 3, 2025.
For purposes of §§ 5.150 through 5.152, the terms “consolidated plan,” “consortium,” “unit of general local government,” “jurisdiction,” and “State” are defined in 24 CFR part 91. For PHAs, “jurisdiction” is defined in 24 CFR 982.4. The following additional definitions are provided solely for purposes of §§ 5.150 through 5.152 and related amendments in 24 CFR parts 91, 92, 570, 574, 576, and 903:
Affirmatively furthering fair housing
means taking meaningful actions, in addition to combating discrimination, that overcome patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from barriers that restrict access to opportunity based on protected characteristics. Specifically, affirmatively furthering fair housing means taking meaningful actions that, taken together, address significant disparities in housing needs and in access to opportunity, replacing segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns, transforming racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity, and fostering and maintaining compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws. The duty to affirmatively further fair housing extends to all of a program participant's activities and programs relating to housing and urban development.
Disability.
(1) The term “disability” means, with respect to an individual:
(i) A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual;
(ii) A record of such an impairment; or
(iii) Being regarded as having such an impairment.
(2) The term “disability” as used herein shall be interpreted consistent with the definition of such term under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008. This definition does not change the definition of “disability” or “disabled person” adopted pursuant to a HUD program statute for purposes of determining an individual's eligibility to participate in a housing program that serves a specified population.
Fair housing choice
means that individuals and families have the information, opportunity, and options to live where they choose without unlawful discrimination and other barriers related to race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or disability. Fair housing choice encompasses:
(1) Actual choice, which means the existence of realistic housing options;
(2) Protected choice, which means housing that can be accessed without discrimination; and
(3) Enabled choice, which means realistic access to sufficient information regarding options so that any choice is informed. For persons with disabilities, fair housing choice and access to opportunity include access to accessible housing and housing in the most integrated setting appropriate to an individual's needs as required under Federal civil rights law, including disability-related services that an individual needs to live in such housing.
Housing programs serving specified populations.
Housing programs serving specified populations are HUD and Federal housing programs, including designations in the programs, as applicable, such as HUD's Supportive Housing for the Elderly, Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities, homeless assistance programs under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11301
et seq.
), and housing designated under section 7 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437e), that:
(1) Serve specific identified populations; and
(2) Comply with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d-4) (Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs); the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19), including the duty to affirmatively further fair housing; section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101,
et seq.
); and other Federal civil rights statutes and regulations.
Integration
means a condition, within the program participant's geographic area of analysis, in which there is not a high concentration of persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or having a disability or a particular type of disability when compared to a broader geographic area. For individuals with disabilities, integration also means that such individuals are able to access housing and services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the individual's needs. The most integrated setting is one that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with persons without disabilities to the fullest extent possible, consistent with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101
et seq.
) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794). See 28 CFR part 35, appendix B (2010) (addressing 28 CFR 35.130 and providing guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act regulation on nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in State and local government services).
Meaningful actions
means significant actions that are designed and can be reasonably expected to achieve a material positive change that affirmatively furthers fair housing by, for example, increasing fair housing choice or decreasing disparities in access to opportunity.
Racially or ethnically concentrated area of poverty
means a geographic area with significant concentrations of poverty and minority populations.
Segregation
means a condition, within the program participant's geographic area of analysis, in which there is a high concentration of persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or having a disability or a type of disability in a particular geographic area when compared to a broader geographic area. For persons with disabilities, segregation includes a condition in which the housing or services are not in the most integrated setting appropriate to an individual's needs in accordance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101, et
seq.
), and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794). (See 28 CFR part 35, appendix B (2010), addressing 25 CFR 35.130.) Participation in “housing programs serving specified populations” as defined in this section does not present a fair housing issue of segregation, provided that such programs are administered to comply with
title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d-4) (Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs): The Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19), including the duty to affirmatively further fair housing: Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101,
et seq.
); and other Federal civil rights statutes and regulations.
Significant disparities in access to opportunity
means substantial and measurable differences in access to educational, transportation, economic, and other important opportunities in a community, based on protected class related to housing.

# Effective Date Note:
At 90 FR 11023, Mar. 3, 2025, § 5.151 was amended by revising § 5.151, effective Apr. 2, 2025. For the convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:
§ 5.151
Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing: AFFH Certifications.
A HUD program participant's certification that it will affirmatively further fair housing is sufficient if the participant takes, in the relevant period, any action that is rationally related to promoting one or more attributes of fair housing as defined in section 5.150(a). Nothing in this paragraph relieves jurisdictions of their other obligations under civil rights and fair housing statutes and regulations.
§ 5.152
AFFH certification and administration.
Link to an amendment published at 90 FR 11023, Mar. 3, 2025.
(a)
Certifications.
Program participants must certify that they will comply with their obligation of affirmatively furthering fair housing when required by statutes or regulations governing HUD programs. Such certifications are made in accordance with applicable regulations. Consolidated plan program participants are subject to the certification requirements in 24 CFR part 91, and PHA Plan program participants are subject to the certification requirements in 24 CFR part 903.
(b)
Administration.
To assist program participants in carrying out their obligation of affirmatively furthering fair housing, and supporting their certifications pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, HUD will provide technical assistance to program participants in various ways, including by:
(1) Making HUD-provided data and informational resources available, including about how to voluntarily engage in fair housing planning, such as:
(i) Analyzing fair housing data, assessing fair housing issues and contributing factors, assessing fair housing priorities and goals; taking meaningful actions to support identified goals; and taking no action that is materially inconsistent with the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing; or
(ii) Conducting an analysis to identify impediments to fair housing choice within the jurisdiction, taking appropriate actions to overcome the effects of any impediments identified through that analysis, and maintaining records reflecting the analysis and actions in this regard; or
(iii) Engaging in other means of fair housing planning that meaningfully supports this certification;
(2) Permitting a program participant to voluntarily submit its fair housing planning for HUD feedback from the responsible office; and
(3) Engaging in other forms of technical assistance.
(c)
Procedure for challenging the validity of an AFFH certification.
The procedures for challenging the validity of an AFFH certification are as follows:
(1) For consolidated plan program participants, HUD's challenge to the validity of an AFFH certification will be as specified in 24 CFR part 91.
(2) For PHA Plan program participants, HUD's challenge to the validity of an AFFH certification will be as specified in 24 CFR part 903.
(d)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(1)
Data
refers collectively to the sources of data provided in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this definition. When identification of the specific source of data in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) is necessary, the specific source (HUD-provided data or local data) will be stated.
(i)
HUD-provided data.
The term “HUD-provided data” refers to HUD-provided metrics, statistics, and other quantified information that may be used when conducting fair housing
planning. HUD-provided data will not only be provided to program participants but will be posted on HUD's website for availability to all of the public;
(ii)
Local data.
The term “local data” refers to metrics, statistics, and other quantified information, relevant to the program participant's geographic areas of analysis, that can be found through a reasonable amount of search, are readily available at little or no cost, and may be used to conduct fair housing planning.
(2)
Program participants
means:
(i) Jurisdictions and Insular Areas, as described in 570.405 and defined in 570.3, that are required to submit consolidated plans for the following programs:
(A) The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program (see 24 CFR part 570, subparts D and I);
(B) The Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) program (see 24 CFR part 576);
(C) The HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) program (see 24 CFR part 92); and
(D) The Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) program (see 24 CFR part 574).
(ii) Public housing agencies (PHAs) receiving assistance under sections 8 or 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f or 42 U.S.C. 1437g).
(3)
Protected characteristics
are race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, having a disability, and having a type of disability.
(4)
Protected class
means a group of persons who have the same protected characteristic; e.g., a group of persons who are of the same race are a protected class. Similarly, a person who has a mobility disability is a member of the protected class of persons with disabilities and a member of the protected class of persons with mobility disabilities.

Procedures necessary to comply with these provisions are provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Procedures for independent verification.
(1) Any determination or redetermination of family income verified in accordance with this paragraph must be carried out in accordance with the requirements and procedures applicable to the individual covered program. Independent verification of information obtained from a SWICA or a Federal agency may be:
(i) By HUD;
(ii) In the case of the public housing program, by a PHA; or
(iii) In the case of any Section 8 program, by a PHA acting as contract administrator under an ACC.
(2) Upon receiving income information from a SWICA or a Federal agency, HUD or, when applicable, the PHA shall compare the information with the information about a family's income that was:
(i) Provided by the assistance applicant or participant to the PHA; or
(ii) Obtained by the owner (or mortgagee, as applicable) from the assistance applicant or participant or from his or her employer.
(3) When the income information reveals an employer or other income source that was not disclosed by the assistance applicant or participant, or when the income information differs substantially from the information received from the assistance applicant or participant or from his or her employer:
(i) HUD or, as applicable or directed by HUD, the PHA shall request the undisclosed employer or other income source to furnish any information necessary to establish an assistance applicant's or participant's eligibility for or level of assistance in a covered program. This information shall be furnished in writing, as directed to:
(A) HUD, with respect to programs under parts 221, 235, 236, or 290 of this title;
(B) The responsible entity (as defined in § 5.100) in the case of the public housing program or any Section 8 program.
(C) The owner or mortgagee, as applicable, with respect to the rent supplement, Section 221(d)(3) BMIR, Section 235 homeownership assistance, or Section 236 programs.
(ii) HUD or the PHA may verify the income information directly with an assistance applicant or participant. Such verification procedures shall not include any disclosure of income information prohibited under paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
(4) HUD and the PHA shall not be required to pursue these verification procedures when the sums of money at issue are too small to raise an inference of fraud or justify the expense of independent verification and the procedures related to termination, denial, suspension, or reduction of assistance.
(5) Based on the income information received from a SWICA or Federal agency, HUD or the PHA, as appropriate, may inform an owner (or mortgagee) that an assistance applicant's or participant's eligibility for or level of assistance is uncertain and needs to be verified. The owner (or mortgagee) shall then confirm the assistance applicant's or participant's income information by checking the accuracy of the information with the employer or other income source, or directly with the family.
(6) Nondisclosure of Income information. Neither HUD nor the PHA may disclose income information obtained from a SWICA directly to an owner (unless a PHA is the owner). Disclosure of income information obtained from the SSA or IRS is restricted under 26 U.S.C. § 6103(l)(7) and 42 U.S.C. 3544.
(c)
Opportunity to contest.
HUD, the PHA, or the owner (or mortgagee, as applicable) shall promptly notify any assistance applicant or participant in writing of any adverse findings made on the basis of the information verified in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The assistance applicant
or participant may contest the findings in the same manner as applies to other information and findings relating to eligibility factors under the applicable program. Termination, denial, suspension, or reduction of assistance shall be carried out in accordance with requirements and procedures applicable to the individual covered program, and shall not occur until the expiration of any notice period provided by the statute or regulations governing the program.

§ 5.238
Criminal and civil penalties.
Persons who violate the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 3544 or 26 U.S.C. 6103(l)(7) with respect to the use and disclosure of income information may be subject to civil or criminal penalties under 42 U.S.C. 3544(c)(3), 26 U.S.C. 7213(a), or 18 U.S.C. 1905.
§ 5.240
Family disclosure of income information to the responsible entity and verification.
(a) This section applies to families that reside in dwelling units with assistance under the public housing program, the Section 8 tenant-based assistance programs, or for which project-based assistance is provided under the Section 8, Section 202, or Section 811 program.
(b) The family must promptly furnish to the responsible entity any letter or other notice by HUD to a member of the family that provides information concerning the amount or verification of family income.
(c) The responsible entity must verify the accuracy of the income information received from the family, and change the amount of the total tenant payment, tenant rent or Section 8 housing assistance payment, or terminate assistance, as appropriate, based on such information.

§ 5.315
Content of pet rules: General requirements.
(a)
Housing programs.
The project owner shall prescribe reasonable rules to govern the keeping of common household pets. The pet rules must include the mandatory rules described in § 5.350 and may, unless otherwise noted in this subpart C, include other discretionary provisions as provided in § 5.318.
(b)
Public Housing programs.
(1) PHAs may choose not to promulgate rules governing the keeping of common household pets or may include rules as provided in § 5.318. PHAs may elect to include provisions based on those in § 5.350. If they so choose, the PHAs may modify the provisions in § 5.350 in any manner consistent with this subpart C.
(2) If PHAs choose to promulgate pet rules, tenants must be permitted to own and keep pets in their units in accordance with the terms and conditions of their leases, the provisions of this subpart C, and any applicable State or local law or regulation governing the owning or keeping of pets in dwelling accommodations.
(3) PHAs that choose not to promulgate pet rules, shall not impose, by lease modification or otherwise, any requirement that is inconsistent with the provisions of this subpart C.
(c)
Use of discretion.
(1) This subpart C does not define with specificity the limits of the project owners' or PHAs' discretion to promulgate pet rules. Where a project owner or PHA has discretion to prescribe pet rules under this subpart C, the pet rules should be:
(i) Reasonably related to furthering a legitimate interest of the project owner or PHA, such as the owner's or PHA's interest in providing a decent, safe, and sanitary living environment for existing and prospective tenants and in protecting and preserving the physical condition of the project and the owner's or PHA's financial interest in it; and
(ii) Drawn narrowly to achieve the owner's or PHA's legitimate interests, without imposing unnecessary burdens and restrictions on pet owners and prospective pet owners.
(2) Where a project owner or PHA has discretion to prescribe pet rules under this subpart C, the owner or PHA may vary the rules' content among projects and within individual projects, based on factors such as the size, type, location, and occupancy of the project or its units, provided that the applicable rules are reasonable and do not conflict with any applicable State or local law or regulation governing the owning or
keeping of pets in dwelling accommodations.
(d)
Conflict with State or local law.
The pet rules adopted by the project owner or PHA shall not conflict with applicable State or local law or regulations. If such a conflict may exist, the State and local law or regulations shall apply.
§ 5.318
Discretionary pet rules.
Pet rules promulgated by project owners and PHAs may include, but are not limited to, consideration of the following factors:
(a)
Definitions of “common household pet”
—(1)
For Public Housing programs.
The pet rules established by a PHA may contain a reasonable definition of a common household pet.
(2)
For Housing programs.
Project owners wishing to define “common household pet” in their pet rules must use the Housing programs definition of the term in § 5.306.
(b)
Density of tenants and pets.
(1)(i) The pet rules established under this section may take into account tenant and pet density. The pet rules may place reasonable limitations on the number of common household pets that may be allowed in each dwelling unit. In the case of group homes, the pet rules may place reasonable limitations on the number of common household pets that may be allowed in each home.
(ii)
For Housing programs.
Under these rules, project owners may limit the number of four-legged, warm-blooded pets to one pet in each dwelling unit or group home.
(iii) Other than the limitations described in this paragraph (b)(1), the pet rules may not limit the total number of pets allowed in the project.
(2) As used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the term “group home” means:
(i)
For purposes of Housing programs.
A small, communal living arrangement designed specifically for individuals who are chronically mentally ill, developmentally disabled, or physically disabled who require a planned program of continual supportive services or supervision (other than continual nursing, medical or psychiatric care).
(ii)
For purposes of Public Housing programs.
A dwelling or dwelling unit for the exclusive residential use of elderly persons or persons with disabilities who are not capable of living completely independently and who require a planned program of continual supportive services or supervision (other than continual nursing, medical or psychiatric care).
(c)
Pet size and pet type.
The pet rules may place reasonable limitations on the size, weight, and type of common household pets allowed in the project.
(d)
Potential financial obligations of tenants
—(1)
Pet deposits.
The pet rules may require tenants who own or keep pets in their units to pay a refundable pet deposit. In the case of project owners, this pet deposit shall be limited to those tenants who own or keep cats or dogs in their units. This deposit is in addition to any other financial obligation generally imposed on tenants of the project. The project owner or PHA may use the pet deposit only to pay reasonable expenses directly attributable to the presence of the pet in the project, including (but not limited to) the cost of repairs and replacements to, and fumigation of, the tenant's dwelling unit and, for project owners, the cost of animal care facilities under § 5.363. The project owner or PHA shall refund the unused portion of the pet deposit to the tenant within a reasonable time after the tenant moves from the project or no longer owns or keeps a pet (or a cat or dog in the case of project owners) in the dwelling unit.
(2)
Housing programs: Maximum pet deposit.
(i) Pet deposits for the following tenants shall not exceed an amount periodically fixed by HUD through notice.
(A) Tenants whose rents are subsidized (including tenants of a HUD-owned project, whose rents were subsidized before HUD acquired it) under one of the programs identified by HUD through notice.
(B) Tenants who live in a project assisted (including tenants who live in a HUD-owned project that was assisted before HUD acquired it) under one of the programs identified by HUD through notice.
(C) For all other tenants of projects for the elderly or persons with disabilities, the pet deposit shall not exceed one month's rent at the time the pet is brought onto the premises.
(ii) In establishing the maximum amount of pet deposit under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, HUD will consider factors such as:
(A) Projected, estimated expenses directly attributable to the presence of pets in the project;
(B) The ability of project owners to offset such expenses by use of security deposits or HUD-reimbursable expenses; and
(C) The low income status of tenants of projects for the elderly or persons with disabilities.
(iii) For pet deposits subject to paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the pet rules shall provide for gradual accumulation of the deposit by the pet owner through an initial payment not to exceed $50 when the pet is brought onto the premises, and subsequent monthly payments not to exceed $10 per month until the amount of the deposit is reached.
(iv) For pet deposits subject to paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(B) and (C) of this section, the pet rules may provide for gradual accumulation of the deposit by the pet owner.
(v) The project owner may (subject to the HUD-prescribed limits) increase the amount of the pet deposit by amending the house pet rules in accordance with § 5.353.
(A) For pet deposits subject to paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the house pet rules shall provide for gradual accumulation of any such increase not to exceed $10 per month for all deposit amounts that are being accumulated.
(B) [Reserved]
(vi) Any pet deposit that is established within the parameters set forth by paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be deemed reasonable for purposes of this subpart C.
(3)
Public Housing programs: Maximum pet deposit.
The maximum amount of pet deposit that may be charged by the PHA, on a per dwelling unit basis, shall not exceed the higher of the Total Tenant Payment (as defined in 24 CFR 913.102) or such reasonable fixed amount as the PHA may require. The pet rules may permit gradual accumulation of the pet deposit by the pet owner.
(4)
Housing programs: Waste removal charge.
The pet rules may permit the project owner to impose a separate waste removal charge of up to five dollars ($5) per occurrence on pet owners that fail to remove pet waste in accordance with the prescribed pet rules. Any pet waste removal charge that is within this five dollar ($5) limitation shall be deemed to be a reasonable amount for the purposes of this subpart C.
(5) The pet deposit (for Housing and Public Housing programs) and waste removal charge (for Housing programs) are not part of the rent payable by the tenant. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section for Housing programs and, paragraph (d) of this section and 24 CFR 966.4(b) for Public Housing programs, project owners or PHAs may not prescribe pet rules that impose additional financial obligations on pet owners that are designed to compensate the project owner or PHA for costs associated with the presence of pets in the project, including (but not limited to) requiring pet owners:
(i) To obtain liability or other insurance to cover damage caused by the pet;
(ii) To agree to be strictly liable for all damages caused by the pet where this liability is not otherwise imposed by State or local law, or
(iii) To indemnify the project owner for pet-related litigation and attorney's fees.
(e)
Standards of pet care.
The pet rules may prescribe standards of pet care and handling, but must be limited to those necessary to protect the condition of the tenant's unit and the general condition of the project premises, or to protect the health or safety of present tenants, project employees, and the public. The pet rules may not require pet owners to have any pet's vocal cords removed. Permitted rules may:
(1) Bar pets from specified common areas (such as lobbies, laundry rooms, and social rooms), unless the exclusion will deny a pet reasonable ingress and egress to the project or building.
(2) Require the pet owner to control noise and odor caused by a pet.
(3) Housing programs: Project owners may also:
(i) Require pet owners to have their dogs and cats spayed or neutered; and
(ii) Limit the length of time that a pet may be left unattended in a dwelling unit.
(f)
Pet licensing.
The pet rules may require pet owners to license their pets in accordance with applicable State and local laws and regulations. (Failure of the pet rules to contain this requirement does not relieve the pet owner of responsibility for complying with applicable State and local pet licensing requirements.)
(g)
Public Housing programs: Designated pet areas.
(1) PHAs may designate buildings, floors of buildings, or sections of buildings as no-pet areas where pets generally may not be permitted. Similarly, the pet rules may designate buildings, floors of buildings, or sections of buildings for residency generally by pet-owning tenants. The PHA may direct such initial tenant moves as may be necessary to establish pet and no-pet areas. The PHA may not refuse to admit (or delay admission of) an applicant for tenancy on the grounds that the applicant's admission would violate a pet or no-pet area. The PHA may adjust the pet and no-pet areas or may direct such additional moves as may be necessary (or both) to accommodate such applicants for tenancy or to meet the changing needs of existing tenants.
(2) Project owners may not designate pet areas in buildings in their pet rules.
(h)
Pets temporarily on the premises.
The pet rules may exclude from the project pets not owned by a tenant that are to be kept temporarily on the project premises. For the purposes of paragraph (h) of this section, pets are to be kept “temporarily” if they are to be kept in the tenant's dwelling accommodations for a period of less than 14 consecutive days and nights. HUD, however, encourages project owners and PHAs to permit the use of a visiting pet program sponsored by a humane society, or other nonprofit organization.
§ 5.321
Lease provisions.
(a)
Lease provisions.
(1) PHAs which have established pet rules and project owners shall ensure that the leases for all tenants of projects for the elderly or persons with disabilities:
(i) State that tenants are permitted to keep common household pets in their dwelling units (subject to the provisions of this subpart and the pet rules);
(ii) Shall incorporate by reference the pet rules promulgated by the project owner or PHA;
(iii) Shall provide that the tenant agrees to comply with these rules; and
(iv) Shall state that violation of these rules may be grounds for removal of the pet or termination of the pet owner's tenancy (or both), in accordance with the provisions of this subpart and applicable regulations and State or local law.
(2) [Reserved]
(b) Where a PHA has not established pet rules, the leases of all tenants of such projects shall not contain any provisions prohibiting the owning or keeping of common household pets, and shall state that owning and keeping of such pets will be subject to the general obligations imposed on the PHA and tenants in the lease and any applicable State or local law or regulation governing the owning or keeping of pets in dwelling accommodations.
§ 5.324
Implementation of lease provisions.
The lease for each tenant of a project for the elderly or persons with disabilities who is admitted on or after the date on which this subpart C is implemented shall contain the lease provisions described in § 5.321 and, if applicable, § 5.360. The lease for each tenant who occupies a unit in such a project under lease on the date of implementation of this part shall be amended to include the provisions described in § 5.321 and, if applicable, § 5.360:
(a) For Housing programs:
(1) Upon renewal of the lease and in accordance with any applicable regulation; and
(2) When a Housing program tenant registers a common household pet under § 5.350
(b) For Public Housing programs:
(1) Upon annual reexamination of tenant income in accordance with any applicable regulation; and
(2) When a Public Housing program tenant wishes to own or keep a common household pet in his or her unit.
§ 5.327
Nuisance or threat to health or safety.
Nothing in this subpart C prohibits a project owner, PHA, or an appropriate community authority from requiring the removal of any pet from a project, if the pet's conduct or condition is duly determined to constitute, under the provisions of State or local law, a nuisance or a threat to the health or safety of other occupants of the project or of other persons in the community where the project is located.

# Pet Ownership Requirements for Housing Programs
§ 5.350
Mandatory pet rules for housing programs.
Mandatory rules.
The project owner must prescribe the following pet rules:
(a)
Inoculations.
The pet rules shall require pet owners to have their pets inoculated in accordance with State and local laws.
(b)
Sanitary standards.
(1) The pet rules shall prescribe sanitary standards to govern the disposal of pet waste. These rules may:
(i) Designate areas on the project premises for pet exercise and the deposit of pet waste;
(ii) Forbid pet owners from exercising their pets or permitting their pets to deposit waste on the project premises outside the designated areas;
(iii) Require pet owners to remove and properly dispose of all removable pet waste; and
(iv) Require pet owners to remove pets from the premises to permit the pet to exercise or deposit waste, if no area in the project is designated for such purposes.
(2) In the case of cats and other pets using litter boxes, the pet rules may require the pet owner to change the litter (but not more than twice each week), may require pet owners to separate pet waste from litter (but not more than once each day), and may prescribe methods for the disposal of pet waste and used litter.
(c)
Pet restraint.
The pet rules shall require that all cats and dogs be appropriately and effectively restrained and under the control of a responsible individual while on the common areas of the project.
(d)
Registration.
(1) The pet rules shall require pet owners to register their pets with the project owner. The pet owner must register the pet before it is brought onto the project premises, and must update the registration at least annually. The project owner may coordinate the annual update with the annual reexamination of tenant income, if applicable. The registration must include:
(i) A certificate signed by a licensed veterinarian or a State or local authority empowered to inoculate animals (or designated agent of such an authority) stating that the pet has received all inoculations required by applicable State and local law;
(ii) Information sufficient to identify the pet and to demonstrate that it is a common household pet; and
(iii) The name, address, and phone number of one or more responsible parties who will care for the pet if the pet owner dies, is incapacitated, or is otherwise unable to care for the pet.
(2) The project owner may require the pet owner to provide additional information necessary to ensure compliance with any discretionary rules prescribed under § 5.318, and shall require the pet owner to sign a statement indicating that he or she has read the pet rules and agrees to comply with them.
(3) The pet rules shall permit the project owner to refuse to register a pet if:
(i) The pet is not a common household pet;
(ii) The keeping of the pet would violate any applicable house pet rule;
(iii) The pet owner fails to provide complete pet registration information or fails annually to update the pet registration; or
(iv) The project owner reasonably determines, based on the pet owner's habits and practices, that the pet owner will be unable to keep the pet in compliance with the pet rules and other lease obligations. The pet's temperament may be considered as a factor in determining the prospective pet owner's ability to comply with the pet rules and other lease obligations.
(4) The project owner may not refuse to register a pet based on a determination that the pet owner is financially unable to care for the pet or that the pet is inappropriate, based on the therapeutic value to the pet owner or the interests of the property or existing tenants.
(5) The pet rules shall require the project owner to notify the pet owner if the project owner refuses to register a pet. The notice shall state the basis for the project owner's action and shall be served on the pet owner in accordance with the requirements of § 5.353(f)(1)(i) or (ii). The notice of refusal to register a pet may be combined with a notice of pet violation as required in § 5.356.
§ 5.353
Housing programs: Procedure for development of pet rules.
(a)
General.
Project owners shall use the procedures specified in this section to promulgate the pet rules referred to in §§ 5.318 and 5.350.
(b)
Development and notice of proposed pet rules.
Project owners shall develop proposed rules to govern the owning or keeping of common household pets in projects for the elderly or persons with disabilities. Notice of the proposed pet rules shall be served on each tenant of the project as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. The notice shall:
(1) Include the text of the proposed rules;
(2) State that tenants or tenant representatives may submit written comments on the rules; and
(3) State that all comments must be submitted to the project owner no later than 30 days from the effective date of the notice of the proposed rules.
(4) The notice may also announce the date, time, and place for a meeting to discuss the proposed rules (as provided in paragraph (c) of this section).
(c)
Tenant consultation.
Tenants or tenant representatives may submit written comments on the proposed pet rules to the project owner by the date specified in the notice of proposed rules. In addition, the owner may schedule one or more meetings with tenants during the comment period to discuss the proposed rules. Tenants and tenant representatives may make oral comments on the proposed rules at these meetings. The project owner must consider comments made at these meetings only if they are summarized, reduced to writing, and submitted to the project owner before the end of the comment period.
(d)
Development and notice of final pet rules.
The project owner shall develop the final rules after reviewing tenants' written comments and written summaries of any owner-tenant meetings. The project owner may meet with tenants and tenant representatives to attempt to resolve issues raised by the comments. Subject to this subpart C, the content of the final pet rules, however, is within the sole discretion of the project owner. The project owner shall serve on each tenant of the project, a notice of the final pet rules as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. The notice must include the text of the final pet rules and must specify the effective date of the final pet rules.
(e)

§ 5.356
Housing programs: Pet rule violation procedures.
(a)
Notice of pet rule violation.
If a project owner determines on the basis of objective facts, supported by written statements, that a pet owner has violated a rule governing the owning or keeping of pets; the project owner may serve a written notice of pet rule violation on the pet owner in accordance with § 5.353(f)(1)(i) or (ii). The notice of pet rule violation must:
(1) Contain a brief statement of the factual basis for the determination and the pet rule or rules alleged to be violated;

(3) State that the pet owner is entitled to be accompanied by another person of his or her choice at the meeting; and
(4) State that the pet owner's failure to correct the violation, to request a meeting, or to appear at a requested meeting may result in initiation of procedures to terminate the pet owner's tenancy.
(b)(1)
Pet rule violation meeting.
If the pet owner makes a timely request for a meeting to discuss an alleged pet rule violation, the project owner shall establish a mutually agreeable time and place for the meeting but no later than 15 days from the effective date of service of the notice of pet rule violation (unless the project owner agrees to a later date). At the pet rule violation meeting, the pet owner and project owner shall discuss any alleged pet rule violation and attempt to correct it. The project owner may, as a result of the meeting, give the pet owner additional time to correct the violation.
(2)
Notice for pet removal.
If the pet owner and project owner are unable to resolve the pet rule violation at the pet rule violation meeting, or if the project owner determines that the pet owner has failed to correct the pet rule violation within any additional time provided for this purpose under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the project owner may serve a written notice on the pet owner in accordance with § 5.353(f)(1) (i) or (ii) (or at the meeting, if appropriate), requiring the pet owner to remove the pet.

(c)
Initiation of procedures to remove a pet or terminate the pet owner's tenancy.

§ 5.359
Housing programs: Rejection of units by applicants for tenancy.
(a) An applicant for tenancy in a project for the elderly or persons with disabilities may reject a unit offered by a project owner if the unit is in close proximity to a dwelling unit in which an existing tenant of the project owns or keeps a common household pet. An applicant's rejection of a unit under this section shall not adversely affect his or her application for tenancy in the project, including (but not limited to) his or her position on the project waiting list or qualification for any tenant selection preference.
(b) Nothing in this subpart C imposes a duty on project owners to provide alternate dwelling units to existing or prospective tenants because of the proximity of common household pets to a particular unit or the presence of such pets in the project.
§ 5.360
Housing programs: Additional lease provisions.
(a)
Inspections.
In addition to other inspections permitted under the lease, the leases for all Housing program tenants of projects for the elderly or persons with disabilities may state that the project owner may, after reasonable notice to the tenant and during reasonable hours, enter and inspect the premises. The lease shall permit entry and inspection only if the project owner has received a signed, written complaint alleging (or the project owner has reasonable grounds to believe) that the conduct or condition of a pet in the dwelling unit constitutes, under applicable State or local law, a nuisance or a threat to the health or safety of the occupants of the project or other persons in the community where the project is located.
(b)
Emergencies.
(1) If there is no State or local authority (or designated agent of such an authority) authorized under applicable State or local law to remove a pet that becomes vicious, displays symptoms of severe illness, or demonstrates other behavior that constitutes an immediate threat to the health or safety of the tenancy as a whole, the project owner may place a provision in tenant leases permitting the project owner to enter the premises (if necessary), remove the pet, and take such action with respect to the pet as may be permissible under State and local law, which may include placing it in a facility that will provide care and shelter for a period not to exceed 30 days.
(2) The lease shall permit the project owner to enter the premises and remove the pet or take such other permissible action only if the project owner requests the pet owner to remove the pet from the project immediately, and the pet owner refuses to do so, or if the project owner is unable to contact the pet owner to make a removal request. The lease may not contain a provision relieving the project owner from liability for wrongful removal of a pet. The cost of the animal care facility shall be paid as provided in § 5.363.
(3) The project owner may place a provision in tenant leases permitting the project owner to enter the premises, remove the pet, and place the pet in a facility that will provide care and shelter, in accordance with the provisions of § 5.363. The lease may not contain a provision relieving the project owner from liability for wrongful removal of a pet.
§ 5.363
Housing programs: Protection of the pet.
(a) If the health or safety of a pet is threatened by the death or incapacity of the pet owner, or by other factors that render the pet owner unable to care for the pet, the project owner may contact the responsible party or parties listed in the pet registration required under § 5.350(d)(1)(iii).
(b) If the responsible party or parties are unwilling or unable to care for the pet, or the project owner, despite reasonable efforts, has been unable to contact the responsible party or parties, the project owner may contact the appropriate State or local authority (or designated agent of such an authority) and request the removal of the pet.
(c) If there is no State or local authority (or designated agent of such an authority) authorized to remove a pet under these circumstances and the project owner has placed a provision in the lease agreement (as described in § 5.360(c)(2)), the project owner may enter the pet owner's unit, remove the pet, and place the pet in a facility that will provide care and shelter until the pet owner or a representative of the pet owner is able to assume responsibility for the pet, but not longer than 30 days.
(d) The cost of the animal care facility provided under this section shall be borne by the pet owner. If the pet owner (or the pet owner's estate) is unable or unwilling to pay, the cost of the animal care facility may be paid from the pet deposit, if imposed under the pet rules.

# Pet Ownership Requirements for Public Housing Programs
§ 5.380
Public housing programs: Procedure for development of pet rules.
PHAs that choose to promulgate pet rules shall consult with tenants of projects for the elderly or persons with disabilities administered by them with respect to their promulgation and subsequent amendment. PHAs shall develop the specific procedures governing tenant consultation, but these procedures must be designed to give tenants (or, if appropriate, tenant councils) adequate opportunity to review and comment upon the pet rules before they are issued for effect. PHAs are solely responsible for the content of final pet rules, but must give consideration to tenant comments. PHAs shall send to the responsible HUD field office, copies of the final (or amended) pet rules, as well as summaries or copies of all tenant comments received in the course of the tenant consultation.

[61 FR 13616, Mar. 27, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 60539, Nov. 29, 1996; 64 FR 25731, May 12, 1999]
§ 5.512
Verification of eligible immigration status.
(a)
General.
Except as described in paragraph (b) of this section and § 5.514, no individual or family applying for assistance may receive such assistance prior to the verification of the eligibility of at least the individual or one family member. Verification of eligibility consistent with § 5.514 occurs when the individual or family members have submitted documentation to the responsible entity in accordance with § 5.508.
(b)
PHA election to provide assistance before verification.
A PHA that is a responsible entity under this subpart may elect to provide assistance to a family before the verification of the eligibility of the individual or one family member.
(c)
Primary verification
—(1)
Automated verification system.
Primary verification of the immigration status of the person is conducted by the responsible entity through the INS automated system (INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE)). The INS SAVE system provides access to names, file numbers and admission numbers of noncitizens.
(2)
Failure of primary verification to confirm eligible immigration status.
If the INS SAVE system does not verify eligible immigration status, secondary verification must be performed.
(d)
Secondary verification
—(1)
Manual search of INS records.
Secondary verification is a manual search by the INS of its records to determine an individual's immigration status. The responsible entity must request secondary verification, within 10 days of receiving the results of the primary verification, if the primary verification system does not confirm eligible immigration status, or if the primary verification system verifies immigration status that is ineligible for assistance under a Section 214 covered program.
(2)
Secondary verification initiated by responsible entity.
Secondary verification is initiated by the responsible entity forwarding photocopies of the original INS documents required for the immigration status declared (front and back), attached to the INS document verification request form G-845S (Document Verification Request), or such other form specified by the INS to a designated INS office for review. (Form G-845S is available from the local INS Office.)
(3)
Failure of secondary verification to confirm eligible immigration status.
If the secondary verification does not confirm eligible immigration status, the responsible entity shall issue to the family the notice described in § 5.514(d), which includes notification of the right to appeal to the INS of the INS finding on immigration status (see § 5.514(d)(4)).
(e)
Exemption from liability for INS verification.
The responsible entity shall not be liable for any action, delay, or failure of the INS in conducting the automated or manual verification.
[61 FR 13616, Mar. 27, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 60539, Nov. 29, 1996; 64 FR 25731, May 12, 1999]

(b)
Restrictions on delay, denial, reduction or termination of assistance
—(1)
Restrictions on reduction, denial or termination of assistance for applicants and tenants.

(c)
Events causing denial or termination of assistance
—(1)
General.
Assistance to an applicant shall be denied, and a tenant's assistance shall be terminated, in accordance with the procedures of this section, upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
(i) Evidence of citizenship (i.e., the declaration) and eligible immigration status is not submitted by the date specified in § 5.508(g) or by the expiration of any extension granted in accordance with § 5.508(h);
(ii) Evidence of citizenship and eligible immigration status is timely submitted, but INS primary and secondary verification does not verify eligible immigration status of a family member; and
(A) The family does not pursue INS appeal or informal hearing rights as provided in this section; or

§ 5.516
Availability of preservation assistance to mixed families and other families.
(a)
Assistance available for tenant mixed families
—(1)
General.
Preservation assistance is available to tenant mixed families, following completion of the appeals and informal hearing procedures provided in § 5.514. There are three types of preservation assistance:
(i) Continued assistance (see paragraph (a) of § 5.518);
(ii) Temporary deferral of termination of assistance (see paragraph (b) of § 5.518); or
(iii) Prorated assistance (see § 5.520, a mixed family must be provided prorated assistance if the family so requests).
(2)
Availability of assistance
—(i)
For Housing covered programs:
One of the three types of assistance described is available to tenant mixed families assisted under a National Housing Act or 1965 HUD Act covered program, depending upon the family's eligibility for such assistance. Continued assistance must be provided to a mixed family that meets the conditions for eligibility for continued assistance.
(ii)
For Section 8 or Public Housing covered programs.
One of the three types of assistance described may be available to tenant mixed families assisted under a Section 8 or Public Housing covered program.
(b)
Assistance available for applicant mixed families.
Prorated assistance is also available for mixed families applying for assistance as provided in § 5.520.
(c)
Assistance available to other families in occupancy.
Temporary deferral of termination of assistance may be available to families receiving assistance under a Section 214 covered program on June 19, 1995, and who have no members with eligible immigration status, as set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1)
For Housing covered programs:
Temporary deferral of termination of assistance is available to families assisted under a Housing covered program.
(2)
For Section 8 or Public Housing covered programs:
The responsible entity may make temporary deferral of termination of assistance to families assisted under a Section 8 or Public Housing covered program.
(d)
Section 8 covered programs: Discretion afforded to provide certain family preservation assistance
—(1)
Project owners.
With respect to assistance under a Section 8 Act covered program administered by a project owner, HUD has the discretion to determine under what circumstances families are to be provided one of the two statutory forms of assistance for preservation of the family (continued assistance or temporary deferral of assistance). HUD is exercising its discretion by specifying the standards in this section under which a project owner must provide one of these two types of assistance to a family. However, project owners and PHAs must offer prorated assistance to eligible mixed families.
(2)
PHAs.
The PHA, rather than HUD, has the discretion to determine the circumstances under which a family will be offered one of the two statutory forms of assistance (continued assistance or temporary deferral of termination of assistance). The PHA must establish its own policy and criteria to follow in making its decision. In establishing the criteria for granting continued assistance or temporary deferral of termination of assistance, the PHA must incorporate the statutory criteria, which are set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 5.518. However, the PHA must offer prorated assistance to eligible families.
[61 FR 13616, Mar. 27, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 60539, Nov. 29, 1996; 64 FR 25732, May 12, 1999]
§ 5.518
Types of preservation assistance available to mixed families and other families.
(a)
Continued assistance
—(1)
General.
A mixed family may receive continued housing assistance if all of the following conditions are met (a mixed family assisted under a Housing covered program must be provided continued assistance if the family meets the following conditions):
(i) The family was receiving assistance under a Section 214 covered program on June 19, 1995;
(ii) The family's head of household or spouse has eligible immigration status as described in § 5.506; and
(iii) The family does not include any person (who does not have eligible immigration status) other than the head of household, any spouse of the head of household, any parents of the head of household, any parents of the spouse, or any children of the head of household or spouse.
(2)
Proration of continued assistance.
A family entitled to continued assistance before November 29, 1996 is entitled to continued assistance as described in paragraph (a) of this section. A family entitled to continued assistance after November 29, 1996 shall receive prorated assistance as described in § 5.520.
(b)
Temporary deferral of termination of assistance
—(1)
Eligibility for this type of assistance.
If a mixed family qualifies for prorated assistance (and does not qualify for continued assistance), but decides not to accept prorated assistance, or if a family has no members with eligible immigration status, the family may be eligible for temporary deferral of termination of assistance if necessary to permit the family additional time for the orderly transition of those family members with ineligible status, and any other family members involved, to other affordable housing. Other affordable housing is used in the context of transition of an ineligible family from a rent level that reflects HUD assistance to a rent level that is unassisted; the term refers to housing that is not substandard, that is of appropriate size for the family and that can be rented for an amount not exceeding the amount that the family pays for rent, including utilities, plus 25 percent.
(2)
Housing covered programs: Conditions for granting temporary deferral of termination of assistance.
The responsible entity shall grant a temporary deferral of termination of assistance to a mixed family if the family is assisted under a Housing covered program and one of the following conditions is met:
(i) The family demonstrates that reasonable efforts to find other affordable housing of appropriate size have been unsuccessful (for purposes of this section, reasonable efforts include seeking information from, and pursuing leads obtained from the State housing agency, the city government, local newspapers, rental agencies and the owner);
(ii) The vacancy rate for affordable housing of appropriate size is below five percent in the housing market for the area in which the project is located; or
(iii) The consolidated plan, as described in 24 CFR part 91 and if applicable to the covered program, indicates that the local jurisdiction's housing market lacks sufficient affordable housing opportunities for households having a size and income similar to the family seeking the deferral.
(3)
Time limit on deferral period.
If temporary deferral of termination of assistance is granted, the deferral period shall be for an initial period not to exceed six months. The initial period may be renewed for additional periods of six months, but the aggregate deferral period for deferrals provided after November 29, 1996 shall not exceed a period of eighteen months. The aggregate deferral period for deferrals granted prior to November 29, 1996 shall not exceed 3 years. These time periods do not apply to a family which includes a refugee under section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act or an individual seeking asylum under section 208 of that Act.
(4)
Notification requirements for beginning of each deferral period.
At the beginning of each deferral period, the responsible entity must inform the family of its ineligibility for financial assistance and offer the family information concerning, and referrals to assist in finding, other affordable housing.
(5)
Determination of availability of affordable housing at end of each deferral period.
(i) Before the end of each deferral period, the responsible entity must satisfy the applicable requirements of either paragraph (b)(5)(i)(A) or (B) of this section. Specifically, the responsible entity must:
(A)
For Housing covered programs:
Make a determination that one of the two conditions specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section continues to be met (note: affordable housing will be
determined to be available if the vacancy rate is five percent or greater), the owner's knowledge and the tenant's evidence indicate that other affordable housing is available; or
(B)
For Section 8 or Public Housing covered programs:
Make a determination of the availability of affordable housing of appropriate size based on evidence of conditions which when taken together will demonstrate an inadequate supply of affordable housing for the area in which the project is located, the consolidated plan (if applicable, as described in 24 CFR part 91), the responsible entity's own knowledge of the availability of affordable housing, and on evidence of the tenant family's efforts to locate such housing.
(ii) The responsible entity must also:
(A) Notify the tenant family in writing, at least 60 days in advance of the expiration of the deferral period, that termination will be deferred again (provided that the granting of another deferral will not result in aggregate deferral periods that exceeds the maximum deferral period). This time period does not apply to a family which includes a refugee under section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act or an individual seeking asylum under section 208 of that Act, and a determination was made that other affordable housing is not available;
or
(B) Notify the tenant family in writing, at least 60 days in advance of the expiration of the deferral period, that termination of financial assistance will not be deferred because either granting another deferral will result in aggregate deferral periods that exceed the maximum deferral period (unless the family includes a refugee under section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act or an individual seeking asylum under section 208 of that Act), or a determination has been made that other affordable housing is available.
(c)
Option to select proration of assistance at end of deferral period.
A family who is eligible for, and receives temporary deferral of termination of assistance, may request, and the responsible entity shall provide proration of assistance at the end of the deferral period if the family has made a good faith effort during the deferral period to locate other affordable housing.
(d)
Notification of decision on family preservation assistance.
A responsible entity shall notify the family of its decision concerning the family's qualification for family preservation assistance. If the family is ineligible for family preservation assistance, the notification shall state the reasons, which must be based on relevant factors. For tenant families, the notice also shall inform the family of any applicable appeal rights.
[61 FR 13616, Mar. 27, 1996, as amended at 61 FR 60539, Nov. 29, 1996; 64 FR 25732, May 12, 1999]
§ 5.520
Proration of assistance.
(a)
Applicability.
This section applies to a mixed family other than a family receiving continued assistance, or other than a family who is eligible for and requests and receives temporary deferral of termination of assistance. An eligible mixed family who requests prorated assistance must be provided prorated assistance.
(b)
Method of prorating assistance for Housing covered programs
—(1)
Proration under Rent Supplement Program.
If the household participates in the Rent Supplement Program, the rent supplement paid on the household's behalf shall be the rent supplement the household would otherwise be entitled to, multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is the number of people in the household and the numerator of which is the number of eligible persons in the household;
(2)
Proration under Section 235 Program.
If the household participates in the Section 235 Program, the interest reduction payments paid on the household's behalf shall be the payments the household would otherwise be entitled to, multiplied by a fraction the denominator of which is the number of people in the household and the numerator of which is the number of eligible persons in the household;
(3)
Proration under Section 236 Program without the benefit of additional assistance.
If the household participates in the Section 236 Program without the benefit of any additional assistance, the household's rent shall be increased above the rent the household would otherwise pay by an amount equal to the difference between the market rate
rent for the unit and the rent the household would otherwise pay multiplied by a fraction the denominator of which is the number of people in the household and the numerator of which is the number of ineligible persons in the household;
(4)
Proration under Section 236 Program with the benefit of additional assistance.
If the household participates in the Section 236 Program with the benefit of additional assistance under the rent supplement, rental assistance payment or Section 8 programs, the household's rent shall be increased above the rent the household would otherwise pay by:
(i) An amount equal to the difference between the market rate rent for the unit and the basic rent for the unit multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is the number of people in the household, and the numerator of which is the number of ineligible persons in the household, plus;
(ii) An amount equal to the rent supplement, housing assistance payment or rental assistance payment the household would otherwise be entitled to multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is the number of people in the household and the numerator of which is the number of ineligible persons in the household.
(c)
Method of prorating assistance for Section 8 covered programs
—(1)
Section 8 assistance other than assistance provided for a tenancy under the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program.
For Section 8 assistance other than assistance for a tenancy under the voucher program, the PHA must prorate the family's assistance as follows:
(i)
Step 1.
Determine gross rent for the unit. (Gross rent is contract rent plus any allowance for tenant paid utilities).
(ii)
Step 2.
Determine total tenant payment in accordance with section 5.613(a). (Annual income includes income of all family members, including any family member who has not established eligible immigration status.)
(iii)
Step 3.
Subtract amount determined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii), (Step 2), from amount determined in paragraph (c)(1)(i), (Step 1).
(iv)
Step 4.
Multiply the amount determined in paragraph (c)(1)(iii), (Step 3) by a fraction for which:
(A) The numerator is the number of family members who have established eligible immigration status; and
(B) The denominator is the total number of family members.
(v)
Prorated housing assistance.
The amount determined in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) (Step 4) is the prorated housing assistance payment for a mixed family.
(vi)
No effect on contract rent.
Proration of the housing assistance payment does not affect contract rent to the owner. The family must pay as rent the portion of contract rent not covered by the prorated housing assistance payment.
(2)
Assistance for a Section 8 voucher tenancy.
For a tenancy under the voucher program, the PHA must prorate the family's assistance as follows:
(i)
Step 1.
Determine the amount of the pre-proration housing assistance payment. (Annual income includes income of all family members, including any family member who has not established eligible immigration status.)
(ii)
Step 2.
Multiply the amount determined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) (Step 1) by a fraction for which:
(A) The numerator is the number of family members who have established eligible immigration status; and
(B) The denominator is the total number of family members.
(iii)
Prorated housing assistance.
The amount determined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) (Step 2) is the prorated housing assistance payment for a mixed family.
(iv)
No effect on rent to owner.
Proration of the housing assistance payment does not affect rent to owner. The family must pay the portion of rent to owner not covered by the prorated housing assistance payment.
(d)
Method of prorating assistance for Public Housing covered programs.
(1) The PHA must prorate the family's assistance;, except as provided in § 960.507 of this title, as follows:
(i)
Step 1.
Determine the total tenant payment in accordance with section 5.628. (Annual income includes income of all family members, including any family member who has not established eligible immigration status.)
(ii)
Step 2.
Subtract the total tenant payment from the PHA-established flat
rent applicable to the unit. The result is the maximum subsidy for which the family could qualify if all members were eligible (“family maximum subsidy”).
(iii)
Step 3.
Divide the family maximum subsidy by the number of persons in the family (all persons) to determine the maximum subsidy per each family member who has citizenship or eligible immigration status (“eligible family member”). The subsidy per eligible family member is the “member maximum subsidy.”
(iv)
Step 4.
Multiply the member maximum subsidy by the number of family members who have citizenship or eligible immigration status (“eligible family members”).
(2) The product of steps 1 through 4 of paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section is the amount of subsidy for which the family is eligible (“eligible subsidy”). The family's rent is the PHA-established flat rent minus the amount of the eligible subsidy.
(e)
Method of prorating assistance when the mixed family's total tenant payment (TTP) is greater than the public housing flat rent.
When the mixed family's TTP is greater than the flat rent, the PHA must use the TTP as the mixed family TTP. The PHA subtracts from the mixed family TTP any established utility allowance, and the sum becomes the mixed family rent.

§ 5.522
Prohibition of assistance to noncitizen students.
(a)
General.
The provisions of §§ 5.516 and 5.518 permitting continued assistance or temporary deferral of termination of assistance for certain families do not apply to any person who is determined to be a noncitizen student as in paragraph (c)(2)(A) of Section 214 (42 U.S.C. 1436a(c)(2)(A)).

(2) Thirty (30) percent of the median income for the area, as determined by HUD, with adjustments for smaller and larger families, except that HUD may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 30 percent of the area median income for the area if HUD finds that such variations are necessary because of unusually high or low family incomes.

Net family assets.
(1) Net family assets is the net cash value of all assets owned by the family, after deducting reasonable costs that would be incurred in disposing real property, savings, stocks, bonds, and other forms of capital investment.
(2) In determining net family assets, PHAs or owners, as applicable, must include the value of any business or family assets disposed of by an applicant or tenant for less than fair market value (including a disposition in trust, but not in a foreclosure or bankruptcy sale) during the two years preceding the date of application for the program or reexamination, as applicable, in excess of the consideration received therefor. In the case of a disposition as part of a separation or divorce settlement, the disposition will not be considered to be for less than fair market value if the applicant or tenant receives consideration not measurable in dollar terms. Negative equity in real property or other investments does not prohibit the owner from selling the property or other investments, so negative equity alone would not justify excluding the property or other investments from family assets.
(3) Excluded from the calculation of net family assets are:
(i) The value of necessary items of personal property;
(ii) The combined value of all non-necessary items of personal property if the combined total value does not exceed $50,000 (which amount will be adjusted by HUD in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers);
(iii) The value of any account under a retirement plan recognized as such by the Internal Revenue Service, including individual retirement arrangements (IRAs), employer retirement plans, and retirement plans for self-employed individuals;
(iv) The value of real property that the family does not have the effective legal authority to sell in the jurisdiction in which the property is located;
(v) Any amounts recovered in any civil action or settlement based on a claim of malpractice, negligence, or other breach of duty owed to a family member arising out of law, that resulted in a family member being a person with a disability;
(vi) The value of any Coverdell education savings account under section 530 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the value of any qualified tuition program under section 529 of such Code, the value of any Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) account authorized under Section 529A of such Code, and the value of any “baby bond” account created, authorized, or funded by Federal, State, or local government.
(vii) Interests in Indian trust land;
(viii) Equity in a manufactured home where the family receives assistance under 24 CFR part 982;
(ix) Equity in property under the Homeownership Option for which a family receives assistance under 24 CFR part 982;
(x) Family Self-Sufficiency Accounts; and
(xi) Federal tax refunds or refundable tax credits for a period of 12 months after receipt by the family.
(4) In cases where a trust fund has been established and the trust is not revocable by, or under the control of, any member of the family or household, the trust fund is not a family asset and the value of the trust is not included in the calculation of net family assets, so long as the fund continues to be held in a trust that is not revocable by, or under the control of, any member of the family or household.
Owner
has the meaning provided in the relevant program regulations. As used in this subpart, where appropriate, the term “owner” shall also include a “borrower” as defined in part 891 of this title.
Responsible entity.
For § 5.611, in addition to the definition of “responsible entity” in § 5.100, “responsible entity” means:
(1) For the Section 202 Supportive Housing Program for the Elderly, the “Owner” as defined in 24 CFR 891.205;

Tenant rent.
The amount payable monthly by the family as rent to the unit owner (Section 8 owner or PHA in public housing). (This term is not used in the Section 8 voucher program.)
Total tenant payment.
See § 5.628.
Utility allowance.
If the cost of utilities (except telephone) and other housing services for an assisted unit is not included in the tenant rent but is the responsibility of the family occupying the unit, an amount equal to the estimate made or approved by a PHA or HUD of the monthly cost of a reasonable consumption of such utilities and other services for the unit by an energy-conservative household of modest circumstances consistent with the requirements of a safe, sanitary, and healthful living environment.
Utility reimbursement.
The amount, if any, by which the utility allowance for a unit, if applicable, exceeds the total tenant payment for the family occupying the unit. (This definition is not used in the Section 8 voucher program, or for a public housing family that is paying a flat rent.)
Very low income family.
A family whose annual income does not exceed 50 percent of the median family income for the area, as determined by HUD with adjustments for smaller and larger families, except that HUD may establish income ceilings higher or lower than 50 percent of the median income for the area if HUD finds that such variations are necessary because of unusually high or low family incomes.
Welfare assistance.
Welfare or other payments to families or individuals, based on need, that are made under programs funded, separately or jointly, by Federal, State or local governments (including assistance provided under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, as that term is defined under the implementing regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services at 45 CFR 260.31).

(ii) If a PHA or owner intends to use the annual income determination made by an administrator for allowable
forms of Federal means-tested public assistance under this paragraph (c)(3), the PHA or owner must obtain it using the appropriate third-party verification. If the appropriate third-party verification is unavailable, or if the family disputes the determination made for purposes of the other form of Federal means-tested public assistance, the PHA or owner must calculate annual income in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart F. The verification must indicate the tenant's family size and composition and state the amount of the family's annual income. The verification must also meet all HUD requirements related to the length of time that is permitted before the third-party verification is considered out-of-date and is no longer an eligible source of income verification.
(4)
De minimis errors.
The PHA or owner will not be considered out of compliance with the requirements in this paragraph (c) solely due to de minimis errors in calculating family income. A de minimis error is an error where the PHA or owner determination of family income deviates from the correct income determination by no more than $30 per month in monthly adjusted income ($360 in annual adjusted income) per family.
(i) The PHA or owner must still take any corrective action necessary to credit or repay a family if the family has been overcharged for their rent or family share as a result of the de minimis error in the income determination, but families will not be required to repay the PHA or owner in instances where a PHA or owner has miscalculated income resulting in a family being undercharged for rent or family share.
(ii) HUD may revise the amount of de minimis error in this paragraph (c)(4) through a rulemaking published in the
Federal Register
for public comment.

(ii) Unreimbursed reasonable attendant care and auxiliary apparatus expenses for each member of the family who is a person with a disability, to the extent necessary to enable any member of the family (including the member who is a person with a disability) to be employed. This deduction may not exceed the combined earned income received by family members who are 18 years of age or older and who are able to work because of such attendant care or auxiliary apparatus; and
(4) Any reasonable child care expenses necessary to enable a member of the family to be employed or to further his or her education.
(b)
Additional deductions.
(1) For public housing, the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) and the Section 8 moderate rehabilitation programs (including the moderate rehabilitation Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) program), a PHA may adopt additional deductions from annual income.
(i)
Public housing.
A PHA that adopts such deductions will not be eligible for an increase in Capital Fund and Operating Fund formula grants based on the application of such deductions. The PHA must establish a written policy for such deductions.
(ii)
HCV, moderate rehabilitation, and moderate rehabilitation Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) programs.
A PHA that adopts such deductions must have sufficient funding to cover the increased housing assistance payment cost of the deductions. A PHA will not be eligible for an increase in HCV renewal funding
or moderate rehabilitation program funding for subsidy costs resulting from such deductions. For the HCV program, the PHA must include such deductions in its administrative plan. For moderate rehabilitation, the PHA must establish a written policy for such deductions.
(2) For the HUD programs listed in § 5.601(d), the responsible entity must calculate such other deductions as required and permitted by the applicable program regulations.
(c)
Financial hardship exemption for unreimbursed health and medical care expenses and reasonable attendant care and auxiliary apparatus expenses.
(1)
Phased-in relief.
This paragraph provides financial hardship relief for families affected by the statutory increase in the threshold to receive health and medical care expense and reasonable attendant care and auxiliary apparatus expense deductions from annual income.
(i)
Eligibility for relief.
To receive hardship relief under this paragraph (c)(1), the family must have received a deduction from annual income because their sum of expenses under paragraph (a)(3) of this section exceeded 3 percent of annual income as of January 1, 2024.
(ii)
Form of relief.
(A) The family will receive a deduction totaling the sum of the expenses under paragraph (a)(3) of this section that exceed 5 percent of annual income.
(B) Twelve months after the relief in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) is provided, the family must receive a deduction totaling the sum of expenses under paragraph (a)(3) of this section that exceed 7.5 percent of annual income.
(C) Twenty-four months after the relief in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) is provided, the family must receive a deduction totaling the sum of expenses under paragraph (a)(3) of this section that exceed ten percent of annual income and the only remaining relief that may be available to the family will be paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(D) A family may request hardship relief under paragraph (c)(2) of this section prior to the end of the twenty-four-month transition period. If a family making such a request is determined eligible for hardship relief under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, hardship relief under this paragraph ends and the family's hardship relief shall be administered in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Once a family chooses to obtain relief under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a family may no longer receive relief under this paragraph.
(2)
General.
This paragraph (c)(2) provides financial relief for an elderly or disabled family or a family that includes a person with disabilities that is experiencing a financial hardship.
(i)
Eligibility for relief.
(A) To receive hardship relief under this paragraph (c)(2), a family must demonstrate that the family's applicable health and medical care expenses or reasonable attendant care and auxiliary apparatus expenses increased or the family's financial hardship is a result of a change in circumstances (as defined by the responsible entity) that would not otherwise trigger an interim reexamination.
(B) Relief under this paragraph (c)(2) is available regardless of whether the family previously received deductions under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, is currently receiving relief under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or previously received relief under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Form and duration of relief.
(A) The family will receive a deduction for the sum of the eligible expenses in paragraph (a)(3) of this section that exceed 5 percent of annual income.
(B) The family's hardship relief ends when the circumstances that made the family eligible for the relief are no longer applicable or after 90 days, whichever comes earlier. However, responsible entities may, at their discretion, extend the relief for one or more additional 90-day periods while the family's hardship condition continues.
(d)
Exemption to continue child care expense deduction.
A family whose eligibility for the child care expense deduction is ending may request a financial hardship exemption to continue the child care expense deduction under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The responsible entity must recalculate the family's adjusted income and continue the child care deduction if the family demonstrates to the responsible entity's satisfaction that the family is unable to pay their rent because of loss of
the child care expense deduction, and the child care expense is still necessary even though the family member is no longer employed or furthering his or her education. The hardship exemption and the resulting alternative adjusted income calculation must remain in place for a period of up to 90 days. Responsible entities, at their discretion, may extend such hardship exemptions for additional 90-day periods based on family circumstances.
(e)
Hardship policy requirements.
(1)
Responsible entity determination of family's inability to pay the rent.
The responsible entity must establish a policy on how it defines what constitutes a hardship under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, which includes determining the family's inability to pay the rent, for purposes of determining eligibility for a hardship exemption under paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Family notification.
The responsible entity must promptly notify the family in writing of the change in the determination of adjusted income and the family's rent resulting from the hardship exemption. The notice must also inform the family of when the hardship exemption will begin and expire (
i.e.,
the time periods specified under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section or within 90 days or at such time as the responsibility entity determines the exemption is no longer necessary in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(B) or (d) of this section).

§ 5.615
Public housing program and Section 8 tenant-based assistance program: How welfare benefit reduction affects family income.
(a)
Applicability.
This section applies to covered families who reside in public housing (part 960 of this title) or receive Section 8 tenant-based assistance (part 982 of this title).
(b)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:
Covered families.
Families who receive welfare assistance or other public assistance benefits (“welfare benefits”) from a State or other public agency (“welfare agency”) under a program for which Federal, State, or local law requires that a member of the family must participate in an economic self-sufficiency program as a condition for such assistance.
Economic self-sufficiency program.
See definition at § 5.603.
Imputed welfare income.
The amount of annual income not actually received
by a family, as a result of a specified welfare benefit reduction, that is nonetheless included in the family's annual income for purposes of determining rent.
Specified welfare benefit reduction.
(1) A reduction of welfare benefits by the welfare agency, in whole or in part, for a family member, as determined by the welfare agency, because of fraud by a family member in connection with the welfare program; or because of welfare agency sanction against a family member for noncompliance with a welfare agency requirement to participate in an economic self-sufficiency program.
(2) “Specified welfare benefit reduction” does not include a reduction or termination of welfare benefits by the welfare agency:
(i) at expiration of a lifetime or other time limit on the payment of welfare benefits;
(ii) because a family member is not able to obtain employment, even though the family member has complied with welfare agency economic self-sufficiency or work activities requirements; or
(iii) because a family member has not complied with other welfare agency requirements.
(c)
Imputed welfare income.
(1) A family's annual income includes the amount of imputed welfare income (because of a specified welfare benefits reduction, as specified in notice to the PHA by the welfare agency), plus the total amount of other annual income as determined in accordance with § 5.609.
(2) At the request of the PHA, the welfare agency will inform the PHA in writing of the amount and term of any specified welfare benefit reduction for a family member, and the reason for such reduction, and will also inform the PHA of any subsequent changes in the term or amount of such specified welfare benefit reduction. The PHA will use this information to determine the amount of imputed welfare income for a family.
(3) A family's annual income includes imputed welfare income in family annual income, as determined at the PHA's interim or regular reexamination of family income and composition, during the term of the welfare benefits reduction (as specified in information provided to the PHA by the welfare agency).
(4) The amount of the imputed welfare income is offset by the amount of additional income a family receives that commences after the time the sanction was imposed. When such additional income from other sources is at least equal to the imputed welfare income, the imputed welfare income is reduced to zero.
(5) The PHA may not include imputed welfare income in annual income if the family was not an assisted resident at the time of sanction.
(d)
Review of PHA decision
—(1)
Public housing.
If a public housing tenant claims that the PHA has not correctly calculated the amount of imputed welfare income in accordance with HUD requirements, and if the PHA denies the family's request to modify such amount, the PHA shall give the tenant written notice of such denial, with a brief explanation of the basis for the PHA determination of the amount of imputed welfare income. The PHA notice shall also state that if the tenant does not agree with the PHA determination, the tenant may request a grievance hearing in accordance with part 966, subpart B of this title to review the PHA determination. The tenant is not required to pay an escrow deposit pursuant to § 966.55(e) for the portion of tenant rent attributable to the imputed welfare income in order to obtain a grievance hearing on the PHA determination.
(2)
Section 8 participant.
A participant in the Section 8 tenant-based assistance program may request an informal hearing, in accordance with § 982.555 of this title, to review the PHA determination of the amount of imputed welfare income that must be included in the family's annual income in accordance with this section. If the family claims that such amount is not correctly calculated in accordance with HUD requirements, and if the PHA denies the family's request to modify such amount, the PHA shall give the family written notice of such denial, with a brief explanation of the basis for the PHA determination of the amount of imputed welfare income. Such notice
shall also state that if the family does not agree with the PHA determination, the family may request an informal hearing on the determination under the PHA hearing procedure.
(e)
PHA relation with welfare agency.
(1) The PHA must ask welfare agencies to inform the PHA of any specified welfare benefits reduction for a family member, the reason for such reduction, the term of any such reduction, and any subsequent welfare agency determination affecting the amount or term of a specified welfare benefits reduction. If the welfare agency determines a specified welfare benefits reduction for a family member, and gives the PHA written notice of such reduction, the family's annual incomes shall include the imputed welfare income because of the specified welfare benefits reduction.
(2) The PHA is responsible for determining the amount of imputed welfare income that is included in the family's annual income as a result of a specified welfare benefits reduction as determined by the welfare agency, and specified in the notice by the welfare agency to the PHA. However, the PHA is not responsible for determining whether a reduction of welfare benefits by the welfare agency was correctly determined by the welfare agency in accordance with welfare program requirements and procedures, nor for providing the opportunity for review or hearing on such welfare agency determinations.
(3) Such welfare agency determinations are the responsibility of the welfare agency, and the family may seek appeal of such determinations through the welfare agency's normal due process procedures. The PHA shall be entitled to rely on the welfare agency notice to the PHA of the welfare agency's determination of a specified welfare benefits reduction.

§ 5.618
Restriction on assistance to families based on assets.
(a)
Restrictions based on net assets and property ownership.
(1) A dwelling unit in the public housing program may not be rented, and assistance under the Section 8 (tenant-based and project-based) programs may not be provided, either initially or upon reexamination of family income, to any family if:
(i) The family's net assets (as defined in § 5.603) exceed $100,000, which amount will be adjusted annually by HUD in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers; or
(ii) The family has a present ownership interest in, a legal right to reside in, and the effective legal authority to sell, based on State or local laws of the jurisdiction where the property is located, real property that is suitable for occupancy by the family as a residence, except this real property restriction does not apply to:
(A) Any property for which the family is receiving assistance under 24 CFR 982.620; or under the Homeownership Option in 24 CFR part 982;
(B) Any property that is jointly owned by a member of the family and at least one non-household member who does not live with the family, if the non-household member resides at the jointly owned property;
(C) Any person who is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as defined in this part 5 (subpart L); or
(D) Any family that is offering such property for sale.
(2) A property will be considered “suitable for occupancy” under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section unless the family demonstrates that it:
(i) Does not meet the disability-related needs for all members of the family (
e.g.,
physical accessibility requirements, disability-related need for additional bedrooms, proximity to accessible transportation, etc.);
(ii) Is not sufficient for the size of the family;
(iii) Is geographically located so as to be a hardship for the family (
e.g.,
the distance or commuting time between the property and the family's place of work or school would be a hardship to the family, as determined by the PHA or owner);
(iv) Is not safe to reside in because of the physical condition of the property (
e.g.,
property's physical condition poses a risk to the family's health and safety and the condition of the property cannot be easily remedied); or
(v) Is not a property that a family may reside in under the State or local laws of the jurisdiction where the property is located.
(b)
Acceptable documentation; confidentiality.
(1) A PHA or owner may determine the net assets of a family based on a certification by the family that the net family assets (as defined in § 5.603) do not exceed $50,000, which amount will be adjusted annually in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, without taking additional steps to verify the accuracy of the declaration. The declaration must state the amount of income the family expects to receive from such assets; this amount must be included in the family's income.
(2) A PHA or owner may determine compliance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section based on a certification by a family that certifies that such family does not have any present ownership interest in any real property at the time of the income determination or review.
(3) When a family asks for or about an exception to the real property restriction because a family member is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, the PHA or owner must comply with the confidentiality requirements under § 5.2007. The PHA or owner must accept a self-certification from the family member, and the restrictions on requesting documentation under § 5.2007 apply.
(c)
Enforcement.
(1) When recertifying the income of a family that is subject to the restrictions in paragraph (a) of this section, a PHA or owner may choose not to enforce such restrictions, or alternatively, may establish exceptions to the restrictions based on eligibility criteria.
(2) The PHA or owner may choose not to enforce the restrictions in paragraph (a) of this section or establish exceptions to such restrictions only pursuant to a policy adopted by the PHA or owner.
(3) Eligibility criteria for establishing exceptions may provide for separate treatment based on family type and may be based on different factors, such as age, disability, income, the ability of the family to find suitable alternative housing, and whether supportive services are being provided. Such policies must be in conformance with all applicable fair housing statutes and regulations, as discussed in this part 5.
(d)
Delay of eviction or termination of assistance.
The PHA or owner may delay for a period of not more than 6 months the initiation of eviction or termination proceedings of a family based on noncompliance under this provision unless it conflicts with other provisions of law.

(ii)
All section 8 programs.

In the event a family leaves the program in advance of its next quarterly reimbursement, the responsible entity must reimburse the family for a prorated share of the applicable reimbursement. PHAs and owners exercising this option must have a hardship policy in place for tenants.
(2) In the public housing program (where the family is paying an income-based rent), the Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program and the Section 8 voucher program, the PHA may pay the utility reimbursement either to the family or directly to the utility supplier to pay the utility bill on behalf of the family. If the PHA elects to pay the utility supplier, the PHA must notify the family of the amount paid to the utility supplier.
(3) In the other Section 8 programs, the owner must pay the utility reimbursement either:
(i) To the family, or
(ii) With consent of the family, to the utility supplier to pay the utility bill on behalf of the family.

# Section 8 Project-Based Assistance: Occupancy Requirements
§ 5.653
Section 8 project-based assistance programs: Admission—Income-eligibility and income-targeting.
(a)
Applicability.
This section describes requirements concerning income-eligibility and income-targeting that apply to the Section 8 project-based assistance programs, except for the moderate rehabilitation and the project-based voucher programs.
(b)
Who is eligible?
—(1)
Basic eligibility.
An applicant must meet all eligibility requirements in order to receive housing assistance. At a minimum, the applicant must be a family, as defined in § 5.403, and must be income-eligible, as described in this section. Such eligible applicants include single persons.
(2)
Low income limit.
No family other than a low income family is eligible for admission to the Section 8 project-based assistance programs. (This paragraph (b) does not apply to the Section 8 project-based voucher program under part 983 of this title.)
(c)
Targeting to extremely low income families.
For each project assisted under a contract for project-based assistance, of the dwelling units that become available for occupancy in any fiscal year that are assisted under the contract, not less than 40 percent shall be available for leasing only by families that are extremely low income families at the time of admission.
(d)
Limitation on admission of non-very low income families
—(1)
Admission to units available before October 1, 1981.
Not more than 25 percent of the Section 8 project-based dwelling units that were available for occupancy under Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Contracts effective before October 1, 1981 and that are leased on or after that date shall be available for leasing by low income families other than very low income families. HUD reserves the right to limit the admission of low income families other than very low income families to these units.
(2)
Admission to units available on or after October 1, 1981.
Not more than 15 percent of the Section 8 project-based dwelling units that initially become available for occupancy under Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Contracts on or after October 1, 1981 shall be available for leasing by low income families other than families that are very low income families at the time of admission to the Section 8 program. Except with the prior approval of HUD under paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section, the owner may only lease such units to very low income families.
(3)
Request for exception.
A request by an owner for approval of admission of low income families other than very low income families to section 8 project-based units must state the basis for requesting the exception and provide supporting data. Bases for exceptions that may be considered include the following:
(i) Need for admission of a broader range of tenants to preserve the financial or management viability of a project because there is an insufficient number of potential applicants who are very low income families;
(ii) Commitment of an owner to attaining occupancy by families with a broad range of incomes;
(iii) Project supervision by a State Housing Finance Agency having a policy of occupancy by families with a broad range of incomes supported by evidence that the Agency is pursuing this goal throughout its assisted projects in the community, or a project with financing through Section 11(b) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437i) or under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 103); and
(iv) Low-income families that otherwise would be displaced from a Section 8 project.
(4)
Action on request for exception.
Whether to grant any request for exception is a matter committed by law to HUD's discretion, and no implication is intended to be created that HUD will seek to grant approvals up to the maximum limits permitted by statute, nor is any presumption of an entitlement to an exception created by the specification of certain grounds for exception that HUD may consider. HUD will review exceptions granted to owners at regular intervals. HUD may withdraw permission to exercise those exceptions for program applicants at any time that exceptions are not being
used or after a periodic review, based on the findings of the review.
(e)
Income used for eligibility and targeting.
Family annual income (see § 5.609) is used both for determination of income-eligibility and for income-targeting under this section.
(f)
Reporting.
The Section 8 owner must comply with HUD-prescribed reporting requirements, including income reporting requirements that will permit HUD to maintain the data necessary to monitor compliance with income-eligibility and income-targeting requirements.
[65 FR 16719, Mar. 29, 2000, as amended at 89 FR 38290, May 7, 2024]

(a)
Applicability.
This section applies to the section 8 project-based assistance programs. The section describes requirements concerning the Section 8 owner's selection of residents to occupy a project or unit, except for the moderate rehabilitation and the project-based voucher programs.
(b)
Selection
—(1)
Selection for owner's project or unit.
Selection for occupancy of a project or unit is the function of the Section 8 owner. However, selection is subject to the income-eligibility and income-targeting requirements in § 5.653.
(2)
Tenant selection plan.
The owner must adopt a written tenant selection plan in accordance with HUD requirements.
(3)
Amount of income.
The owner may not select a family for occupancy of a project or unit in an order different from the order on the owner's waiting list for the purpose of selecting a relatively higher income family. However, an owner may select a family for occupancy of a project or unit based on its income in order to satisfy the targeting requirements of § 5.653(c).
(4)
Selection for particular unit.
In selecting a family to occupy a particular unit, the owner may match family characteristics with the type of unit available, for example, number of bedrooms. If a unit has special accessibility features for persons with disabilities, the owner must first offer the unit to families which include persons with disabilities who require such features (see §§ 8.27 and 100.202 of this title).
(5)
Housing assistance limitation for single persons.
A single person who is not an elderly or displaced person, a person with disabilities, or the remaining member of a resident family may not be provided a housing unit with two or more bedrooms.
(c)
Particular owner preferences.
The owner must inform all applicants about available preferences and must give applicants an opportunity to show that they qualify for available preferences.
(1)
Residency requirements or preferences.
(i) Residency requirements are prohibited. Although the owner is not prohibited from adopting a residency preference, the owner may only adopt or implement residency preferences in accordance with non-discrimination and equal opportunity requirements listed at § 5.105(a).
(ii) A residency preference is a preference for admission of persons who reside in a specified geographic area (“residency preference area”).
(iii) An owner's residency preference must be approved by HUD in one of the following methods:
(A) Prior approval of the housing market area in the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing plan (in accordance with § 108.25 of this title) as a residency preference area;
(B) Prior approval of the residency preference area in the PHA plan of the jurisdiction in which the project is located;
(C) Modification of the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, in accordance with § 108.25 of this title,
(iv) Use of a residency preference may not have the purpose or effect of delaying or otherwise denying admission to a project or unit based on the race, color, ethnic origin, gender, religion, disability, or age of any member of an applicant family.
(v) A residency preference must not be based on how long an applicant has resided or worked in a residency preference area.
(vi) Applicants who are working or who have been notified that they are hired to work in a residency preference area must be treated as residents of the residency preference area. The owner
may treat graduates of, or active participants in, education and training programs in a residency preference area as residents of the residency preference area if the education or training program is designed to prepare individuals for the job market.
(2)
Preference for working families.
(i) The owner may adopt a preference for admission of working families (families where the head, spouse or sole member is employed). However, an applicant shall be given the benefit of the working family preference if the head and spouse, or sole member, is age 62 or older, or is a person with disabilities.
(ii) If the owner adopts a preference for admission of working families, the owner must not give a preference based on the amount of earned income.
(3)
Preference for person with disabilities.
The owner may adopt a preference for admission of families that include a person with disabilities. However, the owner may not adopt a preference for admission of persons with a specific disability.
(4)
Preference for victims of domestic violence.
The owner should consider whether to adopt a preference for admission of families that include victims of domestic violence.
(5)
Preference for single persons who are elderly, displaced, homeless or persons with disabilities over other single persons.
The owner may adopt a preference for admission of single persons who are age 62 or older, displaced, homeless, or persons with disabilities over other single persons.

§ 5.657
Section 8 project-based assistance programs: Reexamination of family income and composition.
(a)
Applicability.
This section states requirements for reexamination of family income and composition in the Section 8 project-based assistance programs, except for the moderate rehabilitation and the project-based voucher programs.
(b)
Regular reexamination.
The owner must conduct a reexamination and redetermination of family income and composition at least annually.
(c)
Interim reexaminations.
(1)
Generally.
A family may request an interim reexamination of family income because of any changes since the last examination. The owner must conduct any interim reexamination within a reasonable time after the family request or when the owner becomes aware of an increase in family adjusted income under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. What qualifies as a “reasonable time” may vary based on the amount of time it takes to verify information, but such time generally should not exceed 30 days from the date a family reports changes in income to an owner.
(2)
Decreases in the family's annual adjusted income.
The owner may decline to conduct an interim reexamination of family income if the owner estimates that the family's adjusted income will decrease by an amount that is less than ten percent of the family's annual adjusted income (or a lower amount established by HUD through notice), or such lower threshold established by the owner.
(3)
Increases in the family's annual adjusted income.
The owner must conduct an interim reexamination of family income when the owner becomes aware that the family's adjusted income (as defined in § 5.611) has changed by an amount that the owner estimates will result in an increase of ten percent or more in annual adjusted income or such other amount established by HUD through notice, except:
(i) The owner may not consider any increase in the earned income of the family when estimating or calculating whether the family's adjusted income has increased, unless the family has previously received an interim reduction under paragraph (c)(1) of this section during the certification period; and
(ii) The owner may choose not to conduct an interim reexamination in the last three months of a certification period.
(4)
Policies on reporting changes in family income or composition.
The owner must adopt policies consistent with this paragraph (c), prescribing when and under what conditions the family must report a change in family income or composition.
(5)
Effective date of rent changes.
(i) If the family has reported a change in
family income or composition in a timely manner according to the owner's policies, the owner must provide the family with 30 days advance notice of any rent increase, and such rent increase will be effective the first day of the month beginning after the end of that 30-day notice period. Rent decreases will be effective on the first day of the first month after the date of the actual change leading to the interim reexamination of family income.
(ii) If the family has failed to report a change in family income or composition in a timely manner according to the owner's policies, owners must implement any resulting rent increases retroactively to the first of the month following the date of the change leading to the interim reexamination of family income. Any resulting rent decrease must be implemented no later than the first rent period following completion of the reexamination. However, rent decreases may be applied retroactively at the discretion of the owner, in accordance with the owner's conditions as established in written policy, and subject to paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section.
(iii) A retroactive rent decrease may not be applied by the owner prior to the later of the first of the month following:
(A) The date of the change leading to the interim reexamination of family income; or
(B) The effective date of the family's most recent previous interim or annual reexamination (or initial examination if that was the family's last examination).
(d)
Streamlined income determination
—(1)
General.
An owner may elect to apply a streamlined income determination to families receiving fixed income as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(2)
Definition of “fixed income”.
For purposes of this section, “fixed income” means periodic payments at reasonably predictable levels from one or more of the following sources:
(i) Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Supplemental Disability Insurance.
(ii) Federal, state, local, or private pension plans.
(iii) Annuities or other retirement benefit programs, insurance policies, disability or death benefits, or other similar types of periodic receipts.
(iv) Any other source of income subject to adjustment by a verifiable COLA or current rate of interest.
(3)
Method of streamlined income determination.
Owners using the streamlined income determination must adjust a family's income according to the percentage of a family's unadjusted income that is from fixed income.
(i) When 90 percent or more of a family's unadjusted income consists of fixed income, owners using streamlined income determinations must apply a COLA or COLAs to the family's fixed-income sources, provided that the family certifies both that 90 percent or more of their unadjusted income is fixed income and that their sources of fixed income have not changed from the previous year. For non-fixed income, owners are not required to make adjustments pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii) When less than 90 percent of a family's unadjusted income consists of fixed income, owners using streamlined income determinations must apply a COLA to each of the family's sources of fixed income. Owners must determine all other income pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
(4)
COLA rate applied by owners.
Owners using streamlined income determinations must adjust a family's fixed income using a COLA or current interest rate that applies to each specific source of fixed income and is available from a public source or through tenant-provided, third-party-generated documentation. If no public verification or tenant-provided documentation is available, then the owner must obtain third-party verification of the income amounts in order to calculate the change in income for the source.
(5)
Triennial verification.
For any income determined pursuant to a streamlined income determination, an owner must obtain third-party verification of all income amounts every 3 years.
(e)
Other applicable requirements.
Reviews of family income under this section are subject to the provisions in Section 904 of the Stewart B. McKinney
Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3544), and any applicable privacy rules in subpart B of this part.
(f)
De minimis errors.
The owner will not be considered out of compliance with the requirements in this section due solely to de minimis errors in calculating family income but is still obligated to correct errors once the owner becomes aware of the errors. A de minimis error is an error where the owner determination of family income varies from the correct income determination by no more than $30 per month in monthly adjusted income ($360 in annual adjusted income) per family.
(1) The owner must take any corrective action necessary to credit or repay a family if the family has been overcharged for their rent as a result of the de minimis error in the income determination. Families will not be required to repay the owner in instances where the owner has miscalculated income resulting in a family being undercharged for rent or family share.
(2) HUD may revise the amount of de minimis error in this paragraph (f) through a rulemaking published in the
Federal Register
for public comment.

(ii) Family execution and submission of consent forms for obtaining wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies (SWICAs).
(4) Any information supplied by the family must be true and complete.
(c)
Family release and consent.
(1) As a condition of admission to or continued occupancy of a unit with Section 8 assistance, the owner must require the family head, and such other family members as the owner designates, to execute a HUD-approved release and consent form (including any release and consent as required under § 5.230 of this title) authorizing any depository or private source of income, or any Federal, State or local agency, to furnish or release to the owner or HUD such information as the owner or HUD determines to be necessary.
(2) The use or disclosure of information obtained from a family or from another source pursuant to this release and consent shall be limited to purposes directly connected with administration of the Section 8 program.
(d)
Owner responsibility for verification.
Except as allowed under paragraph (e), the owner must obtain and document in the family file third party verification of the following factors, or must document in the file why third party verification was not available:
(1) Reported family annual income;
(2) The value of assets;
(3) Expenses related to deductions from annual income; and
(4) Other factors that affect the determination of adjusted income.
(e)
Verification of assets.
For a family with net family assets (as the term is defined in § 5.603) equal to or less than $50,000, which amount will be adjusted annually by HUD in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, an owner may accept, for purposes of recertification of income, a family's declaration under § 5.618(b), except that
the owner must obtain third-party verification of all family assets every 3 years.

(2) The owner's application must include the following information:
(i) A description of criminal activities in the project and the surrounding community, and the effect of criminal activity on the security of project residents.
(ii) Qualifications of security personnel who will reside in the project, and the period of residence by such personnel. How owner proposes to check backgrounds and qualifications of any security personnel who will reside in the project.
(iii) Full disclosure of any family relationship between the owner and any security personnel. For this purpose, “owner” includes a principal or other interested party.
(iv) How residence by security personnel in a project unit will increase security for Section 8 assisted families residing in the project.

The owner shall bear the risk of collecting such rent from such security personnel,
and the amount of the housing assistance payment shall not be increased because of non-payment by such security personnel. The owner shall not be entitled to receive any vacancy payment for the period following occupancy by such security personnel.
(2) In approving the amount of monthly rent payable by security personnel for occupancy of a contract unit, the contract administrator may consider whether security services to be performed are an adequate return for housing assistance payments on the unit, or whether the cost of security services should be borne by the owner from other project income.

(4) The unit must have a living room and a kitchen area with a sink, cooking appliance, refrigerator, food preparation area, and food storage area;
(5) For units assisted under the HCV or PBV program, the unit must have at least one bedroom or living/sleeping room for each two persons;
(6) Except for units subject to this subpart only through § 5.701(a)(6) or (7), or housing otherwise exempt from this requirement as provided elsewhere in this title, the unit must meet or exceed the carbon monoxide detection standards set by HUD through
Federal Register
notification;
(7) The unit must have two working outlets or one working outlet and a permanent light within all habitable rooms;
(8) Outlets within 6 feet of a water source must be GFCI protected:
(9) For climate zones designated by the Secretary through notice, the unit must have a permanently installed heating source. No units may contain unvented space heaters that burn gas, oil, or kerosene;
(10) The unit must have a guardrail when there is an elevated walking surface with a drop off of 30 inches or greater measured vertically; and
(11) The unit must have a permanently mounted light fixture in the kitchen and each bathroom.
(e)
Health and safety concerns
—(1)
General.
The inside, outside and unit must be free of health and safety hazards that pose a danger to residents. Types of health and safety concerns include, but are not limited to carbon monoxide, electrical hazards, extreme temperature, flammable materials or other fire hazards, garbage and debris, handrail hazards, infestation, lead-based paint, mold, and structural soundness.
(2)
Lead-based paint.
HUD housing must comply with all requirements related to the evaluation and control of lead-based paint hazards and have available proper documentation of such (
see
24 CFR part 35). The Lead-based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846), the Residential Lead-based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), and the applicable regulations at 24 CFR part 35 apply.
(f)
Compliance with State and local codes.
(1) The standards for the condition of HUD housing in this section do not supersede State and local housing codes (such as fire, mechanical, plumbing, carbon monoxide, property maintenance, or residential code requirements).
(2) All HUD housing other than units assisted under the HCV and PBV programs must comply with State or local housing codes in order to comply with this subpart.
(3) State and local code compliance is not part of the determination of whether a unit passes the standards for the
condition of HUD housing under this section for the HCV and PBV programs (except in accordance with § 5.705(a)(3)).
(g)
Use of an alternative inspection or additional standard for HCV and PBV programs.
A PHA is not subject to the standards set by this section when the PHA is relying on an alternative inspection in accordance with 24 CFR 982.406. PHAs may also elect to establish additional requirements for quality, architecture, or design of PBV housing, and any such additional requirements must be specified in the Agreement to enter into a HAP Contract or HAP Contract as provided in 24 CFR part 983.
(h)
Special housing types in the HCV, PBV and Moderate Rehabilitation programs.
Part 982, subpart M, of this title identifies special housing types which require standards unique to special types of housing. Unless modified by program-specific regulations, NSPIRE Standards will apply for these special housing types.
§ 5.705
Inspection requirements.
(a)
Procedures
—(1)
General.
Any entity responsible for conducting an inspection of HUD housing to determine compliance with this subpart, must inspect and score such HUD housing in accordance with the standards and procedures for identifying safe, habitable housing set out by the Secretary and published in the
Federal Register
as described in § 5.711. The entity conducting the inspection shall identify each deficiency as “Life Threatening”, “Severe,” “Moderate”, or “Low.”
(2)
Inspection scope.
The inspection requirement for HUD housing generally requires the inside, outside and unit to be inspected, in accordance with § 5.703. The inspection requirement for the tenant-based HCV program and the unit inspection for the PBV and Moderate Rehabilitation programs only applies to units occupied or to be occupied by HCV, PBV, and Moderate Rehabilitation participants, and common areas and exterior areas which either service or are associated with such units.
(3)
HCV and PBV variant inspection standards.
(i) HUD may approve inspection criteria variations for the following purposes:
(A) Variations which apply standards in local housing codes or other codes adopted by the PHA; or
(B) Variations because of local climatic or geographic conditions.
(ii) Acceptability criteria variations may only be approved by HUD pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section if such variations either:
(A) Meet or exceed the performance requirements; or
(B) Significantly expand affordable housing opportunities for families assisted under the program.
(iii) HUD will not approve any inspection criteria variation if HUD believes that such variation is likely to adversely affect the health or safety of participant families, or severely restrict housing choice.
(iv) Approved variations must be added to the Administrative Plan as described in 24 CFR 982.54(d)(21).
(b)
Entity conducting inspections.
HUD housing must be inspected by the appropriate entity as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(1)
General.
The owner, lender, contract administrator, or HUD is the entity responsible for performing inspections of HUD housing as provided in this title, or a regulatory agreement or contract. For properties with more than one HUD-insured loan, only the first mortgage lender is required to conduct the inspection. The second mortgage lender will be provided a copy of the physical inspection report by the first mortgage lender.
(2)
Exception.
Under the HCV and PBV programs, the Public Housing Agency is responsible for inspecting HUD housing under those programs, unless another entity is assigned the inspection by the program regulations governing the housing, regulatory agreements or contracts. A PHA-owned unit receiving assistance under section 8(o) of the 1937 act must be inspected by an independent entity as specified in 24 CFR parts 982 and 983. Under the Moderate Rehabilitation program, the PHA is responsible for inspecting the HUD housing unless the PHA is managing units on which it is also administering the HAP Contract in accordance with 24 CFR 882.412, in which case
HUD is responsible for the inspections in accordance with 24 CFR 882.516(d).
(c)
Timing of inspections
—(1)
Generally.
A property must be inspected before the property is approved for participation in any of the HUD housing programs under this part unless there is a program specific exception to this requirement. An entity responsible for conducting an inspection of HUD housing to determine compliance with this subpart must inspect such housing annually unless specified otherwise below. An inspection shall be conducted no earlier than 3 months before and no later than 3 months after the date marking the anniversary of the previous inspection, except that inspections due on or before July 1, 2024, shall be conducted no earlier than 6 months before and no later than 6 months after the date marking the anniversary of the previous inspection. HUD may approve requests by an owner or PHA for extensions of the deadline for an inspection for good cause as determined by HUD and HUD may extend inspection deadlines without owner request, as deemed necessary by the Secretary.
(2)
Extended inspection cycle.
HUD housing, except as specified below, shall be scored and ranked in accordance with the methodology provided through
Federal Register
notification.
(i)
Standard 1 performing property.
If a property receives a score of 90 points or higher on its physical condition inspection, the property will be designated a standard 1 performing property. Properties designated as standard 1 performing properties will be required to undergo a physical inspection once every three (3) years.
(ii)
Standard 2 performing property.
If a property receives a score of 80 points or higher but less than 90 on its physical condition inspection, the property will be designated a standard 2 performing property. Properties designated as standard 2 performing properties will be required to undergo a physical inspection once every two (2) years.
(iii)
Standard 3 performing property.
If a property receives a score of less than 80 points, the property will be designated a standard 3 performing property. Properties designated as standard 3 performing properties will continue to undergo an annual physical inspection as currently required under covered HUD programs.
(3)
Triennial cycle for small rural PHAs.
Small rural PHAs as defined in 24 CFR 902.101 shall be assessed in accordance with part 902, subpart H of this title.
(4)
Triennial cycle for small PHAs.
Small PHAs as defined in 24 CFR 902.13(a) shall be assessed in accordance with 24 CFR 902.13(a).
(5)
Housing choice vouchers.
PHAs must inspect units subject to part 982 of this title in accordance with the frequency described in 24 CFR 982.405.
(6)
Project based vouchers.
PHAs must inspect units subject to 24 CFR part 983 in accordance with the frequency described in 24 CFR 983.103.
(7)
FHA insured mortgages section 232 facilities.
HUD may exempt assisted-living facilities, board and care facilities, and intermediate care facilities from physical inspections under this part if HUD determines that the State or local government has a reliable and adequate inspection system in place, with the results of the inspection being readily and timely available to HUD. For any other section 232 facilities, the inspection will be conducted only when and if HUD determines, on the basis of information received, such as through a complaint, site inspection, or referral by a State agency, on a case-by-case basis, that inspection of a particular facility is needed to assure protection of the residents or the adequate preservation of the project.
(8)
Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program.
PHAs must inspect units subject to the Moderate Rehabilitation program under 24 CFR part 882 in accordance with the frequency described in 24 CFR 882.516.
(d)
Inspection costs.
The cost of an inspection shall be the responsibility of the entity responsible for the inspection as identified in paragraph (a) of this section, except that a reasonable fee may be required of the owner of a property for a reinspection if an owner notifies the entity responsible for the inspection that a repair has been made or the allotted time for repairs has elapsed and a reinspection reveals that any deficiency cited in the previous inspection that the owner is responsible
for repairing was not corrected. No fee may be passed along to the household residing in the unit or units.
(e)
Access to property for inspection.
Nothing in this subpart shall restrict the right of HUD, or an entity contracted by HUD, to inspect a property. All owners and PHAs are required to provide HUD or its representative with full and free access to all HUD-assisted properties. All owners and PHAs are required to provide HUD or its representative with access to all units and appurtenances in order to permit physical inspections, monitoring reviews, and quality assurance reviews under this part. Access to the units shall be provided whether or not the resident is home or has installed additional locks for which the owner or PHA did not obtain keys. In the event that an owner or PHA fails to provide access as required by HUD or its representative, the owner or PHA shall be given a physical condition score of zero for the project or projects involved. A score of zero for an owner or PHA shall be used to calculate the physical condition indicator score and the overall assessment score for that owner or PHA.
(f)
Tenant involvement in inspections.
HUD will establish, through notice, a procedure for tenants to recommend to HUD particular units which HUD may choose to inspect either during or separate from its standard inspection. HUD will evaluate the condition of these units and issue a report on findings, but they will not be included in the official score unless they were randomly selected independent of the tenant's recommendation. The owner or PHA is required to correct any deficiency HUD identifies within the timeframes HUD has established for the identified deficiency.
§ 5.707
Uniform self-inspection requirement and report.
All PHAs and owners of HUD housing subject to an assistance contract, other than owners participating in the HCV, PBV, and Moderate Rehabilitation programs, are required to annually self-inspect their properties, including all units, to ensure the units are maintained in accordance with the standards in § 5.703. The owner or PHA must maintain the results of such self-inspections for three years and must provide the results to HUD upon request. This self-inspection is independent of other HUD inspections discussed in § 5.705. The owner or PHA may choose to conduct this inspection after a HUD inspection to satisfy this requirement and the post-report survey requirement at § 5.711(c)(2) simultaneously.
§ 5.709
Administrative process for defining and revising inspection criteria.
(a)
Inspection standards and scoring methodology.
The Secretary will publish in the
Federal Register,
following notice and the opportunity to comment, a standards notification with a list of deficiencies and the relative severity of these deficiencies to use for inspecting HUD housing. This
Federal Register
document will also include the factors for determining if an HCV, PBV, or Moderate Rehabilitation unit passes or fails the inspection. The Secretary will also publish in the
Federal Register,
following notice and opportunity to comment, a scoring notification containing the methodologies to use for scoring and ranking HUD housing. After considering the public comments received on these
Federal Register
documents, the Secretary will publish documents announcing the new inspections standards and scoring methodologies, and the date on which these notifications become effective.
(1)
Revisions.
The Secretary will issue a notification in the
Federal Register
published for at least 30 days of public comment making any revisions to the inspection and scoring procedures HUD deems necessary, at least once every three years, or three years after the most recent revision, whichever is later.
(2)
Emergency revisions.
The Secretary may publish a notification without 30 days of public comment in the case of an emergency to protect Federal financial resources or the health or safety of residents of HUD housing, after HUD makes a documented determination that such action is warranted due to:
(i) A Life-Threatening deficiency or Severe deficiency and other significant risks to safety as outlined in § 5.703;
(ii) A new safety concern due to changing construction technology; or
(iii) Other events as determined by the Secretary.
(b) [Reserved]
§ 5.711
Scoring, ranking criteria, and appeals.
(a)
Applicability.
Administrative process for scoring and ranking the physical condition of HUD housing properties under this section does not apply to the HCV, PBV or Moderate Rehabilitation programs. PHAs administering HCV and PBV programs will be assessed under the Section 8 Management Assessment Program (“SEMAP”) or the small rural PHA assessment in accordance with 24 CFR part 985, and PHAs administering the Moderate Rehabilitation programs are subject to HUD review in accordance with 24 CFR 882.517.
(b)
Scoring and ranking of HUD housing
—(1)
General.
HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC), or the appropriate entity either as described in § 5.705(b), or as identified in the regulator agreement or contract for the property as described in § 5.705(b)(1), will score and rank the physical condition of HUD housing properties in accordance with the procedures set out by the Secretary in § 5.709.
(2)
Public housing programs.
PHAs operating public housing will be scored and ranked under the Public Housing Assessment System (“PHAS”) outlined in part 902 of this title.
(c)
Inspection report requirements.
(1)
Life-Threatening deficiencies and Severe deficiencies.
Upon completion of an inspection, or at the end of each day on a multiple-day inspection, REAC, or the appropriate party as described in § 5.705(b), will provide the owner or PHA or owner's representative, a notice of any items classified as Life-Threatening or Severe deficiencies. All Life-Threatening items must be corrected within 24 hours of receipt of notice of these items, unless HUD approves a variation. All Severe items must be corrected within 24 hours of receipt of notice, unless indicated otherwise within the individual inspection standards published in the
Federal Register
with notice and the opportunity for comment, or HUD approves a variation. The owner or PHA or owner's representative must electronically certify and provide supporting evidence within 2 business days after the deadline to correct the Life-Threatening and Severe items that the items have been resolved or sufficiently corrected such that they no longer pose a severe health or safety risk to residents of the property, or that the hazard is blocked until permanent repairs can be completed. If permanent repair will take longer than the allowable time in the relevant standard for the deficiency, the owner or PHA must provide HUD a timeframe for completing permanent repairs for HUD approval.
(2)
Post-report inspection.
The owner or PHA must carefully review the inspection report and is responsible for conducting its own survey of the total property. Moderate deficiencies must be corrected within thirty days and Low deficiencies must be corrected within sixty days, unless indicated otherwise within the individual inspection standards published in the
Federal Register
with notice and the opportunity for comment or within such other reasonable time prescribed by a HUD notice to the owner or PHA. For properties that scored at or above 60, the survey may be limited to inspecting for deficiencies based on the inspecting entity's inspection findings. For properties that scored below 60, the owner or PHA must conduct a survey of the entire project, including all units, inside areas, and outside areas, for any deficiency, and must electronically submit a copy of the results of the survey to HUD.
(d)
Technical review of inspection results
—(1)
Timing.
A request for a technical review of inspection results must be submitted electronically and must be received by the inspecting entity no later than the 45th calendar day following the day the inspection report is provided to the owner or PHA.
(2)
Request for technical review.
The request must be accompanied by the owner's or PHA's relevant evidence that an objectively verifiable and material error occurred or adverse conditions beyond the owner or PHA's control occurred, which if corrected will result in a significant improvement in the overall score of the property. A technical review of the inspection results will not be conducted based on
conditions that were corrected subsequent to the inspection. Upon receipt of this request from the owner or PHA, the REAC will review the inspection and the evidence. If the REAC review determines that an objectively verifiable and material error (or errors) or adverse condition(s) beyond the owner's or PHA's control has been documented and that it is likely to result in a significant improvement in the property's overall score, the REAC will take one or a combination of the following actions:
(i) Undertake a new inspection;
(ii) Correct the original inspection; or
(iii) Issue a new physical condition score.
(3)
Burden of proof that error or adverse conditions occurred rests with owner or PHA.
The burden of proof rests with the owner or PHA to demonstrate that an objectively verifiable and material error (or errors) or adverse conditions occurred in the REAC's inspection through submission of evidence, which if corrected will result in a significant improvement in the property's overall score. The REAC will apply a rebuttable presumption that the inspection was conducted accurately. To support its request for a technical review of the physical inspection results, the owner or PHA may submit photographic evidence, written material from an objective source with subject matter expertise that pertains to the item being reviewed such as a local fire marshal, building code official, registered architect, or professional engineer, or other similar evidence.
(4)
Basis for technical review.
An objectively verifiable material error must be present, or an adjustment to the score must be necessary, to allow for a technical review of inspection results. The basis for a technical review must not be due to the fault of the owner or PHA and must exhibit specific characteristics and meet specific thresholds. The applicable types of material errors and bases for adjustment are as follows.
(i)
Building data error.
A building data error occurs if the inspector inspected the wrong building or a building that was not owned by the property, including common or site areas that were not a part of the property. Incorrect data due to the failure of an owner or PHA to ensure HUD's systems of records are updated cannot form the basis of a review. Incorrect building data that does not affect the score, such as the address and building name would not be considered material.
(ii)
Unit count error.
A unit count error occurs if the total number of units considered in scoring is incorrect due to the fault of HUD. Since scoring uses total units, REAC will examine instances where the participant can provide evidence that the total units used was incorrect and that the results were not representative of the condition of the property.
(iii)
A non-existent deficiency error.
A non-existent deficiency error occurs if the inspection records an observed deficiency that does not satisfy or does not meet a reasonable interpretation of the definition of that deficiency as defined by inspection procedures.
(iv)
Adjustments for factors not reflected or inappropriately reflected in physical condition score.
HUD may determine it is appropriate to review the results of a property's physical inspection if facts and circumstances affecting the owner's or PHA's property are not reflected in the inspection or are reflected inappropriately in the inspection. The circumstances addressed in this may include inconsistencies between local code requirements and the HUD physical inspection protocol; conditions that are permitted by local variance or license or which are preexisting physical features that do not conform to, or are inconsistent with, HUD's physical condition protocol; or the project or PHA having been scored for elements (e.g., roads, sidewalks, mail boxes, resident-owned appliances, etc.) that it does not own and is not responsible for maintaining.
(v)
Adjustments for adverse conditions beyond the control of the owner or PHA.
HUD may determine that certain deficiencies that adversely and significantly affect the physical condition score of the project were caused by circumstances beyond the control of the owner or PHA. The correction of these conditions, however, remains the responsibility of the owner or PHA. The circumstances addressed by this paragraph may include, but are not limited
to, damage caused by third parties (such as a private entity or public entity undertaking work near a Public Housing project that results in damage to the project) or natural disasters.
(vi)
Adjustments for modernization work in progress.
HUD may determine that occupied dwelling units or other areas of a property, which are subject to physical inspection, and which are undergoing modernization work, require an adjustment to the physical condition score. An occupied dwelling unit or other areas of an owner's or PHA's property undergoing modernization are subject to physical inspection; the unit(s) and other areas of the property are not exempt from physical inspection. All elements of the unit or of the other areas of the owner or PHA's project that are subject to inspection and are not undergoing modernization at the time of the inspection (even if modernization is planned) will be subject to HUD's physical inspection protocol without adjustment. For those elements of the unit or of the property that are undergoing modernization, deficiencies will be noted in accordance with HUD's physical inspection protocol, but the owner or PHA may request adjustment of the physical condition score as a result of current modernization or rehab work in progress.
(5)
Significant improvement.
Significant improvement in the project's overall score refers to an increase in a score for the owner or PHA such that the new score crosses an administratively significant threshold.
(6)
Reinspection.
If HUD determines that a reinspection is appropriate, it will arrange for a complete reinspection of the project(s) in question, not just the deficiencies previously identified. The reinspection will constitute the final inspection for the project, and HUD will issue a new inspection report (the final inspection report).
(e)
Independent HUD review.
Under certain circumstances, HUD may find it appropriate absent an owner or PHA request for technical review to review the results of an inspection which are anomalous or have an incorrect result due to facts and circumstances affecting the inspected property which are not reflected in the inspection or reflected inappropriately in the inspection.
(f)
Responsibility for the cost of a new inspection.
If a new inspection is undertaken by the inspecting party and the new inspection score results in a significant improvement in the property's overall score, then the entity responsible for the inspection shall bear the expense of the new inspection. If no significant improvement occurs, then the owner or PHA responsible for the property must bear the expense of the new inspection. The inspection cost of a new inspection, if paid by the owner or PHA, is not an eligible project operating expense. The new inspection score will be considered the final score.
(g)
Issuance of final score and publication of score.
(1) The score of the property is the final score if the owner or PHA files no request for technical review, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, or for other adjustment of the physical condition score, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. If the owner or PHA files a request for technical review or score adjustments in accordance with paragraphs (d), or there is a HUD review under paragraph (e) of this section, the final inspection score is the score issued by HUD after any adjustments are determined necessary and made by HUD at the conclusion of these processes.
(2) HUD will make public the final scores of the properties of the owners and PHAs through posting on HUD's internet site, or other appropriate means.
(h)
Responsibility to notify residents of inspection; and availability of documents to residents
—(1)
Notification to residents.
An owner or PHA must notify its residents of any planned inspections of their units or the housing development generally.
(2)
Availability of documents for review.
(i) Once a final score has been issued the owner or PHA must make the physical inspection report and all related documents available to residents during regular business hours upon reasonable request for review and copying. Related documents include the owner's or PHA's survey plan, plan of correction, certification, and related correspondence.
(ii) Once the owner's final inspection score is issued and published, the owner or PHA must make any additional information, such as the results of any reinspection or appeal requests, available for review and copying by its residents upon reasonable request during regular business hours.
(iii) The owner or PHA must maintain the documents related to the inspection of the property, as described in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, for review by residents for a period of 60 days from the date HUD provides the inspection score for the property in which the residents reside.
(3)
Posting on the availability of materials.
The owner or PHA must post a notice to the residents in the owner's or PHA's management office and on any bulletin boards in all common areas on the date of submission to the owner of the inspection score for the property in which the resident resides that advises residents of the availability of the materials described in this section. The notice must be translated into other languages if necessary to provide meaningful access for limited English proficient (LEP) individuals. The notice should include, where applicable, the name, address, and telephone number of the HUD field office contact.
(4) Residents are encouraged to comment on this information provided by the owner or PHA and submit any comments directly to the applicable HUD field office or responsible entity. Should residents discover the owner or PHA provided HUD with a false certification during the review, they are encouraged to notify the applicable HUD field office where appropriate inquiry and action will be taken.
(i)
Administrative review of properties.
The file of a property that receives a score of 30 points or less, or two successive scores under 60, on its inspection will be subject to additional administrative review. Properties that receive two successive scores under 60 may be referred to HUD's Departmental Enforcement Center (DEC) for evaluation. Properties that receive a score of 30 points or less shall be automatically referred to the DEC for evaluation.
(1)
Notification to owner of submission of property file to the DEC.
Upon referral to the DEC, the Department will provide for notification to the PHA or owner that the file on the owner's property is being submitted to the DEC for evaluation. The notification will be provided at the time the REAC issues the inspection report to the owner or at such other time as a referral occurs.
(2)
Evaluation of the property.
During the DEC's evaluation period, the DEC will perform an analysis of the property, which may include input from tenants, HUD officials, elected officials, maintenance staff and others as may be appropriate. Although program offices will assist with the evaluation, the DEC will have primary responsibility for the conclusion of the evaluation of the property after taking into consideration the input of interested parties as described in this paragraph. The DEC's evaluation may include a site visit to the PHA's or owner's property.
(3)
Continuing responsibilities of HUD program offices and mortgagee.
During the period of DEC evaluation, HUD's program offices continue to be responsible for routine business, oversight, and monitoring. In addition, during this period of evaluation, the mortgagee, as applicable, shall continue to carry out its duties and responsibilities with respect to the mortgage.
(4)
Enforcement action.
Except as otherwise provided by statute, if, based on the DEC's evaluation and in consultation with HUD program offices, the DEC determines that enforcement actions are appropriate, it may take those actions for which the DEC has delegated authority and/or make recommendations to HUD program office with respect to resolving identified physical deficiencies and owner or PHA noncompliance.
(j)
No limitation on existing enforcement authority.
The administrative process provided in this section does not prohibit HUD from taking whatever action may be necessary (notwithstanding the commencement of this process), as authorized under existing statutes, regulations, contracts, grant agreements or other documents, to protect HUD's interests in HUD housing properties and to protect the residents of these properties.
§ 5.713
Second- and third-party rights.
Nothing in this subpart is intended to create any right of the family residing in HUD Housing or any party, other than HUD or a PHA, to require enforcement of the standards required by this subpart or to assert any claim against HUD or the PHA for damages, injunction, or other relief for alleged failure to enforce the standards.

(6) Operators of projects with mortgages insured or held by HUD under section 232 of the Act (Mortgage Insurance for Nursing Homes, Intermediate Care Facilities, Board and Care Homes).
(b)
Submission of financial information.
Entities (or individuals) to which this subpart is applicable must provide to HUD such financial information as required by HUD. Such information must be provided on an annual basis, except as required more frequently under
paragraph (c)(4) of this section. This information must be:
(1) Prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as further defined by HUD in supplementary guidance;
(2) Submitted electronically to HUD through the internet, or in such other electronic format designated by HUD, or in such non-electronic format as HUD may allow if the burden or cost of electronic reporting is determined by HUD to be excessive; and
(3) Submitted in such form and substance as prescribed by HUD.
(4) With respect to financial reports relating to properties insured under section 232 of the Act, concurrently with submitting the information to HUD, submitted to the mortgagee in a format and manner prescribed and/or approved by HUD.
(c)
Filing of financial reports.
(1) For entities listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, the financial information to be submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, must be submitted to HUD annually, no later than 60 days after the end of the fiscal year of the reporting period, and as otherwise provided by law (for public housing agencies, see also 24 CFR 903.33).
(2) For entities listed in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, the financial information to be submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, must be submitted to HUD annually, no later than 90 days after the end of the fiscal year of the reporting period, and as otherwise provided by law.
(3) For those entities listed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the financial information to be submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section must be submitted to HUD annually, no later than 90 days after the end of the fiscal year (or within an extended time if an extension is granted at the sole discretion of the Secretary). An extension request must be received no earlier than 45 days and no later than 15 days prior to the submission deadline.
(4) For entities listed in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the financial information to be submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section must be submitted to HUD on a quarterly and fiscal-year-to-date basis, within 60 calendar days of the end of each quarterly reporting period deadline, except that the final fiscal-year-end quarter and fiscal-year-to-date reports must be submitted to HUD within 90 calendar days of the end of the fiscal-year-end quarter, or within such additional time as may be provided by the Commissioner for good cause shown. HUD may direct that such forms be submitted to the lender or another third party in addition to or in lieu of submission to HUD.
(i) The financial statements submitted by entities listed in paragraph (a)(6) of this section may, at the operator's option, be operator-certified rather than audited, provided, however, if the operator is also the borrower, then that entity's obligation to submit an annual audited financial statement (in addition to its obligation as an operator to submit financial information on a quarterly and year-to-date basis) remains and is not obviated.
(ii) If HUD has reason to believe that a particular operator's operator-certified statements may be unreliable (for example, indicate a likely prohibited use of project funds), or are presented in a manner that is inconsistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, HUD may, on a case-by-case basis, require audited financial statements from the operator. With respect to facilities with FHA-insured or HUD-held Section 232 mortgages, HUD may request more frequent financial statements from the borrower and/or the operator on a case-by-case basis when the circumstances warrant. Nothing in this section limits HUD's ability to obtain further or more frequent information when appropriate pursuant to the applicable regulatory agreement.
(d)
Reporting compliance dates.
Entities (or individuals) that are subject to the reporting requirements in this section must commence compliance with these requirements as follows:
(1) For PHAs listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, the requirements of this section will begin with those PHAs with fiscal years ending September 30, 1999 and later. Unaudited financial statements will be required 60 days after the PHA's fiscal

(a) If you are the owner of federally assisted housing, your federally assisted housing is covered, except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.
(b) If you are operating public housing, this subpart does not apply, but similar provisions applicable to public housing units are found in parts 960 and 966 of this title. If you administer tenant-based assistance under Section 8 or you are the owner of housing assisted with tenant-based assistance under Section 8, this subpart does not apply to you, but similar provisions that do apply are located in part 982 of this title.
(c) If you own or administer housing assisted by the Rural Housing Administration under section 514 or section 515 of the Housing Act of 1949, this subpart does not apply to you.
§ 5.851
What authority do I have to screen applicants and to evict tenants?
(a)
Screening applicants.
You are authorized to screen applicants for the
programs covered by this part. The provisions of this subpart implement statutory directives that either
require
or
permit
you to take action to deny admission to applicants under certain circumstances in accordance with established standards, as described in this subpart. The provisions of this subpart do not constrain your authority to screen out applicants who you determined are unsuitable under your standards for admission.
(b)
Terminating tenancy.
You are authorized to terminate tenancy of tenants, in accordance with your leases and landlord-tenant law for the programs covered by this part. The provisions of this subpart implement statutory directives that either require or permit you to terminate tenancy under certain circumstances, as provided in 42 U.S.C. 1437f, 1437n, and 13662, in accordance with established standards, as described in this subpart. You retain authority to terminate tenancy on any basis that is otherwise authorized.
§ 5.852
What discretion do I have in screening and eviction actions?
(a)
General.
If the law and regulation permit you to take an action but do not require action to be taken, you may take or not take the action in accordance with your standards for admission and eviction. Consistent with the application of your admission and eviction standards, you may consider all of the circumstances relevant to a particular admission or eviction case, such as:
(1) The seriousness of the offending action;
(2) The effect on the community of denial or termination or the failure of the responsible entity to take such action;
(3) The extent of participation by the leaseholder in the offending action;
(4) The effect of denial of admission or termination of tenancy on household members not involved in the offending action;
(5) The demand for assisted housing by families who will adhere to lease responsibilities;
(6) The extent to which the leaseholder has shown personal responsibility and taken all reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the offending action; and
(7) The effect of the responsible entity's action on the integrity of the program.
(b)
Exclusion of culpable household member.
You may require an applicant (or tenant) to exclude a household member in order to be admitted to the housing program (or continue to reside in the assisted unit), where that household member has participated in or been culpable for action or failure to act that warrants denial (or termination).
(c)
Consideration of rehabilitation.
(1) In determining whether to deny admission or terminate tenancy for illegal use of drugs or alcohol abuse by a household member who is no longer engaged in such behavior, you may consider whether such household member is participating in or has successfully completed a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully (42 U.S.C. 13661). For this purpose, you may require the applicant or tenant to submit evidence of the household member's current participation in, or successful completion of, a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program or evidence of otherwise having been rehabilitated successfully.
(2) If rehabilitation is not an element of the eligibility determination (see § 5.854(a)(1) for the case where it must be considered), you may choose not to consider whether the person has been rehabilitated.
(d)
Length of period of mandatory prohibition on admission.
If a statute requires that you prohibit admission of persons for a prescribed period of time after some disqualifying behavior or event, you may apply that prohibition for a longer period of time.
(e)
Nondiscrimination limitation.
Your admission and eviction actions must be consistent with fair housing and equal opportunity provisions of § 5.105.

(b) You may establish a period before the admission decision during which an applicant must not have engaged in the activities specified in paragraph (a) of this section (
reasonable time
).
(c) If you previously denied admission to an applicant because of a determination concerning a member of the household under paragraph (a) of this section, you may reconsider the applicant if you have sufficient evidence that the members of the household are not currently engaged in, and have not engaged in, such criminal activity during a reasonable period, determined by you, before the admission decision.
(1) You would have
sufficient evidence
if the household member submitted a certification that she or he is not currently engaged in and has not engaged in such criminal activity during the specified period and provided supporting information from such sources as a probation officer, a landlord, neighbors, social service agency workers and criminal records, which you verified. (See subpart J of this part for
one method of checking criminal records.)
(2) For purposes of this section, a household member is
currently engaged in
the criminal activity if the person has engaged in the behavior recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that the behavior is current.

# Terminating Tenancy
§ 5.858
What authority do I have to evict drug criminals?
The lease must provide that drug-related criminal activity engaged in on or near the premises by any tenant, household member, or guest, and any such activity engaged in on the premises by any other person under the tenant's control, is grounds for you to terminate tenancy. In addition, the lease must allow you to evict a family when you determine that a household member is illegally using a drug or when you determine that a pattern of illegal use of a drug interferes with the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.
§ 5.859

PHA disclosure of records.
(i) A PHA may disclose the criminal conviction records which the PHA receives from a law enforcement agency only as follows:
(A) To officers or employees of the PHA, or to authorized representatives of the PHA who have a job-related need to have access to the information. For example, if the PHA is seeking to evict a public housing tenant on the basis of criminal activity as shown in criminal conviction records provided by a law enforcement agency, the records may be disclosed to PHA employees performing functions related to the eviction, or to a PHA hearing officer conducting an administrative grievance hearing concerning the proposed eviction.
(B) To the owner for use in connection with judicial eviction proceedings by the owner to the extent necessary in connection with a judicial eviction proceeding. For example, criminal conviction records may be included in pleadings or other papers filed in an eviction action, may be disclosed to parties to the action or the court, and may be filed in court or offered as evidence.
(ii) This disclosure may be made only if the following conditions are satisfied:
(A) If the PHA has determined that criminal activity by the household member as shown by such records received from a law enforcement agency may be a basis for eviction from a Section 8 unit; and

(iii) The PHA may rely on an owner's certification that the criminal record is necessary to proceed with a judicial eviction to evict the tenant based on criminal activity of the identified household member, as shown in the criminal conviction record.
(iv) Upon disclosure as necessary in connection with judicial eviction proceedings, the PHA is not responsible for controlling access to or knowledge of such records after such disclosure.
(f)
Opportunity to dispute.
If a PHA obtains criminal record information from a State or local agency under this section showing that a household member has been convicted of a crime relevant to applicant screening, lease enforcement or eviction, the PHA must notify the household of the proposed action to be based on the information and must provide the subject of the record and the applicant or tenant a copy of such information, and an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of the information. This opportunity must be provided before a denial of admission, eviction or lease enforcement action on the basis of such information.
(g)
Records management.
Consistent with the limitations on disclosure of records in paragraph (e) of this section, the PHA must establish and implement a system of records management that ensures that any criminal record received by the PHA from a law enforcement agency is:
(1) Maintained confidentially;
(2) Not misused or improperly disseminated; and
(3) Destroyed, once the purpose(s) for which the record was requested has been accomplished, including expiration of the period for filing a challenge to the PHA action without institution of a challenge or final disposition of any such litigation.

Penalties for improper release of information
—(1)
Criminal penalty.
Conviction for a misdemeanor and imposition of a penalty of not more than $5,000 is the potential for:

(ii) Any person, including an officer, employee, or authorized representative of any PHA or a project owner, who knowingly and willfully discloses any such information in any manner to any individual not entitled under any law to receive the information.
(2)
Civil liability.
(i) A PHA may be held liable to any applicant for, or tenant of, covered housing assistance affected by either of the following:
(A) A negligent or knowing disclosure of criminal records information obtained under the authority of this section about such person by an officer, employee, or authorized representative of the PHA if the disclosure is not authorized by this section; or
(B) Any other negligent or knowing action that is inconsistent with this section.
(ii) An applicant for, or tenant of, covered housing assistance may seek relief against a PHA in these circumstances by bringing a civil action for damages and such other relief as may be appropriate against the PHA responsible for such unauthorized action. The United States district court in which the affected applicant or tenant resides, in which the unauthorized action occurred, or in which the officer, employee, or representative alleged to be responsible resides, has jurisdiction. Appropriate relief may include reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs.

(iii) If you intend to use the PHA determination regarding any such sex offender registration information for eviction, your request must include your standards for evicting persons subject to a lifetime registration requirement in accordance with § 5.858.
(iv) If you intend to use the PHA determination regarding any such sex offender registration information for lease enforcement other than eviction, your request must include your standards for lease enforcement because of criminal activity by members of a household.

(1) The PHA must establish and implement a system of records management that ensures that any sex offender registration information record received by the PHA from a State or local agency under this section is:
(i) Maintained confidentially;
(ii) Not misused or improperly disseminated; and
(iii) Destroyed, once the purpose for which the record was requested has been accomplished, including expiration of the period for filing a challenge to the PHA action without institution of a challenge or final disposition of any such litigation.

(d)
Opportunity to dispute.
If a PHA obtains sex offender registration information from a State or local agency under paragraph (a) of this section showing that a household member is subject to a lifetime sex offender registration requirement, the PHA must notify the household of the proposed action to be based on the information and must provide the subject of the record, and the applicant or tenant, with a copy of such information, and an opportunity to dispute the accuracy and relevance of the information. This opportunity must be provided before a denial of admission, eviction or lease enforcement action on the basis of such information.

# Subpart L—Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking

# Source:
81 FR 80798, Nov. 16, 2016, unless otherwise noted.
§ 5.2001
Applicability.
(a) This subpart addresses the protections for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who are applying for, or are the beneficiaries of, assistance under a HUD program covered by the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 13925 and 42 U.S.C. 14043e
et seq.
) (“covered housing program,” as defined in § 5.2003). Notwithstanding the title of the statute, protections are not limited to women but cover victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, regardless of sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Consistent with the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements at 24 CFR 5.105(a), victims cannot be discriminated against on the basis of any protected characteristic, including race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, disability, or age. HUD programs must also be operated consistently with HUD's Equal Access Rule at § 5.105(a)(2), which requires that HUD-assisted and HUD-insured housing are made available to all otherwise eligible individuals and families regardless of actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status.
(b)(1) The applicable assistance provided under a covered housing program generally consists of two types of assistance (one or both may be provided): Tenant-based rental assistance, which is rental assistance that is provided to the tenant; and project-based assistance, which is assistance that attaches to the unit in which the tenant resides. For project-based assistance, the assistance may consist of such assistance as operating assistance, development assistance, and mortgage interest rate subsidy.
(2) The regulations in this subpart are supplemented by the specific regulations for the HUD-covered housing programs listed in § 5.2003. The program-specific regulations address how certain VAWA requirements are to be implemented and whether they can be implemented (for example, reasonable time to establish eligibility for assistance as provided in § 5.2009(b)) for the applicable covered housing program, given the statutory and regulatory framework for the program. When there is conflict between the regulations of this subpart and the program-specific regulations, the program-specific regulations govern. Where assistance is provided under more than one covered housing program and there is a conflict between VAWA protections or remedies under those programs, the individual seeking the VAWA protections or remedies may choose to use the protections or remedies under any or all of those programs, as long as the protections or remedies would be feasible and permissible under each of the program statutes.
§ 5.2003

Affiliated individual,
with respect to an individual, means:

Bifurcate
means to divide a lease as a matter of law, subject to the permissibility of such process under the requirements of the applicable HUD-covered program and State or local law, such that certain tenants or lawful occupants can be evicted or removed and the remaining tenants or lawful occupants can continue to reside in the unit under the same lease requirements or as may be revised depending upon the eligibility for continued occupancy of the remaining tenants and lawful occupants.

the HUD-required lease, lease addendum, or tenancy addendum, as applicable, must include a description of specific protections afforded to the victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as provided in this subpart.
(b)
Prohibited basis for denial or termination of assistance or eviction
—(1)
General.
An applicant for assistance or tenant assisted under a covered housing program may not be denied admission to, denied assistance under, terminated from participation in, or evicted from the housing on the basis or as a direct result of the fact that the applicant or tenant is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, if the applicant or tenant otherwise qualifies for admission, assistance, participation, or occupancy.
(2)
Termination on the basis of criminal activity.
A tenant in a covered housing program may not be denied tenancy or occupancy rights solely on the basis of criminal activity directly relating to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking if:
(i) The criminal activity is engaged in by a member of the household of the tenant or any guest or other person under the control of the tenant, and
(ii) The tenant or an affiliated individual of the tenant is the victim or threatened victim of such domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking.
(c)
Construction of lease terms and terms of assistance.
An incident of actual or threatened domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking shall not be construed as:
(1) A serious or repeated violation of a lease executed under a covered housing program by the victim or threatened victim of such incident; or
(2) Good cause for terminating the assistance, tenancy, or occupancy rights under a covered housing program of the victim or threatened victim of such incident.
(d)
Limitations of VAWA protections.
(1) Nothing in this section limits the authority of a covered housing provider, when notified of a court order, to comply with a court order with respect to:
(i) The rights of access or control of property, including civil protection orders issued to protect a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking; or
(ii) The distribution or possession of property among members of a household.
(2) Nothing in this section limits any available authority of a covered housing provider to evict or terminate assistance to a tenant for any violation not premised on an act of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking that is in question against the tenant or an affiliated individual of the tenant. However, the covered housing provider must not subject the tenant, who is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or is affiliated with an individual who is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking, to a more demanding standard than other tenants in determining whether to evict or terminate assistance.
(3) Nothing in this section limits the authority of a covered housing provider to terminate assistance to or evict a tenant under a covered housing program if the covered housing provider can demonstrate an actual and imminent threat to other tenants or those employed at or providing service to property of the covered housing provider would be present if that tenant or lawful occupant is not evicted or terminated from assistance. In this context, words, gestures, actions, or other indicators will be considered an “actual and imminent threat” if they meet the standards provided in the definition of “actual and imminent threat” in § 5.2003.
(4) Any eviction or termination of assistance, as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section should be utilized by a covered housing provider only when there are no other actions that could be taken to reduce or eliminate the threat, including, but not limited to, transferring the victim to a different unit, barring the perpetrator from the property, contacting law enforcement to increase police presence or develop other plans to keep the property safe, or seeking other legal remedies to prevent the perpetrator
from acting on a threat. Restrictions predicated on public safety cannot be based on stereotypes, but must be tailored to particularized concerns about individual residents.
(e)
Emergency transfer plan.
Each covered housing provider, as identified in the program-specific regulations for the covered housing program, shall adopt an emergency transfer plan, no later than June 14, 2017 based on HUD's model emergency transfer plan, in accordance with the following:
(1) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(i)
Internal emergency transfer
refers to an emergency relocation of a tenant to another unit where the tenant would not be categorized as a new applicant; that is, the tenant may reside in the new unit without having to undergo an application process.
(ii)
External emergency transfer
refers to an emergency relocation of a tenant to another unit where the tenant would be categorized as a new applicant; that is the tenant must undergo an application process in order to reside in the new unit.
(iii)
Safe unit
refers to a unit that the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking believes is safe.
(2) The emergency transfer plan must provide that a tenant receiving rental assistance through, or residing in a unit subsidized under, a covered housing program who is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking qualifies for an emergency transfer if:
(i) The tenant expressly requests the transfer; and
(ii)(A) The tenant reasonably believes there is a threat of imminent harm from further violence if the tenant remains within the same dwelling unit that the tenant is currently occupying; or
(B) In the case of a tenant who is a victim of sexual assault, either the tenant reasonably believes there is a threat of imminent harm from further violence if the tenant remains within the same dwelling unit that the tenant is currently occupying, or the sexual assault occurred on the premises during the 90-calendar-day period preceding the date of the request for transfer.
(3) The emergency transfer plan must detail the measure of any priority given to tenants who qualify for an emergency transfer under VAWA in relation to other categories of tenants seeking transfers and individuals seeking placement on waiting lists.
(4) The emergency transfer plan must incorporate strict confidentiality measures to ensure that the covered housing provider does not disclose the location of the dwelling unit of the tenant to a person who committed or threatened to commit an act of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking against the tenant.
(5) The emergency transfer plan must allow a tenant to make an internal emergency transfer under VAWA when a safe unit is immediately available.
(6) The emergency transfer plan must describe policies for assisting a tenant in making an internal emergency transfer under VAWA when a safe unit is not immediately available, and these policies must ensure that requests for internal emergency transfers under VAWA receive, at a minimum, any applicable additional priority that housing providers may already provide to other types of emergency transfer requests.
(7) The emergency transfer plan must describe reasonable efforts the covered housing provider will take to assist a tenant who wishes to make an external emergency transfer when a safe unit is not immediately available. The plan must include policies for assisting a tenant who is seeking an external emergency transfer under VAWA out of the covered housing provider's program or project, and a tenant who is seeking an external emergency transfer under VAWA into the covered housing provider's program or project. These policies may include:
(i) Arrangements, including memoranda of understanding, with other covered housing providers to facilitate moves; and
(ii) Outreach activities to organizations that assist or provide resources to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
(8) Nothing may preclude a tenant from seeking an internal emergency
transfer and an external emergency transfer concurrently if a safe unit is not immediately available.
(9) Where applicable, the emergency transfer plan must describe policies for a tenant who has tenant-based rental assistance and who meets the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section to move quickly with that assistance.
(10) The emergency transfer plan may require documentation from a tenant seeking an emergency transfer, provided that:
(i) The tenant's submission of a written request to the covered housing provider, where the tenant certifies that they meet the criteria in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, shall be sufficient documentation of the requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of this section;
(ii) The covered housing provider may, at its discretion, ask an individual seeking an emergency transfer to document the occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, in accordance with § 5.2007, for which the individual is seeking the emergency transfer, if the individual has not already provided documentation of that occurrence; and
(iii) No other documentation is required to qualify the tenant for an emergency transfer.
(11) The covered housing provider must make its emergency transfer plan available upon request and, when feasible, must make its plan publicly available.
(12) The covered housing provider must keep a record of all emergency transfers requested under its emergency transfer plan, and the outcomes of such requests, and retain these records for a period of three years, or for a period of time as specified in program regulations. Requests and outcomes of such requests must be reported to HUD annually.
(13) Nothing in this paragraph (e) may be construed to supersede any eligibility or other occupancy requirements that may apply under a covered housing program.
§ 5.2007
Documenting the occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
(a)
Request for documentation.
(1) Under a covered housing program, if an applicant or tenant represents to the covered housing provider that the individual is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking entitled to the protections under § 5.2005, or remedies under § 5.2009, the covered housing provider may request, in writing, that the applicant or tenant submit to the covered housing provider the documentation specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(2)(i) If an applicant or tenant does not provide the documentation requested under paragraph (a)(1) of this section within 14 business days after the date that the tenant receives a request in writing for such documentation from the covered housing provider, nothing in § 5.2005 or § 5.2009, which addresses the protections of VAWA, may be construed to limit the authority of the covered housing provider to:
(A) Deny admission by the applicant or tenant to the covered housing program;
(B) Deny assistance under the covered housing program to the applicant or tenant;
(C) Terminate the participation of the tenant in the covered housing program; or
(D) Evict the tenant, or a lawful occupant that commits a violation of a lease.

(b)
Permissible documentation and submission requirements.
(1) In response to a written request to the applicant or tenant from the covered housing provider, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the applicant or tenant may submit, as documentation of the occurrence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, any one of the following forms of documentation, where it is at the discretion of the tenant or applicant which one of the following forms of documentation to submit:
(i) The certification form described in § 5.2005(a)(1)(ii); or
(ii) A document:
(A) Signed by an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim service provider, an attorney, or medical professional, or a mental health professional (collectively, “professional”) from whom the victim has sought assistance relating to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, or the effects of abuse;
(B) Signed by the applicant or tenant; and
(C) That specifies, under penalty of perjury, that the professional believes in the occurrence of the incident of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking that is the ground for protection and remedies under this subpart, and that the incident meets the applicable definition of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking under § 5.2003; or
(iii) A record of a Federal, State, tribal, territorial or local law enforcement agency, court, or administrative agency; or
(iv) At the discretion of a covered housing provider, a statement or other evidence provided by the applicant or tenant.
(2) If a covered housing provider receives documentation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section that contains conflicting information (including certification forms from two or more members of a household each claiming to be a victim and naming one or more of the other petitioning household members as the perpetrator), the covered housing provider may require an applicant or tenant to submit third-party documentation, as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(iii), or (b)(1)(iv) of this section, within 30 calendar days of the date of the request for the third-party documentation.
(3) Nothing in this paragraph (b) shall be construed to require a covered housing provider to request that an individual submit documentation of the status of the individual as a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
(c)
Confidentiality.
Any information submitted to a covered housing provider under this section, including the fact that an individual is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking (confidential information), shall be maintained in strict confidence by the covered housing provider.
(1) The covered housing provider shall not allow any individual administering assistance on behalf of the covered housing provider or any persons within their employ (
e.g.,
contractors) or in the employ of the covered housing provider to have access to confidential information unless explicitly authorized by the covered housing provider for reasons that specifically call for these individuals to have access to this information under applicable Federal, State, or local law.
(2) The covered housing provider shall not enter confidential information described in paragraph (c) of this section into any shared database or disclose such information to any other entity or individual, except to the extent that the disclosure is:
(i) Requested or consented to in writing by the individual in a time-limited release
(ii) Required for use in an eviction proceeding or hearing regarding termination of assistance from the covered program; or
(iii) Otherwise required by applicable law.
(d) A covered housing provider's compliance with the protections of §§ 5.2005 and 5.2009, based on documentation received under this section shall not be sufficient to constitute evidence of an unreasonable act or omission by the covered housing provider. However, nothing in this paragraph (d) of this section shall be construed to limit the liability of a covered housing provider for failure to comply with §§ 5.2005 and 5.2009.
§ 5.2009
Remedies available to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
(a)
Lease bifurcation.
(1) A covered housing provider may in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, bifurcate a lease, or remove a household member from a lease in order to evict, remove, terminate occupancy rights, or terminate assistance to such
member who engages in criminal activity directly relating to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking against an affiliated individual or other individual:
(i) Without regard to whether the household member is a signatory to the lease; and
(ii) Without evicting, removing, terminating assistance to, or otherwise penalizing a victim of such criminal activity who is also a tenant or lawful occupant.
(2) A lease bifurcation, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, shall be carried out in accordance with any requirements or procedures as may be prescribed by Federal, State, or local law for termination of assistance or leases and in accordance with any requirements under the relevant covered housing program.
(b)
Reasonable time to establish eligibility for assistance or find alternative housing following bifurcation of a lease
—(1)
Applicability.
The reasonable time to establish eligibility under a covered housing program or find alternative housing is specified in paragraph (b) of this section, or alternatively in the program-specific regulations governing the applicable covered housing program. Some covered housing programs may provide different time frames than are specified in this paragraph (b), and in such cases, the program-specific regulations govern.
(2)
Reasonable time to establish eligibility assistance or find alternative housing.
(i) If a covered housing provider exercises the option to bifurcate a lease as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, and the individual who was evicted or for whom assistance was terminated was the eligible tenant under the covered housing program, the covered housing provider shall provide to any remaining tenant or tenants that were not already eligible a period of 90 calendar days from the date of bifurcation of the lease to:
(A) Establish eligibility for the same covered housing program under which the evicted or terminated tenant was the recipient of assistance at the time of bifurcation of the lease; or
(B) Establish eligibility under another covered housing program; or
(C) Find alternative housing.
(ii) The 90-calendar-day period provided by paragraph (b)(2) of this section will not be available to a remaining household member if the statutory requirements for the covered housing program prohibit it. The 90-day calendar period also will not apply beyond the expiration of a lease, unless this is permitted by program regulations. The 90-calendar-day period is the total period provided to a remaining tenant to establish eligibility under the three options provided in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A), (B), and (C) of this section.
(iii) The covered housing provider may extend the 90-calendar-day period in paragraph (b)(2) of this section up to an additional 60 calendar days, unless prohibited from doing so by statutory requirements of the covered program or unless the time period would extend beyond expiration of the lease.
(c)
Efforts to promote housing stability for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
Covered housing providers are encouraged to undertake whatever actions permissible and feasible under their respective programs to assist individuals residing in their units who are victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to remain in their units or other units under the covered housing program or other covered housing providers, and for the covered housing provider to bear the costs of any transfer, where permissible.
§ 5.2011
Effect on other laws.
(a) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to supersede any provision of any Federal, State, or local law that provides greater protection than this section for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
(b) All applicable fair housing and civil rights statutes and requirements apply in the implementation of VAWA requirements. See § 5.105(a).

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 6.1
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to implement the provisions of section 109 of title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (Title I) (42 U.S.C. 5309). Section 109 provides that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, national origin, religion, or sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity funded in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance. Section 109 does not directly prohibit discrimination on the bases of age or disability, and the regulations in this part 6 do not apply to age or disability discrimination in Title I programs. Instead, section 109 directs that the prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of age under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-6107) (Age Discrimination Act) and the prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of disability under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) (Section 504) apply to programs or activities funded in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance. Thus, the regulations of 24 CFR part 8, which implement Section 504 for HUD programs, and the regulations of 24 CFR part 146, which implement the Age Discrimination Act for HUD programs, apply to disability and age discrimination in Title I programs.
§ 6.2
Applicability.
(a) This part applies to any program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, including Community Development Block Grants—Entitlement, State and HUD-Administered Small
Cities, and Section 108 Loan Guarantees; Urban Development Action Grants; Economic Development Initiative Grants; and Special Purpose Grants.
(b) The provisions of this part and sections 104(b)(2) and 109 of Title I that relate to discrimination on the basis of race shall not apply to the provision of Federal financial assistance by grantees under this title to the Hawaiian Homelands (42 U.S.C. 5309).
(c) The provisions of this part and sections 104(b)(2) and 109 of Title I that relate to discrimination on the basis of race and national origin shall not apply to the provision of Federal financial assistance to grant recipients under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (25 U.S.C. 4101). See also, 24 CFR 1003.601(a).

(2) In determining the site or location of housing, accommodations, or facilities, a Recipient may not make selections that have the effect of excluding persons from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination on the ground of race, color, national origin, religion, or sex. The Recipient may not make selections that have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of section 109 and of this part 6.
(3)(i) In administering a program or activity in which the Recipient has discriminated on the grounds of race, color, national origin, religion or sex, the Recipient must take any necessary steps to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.
(ii) In the absence of discrimination, a Recipient, in administering a program or activity, may take any steps necessary to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color, national origin, religion, or sex.

After the acceptance of a complete complaint, the Responsible Official will investigate the complaint, attempt informal resolution, and, if resolution is not achieved, the Responsible Official will notify the Recipient and complainant, to the extent practicable within 180 days of the receipt of the complete complaint, of the results of the investigation in a letter of findings sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, containing the following:

(iii) For the State and HUD-Administered Small Cities programs, the compliance review will cover the four years before the date of the review.
(iv) For all other programs, the time period covered by the review will be four years before the date of the review.
(v) On a case-by-case basis, at the discretion of the Responsible Official, the above time frames for review can be expanded where facts or allegations warrant further investigation.
(3)
Early compliance resolution.
On the last day of the on-site visit, after the compliance review, the Recipient will be given an opportunity to supplement the record. Additionally, a prefinding conference may be held and a summary of the proposed findings may be presented to the Recipient.

(c)
Right to a review of the letter of findings.
(1) Within 30 days of receipt of the letter of findings, any party may request that a review be made of the letter of findings, by mailing or delivering to the Responsible Official, Room 5100, Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, HUD, Washington, DC 20410, a written statement of the reasons why the letter of findings should be modified.

(4) If no party requests that the letter of findings be reviewed, the Responsible Official, within 14 calendar days of the expiration of the time period in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section, will send a formal written determination of compliance or noncompliance to all parties.
(d)
Voluntary compliance time limits.
The Recipient will have 10 calendar days from receipt of the letter of findings of noncompliance, or such other reasonable time as specified in the letter, within which to agree, in writing, to come into voluntary compliance or to contact the Responsible Official for settlement discussions. If the Recipient fails to meet this deadline, HUD will proceed in accordance with §§ 6.12 and 6.13.
(e)
Informal resolution/voluntary compliance
—(1)
General.
It is the policy of HUD to encourage the informal resolution of matters. A complaint or a compliance review may be resolved by informal means at any time. If a letter of findings is issued, and the letter makes a finding of noncompliance, the Responsible Official will attempt to resolve the matter through a voluntary compliance agreement.
(2)
Objectives of informal resolution/voluntary compliance.
In attempting informal resolution, the Responsible Official will attempt to achieve a just resolution of the matter and to obtain assurances, where appropriate, that the Recipient will satisfactorily remedy any violations of the rights of any complainant, and will take such action as will assure the elimination of any violation of this part or the prevention of the occurrence of such violation in the future. If a finding of noncompliance has been made, the terms of such an informal resolution shall be reduced to a written voluntary compliance agreement, signed by the Recipient and the Responsible Official, and be made part of the file. Such voluntary compliance agreements shall seek to protect the interests of the complainant (if any), other persons similarly situated, and the public.
(3)
Right to file a private civil action.
At any time in the process, the complainant has the right to file a private civil action. If the complainant does so, the Responsible Official has the discretion to administratively close the investigation or continue the investigation, if he or she decides that it is in the best interests of the Department to do so. If the Responsible Official makes a finding of noncompliance and an agreement to voluntarily comply is not obtained from the Recipient, the procedures at §§ 6.12 and 6.13 for effecting compliance shall be followed.
(f)
Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited.
No Recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any person for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by this part, or because he or she has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, compliance review, proceeding, or hearing under this part.
§ 6.12
Procedure for effecting compliance.
(a) Whenever the Assistant Secretary determines that a Recipient of Federal
financial assistance has failed to comply with Section 109(a) or this part and voluntary compliance efforts have failed, the Secretary will notify the Governor of the State or the Chief Executive Officer of the unit of general local government of the findings of noncompliance and will request that the Governor or the Chief Executive Officer secure compliance. If within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60 days, the Governor or the Chief Executive Officer fails or refuses to secure compliance, the Secretary will:
(1) Refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation that an appropriate civil action be instituted;
(2) Exercise the powers and functions provided by Title VI;
(3) Terminate or reduce payments under Title I, or limit the availability of payments under Title I to programs or activities not affected by the failure to comply; or
(4) Take such other actions as may be provided by law, including, but not limited to, the initiation of proceedings under 2 CFR part 2424 or any applicable proceeding under State or local law.
(b)
Termination, reduction, or limitation of the availability of Title I payments.
No order terminating, reducing, or limiting the availability of Title I payments under this part shall become effective until:
(1) The Secretary has notified the Governor of the State or the Chief Executive Officer of the unit of general local government of the Recipient's failure to comply in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and of the termination, reduction or limitation of the availability of Title I payments to be taken;
(2) The Secretary has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;
(3) The Recipient has been extended an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with § 6.13(a); and
(4) A final agency notice or decision has been rendered in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section or 24 CFR part 180.
(c) If a Recipient does not respond to the notice of opportunity for a hearing or does not elect to proceed with a hearing within 20 days of the issuance of the Secretary's actions listed in paragraphs (b)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, then the Secretary's approval of the termination, reduction or limitation of the availability of Title I payments is considered a final agency notice and the Recipient may seek judicial review in accordance with section 111(c) of the Act.
[64 FR 3797, Jan. 25, 1999, as amended at 72 FR 73491, Dec. 27, 2007]
§ 6.13
Hearings and appeals.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 8.1
Purpose.
(a) The purpose of this part is to effectuate section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C 794), to the end that no otherwise qualified individual with handicaps in the United States shall, solely by reason of his or her handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This part also implements section 109 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5309). This part does not effectuate section 504 as it applies to any program or activity conducted by the Department. Compliance with this part does not assure compliance with requirements for accessibility by physically-handicapped persons imposed under the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157; 24 CFR part 40).
(b) The policies and standards for compliance established by this part are established in contemplation of, and with a view to enforcement through, the Department's administration of programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance and the administrative procedures described in subpart D (including, without limitation, judicial enforcement under § 8.57(a)).
[53 FR 20233, June 2, 1988, as amended at 83 FR 26361, June 7, 2018]
§ 8.2
Applicability.
This part applies to all applicants for, and recipients of, HUD assistance in the operation of programs or activities receiving such assistance.
[53 FR 20233, June 2, 1988, as amended at 83 FR 26361, June 7, 2018]
§ 8.3
Definitions.
As used in this part:
Accessible,
when used with respect to the design, construction, or alteration of a facility or a portion of a facility other than an individual dwelling unit, means that the facility or portion of the facility when designed, constructed or altered, can be approached, entered, and used by individuals with physical handicaps. The phrase
accessible to and usable by
is synonomous with accessible.
Accessible,
when used with respect to the design, construction, or alteration of an individual dwelling unit, means that the unit is located on an accessible route and when designed, constructed, altered or adapted can be approached, entered, and used by individuals with physical handicaps. A unit that is on an accessible route and is adaptable and otherwise in compliance with the standards set forth in § 8.32 is
accessible
within the meaning of this paragraph. When a unit in an existing facility which is being made accessible as a result of alterations is intended for use by a specific qualified individual with handicaps (e.g., a current occupant of such unit or of another unit under the control of the same recipient, or an applicant on a waiting list), the unit will be deemed accessible if it meets the requirements of applicable standards that address the particular disability or impairment of such person.
Accessible route
means a continuous unobstructed path connecting accessible elements and spaces in a building or facility that complies with the space and reach requirements of applicable standards prescribed by § 8.32. An accessible route that serves only accessible units occupied by persons with hearing or vision impairments need not comply with those requirements intended to effect accessibility for persons with mobility impairments.
Adaptability
means the ability of certain elements of a dwelling unit, such as kitchen counters, sinks, and grab bars, to be added to, raised, lowered, or otherwise altered, to accommodate the needs of persons with or without handicaps, or to accommodate the needs of persons with different types or degrees of disability. For example, in a unit adaptable for a hearing-impaired person, the wiring for visible emergency alarms may be installed but the alarms need not be installed until such time as the unit is made ready for occupancy by a hearing-impaired person.
Alteration
means any change in a facility or its permanent fixtures or equipment. It includes, but is not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, changes or rearrangements in structural parts and extraordinary repairs. It does not include normal maintenance or repairs, reroofing, interior decoration, or changes to mechanical systems.
Applicant for assistance
means one who submits an application, request, plan, or statement required to be approved by a Department official or by a primary recipient as a condition of eligibility for Federal financial assistance. An application means such a request, plan or statement.
Auxiliary aids
means services or devices that enable persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills to have an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance. For example, auxiliary aids for persons with impaired vision may include readers, Brailled materials, audio recordings, and other similar services and devices. Auxiliary aids for persons with impaired hearing may include telephone handset amplifiers, telephones compatible with hearing aids, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's), interpreters, notetakers, written materials, and other similar services and devices.
Department
or
HUD
means the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Facility
means all or any portion of buildings, structures, equipment, roads, walks, parking lots, rolling stock or other real or personal property or interest in the property.
Federal financial assistance
means any assistance provided or otherwise made available by the Department through any grant, loan, contract or any other arrangement, in the form of:
(a) Funds;
(b) Services of Federal personnel; or
(c) Real or personal property or any interest in or use of such property, including:
(1) Transfers or leases of the property for less than fair market value or for reduced consideration; and
(2) Proceeds from a subsequent transfer or lease of the property if the Federal share of its fair market value is not returned to the Federal Government.
Federal financial assistance
includes community development funds in the form of proceeds from loans guaranteed under section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended, but does not include assistance made available through direct Federal procurement contracts or payments made under these contracts or any other contract of insurance or guaranty.
Handicap
means any condition or characteristic that renders a person an individual with handicaps.
Historic preservation programs or activities
means programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance that have preservation of historic properties as a primary purpose.
Historic properties
means those properties that are listed or are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, or such properties designated as historic under a statute of the appropriate State or local government body.
Individual with handicaps
means any person who has a physical or mental
impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; has a record of such an impairment; or is regarded as having such an impairment. For purposes of employment, this term does not include: Any individual who is an alcoholic or drug abuser whose current use of alcohol or drugs prevents the individual from performing the duties of the job in question, or whose employment, by reason of current alcohol or drug abuse, would constitute a direct threat to property or the safety of others; or any individual who has a currently contagious disease or infection and who, by reason of such disease or infection, would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or who, by reason of the currently contagious disease or infection, is unable to perform the duties of the job. For purposes of other programs and activities, the term does not include any individual who is an alcoholic or drug abuser whose current use of alcohol or drugs prevents the individual from participating in the program or activity in question, or whose participation, by reason of such current alcohol or drug abuse, would constitute a direct threat to property or the safety of others. As used in this definition, the phrase:
(a)
Physical or mental impairment
includes:
(1) Any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: Neurological; musculoskeletal; special sense organs; respiratory, including speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive; digestive; genito-urinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine; or
(2) Any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities. The term
physical or mental impairment
includes, but is not limited to, such diseases and conditions as orthopedic, visual, speech and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, autism, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, drug addiction and alcoholism.

(c)
Has a record of such an impairment
means has a history of, or has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.
(d)
Is regarded as having an impairment
means:
(1) Has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit one or more major life activities but that is treated by a recipient as constituting such a limitation;
(2) Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward such impairment; or
(3) Has none of the impairments defined in paragraph (a) of this section but is treated by a recipient as having such an impairment.
Multifamily housing project
means a project containing five or more dwelling units.
Primary recipient
means a person, group, organization, State or local unit of government that is authorized or required to extend Federal financial assistance to another recipient for the purpose of carrying out a program or activity.

means all of the operations of:
(a)(1) A department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local government; or
(2) The entity of such State or local government that distributes such assistance and each such department or agency (and each other State or local government entity) to which the assistance is extended, in the case of assistance to a State or local government;
(b)(1) A college, university, or other post-secondary institution, or a public system of higher education; or
(2) A local educational agency (as defined in section 198(a)(10) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965), system of vocational education, or other school system;
(c)(1) An entire corporation, partnership, or other private organization, or an entire sole proprietorship—
(i) If assistance is extended to such corporation, partnership, private organization, or sole proprietorship as a whole; or
(ii) Which is principally engaged in the business of providing education, health care, housing, social services, or parks and recreation; or
(2) The entire plant or other comparable, geographically separate facility to which Federal financial assistance is extended, in the case of any other corporation, partnership, private organization, or sole proprietorship; or
(d) Any other entity which is established by two or more of the entities described in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section;
any part of which is extended Federal financial assistance.
Project
means the whole of one or more residential structures and appurtenant structures, equipment, roads, walks, and parking lots which are covered by a single contract for Federal financial assistance or application for assistance, or are treated as a whole for processing purposes, whether or not located on a common site.
Qualified individual with handicaps
means:
(a) With respect to employment, an individual with handicaps who, with reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the job in question; and
(b) With respect to any non-employment program or activity which requires a person to perform services or to achieve a level of accomplishment, an individual with handicaps who meets the essential eligibility requirements and who can achieve the purpose of the program or activity without modifications in the program or activity that the recipient can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in its nature; or
(c) With respect to any other non-employment program or activity, an individual with handicaps who meets the essential eligibility requirements for participation in, or receipt of benefits from, that program or activity.
Essential eligibility requirements
include stated eligibility requirements such as income as well as other explicit or implicit requirements inherent in the nature of the program or activity, such as requirements that an occupant of multifamily housing be capable of meeting the recipient's selection criteria and be capable of complying with all obligations of occupancy with or without supportive services provided by persons other than the recipient. For example, a chronically mentally ill person whose particular condition poses a significant risk of substantial interference with the safety or enjoyment of others or with his or her own health or safety in the absence of necessary supportive services may be
qualified
for occupancy in a project where such supportive services are provided by the recipient as part of the assisted program. The person may not be
qualified
for a project lacking such services.
Recipient
means any State or its political subdivision, any instrumentality of a State or its political subdivision, any public or private agency, institution, organization, or other entity, or any person to which Federal financial assistance is extended for any program or activity directly or through another recipient, including any successor, assignee, or transferee of a recipient, but excluding the ultimate beneficiary of the assistance. An entity or person receiving housing assistance payments from a recipient on behalf of eligible families under a housing assistance payments program or a voucher program is not a recipient or subrecipient merely by virtue of receipt of such payments.

[53 FR 20233, June 2, 1988; 54 FR 8188, Feb. 27, 1989]
§ 8.4
Discrimination prohibited.
(a) No qualified individual with handicaps shall, solely on the basis of handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance from the Department.
(b)(1) A recipient, in providing any housing, aid, benefit, or service in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance from the Department may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, solely on the basis of handicap:
(i) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to participate in, or benefit from, the housing, aid, benefit, or service;
(ii) Afford a qualified individual with handicaps an opportunity to participate in, or benefit from, the housing, aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded to others;
(iii) Provide a qualified individual with handicaps with any housing, aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording the individual an equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;
(iv) Provide different or separate housing, aid, benefits, or services to individuals with handicaps or to any class of individuals with handicaps from that provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with handicaps with housing, aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others.
(v) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified individual with handicaps by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of handicap in providing any housing, aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries in the recipient's federally assisted program or activity;
(vi) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards;
(vii) Deny a dwelling to an otherwise qualified buyer or renter because of a handicap of that buyer or renter or a person residing in or intending and eligible to reside in that dwelling after it is sold, rented or made available; or
(viii) Otherwise limit a qualified individual with handicaps in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by other qualified individuals receiving the housing, aid, benefit, or service.
(2) For purposes of this part, housing, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for individuals with handicaps and non-handicapped persons, but must afford individuals with handicaps equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement.
(3) A recipient may not deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to participate in any federally assisted program or activity that is not separate or different despite the existence of permissibly separate or different programs or activities.
(4) In any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department, a recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose or effect of which would:
(i) Subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination solely on the basis of handicap;
(ii) Defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's federally assisted program or activity for qualified individuals with a particular handicap involved in the program or activity, unless the recipient can demonstrate that the criteria or methods of administration are manifestly related to the accomplishment of an objective of a program or activity; or
(iii) Perpetuate the discrimination of another recipient if both recipients are
subject to common administrative control or are agencies of the same State.
(5) In determining the site or location of a federally assisted facility, an applicant for assistance or a recipient may not make selections the purpose or effect of which would:
(i) Exclude qualified individuals with handicaps from, deny them the benefits of, or otherwise subject them to discrimination under, any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance from the Department, or
(ii) Defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity with respect to qualified individuals with handicaps.
(6) As used in this section, the housing, aid, benefit, or service provided under a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance includes any housing, aid, benefit, or service provided in or through a facility that has been constructed, altered, leased or rented, or otherwise acquired, in whole or in part, with Federal financial assistance.
(c)(1) Non-handicapped persons may be excluded from the benefits of a program if the program is limited by Federal statute or executive order to individuals with handicaps. A specific class of individuals with handicaps may be excluded from a program if the program is limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of individuals.
(2) Certain Department programs operate under statutory definitions of
handicapped person
that are more restrictive than the definition of
individual with handicaps
contained in § 8.3. Those definitions are not superseded or otherwise affected by this regulation.
(d) Recipients shall administer programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with handicaps.
(e) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that, based on handicap, imposes inconsistent or contradictory prohibitions or limits upon the eligibility of qualified individuals with handicaps to receive services or to practice any occupation or profession.
(f) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section does not limit the general prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.
[53 FR 20233, June 2, 1988; 53 FR 28115, July 26, 1988, as amended at 83 FR 23961, June 7, 2018]
§ 8.5
[Reserved]
§ 8.6
Communications.
(a) The recipient shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, beneficiaries, and members of the public.
(1) The recipient shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
(i) In determining what auxiliary aids are necessary, the recipient shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.
(ii) The recipient is not required to provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.
(2) Where a recipient communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective communication systems shall be used.
(b) The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to ensure that interested persons (including persons with impaired vision or hearing) can obtain information concerning the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.
(c) This section does not require a recipient to take any action that the recipient can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. If an action would result in such an alteration or burdens, the recipient shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services
of the program or activity receiving HUD assistance.

# Subpart B—Employment
§ 8.10
General prohibitions against employment discrimination.
(a) No qualified individual with handicaps shall, solely on the basis of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance from the Department.
(b) A recipient may not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or employees in any way that adversely affects their opportunities or status because of handicap.
(c) The prohibition against discrimination in employment applies to the following activities:
(1) Recruitment, advertising, and the processing of applications for employment;
(2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, award of tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, right of return from layoff, injury or illness, and rehiring;
(3) Rates of pay or any other form of compensation and changes in compensation;
(4) Job assignments, job classifications, organizational structures, position descriptions, lines of progression, and seniority lists;
(5) Leaves of absence, sick leave, or any other leave;
(6) Fringe benefits available by virtue of employment, whether or not administered by the recipient;
(7) Selection and financial support for training, including apprenticeship, professional meetings, conferences, and other related activities, and selection for leaves of absence for training;
(8) Employer sponsored activities, including social or recreational programs; and
(9) Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment.
(d) A recipient may not participate in a contractual or other relationship that has the effect of subjecting qualified applicants with handicaps or employees with handicaps to discrimination prohibited by this subpart. The relationships referred to in this paragraph (d) include relationships with employment and referral agencies, labor unions, organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the recipient, and organizations providing training and apprenticeship programs.
§ 8.11
Reasonable accommodation.
(a) A recipient shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified applicant with handicaps or employee with handicaps, unless the recipient can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program.
(b) Reasonable accommodation may include:
(1) Making facilities used by employees accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps and
(2) Job restructuring, job relocation, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisitions or modification of equipment or devices, the provision of readers or interpreters, and other similar actions.
(c) In determining, under paragraph (a) of this section, whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of a recipient's program, factors to be considered include:
(1) The overall size of the recipient's program with respect to number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget;
(2) The type of the recipient's operation, including the composition and structure of the recipient's workforce; and
(3) The nature and cost of the accommodation needed.
(d) A recipient may not deny any employment opportunity to a qualified handicapped employee or applicant if the basis for the denial is the need to make reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental limitations of the employee or applicant.
§ 8.12
Employment criteria.
(a) A recipient may not use any employment test or other selection criterion that screens out or tends to screen out individuals with handicaps or any class of individuals with handicaps unless:
(1) The recipient demonstrates that the test score or other selection criterion, as used by the recipient, is job-related for the position in question; and
(2) The appropriate HUD official demonstrates that alternative job-related tests or criteria that tend to screen out fewer individuals with handicaps are unavailable.
(b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning employment to ensure that, when administered to an applicant or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's or employee's job skills, aptitude, or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than the applicant's or employee's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).
§ 8.13
Preemployment inquiries.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a recipient may not make a preemployment inquiry or conduct a preemployment medical examination of an applicant to determine whether the applicant is an individual with handicaps or the nature or severity of a handicap. A recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform job-related functions.
(b) When a recipient is undertaking affirmative action efforts, voluntary or otherwise, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped, if the following conditions are met:
(1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose, or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is used, that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations, or its voluntary or affirmative action efforts; and
(2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential (as provided in paragraph (d) of this section), that refusal to provide the information will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and that the information will be used only in accordance with this part.
(c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted before the employee's entrance on duty if all entering employees in that category of job classification must take such an examination regardless of handicap, and the results of such examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this part.
(d) Information obtained under this section concerning the medical condition or history of the applicant is to be collected and maintained on separate forms that are accorded confidentiality as medical records, except that:
(1) Supervisors and managers may be informed of restrictions on the work or duties of individuals with handicaps and informed of necessary accommodations;
(2) First aid and safety personnel may be informed if the condition might require emergency treatment; and
(3) Government officials investigating compliance with section 504 shall be provided relevant information upon request.

# Subpart C—Program Accessibility
§ 8.20
General requirement concerning program accessibility.
Except as otherwise provided in §§ 8.21(c)(1), 8.24(a), 8.25, and 8.31, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because a recipient's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance.
§ 8.21
Non-housing facilities.
(a)
New construction.
New non-housing facilities shall be designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.
(b)
Alterations to facilities.
Alterations to existing non-housing facilities shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be
made to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. For purposes of this paragraph, the phrase
to the maximum extent feasible
shall not be interpreted as requiring that a recipient make a non-housing facility, or element thereof, accessible if doing so would impose undue financial and administrative burdens on the operation of the recipient's program or activity.
(c)
Existing non-housing facilities
—(1)
General.
A recipient shall operate each non-housing program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—
(i) Necessarily require a recipient to make each of its existing non-housing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
(ii) In the case of historic preservation programs or activities, require the recipient to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or
(iii) Require a recipient to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the recipient shall take any action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
(2)
Methods
—(i)
General.
A recipient may comply with the requirements of this section in its programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance through such means as location of programs or services to accessible facilities or accessible portions of facilities, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, the addition or redesign of equipment (e.g., appliances or furnishings) changes in management policies or procedures, acquisition or construction of additional facilities, or alterations to existing facilities on a selective basis, or any other methods that result in making its program or activity accessible to individuals with handicaps. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the recipient shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
(ii)
Historic preservation programs or activities.
In meeting the requirements of § 8.21(c) in historic preservation programs or activities, a recipient shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 8.21(c)(1)(ii) or (iii), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible; assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or adopting other innovative methods.
(3)
Time period for compliance.
The recipient shall comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty days of July 11, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three years of July 11, 1988, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
(4)
Transition plan.
If structural changes to non-housing facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, a recipient shall develop, within six months of July 11, 1988, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps. A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—
(i) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;
(ii) Describe in details the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;
(iii) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period;
(iv) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan; and

§ 8.22
New construction—housing facilities.
(a) New multifamily housing projects (including public housing and Indian housing projects as required by § 8.25) shall be designed and constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.
(b) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, a minimum of five percent of the total dwelling units or at least one unit in a multifamily housing project, whichever is greater, shall be made accessible for persons with mobility impairments. A unit that is on an accessible route and is adaptable and otherwise in compliance with the standards set forth in § 8.32 is accessible for purposes of this section. An additional two percent of the units (but not less than one unit) in such a project shall be accessible for persons with hearing or vision impairments.
(c) HUD may prescribe a higher percentage or number than that prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section for any area upon request therefor by any affected recipient or by any State or local government or agency thereof based upon demonstration to the reasonable satisfaction of HUD of a need for a higher percentage or number, based on census data or other available current data (including a currently effective Housing Assistance Plan or Comprehensive Homeless Assistance Plan), or in response to evidence of a need for a higher percentage or number received in any other manner. In reviewing such request or otherwise assessing the existence of such needs, HUD shall take into account the expected needs of eligible persons with and without handicaps.

§ 8.23
Alterations of existing housing facilities.
(a)
Substantial alteration.
If alterations are undertaken to a project (including a public housing project as required by § 8.25(a)(2)) that has 15 or more units and the cost of the alterations is 75 percent or more of the replacement cost of the completed facility, then the provisions of § 8.22 shall apply.
(b)
Other alterations.
(1) Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, alterations to dwelling units in a multifamily housing project (including public housing) shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be made to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. If alterations of single elements or spaces of a dwelling unit, when considered together, amount to an alteration of a dwelling unit, the entire dwelling unit shall be made accessible. Once five percent of the dwelling units in a project are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with mobility impairments, then no additional elements of dwelling units, or entire dwelling units, are required to be accessible under this paragraph. Alterations to common areas or parts of facilities that affect accessibility of existing housing facilities shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be made to be accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. For purposes of this paragraph, the phrase
to the maximum extent feasible
shall not be interpreted as requiring that a recipient (including a PHA) make a dwelling unit, common area, facility or element thereof accessible if doing so would impose undue financial and administrative burdens on the operation of the multifamily housing project.
(2) HUD may prescribe a higher percentage or number than that prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for any area upon request therefor by any affected recipient or by any
State or local government or agency thereof based upon demonstration to the reasonable satisfaction of HUD of a need for a higher percentage or number, based on census data or other available current data (including a currently effective Housing Assistance Plan or Comprehensive Homeless Assistance Plan), or in response to evidence of a need for a higher percentage or number received in any other manner. In reviewing such request or otherwise assessing the existence of such needs, HUD shall take into account the expected needs of eligible persons with and without handicaps.
§ 8.24
Existing housing programs.
(a)
General.
A recipient shall operate each existing housing program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—
(1) Necessarily require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
(2) Require a recipient to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the recipient shall take any action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
(b)
Methods.
A recipient may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, provision of housing or related services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing housing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section or to provide supportive services that are not part of the program. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the recipient shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
(c)
Time period for compliance.
The recipient shall comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty days of July 11, 1988 except that—
(1) In a public housing program where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within the timeframes established in § 8.25(c).
(2) In other housing programs, where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three years of July 11, 1988, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
(d)
Transition plan and time period for structural changes.
Except as provided in § 8.25(c), in the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, a recipient shall develop, within six months of July 11, 1988, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps. A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—
(1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;
(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;
(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period;
(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan; and
(5) Identify the persons or groups with whose assistance the plan was prepared.

§ 8.25
Public housing and multi-family Indian housing.
(a)
Development and alteration of public housing and multi-family Indian housing.
(1) The requirements of § 8.22 shall apply to all newly constructed public housing and multi-family Indian housing.
(2) The requirements of § 8.23 shall apply to public housing and multi-family Indian housing developed through rehabilitation and to the alteration of public housing and multi-family Indian housing.
(3) In developing public housing and multi-family Indian housing through the purchase of existing properties PHAs and IHAs shall give priority to facilities which are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.
(b)
Existing public housing and multi-family Indian housing—general.
The requirements of § 8.24(a) shall apply to public housing and multi-family Indian housing programs.
(c)
Existing public housing and multi-family Indian housing—needs assessment and transition plan.
As soon as possible, each PHA (for the purpose of this paragraph, this includes an Indian Housing Authority) shall assess, on a PHA-wide basis, the needs of current tenants and applicants on its waiting list for accessible units and the extent to which such needs have not been met or cannot reasonably be met within four years through development, alterations otherwise contemplated, or other programs administered by the PHA (e.g., Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation or Section 8 Existing Housing or Housing Vouchers). If the PHA currently has no accessible units or if the PHA or HUD determines that information regarding the availability of accessible units has not been communicated sufficiently so that, as a result, the number of eligible qualified individuals with handicaps on the waiting list is not fairly representative of the number of such persons in the area, the PHA's assessment shall include the needs of eligible qualified individuals with handicaps in the area. If the PHA determines, on the basis of such assessment, that there is no need for additional accessible dwelling units or that the need is being or will be met within four years through other means, such as new construction, Section 8 or alterations otherwise contemplated, no further action is required by the PHA under this paragraph. If the PHA determines, on the basis of its needs assessment, that alterations to make additional units accessible must be made so that the needs of eligible qualified individuals with handicaps may be accommodated proportionally to the needs of non-handicapped individuals in the same categories, then the PHA shall develop a transition plan to achieve program accessibility. The PHA shall complete the needs assessment and transition plan, if one is necessary, as expeditiously as possible, but in any event no later than two years after July 11, 1988. The PHA shall complete structural changes necessary to achieve program accessibility as soon as possible but in any event no later than four years after July 11, 1988. The Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity and the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing may extend the four year period for a period not to exceed two years, on a case-by-case determination that compliance within that period would impose undue financial and administrative burdens on the operation of the recipient's public housing and multi-family Indian housing program. The Secretary or the Undersecretary may further extend this time period in extraordinary circumstances, for a period not to exceed one year. The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps. A copy of the needs assessment and transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The transition plan shall, at a minimum—
(1) Identify physical obstacles in the PHA's facilities (e.g., dwelling units
and common areas) that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;
(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the PHA's facilities accessible. A PHA may, if necessary, provide in its plan that it will seek HUD approval, under 24 CFR part 968, of a comprehensive modernization program to meet the needs of eligible individuals with handicaps;
(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period;
(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan; and
(5) Identify the persons or groups with whose assistance the plan was prepared.

§ 8.26
Distribution of accessible dwelling units.
Accessible dwelling units required by § 8.22, 8.23, 8.24 or 8.25 shall, to the maximum extent feasible and subject to reasonable health and safety requirements, be distributed throughout projects and sites and shall be available in a sufficient range of sizes and amenities so that a qualified individual with handicaps' choice of living arrangements is, as a whole, comparable to that of other persons eligible for housing assistance under the same program. This provision shall not be construed to require provision of an elevator in any multifamily housing project solely for the purpose of permitting location of accessible units above or below the accessible grade level.
§ 8.27
Occupancy of accessible dwelling units.
(a) Owners and managers of multifamily housing projects having accessible units shall adopt suitable means to assure that information regarding the availability of accessible units reaches eligible individuals with handicaps, and shall take reasonable nondiscriminatory steps to maximize the utilization of such units by eligible individuals whose disability requires the accessibility features of the particular unit. To this end, when an accessible unit becomes vacant, the owner or manager before offering such units to a non-handicapped applicant shall offer such unit:
(1) First, to a current occupant of another unit of the same project, or comparable projects under common control, having handicaps requiring the accessibility features of the vacant unit and occupying a unit not having such features, or, if no such occupant exists, then
(2) Second, to an eligible qualified applicant on the waiting list having a handicap requiring the accessibility features of the vacant unit.
(b) When offering an accessible unit to an applicant not having handicaps requiring the accessibility features of the unit, the owner or manager may require the applicant to agree (and may incorporate this agreement in the lease) to move to a non-accessible unit when available.
§ 8.28
Housing voucher programs.
(a) In carrying out the requirements of this subpart, a recipient administering a Section 8 housing voucher program shall:
(1) In providing notice of the availability and nature of housing assistance for low-income families under program requirements, adopt suitable means to assure that the notice reaches eligible individuals with handicaps;
(2) In its activities to encourage participation by owners, include encouragement of participation by owners having accessible units;
(3) When issuing a Housing Voucher to a family which includes an individual with handicaps include a current listing of available accessible units known to the PHA and, if necessary, otherwise assist the family in locating an available accessible dwelling unit;
(4) Take into account the special problem of ability to locate an accessible unit when considering requests by eligible individuals with handicaps for extensions of Housing Vouchers; and
(5) If necessary as a reasonable accommodation for a person with disabilities, approve a family request for an exception payment standard under § 982.503(d)(5) for a regular tenancy under the Section 8 voucher program so that the program is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities.
(b) In order to ensure that participating owners do not discriminate in the recipient's federally assisted program, a recipient shall enter into a HUD-approved contract with participating owners, which contract shall include necessary assurances of nondiscrimination.
[53 FR 20233, June 2, 1988, as amended at 63 FR 23853, Apr. 30, 1998; 89 FR 38290, May 7, 2024]
§ 8.29
Homeownership programs (sections 235(i) and 235(j), Turnkey III and Indian housing mutual self-help programs).
Any housing units newly constructed or rehabilitated for purchase or single family (including semi-attached and attached) units to be constructed or rehabilitated in a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance shall be made accessible upon request of the prospective buyer if the nature of the handicap of an expected occupant so requires. In such case, the buyer shall consult with the seller or builder/sponsor regarding the specific design features to be provided. If accessibility features selected at the option of the homebuyer are ones covered by the standards prescribed by § 8.32, those features shall comply with the standards prescribed in § 8.32. The buyer shall be permitted to depart from particular specifications of these standards in order to accommodate his or her specific handicap. The cost of making a facility accessible under this paragraph may be included in the mortgage amount within the allowable mortgage limits, where applicable. To the extent such costs exceed allowable mortgage limits, they may be passed on to the prospective homebuyer, subject to maximum sales price limitations (see 24 CFR 235.320.)
§ 8.30
Rental rehabilitation program.
Each grantee or state recipient in the rental rehabilitation program shall, subject to the priority in 24 CFR 511.10(l) and in accordance with other requirements in 24 CFR part 511, give priority to the selection of projects that will result in dwelling units being made readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.
[53 FR 20233, June 2, 1988; 53 FR 28115, July 26, 1988]
§ 8.31
Historic properties.
If historic properties become subject to alterations to which this part applies the requirements of § 4.1.7 of the standards of § 8.32 of this part shall apply, except in the case of the Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) program. In the UDAG program the requirements of 36 CFR part 801 shall apply. Accessibility to historic properties subject to alterations need not be provided if such accessibility would substantially impair the significant historic features of the property or result in undue financial and administrative burdens.
§ 8.32
Accessibility standards.
(a) Effective as of July 11, 1988, design, construction, or alteration of buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of §§ 8.21, 8.22, 8.23, and 8.25 with respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and scoping requirements of the UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the building is provided. The alteration of housing facilities shall also be in conformance with additional scoping requirements contained in this part. Persons interested in obtaining a copy of the UFAS are directed to § 40.7 of this title.
(b) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the employment or residence
therein of individuals with physical handicaps.
(c) This section does not require recipients to make building alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.
(d) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.4(11) of UFAS may not be used to waive or lower the minimum of five percent accessible units required by § 8.22(b) or to apply the minimum only to projects of 15 or more dwelling units.
(e) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the provisions of §§ 8.21 (a) and (b), 8.22 (a) and (b), 8.23, 8.25(a) (1) and (2), and 8.29 shall apply to facilities that are designed, constructed or altered after July 11, 1988. If the design of a facility was commenced before July 11, 1988, the provisions shall be followed to the maximum extent practicable, as determined by the Department. For purposes of this paragraph, the date a facility is constructed or altered shall be deemed to be the date bids for the construction or alteration of the facility are solicited. For purposes of the Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) program, the provisions shall apply to the construction or alteration of facilities that are funded under applications submitted after July 11, 1988. If the UDAG application was submitted before July 11, 1988, the provisions shall apply, to the maximum extent practicable, as determined by the Department.
[53 FR 20233, June 2, 1988, as amended at 61 FR 5203, Feb. 9, 1996]
§ 8.33
Housing adjustments.
A recipient shall modify its housing policies and practices to ensure that these policies and practices do not discriminate, on the basis of handicap, against a qualified individual with handicaps. The recipient may not impose upon individuals with handicaps other policies, such as the prohibition of assistive devices, auxiliary alarms, or guides in housing facilities, that have the effect of limiting the participation of tenants with handicaps in the recipient's federally assisted housing program or activity in violation of this part. Housing policies that the recipient can demonstrate are essential to the housing program or activity will not be regarded as discriminatory within the meaning of this section if modifications to them would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program or activity or undue financial and administrative burdens.

§ 8.50
Assurances required.
(a)
Assurances.
An applicant for Federal financial assistance for a program or activity to which this part applies shall submit an assurance to HUD, or in the case of a subrecipient to a primary recipient, on a form specified by the responsible civil rights official, that the program or activity will be operated in compliance with this part. An applicant may incorporate these assurances by reference in subsequent applications to the Department.
(b)
Duration of obligation.
(1) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended in the form of real property or to provide real property or structures on the property, the assurance will obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for the purpose for which Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.
(2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide personal property, the assurance will obligate the recipient for the period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.
(3) In all other cases the assurance will obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.
(c)
Covenants.
(1) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from the Department, the instrument effecting or recording this transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.
(2) Where no transfer of property is involved but property is purchased or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent transfer of the property.
(3) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from the Department, the covenant shall also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on the property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the Secretary may, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such conditions as he or she deems appropriate, agree to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.

Remedial and affirmative action.
(a)
Remedial action.

(ii) With respect to individuals with handicaps who would have been participants in the program had the discrimination not occurred.
(b)
Voluntary action.
A recipient may take nondiscriminatory steps, in addition to any action that is required by this part, to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity by qualified individuals with handicaps.

with respect to complaints from applicants for employment or from applicants for admission to housing covered by this part.
§ 8.54
Notice.
(a) A recipient that employs fifteen or more persons shall take appropriate initial and continuing steps to notify participants, beneficiaries, applicants, and employees, including those with impaired vision or hearing, and unions or professional organizations holding collective bargaining or professional agreements with the recipient that it does not discriminate on the basis of handicap in violation of this part. The notification shall state, where appropriate, that the recipient does not discriminate in admission or access to, or treatment or employment in, its federally assisted programs and activities. The notification shall also include an identification of the responsible employee designated pursuant to § 8.53. A recipient shall make the initial notification required by this paragraph within 90 days of July 11, 1988.

If an informal resolution of the complaint is not reached the responsible civil rights official or his or her designee shall, within 180 days of receipt of the complaint, notify the recipient and the complainant (if any) of the results of the investigation in a letter sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, containing the following:
(1) Preliminary findings of fact and a preliminary finding of compliance or noncompliance;
(2) A description of an appropriate remedy for each violation believed to exist;
(3) A notice that a copy of the Final Investigative Report of the Department will be made available, upon request, to the recipient and the complainant (if any); and

(3) The reviewing civil rights official shall either sustain or modify the letter of findings within 60 days of the request for review. The reviewing civil rights official's decision shall constitute the formal determination.
(4) If neither party requests that the letter of findings be reviewed, the responsible civil rights official shall, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the expiration of the time period in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, send a formal written determination of compliance or noncompliance to the recipient and copies to the award official.

Informal resolution/voluntary compliance
—(1)
General.
It is the policy of the Department to encourage the informal resolution of matters. The responsible civil rights official may attempt to resolve a matter through informal means at any stage of processing. A matter may be resolved by informal means at any time. If a letter of findings making a preliminary finding of noncompliance is issued, the responsible civil rights official shall attempt to resolve the matter by informal means.
(2)
Objectives of informal resolution/voluntary compliance.
In attempting informal resolution, the responsible civil rights official shall attempt to achieve a just resolution of the matter and to obtain assurances where appropriate, that the recipient will satisfactorily remedy any violations of the rights of any complainant and will take such action as will assure the elimination of any violation of this part or the prevention of the occurrence of such violation in the future. The terms of such an informal resolution shall be reduced to a written voluntary compliance agreement, signed by the recipient and the responsible civil rights official, and be made part of the file for the matter. Such voluntary compliance agreements shall seek to protect the interests of the complainant (if any), other persons similarly situated, and the public interest.
(k)
Intimidatory or retaliatory acts prohibited.
No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any person for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by this part, or because he or she has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of investigation, hearing or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.

§ 8.57
Procedure for effecting compliance.
(a)
General.
If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance, or by other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to:
(1) A referral to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States, or any assurance or other contractual undertaking;
(2) The initiation of debarment proceedings pursuant to 2 CFR part 2424; and
(3) Any applicable proceeding under State or local law.
(b)
Noncompliance with § 8.50.
If an applicant or a recipient of assistance under a contract which is extended or amended on or after July 11, 1988, fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 8.50 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with the requirements imposed by that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused under paragraph (c) of this section. The Department is not required to provide assistance during the pendency of the administrative proceeding under such paragraph (c), except where the assistance is due and payable under a contract approved before July 11, 1988.
(c)
Termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance.
No order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until:
(1) The responsible civil rights official has advised the applicant or recipient of its failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;
(2) There has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed under this part;
(3) The action has been approved by the Secretary; and
(4) The expiration of 30 days after the Secretary has filed with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate, or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in
which such noncompliance has been so found.
(d)
Notice to State or local government.
Whenever the Secretary determines that a State or unit of general local government which is a recipient of Federal financial assistance under title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5301-5318) has failed to comply with a requirement of this part with respect to a program or activity funded in whole or in part with such assistance, the Secretary shall notify the Governor of the State or the chief executive officer of the unit of general local government of the noncompliance and shall request the Governor or the chief executive officer to secure compliance. The notice shall be given at least sixty days before:
(1) An order suspending, terminating, or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance becomes effective under paragraph (c) of this section; or
(2) Any action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law is taken under paragraph (a) of this section.
(e)
Other means authorized by law.
No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:
(1) The responsible civil rights official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means;
(2) The recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and
(3) At least 10 days have elapsed since the mailing of such notice to the applicant or recipient. During this period, additional efforts shall be made to persuade the applicant or recipient to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.
However, this paragraph shall not be construed to prevent an award official from utilizing appropriate procedures and sanctions established under the program to assure or secure compliance with a specific requirement of the program designed to effectuate the objectives of this part.

§ 8.58
Hearings.
(a)
Opportunity for hearing.
Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 8.57(c), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action. The notice shall:
(1) Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of the notice for the applicant or recipient to request the administrative law judge to schedule a hearing, or
(2) Advise the applicant or recipient that the matter has been scheduled for hearing at a stated time and place. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set is a waiver of the right to a hearing under § 8.57(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of available information.
(b)
Hearing procedures.
Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with 24 CFR part 180.

§ 9.101
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to effectuate section 119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978, which amended section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability in programs or activities conducted by Executive agencies or the United States Postal Service.
§ 9.102
Applicability.
This part applies to all programs or activities conducted by the agency, except for programs or activities conducted outside the United States that do not involve individuals with disabilities in the United States.
§ 9.103
Definitions.
For purposes of this part:
Accessible:
(1) When used with respect to the design, construction, or alteration of a facility or a portion of a facility other than an individual dwelling unit, means that the facility or portion of the facility when designed, constructed or altered, complies with applicable accessibility standards and can be approached, entered, and used by individuals with physical disabilities. The phrase “accessible to and usable by” is synonymous with accessible.
(2) When used with respect to the design, construction, or alteration of an individual dwelling unit, means that the unit is located on an accessible route and, when designed, constructed, altered or adapted, complies with applicable accessibility standards, and can be approached, entered, and used by individuals with physical disabilities. A unit that is on an accessible route and is adaptable and otherwise in compliance with the standards set forth in § 9.151 is “accessible” within the meaning of this definition. When a unit in an existing facility which is being made accessible as a result of alterations is intended for use by a specific qualified individual with disabilities (e.g., a current occupant of such unit or of another unit under the control of the same agency, or an applicant on a waiting list), the unit will be deemed accessible if it meets the requirements of applicable standards that address the particular disability or impairment of such person.
Accessible route
means a continuous unobstructed path connecting accessible elements and spaces of a building or facility. Interior accessible routes may include corridors, floors, ramps, elevators, lifts, and clear floor space at fixtures. Exterior accessible routes may include parking access aisles, curb ramps, crosswalks at vehicular ways, walks, ramps and lifts.
ADA
means the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 through 12213)
ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG)
means the Accessibility Guidelines issued under the ADA, and which are codified in the Appendix to 39 CFR part 1191.
Adaptability
means the ability of certain building, spaces and elements, such as kitchen counters, sinks, and grab bars, to be added or altered, to accommodate the needs of persons with or without disabilities, or to accommodate the needs of persons with different types or degrees of disability. For example, in a unit adaptable for a person with impaired hearing, the wiring for
visible emergency alarms may be installed but the alarms need not be installed until such time as the unit is made ready for occupancy by a person with impaired hearing.
Agency
means the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Alteration
means a change to a building or facility or its permanent fixtures or equipment that affects or could affect the usability of the building or facility or part thereof. Alterations include, but are not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, changes or rearrangements of the structural parts and changes or rearrangements in the plan configuration of walls and full-height partitions. Normal maintenance, re-roofing, painting, or wallpapering or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability of the building or facility.
Assistant Attorney General
means the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, United States Department of Justice.
Assistant Secretary
means the Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.
Auxiliary aids
means services or devices that enable persons with impaired sensory, manual, or communication skills to have an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, programs or activities conducted by the agency. For example, auxiliary aids useful for persons with impaired vision include readers, Brailled materials, audio recordings, and other similar services and devices. Auxiliary aids useful for persons with impaired hearing include telephone handset amplifiers, telephones compatible with hearing aids, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's), interpreters, note takers, written materials, and other similar services and devices.
Complete complaint
means a written statement that contains the complainant's name and address and describes the agency's alleged discriminatory action in sufficient detail to inform the agency of the nature and date of the alleged violation of section 504. It shall be signed by the complainant or by someone authorized to do so on his or her behalf. Complaints filed on behalf of classes or third parties shall describe or identify (by name, if possible) the alleged victims of discrimination.
Current illegal use of drugs
means illegal use of drugs that occurred recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that a person's drug use is current or that continuing use is a real and ongoing problem.
Drug
means a controlled substance, as defined in schedules I through V of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812).
Facility
means all or any portion of buildings, structures, site improvements, complexes, equipment, roads, walks, passageways, parking lots, rolling stock or other conveyances, or other real or personal property located on a site.
Historic properties
means those properties that are listed or are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, or such properties designated as historic under a statute of the appropriate State or local government body.
Illegal use of drugs
means the use of one or more drugs, the possession or distribution of which is unlawful under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812).

[Reserved]
§ 9.130
General prohibitions against discrimination.
(a) No qualified individual with disabilities shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.
(b)(1) The agency, in providing any housing, aid, benefit, or service, may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of disability—
(i) Deny a qualified individual with disabilities the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the housing, aid, benefit, or service;
(ii) Afford a qualified individual with disabilities an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the housing, aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;
(iii) Provide a qualified individual with disabilities with any housing, aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;
(iv) Provide different or separate housing, aid, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any class of individuals with disabilities than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with disabilities with housing, aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;
(v) Deny a qualified individual with disabilities the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards;
(vi) Deny a dwelling to an otherwise qualified buyer or renter because of a disability of that buyer or renter or a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is sold, rented or made available; or
(vii) Otherwise limit a qualified individual with disabilities in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the housing, aid, benefit, or service.
(2) For purposes of this part, housing, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for individuals with disabilities and for persons without disabilities, but must afford individuals with disabilities equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement.
(3) The agency may not deny a qualified individual with disabilities the opportunity to participate in programs or activities that are not separate or different, despite the existence of programs or activities that are permissibly separate or different for persons with disabilities.
(4) The agency may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose or effect of which would:
(i) Subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability; or
(ii) Defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals with disabilities.
(5) The agency may not, in determining the site or location of a facility, make selections the purpose or effect of which would:
(i) Exclude individuals with disabilities from, deny them the benefits of, or otherwise subject them to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency; or
(ii) Defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals with disabilities.
(6) The agency, in the selection of procurement contractors, may not use criteria that subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability.
(7) The agency may not administer a licensing or certification program in a manner that subjects qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability, nor may the agency establish requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified entities that subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability. However, the programs or activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are not, themselves, covered by this part.
(c)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, persons without disabilities may be excluded from the benefits of a program if the program is limited by Federal statute or Executive order to individuals with disabilities. A specific class of individuals with disabilities may be excluded from a program if the program is limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of individuals.
(2) Certain agency programs operate under statutory definitions of “persons with disabilities” that are more restrictive than the definition of “individual with disabilities” contained in § 9.103. Those definitions are not superseded or otherwise affected by this regulation.
(d) The agency shall administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities.
(e) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that, based on disability, imposes inconsistent or contradictory prohibitions or limits upon the eligibility of qualified individuals with disabilities to receive services or to practice any occupation or profession.
(f) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section does not limit the general prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.
§ 9.131
Direct threat.
(a) This part does not require the agency to permit an individual to participate in, or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of that agency when that individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others.
(b) “Direct threat” means a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services.
(c) In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others, the agency must make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk.
§§ 9.132-9.139
[Reserved]
§ 9.140
Employment.
No qualified individual with disabilities shall, on the basis of disability, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613 (subpart G), shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities.
§§ 9.141-9.148
[Reserved]
§ 9.149
Program accessibility: discrimination prohibited.
Except as otherwise provided in § 9.150, no qualified individual with disabilities shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.
§ 9.150
Program accessibility: existing facilities.
(a)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This section does not—
(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities;
(2) In the case of historic properties, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or
(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 9.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Secretary or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
(b)
Methods.
The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, also shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate.
(c)
Time period for compliance.
The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty days of July 18, 1994 except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three years of July 18, 1994, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
(d)
Transition plan.
In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, within six months of July 18, 1994, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with disabilities or organizations representing individuals with disabilities, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—
(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with disabilities;
(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;
(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and
(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.
(e) The requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall apply to the Property Disposition Programs. However, this section does not require HUD to make alterations to existing facilities that are part of the Property Disposition Programs unless such alterations are necessary to meet the needs of a current or prospective tenant during the time when HUD expects to retain legal possession of the facilities, and there is no alternative method to meet the needs of that current or prospective tenant. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require alterations to make facilities accessible to persons with disabilities who are expected to occupy the facilities only after HUD relinquishes legal possession.
§ 9.151
Program accessibility: new construction and alterations.
Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered and provide emergency egress so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The definitions, requirements, and accessibility standards that apply to buildings covered by this section are those contained in the UFAS, except where the ADAAG provides for greater accessibility for the type of construction or alteration being undertaken, and in this case, the definitions, requirements and standards of the ADAAG shall apply.
§ 9.152
Program accessibility: alterations of Property Disposition Program multifamily housing facilities.
(a)
Substantial alteration.
If the agency undertakes alterations to a PDP multifamily housing project that has 15 or more units and the cost of the alterations is 75 percent or more of the replacement cost of the completed facility, then the project shall be designed and altered to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, a minimum of five percent of the total dwelling units, or at least one unit, whichever is greater, shall be made accessible for persons with mobility impairments. A unit that is on an accessible route and is adaptable and otherwise in compliance with the standards set forth in paragraph (d) of this section is accessible for purposes of this section. An additional two percent of the units (but not less that one unit) in such a project shall be accessible for persons with hearing or vision impairments. If state or local requirements for alterations require greater action than this paragraph, those requirements shall prevail.
(b)
Other alteration.
(1) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, alterations to dwelling units in a PDP multifamily housing project shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be made to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. If alterations of single elements or spaces of a dwelling unit, when considered together, amount to an alteration of a dwelling unit, the entire dwelling unit shall be made accessible. Once five percent of the dwelling units in a project are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with mobility impairments, then no additional elements of dwelling units, or entire dwelling units, are required to be accessible under this paragraph. Once two percent of the dwelling units in a project are readily accessible to or usable by individuals with hearing or vision impairments, then no additional elements of dwelling units, or entire dwelling units, are required to be accessible under this paragraph.
(2) Alterations to common areas or parts of facilities that affect accessibility of existing housing facilities, shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be made to be accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.
(c) The agency may establish a higher percentage or number of accessible units than that prescribed in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section if the agency determines that there is a need for a higher percentage or number, based on census data or other available current data. In making such a determination, HUD shall take into account the expected needs of eligible persons with and without disabilities.
(d) The definitions, requirements, and accessibility standards that apply to PDP multifamily housing projects covered by this section are those contained in the UFAS, except where the ADAAG provides for greater accessibility for the type of alteration being undertaken, and, in this case, the definitions, requirements and standards of the ADAAG shall apply.
(e) With respect to multifamily housing projects operated by HUD, but in which HUD does not have an ownership interest, alterations under this section need not be made if doing so would impose undue financial and administrative burdens on the operation of the multifamily housing project.
§ 9.153
Distribution of accessible dwelling units.
Accessible dwelling units required by § 9.152 shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be distributed throughout projects and sites and shall be available in a sufficient range of sizes and amenities so that a qualified individual with disabilities' choice of living arrangements is, as a whole, comparable to that of other persons eligible for housing assistance under the same agency conducted program. This provision shall not be construed to require (but does allow) the provision of an elevator in any multifamily housing project solely for the purpose of permitting location of accessible units above or below the accessible grade level.
§ 9.154
Occupancy of accessible dwelling units.
(a) The agency shall adopt suitable means to assure that information regarding the availability of accessible units in PDP housing facilities reaches eligible individuals with disabilities, and shall take reasonable nondiscriminatory steps to maximize the utilization of such units by eligible individuals whose disability requires the accessibility features of the particular unit. To this end, when an accessible unit becomes vacant, the agency (or its management agent) before offering such units to an applicant without disabilities shall offer such unit:
(1) First, to a current occupant of another unit of the same project, or comparable projects under common control, having disabilities requiring the accessibility features of the vacant unit and occupying a unit not having such features, or, if no such occupant exists, then
(2) Second, to an eligible qualified applicant on the waiting list having a disability requiring the accessibility features of the vacant unit.
(b) When offering an accessible unit to an applicant not having disabilities requiring the accessibility features of the unit, the agency may require the applicant to agree (and may incorporate this agreement in the lease) to move to a non-accessible unit when available.
§ 9.155
Housing adjustments.
(a) The agency shall modify its housing policies and practices as they relate to PDP housing facilities to ensure that these policies and practices do not discriminate, on the basis of disability, against a qualified individual with disabilities. The agency may not impose upon individuals with disabilities other policies, such as the prohibition of assistive devices, auxiliary aids, alarms, or guides in housing facilities, that have the effect of limiting the participation of tenants with disabilities in any agency conducted housing program or activity in violation of this part. Housing policies that the agency can demonstrate are essential to the housing program or activity will not be regarded as discriminatory within the
meaning of this section if modifications would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program or activity or undue financial and administrative burdens.
(b) The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Secretary or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
§ 9.160
Communications.
(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.
(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.
(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with disabilities.
(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.
(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries or members of the public by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.
(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.
(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.
(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with this section would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Secretary or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with § 9.160 would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
§ 9.170
Compliance procedures.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of disability in programs or activities conducted by the agency.
(b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613 under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).
(c) The Responsible Official shall coordinate implementation of this section.
(d) Persons may submit complete complaints to the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, 451 Seventh St., SW., Washington, DC 20410, or to any HUD Area Office. The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints for which the agency has jurisdiction. All complete complaints shall be filed within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may extend this time period for good cause. For purposes of determining when a complaint is filed, a complaint mailed to the agency shall be deemed filed on the date it is postmarked. Any other complaint shall be deemed filed on the date it is received by the agency. The agency shall acknowledge all complaints, in writing, within ten (10) working days of receipt of the complaint.
(e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government entity.
(f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The agency shall delete the identity of the complainant from the copy of the complaint.
(g)(1) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which it has jurisdiction, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity shall complete the investigation of the complaint, attempt informal resolution, and if no informal resolution is achieved, issue a letter of findings. If a complaint is filed against the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, the Secretary or a designee of the Secretary shall investigate and resolve the complaint through informal agreement or letter of findings.
(2) If a complaint is resolved informally, the terms of the agreement shall be reduced to writing and made part of the complaint file, with a copy of the agreement provided to the complainant and the agency. The written agreement may include a finding on the issue of discrimination and shall describe any corrective action to which the complainant and the respondent have agreed.
(3) If a complaint is not resolved informally, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity or a person designated under this paragraph shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation in a letter containing—
(i) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
(ii) A description of a remedy for each violation found;
(iii) A notice of the right to appeal to the Secretary;
(h)(1) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from the agency of the letter required by § 9.170(g). The Assistant Secretary or the person designated by the Secretary to decide an appeal of a complaint filed against the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity may extend this time for good cause.
(2) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the Assistant Secretary. Decisions on an appeal shall not be issued by the person who made the initial determination.
(i) The Assistant Secretary or the person designated by the Secretary to decide an appeal of a complaint filed against the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity shall notify the complainant of the results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If the agency determines that it needs additional information from the complainant, it shall have 60 days from the date it receives the additional information to make its determination on the appeal.
(j) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (i) of this section may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
(k) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint investigations to other Federal agencies, except that the authority for making
the final determination may not be delegated to another agency.

# Subpart A—General
§ 10.1
Policy.
It is the policy of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide for public participation in rulemaking with respect to all HUD programs and functions, including matters that relate to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts even though such matters would not otherwise be subject to rulemaking by law or Executive policy. The Department therefore publishes notices of proposed rulemaking in the
Federal Register
and gives interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking through submission of written data, views, and arguments with or without opportunity for oral presentation. It is the policy of the Department that its notices of proposed rulemaking are to afford the public not less than sixty days for submission of comments. For some rules the Secretary will employ additional methods of inviting public participation. These methods include, but are not limited to, publishing Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR), conducting public surveys, and convening public forums or panels. An ANPR will be used to solicit public comment early in the rulemaking process for significant rules unless the Secretary grants an exception based upon legitimate and pressing time constraints. Unless required by statute, notice and public procedure will be omitted if the Department determines in a particular case or class of cases that notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest. In a particular case, the reasons for the determination shall be stated in the rulemaking document. Notice and public procedure may also be omitted with respect to statements of policy, interpretative rules, rules governing the Department's organization or its own internal practices or procedures, or if a statute expressly so authorizes. A final substantive rule will be published not less than 30 days before its effective date, unless it grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction or unless the rule itself states good cause for taking effect upon publication or less than 30 days thereafter. Statements of policy and interpretative rules will usually be made effective on the date of publication.

§ 10.7
Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.
An Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued in accordance with § 10.1 of this part is published in the

§ 10.14
Hearings.
(a) The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557, which govern formal hearings in adjudicatory proceedings, do not apply to informal rule making proceedings described in this part. When opportunity is afforded for oral presentation, such informal
hearing
is a nonadversary, fact-finding proceeding. Any rule issued in a proceeding under this part in which a hearing is held is not based exclusively on the record of such hearing.
(b) When a hearing is provided, the Secretary will designate a representative to conduct the hearing, and if the presence of a legal officer is desirable, the General Counsel will designate a staff attorney to serve as the officer.
§ 10.16

All timely comments are considered in taking final action on a proposed rule. Each preamble to a final rule will contain a short analysis and evaluation of the relevant significant issues set forth in the comments submitted, and a clear concise statement of the basis and purpose of the rule.
§ 10.18
Petitions for reconsideration.
Petitions for reconsideration of a final rule will not be considered. Such petitions, if filed, will be treated as petitions for rulemaking in accordance with § 10.20.
§ 10.20
Petition for rulemaking.

If the Secretary finds that the petition does not contain adequate justification, the petition will be denied by letter or other notice, with a brief statement of the ground for denial. The Secretary may consider new evidence at any time; however, repetitious petitions for rulemaking will not be considered.

§ 14.120
Eligibility of applicants.
(a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term
party
is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B.
(b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
(1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;
(2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees;
(3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3), with not more than 500 employees;
(4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1141j(a), with not more than 500 employees; or
(5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.
(c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated. For the purpose of eligibility of applicants before the HUD Board of Contract Appeals, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the applicant filed its appeal under 41 U.S.C. 606.
(d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an
individual
rather than a
sole owner of an unincorporated business
if the issues on which the application prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.
(e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.
(f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interests of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute
special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
(g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.
§ 14.125
Standards for awards.
(a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the position of the agency over which the applicant has prevailed was substantially justified. The position of the agency includes, in addition to the position taken by the agency in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an ineligible prevailing applicant because the agency's position was substantially justified is on the agency counsel, who may avoid an award by showing that its position was reasonable in law and fact.
(b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the proceeding, if the applicant has falsified the application (including documentation) or net worth exhibit or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.
§ 14.130
Allowable fees and expenses.
(a) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules may exceed $75.00 per hour. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.
(b) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent or expert witness, the adjudicative officer shall consider the following:
(1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;
(2) The prevailing rate for the kind and quality of services furnished in the community in which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;
(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
(4) The time reasonably spent in the light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and
(5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.
(c) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the services does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.
§ 14.135
Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.
Any person may file with the Department a petition for rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees as provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(A)(ii), in accordance with 24 CFR part 10. The petition should identify the rate the petitioner believes the Department should establish and the types of proceedings in which the rate should be used. It should also explain fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted. The Department will respond to the petition in accordance with 24 CFR 10.20(b).
§ 14.140
Awards against other agencies.
If an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevails over another agency of the United States that participates in a proceeding before the Department and takes a position that is not substantially justified, the award or an appropriate portion of the award shall be made against that agency.

# Subpart B—Information Required From Applicants
§ 14.200
Contents of application.
(a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act shall identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and identify the position of the Department or other
agencies that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall also state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.
(b) The application shall also include a statement that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or $7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
(1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3), or, in the case of a tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under such section; or
(2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1141j(a).
(c) If the applicant is a partnership, corporation, association, or organization, or a sole owner of an unincorporated business, the applicant shall state that it did not have more than 500 employees at the time the proceeding was initiated, giving the number of its employees and describing briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.
(d) The application shall also itemize the amount of fees and expenses for which an award is sought.
(e) The application also may include any other matters that the applicant wishes the Department to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made.
(f) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an authorized officer with respect to the eligibility of the applicant and by the attorney of the applicant with respect to fees and expenses sought. The application shall contain or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or affirmation under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the application and all accompanying material is true and complete to the best of the applicant's or authorized officer's information and belief.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2510-0001)
§ 14.205
Net worth exhibit.
(a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or a qualified cooperative association must submit with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 14.120(f) of this part) when the proceeding was initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities, and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards of the Act and this part. The adjudicative officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.
(b) The net worth exhibit shall describe any transfers of assets from, or obligations incurred by, the applicant or any affiliate, occurring in the one-year period before the date on which the proceeding was initiated, that reduced the net worth of the applicant and its affiliates below the applicable net worth ceiling. If there were no such transactions, the applicant shall so state.
(c) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the adjudicative officer in a sealed envelope labeled “Confidential Financial Information,” accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b) (1)-(9)), why public disclosure of the information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be served on
counsel representing the agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the proceeding. If the adjudicative officer finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the Department's established procedures under the Freedom of Information Act, 24 CFR part 15. In either case, disclosure shall be subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and the Department's procedures implementing the Privacy Act of 1974 at 24 CFR part 16.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2510-0001)
§ 14.210
Documentation of fees and expenses.
(a) The application shall be accompanied by full and itemized documentation of the fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award is sought.
(b) The documentation shall include an affidavit from any attorney, agent or expert witness representing or appearing in behalf of the party, stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses were computed and describing the specific services performed.
(c) The documentation shall also include a description of any expenses for which reimbursement is sought and a statement of the amounts paid and payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. Vouchers, receipts, logs, or other substantiation for any expenses paid or payable shall be provided.
(d) The adjudicative officer may require the applicant to provide additional substantiation for any expenses claimed.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2510-0001)
§ 14.215
When an application may be filed.
(a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after the Department's final disposition of the proceeding.
(b) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the date on which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the proceeding or any other complete resolution of the proceeding, such as a settlement of voluntary dismissal, become final and unappealable, both within the Department and to the courts.
(c) If review or reconsideration (under HUD Board of Contract Appeals Rule 29, 24 CFR 20.10) is sought or taken of a decision as to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy. When the United States appeals the underlying merits of an adversary adjudication to a court, no decision on an application for fees and other expenses in connection with that adversary adjudication shall be made until a final and unreviewable decision is rendered by the court on the appeal or until the underlying merits of the case have been finally determined pursuant to the appeal.

# Subpart C—Procedures for Considering Applications
§ 14.300
Jurisdiction of adjudicative officer.
Any provision in the Department's rules and regulations other than this part which limits or terminates the jurisdiction of an adjudicative officer upon the effective date of his or her decision in the underlying proceeding shall not in any way affect his or her jurisdiction to render a decision under this part.
§ 14.305
Filing and service of documents.
Any application for an award or other pleading or document related to an application shall be filed and served on all parties to the proceeding in the same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding, except as provided in § 14.205(c) for confidential financial information.
§ 14.310
Answer to application.
(a) Within 30 days after service of an application, agency counsel may file an answer to the application. Agency counsel may request an extension of time for filing. If agency counsel fails to answer or otherwise fails to contest or settle the application, the adjudicative officer, upon a satisfactory showing of entitlement by the applicant, may make an award for the applicant's fees and other expenses under the Act.
(b) If agency counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the adjudicative officer upon request by agency counsel and the applicant.
(c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of agency counsel's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, agency counsel shall include with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 14.325.
§ 14.315
Comments by other parties.
Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and agency counsel may file comments on an application within 30 days after it is served, or on an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting party may not participate further in proceedings on the application unless the adjudicative officer determines that the public interest requires such participation in order to permit full exploration of matters raised in the comments.
§ 14.320
Settlement.
The applicant and agency counsel may agree on a proposed settlement of the award before final action on the application, either in connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding, or after the underlying proceeding has been concluded, in accordance with the settlement procedure applicable to the underlying proceeding. If a prevailing party and agency counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an application has been filed, the application shall be filed with the proposed settlement.
§ 14.325
Extensions of time and further proceedings.
(a) The adjudicative officer on motion and for good cause shown may grant extensions of time other than for filing an application for fees and expenses after final disposition in the adversary adjudication.
(b) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant or agency counsel, or on his or her own initiative, the adjudicative officer may order further proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions, or as to issues other than substantial justification (such as the applicant's eligibility or substantiation of fees and expenses), pertinent discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible. Whether or not the position of the agency was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought.
(c) A request that the adjudicative officer order further proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.
§ 14.330
Decision.
The adjudicative officer shall issue an initial decision on the application within 30 days after completion of proceedings on the application. The decision shall include written findings and conclusions on such of the following as are relevant to the decision:
(a) The applicant's status as a prevailing party;
(b) The applicant's qualification as a
party
under 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(B);
(c) Whether the agency's position was substantially justified;
(d) Whether special circumstances make an award unjust;
(e) Whether the applicant during the course of the proceedings engaged in conduct that unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter in controversy; and
(f) The amounts, if any, awarded for fees and other expenses, with reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded.
If the applicant has sought an award against more than one agency, the decision shall allocate responsibility for payment of any award made among the agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the allocation made.
§ 14.335
Departmental review.
(a) Either the applicant or agency counsel may seek review of the initial decision on the fee application, or the Secretary (or his or her delegate, if any) may decide to review the decision on his or her own initiative, in accordance with the Department's review or appeals procedures applicable to the underlying proceeding. If neither the applicant nor agency counsel seeks review and the Secretary (or his or her delegate, if any) does not take review on his or her own initiative, the initial decision on the application shall become a final decision of the Department in the same manner as a decision in the underlying proceeding becomes final. Whether to review a decision is a matter within the discretion of the Secretary (or his or her delegate, if any). If review is taken, the Department will issue a final decision on the application or remand the application to the adjudicative officer for further proceedings.
(b) Either party may seek reconsideration of the decision on the fee application in accordance with Rule 29, 24 CFR 20.10.
§ 14.340
Judicial review.
Judicial review of final departmental decisions on awards may be sought as provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).
§ 14.345
Payment of award.
An applicant seeking payment of an award shall submit a copy of the final decision granting the award to: Director, Office of Finance and Accounting, Room 2202, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, DC 20410, with a copy to: Associate General Counsel for Equal Opportunity and Administrative Law, Room 10244, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, DC 20410. A statement that review of the underlying decision is not being sought in the United States courts, or that the process for seeking review of the award, if initiated, has been completed, must also be included. The agency will pay the amount awarded to the applicant within 60 days, unless judicial review of the award or of the underlying decision of the adversary adjudication has been sought by the applicant or any other party to the proceeding.

[80 FR 49145, Aug. 17, 2015, as amended at 82 FR 3622, Jan. 12, 2017; 82 FR 21694, May 10, 2017]
§ 15.102
Requirements for making requests for records.
(a)
In general.
Any request for HUD records must be made in writing and submitted to the FOIA Public Liaison in the HUD field office where the records are located or to the Office of the Executive Secretariat in HUD Headquarters if the request is for records located in HUD Headquarters.
(b)
HUD field office records.
Requests for records located in a HUD field office may be submitted by mail (including courier or delivery service), email, or facsimile to the FOIA Public Liaison at the field office.
(c)
HUD headquarters records.
Requests for records located in HUD Headquarters may be submitted via an electronic request form on HUD's FOIA Web site at
http://www.hud.gov/FOIA.
Requests can also be submitted in person or by mail (including courier or delivery service), email, or facsimile to the Office of the Executive Secretariat in HUD Headquarters.
(d)
Form of requests.
FOIA requests should:
(1) Be in writing and clearly identifiable as a FOIA request. To facilitate
identification, the requester should place the phrase “FOIA Request” on the front of the envelope or on the cover sheet or other transmittal document used when submitting the request in person or by mail, email, facsimile, or electronic request form;
(2) Include, whenever possible, detailed and specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. The more specific the FOIA request for records, the more likely HUD officials will be able to locate the records requested. Requests for categories of information should be for specific and well-defined categories. Insufficient descriptions may lead HUD officials to contact the requester to seek additional information for their record search;
(3) Indicate the form or format in which the requester would like the record made available, if the requester has a preference;
(4) Specify the fee amount the requester is willing to pay. In general, HUD provides records at no cost up to $25. Requesters are required to agree to pay for any costs that exceed $25. Requesters may also request a dollar amount above which HUD should consult with them before they agree to pay the fee. If a requester seeks a fee waiver or reduction, the requester should include this request with the FOIA disclosure request and should describe, consistent with § 15.106(k), how the disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester;
(5) Indicate the fee category that the requester believes applies to each of his or her requests (fee categories are defined in § 15.106(b));
(6) Include verification information of the requester's identity, if the requester requests agency records pertaining to the requester, a minor, or an individual who is legally incompetent. Information about what constitutes acceptable verification information can be found in HUD's Privacy Act regulations in 24 CFR part 16;
(7) Contain signed authorization from the other person, if the requester makes a request on another person's behalf for information about that person. If necessary, HUD will inform the requester of the authorization needed from the other person and give the requester an opportunity to provide such authorization. Requests for information about another person should be accompanied by either written, notarized authorization or proof that the individual is deceased (for example, a copy of a death certificate or an obituary), or the request will be deemed insufficient; and
(8) Contain a detailed explanation of the basis for the request, if the requester makes a request for expedited processing as provided by § 15.104(c). The requester should also include a statement certifying the truth of the circumstances alleged or other evidence, acceptable to HUD, of the requester's compelling need.
§ 15.103
Timing of responses to requests.
(a)
In general.
HUD will generally make a determination whether to comply with a FOIA request within 20 working days, depending on the size of the request. The 20-day period will begin on the day the request is received by the appropriate component of HUD, but in any event not later than 10 working days after the request is received by any component of HUD designated to receive FOIA requests.
(b)
Tolling the 20-day time period.
Under the OPEN Government Act of 2007, HUD may toll the 20-day period:
(1) One time to make a reasonable request for additional information from the requester; or
(2) As many times as necessary to clarify issues regarding fee assessment with the requester. The agency's receipt of the requester's response to the agency's request for information or resolution of all fee assessment issues ends the tolling period.
(c)
Extension of time periods for processing a request.
In unusual circumstances, as defined in this paragraph, HUD may extend the time period for processing a FOIA request. In such circumstances, HUD will provide the requester with written notice setting forth the unusual circumstances for the extension and the date on which
a determination is expected to be dispatched. If processing a request would require more than 10 working days beyond the general time limit established in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD will offer the requester an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that HUD may process it within the extra 10-day working period or arrange an alternative time period within which the FOIA request will be processed. To aid the requester, HUD shall make available its FOIA Public Liaison, who shall assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and HUD, and notify the requester of the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services. For purposes of this section, unusual circumstances include:
(1) The need to search for and collect records not located in the office processing the request;
(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records; or
(3) The need to consult with another agency or two or more HUD components having a substantial interest in the determination of the FOIA request.
(d)
Aggregating multiple requests.
(1) HUD may aggregate multiple requests in cases where unusual circumstances exist and HUD determines that:
(i) Certain requests from the same requester or from a group of requesters acting in concert actually constitute a single request; and
(ii) The requests involve clearly related matters.
(2) Aggregation of requests for this purpose will be conducted independent of aggregation of requests for fee purposes under § 15.106(h).
[80 FR 49145, Aug. 17, 2015, as amended at 82 FR 3622, Jan. 12, 2017]
§ 15.104
Procedures for processing FOIA requests.
(a)
In general.
HUD will ordinarily respond to FOIA requests according to their order of receipt.
(b)
Tracking number.
FOIA requests will be logged in the order that they are received and be assigned a tracking number. A requester should use the tracking number to identify his or her request when contacting the FOIA office for any reason.
(c)
Expedited processing.
(1) Requests and appeals will be taken out of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that they involve:
(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;
(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information; or
(iii) The loss of substantial due process rights.
(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial request for records or at any later time. For a prompt determination, a request for expedited processing should be received by the proper office designated to receive FOIA requests as provided in § 15.102.
(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing should submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. For example, a requester who makes a request under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, if not a full-time member of the news media, should establish that he or she is a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, though it need not be his or her sole occupation. A requester making a request under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section also should establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request, beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The formality of certification may be waived as a matter of administrative discretion.
(4) HUD will make a determination within 10 calendar days of receipt by the appropriate component of HUD, as provided in § 15.103, whether to grant or deny a request for expedited processing and notify the requester of HUD's determination. FOIA requests accepted for expedited processing will be processed as soon as practicable and on a priority basis.
(d)
Multitrack processing.
(1) For requests that do not qualify for expedited processing, HUD may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and complex FOIA requests based on the following: The time and work necessary to process the FOIA request and the volume of agency records responsive to the FOIA request.
(2) When HUD uses multitrack processing, it may provide requesters in its slower track an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of HUD's faster track. When HUD chooses to provide this option, HUD will contact the requester by telephone, letter, or email, whichever is more efficient in each case.
[80 FR 49145, Aug. 17, 2015, as amended at 82 FR 3622, Jan. 12, 2017]
§ 15.105
Responses to requests.
(a)
Acknowledgements of requests.
The FOIA office in the Office of the Executive Secretariat in HUD Headquarters and FOIA Public Liaison in each HUD field office will ordinarily send an acknowledgement letter to the requester that will confirm receipt of the request by the appropriate HUD office and provide an assigned tracking number, as provided by § 15.104(b), for further reference.
(b)
Consultations, coordination, and referrals.
When HUD receives a request for a record in its possession, it shall determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA or whether it should be disclosed as a matter of administrative discretion. If HUD determines that it is best able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure, then it shall do so. If HUD determines that it is not best able to make that determination, then it shall either:
(1) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting with the agency best able to determine whether to disclose it and with any other agency that has a substantial interest in it; or
(2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to the agency that originated the record, but only if that agency is subject to the FOIA. Ordinarily, the agency with which the record originated will be presumed to be best able to determine whether to disclose it.
(c)
Fee estimates.
HUD will notify the requester if HUD's estimate of the fee is more than the requester has agreed to pay. Consistent with § 15.106(e), the requester shall have 15 working days to agree to pay the higher fee.
(d)
Forms of response.
Once HUD makes a determination regarding whether to comply with a request pursuant to time limits established in § 15.103(a), HUD shall immediately notify the requester of such determination and the reasons therefor, and the requester's right to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison.
(1)
Granting requests in whole or in part.
If HUD makes a determination to grant a request in whole or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. HUD will make a record available in the form or format requested, if the record is readily reproducible in that format. HUD will inform the requester in the notice of any fee charged under § 15.106 and disclose records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fee. Records disclosed in part will be marked or annotated to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption(s) under which each deletion is made, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable FOIA exemption. The location of the information deleted and the exemption(s) under which the deletion is made will be indicated directly on the record itself, if technically feasible.
(2)
Adverse determination of requests.
If a determination is made to deny a request in any respect, HUD shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include: A determination to withhold any requested record, in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has not been retained; a determination that a record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester; a determination that what has been requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; a determination on any disputed fee matter, including a denial of a request for a fee waiver or reduction; and
a denial of a request for expedited treatment. The denial letter shall be signed by the Director of the Office of the Executive Secretariat, or a designee of the Director, in HUD Headquarters or the FOIA Public Liaison for the HUD field office where the adverse determination was made, and shall include:
(i) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;
(ii) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by HUD in denying the request;
(iii) An estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, when appropriate, in number of pages or in some other reasonable form of estimation. This estimate does not need to be provided if the volume is otherwise indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and
(iv) Notice of the right of the requester to appeal to the head of the agency, within a period determined by the head of the agency that is not less than 90 days after the date of such adverse determination;
(v) Notice of the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison of the agency or the Office of Government Information Services;
(vi) A statement that the denial may be appealed as provided by § 15.109 and a description of the requirements for appeal.
[80 FR 49145, Aug. 17, 2015, as amended at 82 FR 3622, Jan. 12, 2017; 82 FR 21694, May 10, 2017]
§ 15.106
Fees.
(a)
In general.
HUD will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, except where fees are limited under paragraph (d) of this section or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (k) of this section. HUD shall collect all applicable fees before sending copies of requested records to a requester. In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, HUD may contact a requester for additional information. Requesters shall pay fees by check or money order made payable to the United States Treasury.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section:
Commercial use
means a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. HUD shall determine, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the requested records. When it appears that the requester will put the records to a commercial use, either because of the nature of the request itself or because HUD has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's stated use, HUD shall provide the requester a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.
Direct costs
means those expenses that HUD actually incurs in searching for and duplicating and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as for mainframe computer run time. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting a facility.
Duplication
means the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, audiovisual materials, or machine readable documentation (
e.g.,
diskette), among others. HUD shall honor a requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format by the office responding to the request.
Educational institution
means:
(i)(A) A preschool;
(B) A public or private elementary or secondary school;
(C) An institution of graduate higher education;
(D) An institution of undergraduate higher education;
(E) An institution of professional education; or
(F) An institution of vocational education, that primarily (or solely) operates a program or programs of scholarly research.
(ii) To be in this category, a requester should show that the request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scholarly research. Records requested for the intention of fulfilling credit requirements are not considered to be sought for a scholarly purpose.
Other requester
means any requester that does not fall within the categories of requesters described in this section.
Noncommercial scientific institution
means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be in this category, a requester should show that the request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scientific research.
Representative of the news media,
or
news media requester,
means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term
news
means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate news and make their products available to the general public through a variety of means. For freelance journalists to be regarded as working for a news media entity, they should demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but HUD will also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination. To be in this category a requester should not be seeking the requested records for a commercial use. However, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use.
(c)
Fees

(2)
Search.
(i) Search fees will be charged for all requests other than requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. HUD may charge for time spent searching even if HUD does not locate any responsive record or if HUD withholds the record(s) located as entirely exempt from disclosure.
(ii) For each hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees will be $13 per quarter hour for professional personnel and $6 per quarter hour for clerical personnel.
(iii) Requesters will be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new program to locate the requested records.
(iv) For requests requiring the retrieval of records from any Federal records center, certain additional costs may be incurred in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by the National Archives and Records Administration.
(3)
Duplication.
Duplication fees will be charged to all requesters, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. For a paper photocopy of a record (no more than one copy of which need be supplied), the fee will be $0.10 per page. For copies in digital format, HUD will charge the direct costs, including operator time, of producing the copy. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, HUD will charge the direct costs.
(4)
Review.
Review fees will be charged to requesters who make a commercial use request. Review fees will be charged only for the initial record review (the review done where HUD determines whether an exemption applies to a particular record or record portion, at the initial request level). No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal level for an exemption already applied. However, records or portions of records withheld under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine whether any other exemption not previously considered applies. The cost of that review is chargeable where it is made necessary by such a change of circumstances. Fees for the review time will be $13 per quarter hour for professional personnel and $6 per quarter hour for clerical personnel.
(d)
Restrictions on charging fees.
(1) No search fee will be charged for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media. In addition, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(5), (d)(6), and (d)(7) of this section, HUD shall not assess any search fees (or, for requesters that are educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions or representatives of the news media requesting records not sought for commercial use, duplication fees) if HUD has failed to comply with any time limit described in § 15.103.
(2) Search and review fees will be charged in quarter-hour increments. HUD will round up a quarter hour when professional and clerical search and review time exceeds a quarter-hour increment.
(3) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, HUD will provide without charge:
(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent); and
(ii) The first 2 hours of search (or the cost equivalent).
(4) No fee will be charged whenever a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is less than HUD's cost to process the payment. Currently, whenever a total fee calculated is $25 or less, no fee will be charged.
(5) If HUD determines that unusual circumstances apply and HUD provides timely written notice to the requester pursuant to requirements provided in § 15.103(c), a failure to comply with any time limit as described in § 15.103 is excused for an additional 10 days. If HUD fails to comply with the extended time limit, HUD may not assess any search fees (or for requesters that are educational or noncommercial scientific institutions or representatives of the
news media requesting records not sought for commercial use, duplication fees).
(6) If unusual circumstances apply and more than 5000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, HUD may charge search fees or, for requesters that are educational or noncommercial scientific institutions or representatives of the news media requesting records not sought for commercial use, duplication fees, if timely written notice has been made to the requester pursuant to requirements provided in § 15.103(c) and HUD has discussed with the requester through written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than 3 good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request as stipulated in § 15.103(c).
(7)(i) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, a failure to comply with any time limit as described in § 15.103 shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.
(ii) For purposes of this section, the term “exceptional circumstances” does not include a delay that results from a predictable workload of requests, unless HUD demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests. However, refusal by the requester to reasonably modify the scope of a request or arrange an alternative time frame for processing a request (or a modified request) after HUD gives them an opportunity to do so shall be considered a factor in determining whether exceptional circumstances exist.
(e)
Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.
When HUD determines or estimates that the fees to be charged under this section will amount to more than $25, HUD will notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as the amount anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be readily estimated, HUD shall advise the requester that the estimated fee may be only a portion of the total fee. In cases in which a requester has been notified that actual or estimated fees amount to more than $25, the request will be held in abeyance for 15 working days. Further work will not be done on that request until the requester has either made a firm commitment to pay the anticipated total fee, or has made payment in advance if the total fee exceeds $250. Any such agreement should be memorialized by the requester in writing, should indicate a given dollar amount, and should be received by HUD within the time period specified by HUD in its notice to the requester. If the requester does not provide a firm commitment to pay the anticipated fee within the time period specified by HUD, the request will be closed. A notice under this paragraph will offer the requester an opportunity to discuss the matter of fees with HUD personnel in order to reformulate the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost. HUD is not required to accept payments in installments.
(f)
Charges for other services.
Although not required to provide special services, if HUD chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, HUD will charge the direct costs of providing these services. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending documents by means other than ordinary mail.
(g)
Charging interest.
HUD may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing until payment is received by HUD. HUD will follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.
(h)
Aggregating requests.
If HUD reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, HUD may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. HUD may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to
avoid fees. Where requests are separated by a longer period, HUD will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted under all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated. Aggregation of requests for fee purposes under this paragraph will be conducted independent of aggregation of requests under § 15.103(d).
(i)
Advance payments.
(1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (i)(2) and (3) of this section, HUD will not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is begun or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed, such as prepayment before copies are sent to a requester, is not an advance payment.
(2) If HUD determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will be more than $250, it may require the requester to make an advance payment of an amount up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request, except where it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester who has a history of prompt payment.
(3) If a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to HUD within 30 days of the date of billing, before HUD begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request from that requester, HUD will require the requester to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee. If HUD has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented his or her identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, HUD may require that the requester provide proof of identity.
(4) When HUD requires advance payment, the request will be held in abeyance for 15 working days to allow the requester an opportunity to make payment in advance and/or modify the scope of the request. If the requester does not pay the advance payment or modify the scope of the request within the allotted time frame, the request will be closed.
(j)
Other statutes specifically providing for fees.
The fee schedule in this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. Where records responsive to requests are maintained for distribution by agencies operating such statutorily based fee schedule programs, HUD will inform requesters of the contact information for that source.
(k)
Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees.
(1) Records responsive to a request will be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced below that established under paragraph (c) of this section if HUD determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated the following:
(i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government; and
(ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
(2) To determine whether the first fee waiver requirement is met, HUD will consider the following factors:
(i) The subject of the requested records should concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.
(ii) The disclosable portions of the requested records should be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities and “likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would not be as likely to contribute to such increased understanding, where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.
(iii) The disclosure should contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject
area and ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public will be considered. It will be presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.
(iv) The public's understanding of the subject in question, as compared to the level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure, should be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. However, HUD will not make value judgments about whether information at issue is “important” enough to be made public.
(3) To determine whether the second fee waiver requirement is met, HUD will consider the following factors:
(i) HUD will identify any commercial interest of the requester as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, or of any person on whose behalf the requester may be acting, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters shall be given an opportunity in the administrative process to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.
(ii) A fee waiver or reduction is justified where the public interest standard is satisfied and that public interest is greater than that of any identified commercial interest in disclosure. HUD ordinarily will presume that where a news media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.
(4) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver will be granted for those records.
(5) Requests for the waiver or reduction of fees should address the factors listed in paragraphs (k)(2) and (3) of this section, insofar as they apply to each request. In deciding to grant waivers or reductions of fees, HUD will exercise its discretion to consider the cost effectiveness of its investment of administrative resources.

§ 15.107
Documents generally protected from disclosure.
(a) HUD shall withhold information only if HUD reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, or disclosure is prohibited by law. HUD will consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever HUD determines that a full disclosure of a requested record is not possible, and will take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information. Nothing in this section requires disclosure of information that is otherwise prohibited from disclosure by law, or otherwise exempted from disclosure as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(b) The FOIA contains nine exemptions (5 U.S.C. 552(b)) that authorize agencies to withhold various records from disclosure. With regard to certain types of records, HUD generally applies the exemptions as follows:
(1)
Classified documents.
Exemption 1 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)) protects classified national defense and foreign relations information. HUD seldom relies on this exception to withhold documents. However, where applicable, HUD will refer a request for records classified under Executive Order 13526 and the pertinent records to the originating agency for processing. HUD may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of the requested information if the originating agency determines that the fact of the existence of the information itself is classified.
(2)
Internal agency rules and practices.
Exemption 2 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(2)) protects records relating to internal personnel rules and practices.
(3)
Information prohibited from disclosure by another statute.
Exemption 3 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3)) protects information that is prohibited from disclosure by another Federal law. HUD generally will not disclose competitive proposals prior to contract award, competitive proposals that are not set forth or incorporated by reference into the awarded contract (see 41 U.S.C. 4702), or, during the selection process, any covered selection information regarding such selection, either directly or indirectly (see 42 U.S.C. 3537a).
(4)
Commercial or financial information.
Exemption 4 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)) protects trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential. HUD will handle this type of information as provided by § 15.108.
(5)
Certain interagency or intra-agency communications.
Exemption 5 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5)) protects interagency or intra-agency communications that are protected by legal privileges, such as the attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product privilege, or communications reflecting the agency's deliberative process. The deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested.
(6)
Personal privacy.
Exemption 6 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6)) protects information involving matters of personal privacy. This information may include personnel, medical, and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Names, addresses, telephone numbers, and email addresses of persons residing in public or assisted housing or of borrowers in FHA-insured single family mortgage transactions generally will not be disclosed.
(7)
Law enforcement records.
Exemption 7 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7)) protects certain records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes. This exemption protects records where the production could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings; for example, the names of individuals who have filed fair housing complaints. The protection of this exemption also encompasses, but is not limited to, information in law enforcement files that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; the names of confidential informants, and techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations, or guidelines for law enforcement investigations if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.
(8)
Supervision of financial institutions.
Exemption 8 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8)) protects information relating to the supervision of financial institutions. For purposes of Exemption 8, HUD is an “agency responsible for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions” for purposes of monitoring fair housing compliance.
(9)
Wells.
Exemption 9 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(9)) protects geological information on wells.
[82 FR 21694, May 10, 2017]
§ 15.108
Business information.
(a)
In general.
Business information obtained by HUD from a submitter will be disclosed under the FOIA only under this section. In making final confidentiality determinations under this section, HUD relies to a large extent upon the information furnished by the affected business to substantiate its claim of confidentiality. HUD may be unable to verify the accuracy of much of the information submitted by the affected business. HUD will comply with Executive Order 12600 and follow the procedure in this section by giving notice to the affected business and an opportunity for the business to present evidence of its confidentiality claim. If HUD is sued by a requester under the FOIA for nondisclosure of confidential business information, HUD expects the affected business to cooperate to the fullest extent possible in defending such a decision.
(b)
Designation of business information.
A submitter of business information will use good faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations will expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer designation period.
(c)
Notice to submitters.
HUD will provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal that seeks business information, wherever required under paragraph (d) of this section, in order to give the submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure of any specified portion of that information under paragraph (e) of this section. The notice will either describe the business information requested or include copies of the requested records or portions of
records containing the information. When notification of a voluminous number of submitters is required, notification may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish notification.
(d)
Where notice is required.
Notice will be given to a submitter wherever:
(1) The information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or
(2) HUD has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4.
(e)
Opportunity to object to disclosure.
HUD will allow a submitter a reasonable time to respond to the notice described in paragraph (c) of this section and will specify that time period within the notice. If a submitter has any objection to disclosure, the submitter should submit a detailed written statement specifying the grounds for withholding any portion of the information under any exemption of the FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, the submitter should show why the information is a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. HUD generally will not consider conclusory statements that particular information would be useful to competitors or would impair sales, or other similar statements, sufficient to justify confidential treatment. In the event that a submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to the disclosure of the information. Information provided by the submitter that is not received until after the disclosure decision has been made will not be considered by HUD. Information provided by a submitter under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.
(f)
Notice of intent to disclose.
HUD will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose business information. Whenever HUD decides to disclose business information over the objection of a submitter, HUD will give the submitter written notice, which will include:
(1) A statement of the reason(s) why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;
(2) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and
(3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.
(g)
Exceptions to notice requirements.
The notice requirements of paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section will not apply if:
(1) HUD determines that the information should not be disclosed;
(2) The information lawfully has been published or has been officially made available to the public; or
(3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600.
(h)
Notice of a FOIA lawsuit.
Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of business information, HUD will promptly notify the submitter.
(i)
Corresponding notice to requesters.
Whenever HUD provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure under paragraph (f) of this section, HUD will also notify the requester(s). Whenever a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of business information, HUD will notify the requester(s).
§ 15.109
Appeals.
(a)
In general.
A requester may appeal an adverse determination denying a request, in any respect, in writing. The letter of appeal should clearly identify the determination that is being appealed and the assigned tracking number. The appeal letter and envelope should be marked “Freedom of Information Act Appeal” for the quickest possible handling. If mailed, the requester's letter of appeal must be postmarked within 90 calendar days of the date of HUD's letter of determination. If the letter of appeal is transmitted electronically or by a means other than the United States Postal Service, it must be received in the appropriate office by the close of business on the 30th calendar day after the date of HUD's letter of determination.
(b)
Time frames
—(1) Expedited processing. HUD will decide an appeal of a denial of a request to expedite processing of a FOIA request within 10 working days of receipt of the appeal.
(2)
All other appeals.
HUD will make a determination on appeals within 20 working days of receipt, unless unusual circumstances require HUD to extend the time for an additional 10 working days.
(3)
Exceptions.
An appeal ordinarily will not be acted upon if the subject of the appeal is simultaneously being litigated in an applicable Federal court.
(c)
Content of appeals.
An appeal letter should include the following:
(1) A copy of the original request;
(2) A copy of the adverse determination;
(3) A statement of facts and legal arguments supporting the appeal; and
(4) Any additional information the appellant wishes to include.
(d)
When appeal is required.
Before seeking a court review of HUD's adverse determination, a requester generally must have exhausted their administrative remedies.
[80 FR 49145, Aug. 17, 2015 as amended at 82 FR 21695, May 10, 2017]
§ 15.110
HUD response to appeals.
(a)
In general.
(1) The appellate official will conduct a de novo review of the entire record and applicable law when making a decision.
(2) The decision on the appeal will be made in writing and will be considered the final action of HUD.
(i) A decision affirming an adverse determination, in whole or in part, will contain a statement of the reason(s) for the affirmation, including any FOIA exemption(s) applied, and will inform the appellant of the FOIA provisions for potential court review of the decision.
(ii) If the adverse determination is modified on appeal, in whole or in part, a written decision will be sent to the appellant and the FOIA request will be reprocessed in accordance with the appeal decision.
(iii) Adverse decisions will include the name and contact information of dispute resolution services that offer mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a nonexclusive alternative to litigation.
(b)
Appeal of a denial of record request.
Upon appeal of a denial of a record request, the appellate official will issue a decision that either:
(1) Overturns the adverse determination, in whole or in part, and remands the request to the appropriate office. The requester will be notified of the rationale for the determination in writing. The original office will then reprocess the request in accordance with the appeal determination and respond directly to the requester; or
(2) Affirms the adverse determination and declines to provide the requested records to the appellant.
(c)
Appeal of a fee determination.
Upon appeal of a fee determination, the appellate official will issue a decision that either:
(1) Waives the fee or charges the fee that the appellant requested;
(2) Modifies the original fee charged and explains why the modified fee is appropriate; or
(3) Advises the appellant that the original fee charged was appropriate and gives the reason behind this determination.
(d)
Appeal of a denial of expedited processing.
Upon appeal of a denial of an expedited processing request, the appellate official will issue a decision that either:
(1) Overturns the adverse determination and grants the expedited processing request; or
(2) Affirms the decision to deny expedited processing.

[72 FR 8582, Feb. 26, 2007, as amended at 73 FR 72205, Nov. 26, 2008]
§ 15.202
Production of material or provision of testimony prohibited unless approved.
Neither the Department nor any employee of the Department shall comply with any demand for production of material or provision of testimony in a legal proceeding among private litigants, unless the prior approval of the Authorized Approving Official has been obtained in accordance with this subpart.

(10) Describe how producing such material or providing such testimony would affect the interests of the United States.
(b) If the Department determines that the requestor has failed to provide the information required by paragraph (a) of this section, or that the information provided is insufficient to consider the demand in accordance with § 15.204, the Department may require that additional information be provided by the requestor before the demand is considered.
(c) Whenever a demand is made upon the Department or an employee of the Department for the production of material or provision of testimony, the
employee shall immediately notify the Appropriate Associate General Counsel or Appropriate Regional Counsel.
[73 FR 72205, Nov. 26, 2008]
§ 15.204
Consideration of demands for production of material or provision of testimony.
(a) The Authorized Approving Official shall determine what material is to be produced or what testimony is to be provided, based upon the following standards:
(1)
Expert or opinion material or testimony.
In any legal proceeding among private litigants, no employee of the Department may produce material or provide testimony as described in § 15.201(a) that is of an expert or opinion nature, unless specifically authorized by the Authorized Approving Official for good cause shown.
(2)
Factual material or testimony.
In any legal proceeding among private litigants, no employee of the Department may produce material or provide testimony as described in § 15.201(a) that is of a factual nature, unless specifically authorized by the Authorized Approving Official. The Authorized Approving Official shall determine whether any of the following factors are applicable. Such a demand may either be denied, or conditionally granted in accordance with § 15.204(c), if any such factors are applicable:
(i) Producing such material or providing such testimony would violate a statute or regulation;
(ii) Producing such material or providing such testimony would reveal classified, confidential, or privileged material;
(iii) Such material or testimony would be irrelevant to the legal proceeding;
(iv) Such material or testimony could be obtained from any other source;
(v) One or more documents, or a declaration or affidavit, could reasonably be provided in lieu of oral testimony;
(vi) The amount of employees' time necessary to comply with the demand would be unreasonable;
(vii) Production of the material or provision of the testimony would not be required under the rules of procedure governing the legal proceeding for which it is sought (e.g., unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the relevant rules governing discovery);
(viii) Producing such material or providing such testimony would impede a significant interest of the United States; or
(ix) The Department has any other legally cognizable objection to the release of such information or testimony in response to a demand.
(b) Once a determination has been made, the requester will be notified of the determination. If the demand is denied, the requestor shall be notified of the reasons for the denial. If the demand is conditionally approved, the requestor shall be notified of the conditions that have been imposed upon the production of the material or provision of the testimony demanded, and the reasons for the conditional approval of the demand.
(c) The Authorized Approving Official may impose conditions or restrictions on the production of any material or provision of any testimony. Such conditions or restrictions may include the following:
(1) A requirement that the parties to the legal proceeding obtain a protective order or execute a confidentiality agreement to limit access to, and limit any further disclosure of, material or testimony;
(2) A requirement that the requester accept examination of documentary material on HUD premises in lieu of production of copies;
(3) A limitation on the subject areas of testimony permitted;
(4) A requirement that testimony of a HUD employee be provided by deposition at a location prescribed by HUD or by written declaration;
(5) A requirement that the parties to the legal proceeding agree that a transcript of the permitted testimony be kept under seal or will only be used or only made available in the particular legal proceeding for which testimony was demanded;
(6) A requirement that the requester purchase an extra copy of the transcript of the employee's testimony from the court reporter and provide the Department with a copy at the requester's expense; or
(7) Any other condition or restriction deemed to be in the best interests of the United States, including reimbursement of costs to the Department.
(d) The determination made with respect to the production of material or provision of testimony pursuant to this subpart is within the sole discretion of the Authorized Approving Official and shall constitute final agency action from which no administrative appeal is available.
[73 FR 72205, Nov. 26, 2008]
§ 15.205
Method of production of material or provision of testimony.
(a) Where the Authorized Approving Official has authorized the production of material or provision of testimony, the Department shall produce such material or provide such testimony in accordance with this section and any conditions imposed upon production of material or provision of testimony pursuant to § 15.204(c).
(b) In any legal proceeding where the Authorized Approving Official has authorized the production of documents, the Department shall respond by producing authenticated copies of the documents, to which the seal of the Department has been affixed, in accordance with its authentication procedures. The authentication shall be evidence that the documents are true copies of documents in the Department's files and shall be sufficient for the purposes of Rules 803(8) and 902 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and Rule 44(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
(c) If response to a demand is required before the determination from the Authorized Approving Official is received, the U.S. Attorney, Department of Justice Attorney, or such other attorney as may be designated for the purpose will appear or make such filings as are necessary to furnish the court or other authority with a copy of the regulations contained in this subpart and will inform the court or other authority that the demand has been, or is being, as the case may be, referred for prompt consideration. The court or other authority shall be requested respectfully to stay the demand pending receipt of the requested determination from the Authorized Approving Official.
[73 FR 72206, Nov. 26, 2008]
§ 15.206
Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling regarding production of material or provision of testimony.
If the court or other authority declines to stay the demand made in accordance with § 15.205(c) pending receipt of the determination from the Authorized Approving Official, or if the court or other authority rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of the determination by the Authorized Approving Official not to produce the material or provide the testimony demanded or to produce subject to conditions or restrictions, the employee upon whom the demand has been made shall, if so directed by an attorney representing the Department, respectfully decline to comply with the demand.

§ 16.1
Purpose and statement of policy.
(a) The purpose of this part is to establish policies and procedures for implementing the Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-579), 5 U.S.C. 552(a). The main objectives are to facilitate full
exercise of rights conferred on individuals under the Act and to insure the protection of privacy as to individuals about whom the Department maintains records in systems of records under the Act. The Department accepts the responsibility to act promptly and in accordance with the Act upon receipt of any inquiry, request or appeal from a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence into the United States, regardless of the age of the individual.
(b) Further, the Department accepts the obligations to maintain only such information on individuals as is relevant and necessary to the performance of its lawful functions, to maintain that information with such accuracy, relevancy, timeliness and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness in determinations made by the Department about the individual, to obtain information from the individual to the extent practicable, and to take every reasonable step to protect that information from unwarranted disclosure. The Department will maintain no record describing how an individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.
(c) This part applies to all organizational components in the Department in order to assure the maximum amount of uniformity and consistency within the Department in its implementation of the Act.
(d) The Assistant Secretary for Administration shall be responsible for carrying out the requirements of this part, for issuing such orders and directives internal to the Department as are necessary for full compliance with the Act, and for effecting publication of all required notices concerning systems of records.
(e) Requests involving information pertaining to an individual which is in a record or file but not within the scope of a System of Records Notice published in the
Federal Register
are outside the scope of this part. Requests for departmental records will be considered to determine whether processing under this part, part 15, or both is most appropriate, notwithstanding the requester's characterization of the request, as follows:
(1)
A Privacy Act request from an individual for records about that individual and not contained in a Privacy Act Records System
shall be considered a Freedom of Information Act request and processed under HUD Freedom of Information Act regulations (24 CFR part 15) to the extent that the requester has provided the Department a reasonable description of the documents requested. When a request for records is so considered as a Freedom of Information Act request, the Privacy Act Officer shall promptly refer it to the head of the appropriate organizational unit in accordance with HUD FOIA Regulations and shall advise the requester that time of receipt for processing purposes will be the time when it is received by the appropriate official.
(2)
A Freedom of Information Act request from an individual for records about that individual contained in a Privacy Act Records System
shall be processed as follows:
(i) If the request in whole or in part contains a reasonable description of any HUD document, processing shall be carried out pursuant to HUD FOIA Regulations.
(ii) If the request in whole or in part does not contain a reasonable description of any HUD document, but does provide sufficient information under HUD Privacy Act Regulations to undertake a Privacy Act Records System search, the Department will provide full access under HUD Privacy Act Regulations. In this situation, the Department will comply with the deadlines for response set forth in the Privacy Act and HUD implementing regulations. In that event, an explanation will be provided to the requester advising that the request did not contain a reasonable description of a particular document as required under the FOIA and offering to process the request under FOIA procedures upon receipt of additional information sufficient to constitute a
reasonable description.
(3)
A Freedom of Information Act request from an individual for records about another individual contained in a Privacy
Act Records System
shall be processed as follows: When an exemption under subsection (b) of FOIA is available, the Privacy Act governs the public interest determination under HUD FOIA Regulations (24 CFR 15.21) and compels the withholding of such documents unless: (i) The subject of those records consents to their release or (ii) disclosure comes within one of the subsections of 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b).
(4)
A Privacy Act request from an individual for records about another individual
shall be processed as follows: Except as expressly permitted in this part, requests by persons who are not the subject of a record contained in a Privacy Act Records System shall be outside the scope of this part. If the request satisfies the Freedom of Information Act requirement that requested records be reasonably described, the Privacy Act Officer shall consider the requests as a Freedom of Information Act request and shall proceed as in § 16.1(e)(1) of this section.

§ 16.4
Requests for access; requirements.
(a) Any individual, regardless of age, may submit to the Department a request for access to records of the Department. The request should be made either in person at the Office of, or by mail addressed to, the responsible Privacy Act Officer. Although oral requests may be honored, a requester may be asked to submit his request in writing. The envelope containing the request and the letter itself should both clearly indicate that the subject is a PRIVACY ACT REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO RECORDS.
(b) When a request for access to records is misdirected by the requester, or not addressed as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Department official receiving same shall promptly refer it to the appropriate Privacy Act Officer and the time of receipt for processing purposes will be the time when it is received by that official.
(c) When a request for access to records fails to provide necessary information as set forth in paragraph (b) of
this section the requester shall be advised that the time of receipt for processing purposes will be the time when the additional necessary information is received by the appropriate official.
(d) The requirements for identification of individuals seeking access to records are as follows:
(1)
In person.
Each individual making a request in person shall be required to present satisfactory proof of identity. The means of proof, in the order of preference and priority, are:
(i) A document bearing the individual's photograph (for example, passport or military or civilian identification card);
(ii) A document bearing the individual's signature (for example, driver's license, social security card, unemployment insurance book, employer's identification card, national credit card and professional, craft or union membership card); and
(iii) A document bearing neither the photograph nor the signature of the individual (for example, a Medicaid card). In the event the individual can provide no suitable documentation of identity, the Department will require a signed statement asserting the individual's identity and stipulating that the individual understands the penalty provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3). That penalty provision also appears at § 16.13(a). In order to avoid any unwarranted disclosure of an individual's records, the Department reserves the right to determine to its satisfaction whether proof of identity offered by any individual is adequate.
(2)
Not in person.
If the individual making a request does not appear in person before a Privacy Act Officer, the information set forth in § 16.3(b)(1) and a certificate of a notary public or equivalent officer empowered to administer oaths must accompany the request. The certificate within or attached to the letter must be substantially in accord with the following text:
City of __________
County of __________:
ss __________ (name of individual), who affixed (his) (her) signature below in my presence, came before me, a ________ (title), in and for the aforesaid County and State, this ______ day of ______, 19—, and established (his) (her) identity to my satisfaction.
My commission expires __________.
__________________
(signature)
If the request follows inquiry under § 16.3, this should be indicated in the request for access in order to facilitate processing.
(3)
Parents of minors and legal guardians.
An individual acting as the parent of a minor or the legal guardian of the individual to whom a record pertains shall establish his or her personal identity in the same manner prescribed in either paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section. In addition, such other individual shall establish his or her representative capacity of parent or legal guardian. In the case of the parent of a minor, the proof of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy of the minor's birth certificate. In the case of a legal guardian of an individual who has been declared incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction, the proof of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy of the court's order. A parent or legal guardian may act only for a living individual, not for a decedent. A parent or legal guardian may be accompanied during personal access to a record by another individual, provided the provisions of § 16.5(e) are satisfied.
(e) When the provisions of this part are alleged to have the effect of impeding an individual in exercising his or her right to access, the Department will consider alternative suggestions from an individual making a request, regarding proof of identity and access to records.
(f) An individual shall not be required to state a reason or otherwise justify his or her request for access to a record.
[40 FR 39729, Aug. 28, 1975, as amended at 83 FR 26361, June 7, 2018]
§ 16.5
Disclosure of requested information to individuals.
(a) Each request received shall be acted upon promptly by the responsible Privacy Act Officer. Every effort will be made to respond within ten days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and
holidays) of the date of receipt. If a response cannot be made within ten days due to unusual circumstances, the Privacy Act Officer shall send an acknowledgement during that period providing information on the status of the request and asking for such further information as may be necessary to process the request.
Unusual circumstances
shall include circumstances where a search for and collection of requested records from inactive storage, field facilities or other establishments are required, cases where a voluminous amount of data is involved, instances where information on other individuals must be separated or expunged from the particular record, and cases where consultations with other agencies having a substantial interest in the determination of the request are necessary.
(b)
Grant of access
—(1)
Notification.
An individual shall be granted access to a record pertaining to him or her, except where the provisions of § 16.6 apply. The Privacy Act Officer shall notify the individual of such determination and provide the following information:
(i) The methods of access, as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;
(ii) The place at which the record may be inspected;
(iii) The earliest date on which the record may be inspected and the period of time that the records will remain available for inspection and/or the estimated date by which a copy of the record could be mailed and the estimate of fees pursuant to § 16.12;
(iv) The fact that the individual, if he or she wishes, may be accompanied by another individual during personal access, subject to procedures set forth in paragraph (e) of this section; and
(v) Any additional requirements needed to grant access to a specific record.
(2)
Methods of access.
The following methods of access to records by an individual may be available depending on the circumstances of a given situation:
(i) Inspection in person may be had in the office specified by the Privacy Act Officer granting access during hours indicated by the Privacy Act Officer;
(ii) Transfer of records to a Federal facility more convenient to the individual may be arranged, but only if the Privacy Act Officer determines that a suitable facility is available, that the individual's access can be properly supervised at the facility, and that transmittal of the records to that facility will not unduly interfere with operations of the Department or involve unreasonable costs, in terms of both money and manpower; and
(iii) Copies may be mailed at the request of the individual, subject to payment of the fees prescribed in § 16.12. The Department, at its own initiative, may elect to provide a copy by mail, in which case no fee will be charged the individual.
(c) The Department shall supply such other information and assistance at the time of access as to make the record intelligible to the individual.
(d) The Department reserves the right to limit access to copies and abstracts of original records, rather than the original records. This election would be appropriate, for example, when the record is in an automated data media such as tape or disc, when the record contains information on other individuals, and when deletion of information is permissible under exemptions (for example, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2)). In no event shall original records of the Department be made available to the individual except under the immediate supervision of the Privacy Act Officer or his designee. It is a crime to conceal, mutilate, obliterate, or destroy any record filed in a public office, or to attempt to do any of the foregoing, Title 18, United States Code, 2701(a).
(e) Any individual who requests access to a record pertaining to that individual may be accompanied by another individual of his or her choice.
Accompanied
includes discussion of the record in the presence of the other individual. The individual to whom the record pertains shall authorize the presence of the other individual by a signed and dated document which includes the name of the other individual and specifically describes the record to which access is sought. The other individual shall sign the authorization in the presence of the Privacy Act Officer. An individual shall not be required to state a reason or otherwise justify his or her decision to be accompanied by
another individual during personal access to a record.
§ 16.6
Initial denial of access.
(a)
Grounds.
Access by an individual to a record which pertains to that individual will be denied only upon a determination by the Privacy Act Officer that:
(1) The record is subject to an exemption under § 16.14, § 16.15 or to an exemption determined by another agency noticing the system of records;
(2) The record is information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding; or
(3) The individual unreasonably has failed to comply with the procedural requirements of this part.
(b)
Notification.
The Privacy Act Officer shall give notice of denial of access to records to the individual in writing and shall include the following information:
(1) The Privacy Act Officer's name and title or position;
(2) The date of the denial;
(3) The reasons for the denial, including citation to the appropriate section of the Act and/or this part;
(4) The individual's opportunities, if any, for further administrative consideration, including the identity and address of the appropriate Privacy Appeals Officer. If no further administrative consideration within the Department is available, the notice shall state that the denial is administratively final; and,
(5) If stated to be administratively final; and, within the Department, the individual's right to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1), as amended by 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(5).

(d) When a request for review fails to provide necessary information as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, the requester shall be given reasonable opportunity to amend the request and shall be advised that the time of receipt for processing purposes will be the time when the additional necessary information is received by the appropriate official.
(e) The filing of a request for review may be accomplished by mailing to the Privacy Appeals Officer a copy of the request for access, if in writing; a copy of the written denial issued under § 16.6; and a statement of the reasons why the initial denial is believed to be in error. The appeal shall be signed by the individual.
(f) No hearing will be allowed in connection with administrative review of an initial denial of access.
(g) The Privacy Appeals Officer shall act upon the appeal and issue a final determination in writing not later than thirty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) from the date on which the appeal is received; provided, that the Privacy Appeals officer may extend the thirty days upon deciding that a fair and equitable review cannot be made within that period, but only if the individual is advised in writing of the reason for the extension and the estimated date by which a final determination will issue, which estimated date should not be later than the sixtieth day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) after receipt of the appeal unless there exist unusual circumstances, as described in § 16.5(a).
(h) The decision after review will be in writing, will constitute final action
of the Department on a request for access, and, if the denial of the request is in whole or part upheld, the Department shall notify the person making the request of his right to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1), as amended by 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(5).

(f) No hearing on appeal will be allowed.
(g) The Privacy Appeals Officer shall act upon the appeal and issue a final Department determination in writing not later than thirty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) from the date on which the appeal is received; provided, that the Privacy Appeals Officer may extend the thirty days upon deciding that a fair and equitable review cannot be made within that period, but only if the individual is advised in writing of the reason for the extension and the estimated date by which a final determination will issue (which estimated date should not be later than the sixtieth day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) after receipt of the appeal unless unusual circumstances, as described in § 16.5(a), are met).

The Privacy Act Officer shall make reasonable efforts to notify any individual when any record in a system of records is disclosed to any person under compulsory legal process, promptly upon being informed that such process has become a matter of public record.
§ 16.12
Fees.
(a) The only fees to be charged to or collected from an individual under the provisions of this part are for copying records at the request of the individual.
(1) No fees shall be charged or collected for the following: Search for and retrieval of the records; review of the records; copying at the initiative of the Department without a request from the individual; transportation of records and personnel; and first class postage.
(2) It is the policy of the Department to provide an individual with one copy of each record corrected or amended pursuant to his or her request without charge as evidence of the correction or amendment.
(3) As requested by the United States Civil Service Commission in its published regulations implementing the Act, the Department will charge no fee to an individual who requests copies of a personnel record covered by that Commission's Government-wide published notice of systems of records. However, when such records are voluminous and the cost of copying would be in excess of five dollars ($5) the Department may, in its discretion, charge a fee.
(b) The copying fees prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section are:
$0.10 Each copy of each page, up to 8
1/2
″ × 14″ made by photocopy or similar process.
$0.20 Each page of computer printout without regard to the number of carbon copies concurrently printed.
(c) Payment of fees under this section shall be made in cash, or preferably by check or money order payable to the “Treasurer of the United States.” Payment shall be delivered or sent to the office stated in the billing notice or, if none is stated, to the Privacy Act Officer processing the request. Payment may be required in the form of a certified check in appropriate circumstances. Postage stamps will not be accepted.
(d) A copying fee totaling $1 or less shall be waived, but the copying fees for contemporaneous requests by the same individual shall be aggregated to determine the total fee. A copying fee shall not be charged or collected, or alternatively, it may be reduced when such action is determined by the Privacy Act Officer to be in the public interest.
(e) Special and additional services provided at the request of the individual, such as certification or authentication, postal insurance and special mailing arrangement costs, will be charged to the individual in accordance with other published regulations of the Department pursuant to statute (for example, 31 U.S.C. 433a).
(f) This section applies only to individuals making requests under this part. All other persons shall remain subject to fees and charges prescribed by other and appropriate authorities.
[40 FR 39729, Aug. 28, 1975, as amended at 42 FR 29479, June 9, 1977]
§ 16.13
Penalties.
(a) The Act provides, in pertinent part:
Any person who knowingly and willfully requests or obtains any record concerning an individual from an agency under false pretences shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000. (5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3))
(b) A person who falsely or fraudulently attempts to obtain records under the Act may also be subject to prosecution under such other criminal statutes as 18 U.S.C. 494, 495 and 1001.
§ 16.14
General exemptions.
(a) Individuals may not have access to records maintained by the Department but which were provided by another agency which has determined by regulation that such information is subject to general exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j). If such exempt records
are within a request for access, the Department will advise the individual of their existence and of the name and address of the source agency. For any further information concerning the record and the exemption, the individual must contact that source agency.
(b) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has determined that the Office of the Assistant Inspector General for Investigation performs, as its principal function, activities pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. The records maintained by that office in a system identified as “HUD/DEPT-24, Investigation Files,” primarily consist of information compiled for the purpose of criminal investigations and are associated with identifiable individuals. Therefore, the Secretary has determined that this system of records shall be exempt, consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), from all requirements of the Privacy Act except 5 U.S.C. 552a (b), (c) (1) and (2), (e)(4) (A) through (F), (e) (6), (7), (9), (10), and (11), and (i) unless elsewhere exempted.
[40 FR 39729, Aug. 28, 1975, as amended at 49 FR 20486, May 15, 1984]
§ 16.15
Specific exemptions.
Whenever the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines it to be necessary and proper, with respect to any system of records maintained by the Department, to exercise the right to promulgate rules to exempt such systems in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k), each specific exemption, including the parts of each system to be exempted, the provisions of the Act from which they are exempted, and the justification for each exemption shall be published in the
Federal Register
as part of the Department's Notice of Systems of Records.
(a) Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), (I), and (f). This exemption allows the Department to withhold records compiled for law enforcement purposes. The reasons for adopting this exemption are to prevent individuals, who are the subjects of investigation, from frustrating the investigatory process, to ensure the integrity of the investigatory process, to ensure the integrity of law enforcement activities, to prevent disclosure of investigative techniques, and to protect the confidentiality of sources of information. The names of systems correspond to those published in the
Federal Register
as part of the Department's Notice of Systems of Records.
(1) HUD/DEPT-15. Equal Opportunity Housing Complaints.
(2) HUD/DEPT-24. Investigation Files in the Office of the Inspector General.
(3) HUD/DEPT-25. Legal Action Files.
(b) Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552(k)(5) from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4), (G), (H), and (I), and (f). This exemption allows the Department to withhold records compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal contracts, or access to classified material. The reasons for adopting this exemption are to insure the proper functioning of the investigatory process, to insure effective determination of suitability, eligibility and qualification for employment and to protect the confidentiality of sources of information. The names of systems correspond to those published in the
Federal Register
as part of the Department's Notice of Systems of Records.
(1) HUD/DEPT-24. Investigation Files in the Office of the Inspector General.
(2) HUD/DEPT-25. Legal Action Files.
(c) The system of records entitled “HUD/PIH-1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files” consists in part of investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes. Relevant records will be used by appropriate Federal, state or local agencies charged with the responsibility for investigating or prosecuting violations of law. Therefore, to the extent that information in the system falls within the coverage of subsection (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), the system is exempt from the requirements of the following subsections of the Privacy Act, for the reasons stated below.
(1) From subsection (c)(3) because release of an accounting of disclosures to an individual who may be the subject of an investigation could reveal the nature and scope of the investigation and
could result in the altering or destruction of evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, and other evasive actions that could impede or compromise the investigation.
(2) From subsection (d)(1) because release of the records to an individual who may become or has become the subject of an investigation could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties, reveal the identity of confidential sources, or reveal sensitive investigative techniques and procedures.
(3) From subsection (d)(2) because amendment or correction of the records could interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, or could impose an impossible administrative and investigative burden by requiring the office that maintains the records to continuously retrograde its verifications of tenant eligibility attempting to resolve questions of accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness.
(4) From subsection (e)(1) because it is often impossible to determine relevance or necessity of information in pre-investigative early stages. The value of such information is a question of judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected may ultimately be evaluated and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to an investigation. In addition, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, or investigators, may obtain information concerning the violation of laws other than those within the scope of its jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, or investigators, should retain this information because it may aid in establishing patterns of unlawful activity and provide leads for other law enforcement agencies. Further, in obtaining the evidence, information may be provided which relates to matters incidental to the main purpose of the inquiry or investigation but which may be pertinent to the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be identified.
(d) The system of records entitled “HUD/PIH-1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files” consists in part of material that may be used for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment or Federal contracts, the release of which would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. Therefore, to the extent that information in this system falls within the coverage of subsection (k)(5) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), the system is exempt from the requirements of the following subsection of the Privacy Act, for the reasons stated below.
(1) From subsection (d)(1) because release would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise of confidentiality. Revealing the identity of a confidential source could impede future cooperation by sources, and could result in harassment or harm to such sources.

(a) For purposes of this subpart, a claim shall be deemed to have been presented when the Department receives, at a place designated in paragraph (b) of this section, an executed
Claim for Damages or Injury,
Standard Form 95, or other written notification of an incident, accompanied by a claim for money damages in a sum certain for injury to or loss of property, for personal injury, or for death alleged to have occurred by reason of the incident. A claim which should have been presented to the Department, but which was mistakenly addressed to or filed with another Federal agency, is
deemed to be presented to the Department as of the date that the claim is received by the Department. If a claim is mistakenly addressed to or filed with the Department, the Department shall forthwith transfer it to the appropriate Federal agency, if ascertainable, or return it to the claimant.
(b) A claimant shall mail or deliver his claim to the office of employment of the Department employee or employees whose negligent or wrongful act or omission is alleged to have caused the loss or injury complained of. Where such office of employment is the Department Central Office in Washington, or is not reasonably known and not reasonably ascertainable, claimant shall file his claim with the Assistant Secretary for Administration, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. In all other cases, claimant shall address his claim to the head of the appropriate office, the address of which will generally be found listed in the local telephone directory.

A claim for loss partially compensated by an insurer with the rights of a subrogee may be presented by the insurer or the insured individually, as their respective interests appear, or jointly. Whenever an insurer presents a claim asserting the rights of a subrogee, he shall present with his claim appropriate evidence that he has the rights of a subrogee.
(e) A claim presented by an agent or legal representative shall be presented in the name of the claimant, be signed by the agent or legal representative, show the title or legal capacity of the person signing, and be accompanied by evidence of his authority to present a claim on behalf of the claimant as agent, executor, administrator, parent, guardian, or other representative.

Authority to adjust, determine, compromise, and settle claims.
The General Counsel, the Deputy General Counsel, and such employees of the Office of the General Counsel as may be designated by the General Counsel, are authorized to consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise, and settle claims pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. 2671, and the regulations contained in 28 CFR part 14 and in this subpart.

(3) The United States is or may be entitled to indemnity or contribution from a third party, and the Department is unable to adjust the third party claim; or
(4) The compromise of a particular claim, as a practical matter, will or may control the disposition of a related claim in which the amount to be paid may exceed $25,000.
(c) An administrative claim may be adjusted, determined, compromised, or settled only after consultation with the Department of Justice when the Department is informed or is otherwise aware that the United States or an officer, employee, agent, or cost-type contractor of the United States is involved in litigation based on a claim arising out of the same incident or transaction.

(b) Acceptance by the claimant, his agent, or legal representative of an award, compromise, or settlement made under section 2672 or 2677 of Title 28, United States Code, is final and conclusive on the claimant, his agent or legal representative, and any other person on whose behalf or for whose benefit the claim has been presented, and constitutes a complete release of any claim against the United States and against any officer or employee of the Government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim, by reason of the same subject matter.

# Subpart B—Claims Under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees Claims Act of 1964

# Authority:
Sec. 3, 78 Stat. 767 (31 U.S.C. 3721).

# Source:
36 FR 24427, Dec. 22, 1971, unless otherwise noted.
§ 17.40
Scope and purpose.
(a) This subpart applies to all claims filed by or on behalf of employees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development for loss of or damage to personal property which occurs incident to their service with HUD under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act of 1964. A claim must be substantiated and the possession of the property determined to be reasonable, useful, or proper. The maximum amount that can be paid under any claim under the Act is $25,000 and property may be replaced in kind at the option of the Government. Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to bar claims payable under statutory authority.
(b) HUD is not an insurer and does not underwrite all personal property losses that an employee may sustain. Employees are encouraged to carry private insurance to the maximum extent practicable to avoid large losses or losses which may not be recoverable from HUD. The procedures set forth in this section are designed to enable the claimant to obtain the maximum amount of compensation for his loss or damage. Failure of the claimant to comply with these procedures may reduce or preclude payment of his claim under this subpart.
[36 FR 24427, Dec. 22, 1971, as amended at 48 FR 6536, Feb. 14, 1983]
§ 17.41
Claimants.
(a) A claim pursuant to this subpart may only be made by:
(1) An employee of HUD.
(2) A former employee of HUD whose claim arises out of an incident occurring before his separation from HUD.
(3) Survivors of a person named in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, in the following order of precedence:
(i) Spouse.
(ii) Children.
(iii) Father or mother, or both.
(iv) Brothers or sisters, or both.
(4) The authorized agent or legal representative of a person named in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section.
(b) A claim may not be presented by or for the benefit of a subrogee, assignee, conditional vendor, or other third party.
§ 17.42
Time limitations.
A claim under this part may be allowed only if:
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, it is filed in writing within 2 years after accrual. For purposes of this part, a claim accrues at the time of the accident or incident causing the loss or damage, or at such time as the loss or damage should have been discovered by the claimant by the exercise of due diligence.
(b) It cannot be filed within the time limits of paragraph (a) of this section, because it accrues in time of war or in time of armed conflict in which any armed force of the United States is engaged or if such a war or armed conflict intervenes within 2 years after it accrues, and if good cause is shown, and if it is filed not later than 2 years after that cause ceases to exist, or 2 years after the war or armed conflict is terminated, whichever is earlier.
§ 17.43
Allowable claims.
(a) A claim may be allowed only if:
(1) The damage or loss was not caused wholly or partly by the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant, his agent, the members of his family, or his private employee (the standard to be applied is that of reasonable care under the circumstances); and
(2) The possession of the property lost or damaged and the quantity possessed is determined to have been reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances; and
(3) The claim is substantiated by proper and convincing evidence.
(b) Claims which are otherwise allowable under this part shall not be disallowed solely because the property was not in the possession of the claimant at the time of the damage or loss, or solely because the claimant was not
the legal owner of the property for which the claim is made. For example, borrowed property may be the subject of a claim.
(c) Subject to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section, and the other provisions of this subpart, any claim for damage to, or loss of, personal property incident to service with HUD may be considered and allowed. The following are examples of the principal types of claims which may be allowed, but these examples are not exclusive and other types of claims may be allowed, unless excluded by §§ 17.44 and 17.45:
(1)
Property loss or damage in quarters or other authorized places.
Claims may be allowed for damage to, or loss of, property arising from fire, flood, hurricane, other natural disaster, theft, or other unusual occurrence, while such property is located at:
(i) Quarters within the 50 States or the District of Columbia that were assigned to the claimant or otherwise provided in kind by the United States;
(ii) Quarters outside the 50 States and the District of Columbia that were occupied by the claimant, whether or not they were assigned or otherwise provided in kind by the United States, except when the claimant is a civilian employee who is a local inhabitant; or
(iii) Any warehouse, office, working area, or other place (except quarters) authorized or apparently authorized for the reception or storage of property.
(2)
Transportation or travel losses.
Claims may be allowed for damage to, or loss of, property incident to transportation or storage pursuant to orders, or in connection with travel under orders, including property in the custody of a carrier, an agent or agency of the Government, or the claimant.
(3)
Manufactured homes.

§ 17.44
Restrictions on certain claims.
Claims of the type described in this section are only allowable subject to the restrictions noted:
(a)
Money or currency.
Claims may be allowed for loss of money or currency only when lost incident to fire, flood, hurricane, other natural disaster, or by theft from quarters (as limited by paragraph (a) of § 17.45). In instances of theft from quarters, it must be conclusively shown that the quarters were locked at the time of the theft. Reimbursement for loss of money or currency is limited to an amount which is determined to have been reasonable for the claimant to have had in his possession at the time of the loss.
(b)
Government property.
Claims may only be allowed for property owned by the United States for which the claimant is financially responsible to any agency of the Government other than HUD.
(c)
Estimate fees.
Claims may include fees paid to obtain estimates of repair only when it is clear that an estimate could not have been obtained without paying a fee. In that case, the fee may be allowed only in an amount determined to be reasonable in relation to the value of the property or the cost of the repairs.
(d)
Automobiles and other motor vehicles.
Claims may only be allowed for damage to, or loss of, automobiles and other motor vehicles if:
(1) Such motor vehicles were required to be used for official Government business (official Government business, as used here, does not include travel, or parking incident thereto, between quarters and office, or use of vehicles for the convenience of the owner. However, it does include travel, and parking incident thereto, between quarters and assigned place of duty specifically authorized by the employee's supervisor as being more advantageous to the Government); or
(2) Shipment of such motor vehicles was being furnished or provided by the Government, subject to the provisions of § 17.46.
§ 17.45
Unallowable claims.
Claims are not allowable for the following:
(a)
Unassigned quarters in United States.
Property loss or damage in quarters occupied by the claimant within the 50 States or the District of Columbia that were not assigned to him or otherwise provided in kind by the United States.
(b)
Business property.
Property used for business or profit.
(c)
Unserviceable property.
Wornout or unserviceable property.
(d)
Illegal possession.
Property acquired, possessed, or transported in violation of law or in violation of applicable regulations or directives.
(e)
Articles of extraordinary value.
Valuable articles, such as cameras, watches, jewelry, furs, or other articles of extraordinary value, when shipped with household goods or as unaccompanied baggage (shipment includes storage). This prohibition does not apply to articles in the personal custody of the claimant or articles properly checked, provided that reasonable protection or security measures have been taken by claimant.
(f)
Minimum amount.
Loss or damage amounting to less than $10.
§ 17.46
Claims involving carriers or insurers.
In the event the property which is the subject of a claim was lost or damaged while in the possession of a carrier or was insured, the following procedures will apply:
(a) Whenever property is damaged, lost, or destroyed while being shipped pursuant to authorized travel orders, the owner must file a written claim for reimbursement with the last commercial carrier known or believed to have handled the goods, or the carrier known to be in possession of the property when the damage or loss occurred, according to the terms of its bill of lading or contract, before submitting a claim against the Government under this subpart.
(1) If more than one bill of lading or contract was issued, a separate demand should be made against the last carrier on each such document.
(2) The demand should be made within 9 months of the date that delivery was made, or within 9 months of the date that delivery should ordinarily have been made.
(3) If it is apparent that the damage or loss is attributable to packing, storage, or unpacking while in the custody of the Government, no demand need be made against the carrier.
(b) Whenever property which is damaged, lost, or destroyed incident to the claimant's service is insured in whole or in part, the claimant must make demand in writing against the insurer for reimbursement under the terms and conditions of the insurance coverage, prior to the filing of the concurrent claim against the Government.
(c) Failure to make a demand on a carrier or insurer or to make all reasonable efforts to protect and prosecute rights available against a carrier or insurer and to collect the amount recoverable from the carrier or insurer may result in reducing the amount recoverable from the Government by the maximum amount which would have been recoverable from the carrier or insurer, had the claim been timely or
diligently prosecuted. However, no deduction will be made where the circumstances of the claimant's service preclude reasonable filing of such a claim or diligent prosecution, or the evidence indicates a demand was impracticable or would have been unavailing.
(d) Following the submission of the claim against the carrier or insurer, the claimant may immediately submit his claim against the Government in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, without waiting until either final approval or denial of his claim is made by the carrier or insurer.
(1) Upon submitting his claim, he will certify in his claim that he has or has not gained any recovery from a carrier or insurer, and enclose all correspondence pertinent thereto.
(2) If final action has not been taken by the carrier or insurer on his claim, he will immediately notify them to address all correspondence in regard to his claim to him, in care of the General Counsel of HUD.
(3) The claimant shall advise the General Counsel of any action taken by the carrier or insurer on his claim and upon request shall furnish all correspondence documents, and other evidence pertinent to the matter.
(e) The claimant will assign to the United States to the extent of any payment on his claim accepted by him, all his right, title and interest in any claim he may have against any carrier, insurer, or other party arising out of the incident on which the claim against the United States is based. After payment of his claim by the United States, the claimant will, upon receipt of any payment from a carrier or insurer, pay the proceeds to the United States to the extent of the payment received by him from the United States.
(f) Where a claimant recovers for the loss from the carrier or insurer before his claim under this subpart is settled, the amount or recovery shall be applied to his claim as follows:
(1) When the amount recovered from a carrier, insurer, or other third party is greater than or equal to the claimant's total loss as determined under this part, no compensation is allowable under this part.
(2) When the amount recovered is less than such total loss, the allowable amount is determined by deducting the recovery from the amount of such total loss.
(3) For the purpose of this paragraph (f) the claimant's total loss is to be determined without regard to the $6,500 maximum set forth above. However, if the resulting amount, after making this deduction, exceeds $6,500, the claimant will be allowed only $6,500.
§ 17.47
Settlement of claims.
(a) The General Counsel, HUD, is authorized to settle (consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, and dispose of, whether by full or partial allowance or disallowance) any claim under this subpart.
(b) The General Counsel may formulate such procedures and make such redelegations as may be required to fulfill the objectives of this subpart.
(c) The General Counsel shall conduct such investigation as may be appropriate in order to determine the validity of a claim.
(d) The General Counsel shall notify a claimant in writing of action taken on his claim, and if partial or full disallowance is made, the reasons therefor.
(e) In the event a claim submitted against a carrier under § 17.46 has not been settled before settlement of the claim against the Government pursuant to this subpart, the General Counsel shall notify such carrier or insurer to pay the proceeds of the claim to HUD to the extent HUD has paid such to claimant in settlement.
§ 17.48
Computation of amount of award.
(a) The amount allowed for damage to or loss of any item of property may not exceed the cost of the item (either the price paid in cash or property, or the value at the time of acquisition if not acquired by purchase or exchange); and there will be no allowance for replacement cost or for appreciation in the value of the property. Subject to these limitations, the amount allowable is either:
(1) The depreciated value, immediately prior to the loss or damage, of
property lost or damaged beyond economical repair, less any salvage value; or
(2) The reasonable cost of repairs, when property is economically repairable, provided that the cost of repairs does not exceed the amount allowable under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(b) Depreciation in value is determined by considering the type of article involved, its cost, its condition when damaged or lost, and the time elapsed between the date of acquisition and the date of damage or loss.
(c) Replacement of lost or damaged property may be made in kind whenever appropriate.
§ 17.49
Attorney's fees.
No more than 10 per centum of the amount paid in settlement of each individual claim submitted and settled under this subpart shall be paid or delivered to or received by any agent or attorney on account of services rendered in connection with that claim.
§ 17.50
Claims procedures.
(a) Claims by, or on behalf of, employees of field offices shall be filed in writing with the appropriate Regional Counsel. Claims by, or on behalf of, employees of Department Headquarters shall be filed in writing with the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410.
(b) Each written claim shall contain, as a minimum:
(1) Name, address, place of employment of claimant.
(2) Place and date of loss or damage.
(3) A brief statement of the facts and circumstances surrounding loss or damage.
(4) Cost, date, and place of acquisition of each piece of property lost or damaged.
(5) Two itemized repair estimates, or value estimates, whichever is applicable.
(6) Copies of police reports, if applicable.
(7) With respect to claims involving thefts or losses in quarters or other places where the property was reasonably kept, a statement as to what security precautions were taken to protect the property involved.
(8) With respect to claims involving property being used for the benefit of the Government, a statement by the employee's supervisor evidencing that the claimant was required to provide such property or that his providing it was in the interest of the Government.
(9) Other evidence as may be required by the General Counsel.

# Administrative Offset and Other Actions
§ 17.65
Demand and notice of intent to offset.
HUD will make written demand upon the debtor pursuant to the requirements of 31 CFR 901.2 and send written notice of intent to offset to the debtor pursuant to the requirements of 31 CFR 901.3 and 31 CFR part 285, subpart A. The Secretary shall mail the demand and notice of intent to offset to the debtor, at the most current address that is available to the Secretary. HUD may refer the debt to the Treasury for collection and shall request that the amount of the debt be offset against any amount payable by the Treasury as a Federal payment, at any time after 60 days from the date such notice is sent to the debtor.
§ 17.67
Review of departmental records related to the debt.
(a)
Notification by the debtor.
A debtor who intends to inspect or copy departmental records related to the debt pursuant to 31 CFR 901.3 must, within 20 calendar days after the date of the notice in § 17.65, send a letter to HUD, at the address indicated in the notice of intent to offset, stating his or her intention. A debtor may also request, within 20 calendar days from the date of such notice, that HUD provide the debtor with a copy of departmental records related to the debt.
(b)
HUD's response.
In response to a timely notification by the debtor as described in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD shall notify the debtor of the location and the time when the debtor may inspect or copy departmental records related to the debt. If the debtor requests that HUD provide a copy of departmental records related to the debt, HUD shall send the records to the debtor within 10 calendar days from the date that HUD receives the debtor's request. HUD may charge the debtor a reasonable fee to compensate for the cost of providing a copy of the departmental records related to the debt.
§ 17.69
Review within HUD of a determination that an amount is past due and legally enforceable.
(a)
Notification by the debtor.
A debtor who receives notice of intent to offset pursuant to § 17.65 has the right to a review of the case and to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past due or not legally enforceable. The debtor may send a copy of the notice with a letter notifying the Office of Hearings and Appeals of his or her intention to present evidence. Failure to give this notice shall not jeopardize the debtor's right to present evidence within the 60 calendar days provided for in
paragraph (b) of this section. If the Office of Hearings and Appeals has additional procedures governing the review process, a copy of the procedures shall be mailed to the debtor after the request for review is received and docketed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.
(b)
Submission of evidence.
If the debtor wishes to submit evidence showing that all or part of the debt is not past due or not legally enforceable, the debtor must submit such evidence to the Office of Hearings and Appeals within 60 calendar days after the date of the notice of intent to offset. Failure to submit evidence will result in a dismissal of the request for review by the OHA.
(c)
Review of the record.
After timely submission of evidence by the debtor, the OHA will review the evidence submitted by the Department that shows that all or part of the debt is past due and legally enforceable. The decision of an administrative judge of the OHA will be based on a preponderance of the evidence as to whether there is a debt that is past due and whether it is legally enforceable. The administrative judge of the OHA shall make a determination based upon a review of the evidence that comprises the written record, except that the OHA may order an oral hearing if the administrative judge of the OHA finds that:
(1) An applicable statute authorizes or requires the Department to consider a waiver of the indebtedness and the waiver determination turns on credibility or veracity; or
(2) The question of indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence.
(d)
Previous decision by an administrative judge of the Office of Hearings and Appeals.
The debtor is not entitled to a review of the Department's intent to offset if an administrative judge of the OHA has previously issued a decision on the merits that the debt is past due and legally enforceable, except when the debt has become legally unenforceable since the issuance of that decision, or the debtor can submit newly discovered material evidence that the debt is presently not legally enforceable.
§ 17.71
Request for hearing.
The debtor shall file a request for a hearing with the OHA at the address specified in the notice or at such other address as the OHA may direct in writing to the debtor.
§ 17.73
Determination of the HUD Office of Hearings and Appeals.
(a)
Determination.
An administrative judge of the OHA shall issue a written decision that includes the supporting rationale for the decision. The decision of the administrative judge of the OHA concerning whether a debt or part of a debt is past due and legally enforceable is the final agency decision with respect to the past due status and enforceability of the debt.
(b)
Copies.
Copies of the decision of the administrative judge of the OHA shall be distributed to HUD's General Counsel, HUD's Chief Financial Officer (CFO), or other appropriate HUD program official, the debtor, and the debtor's attorney or other representative, if any.
(c)
Notification to the Department of the Treasury.
If the decision of the administrative judge of the OHA affirms that all or part of the debt is past due and legally enforceable, HUD shall notify the Treasury after the date that the determination of the OHA has been issued under paragraph (a) of this section and a copy of the determination has been received by HUD's CFO or other appropriate HUD program official. No referral shall be made to the Treasury if the review of the debt by an administrative judge of the OHA subsequently determines that the debt is not past due or not legally enforceable.
§ 17.75
Postponements, withdrawals, and extensions of time.
(a)
Postponements and withdrawals.
HUD may, for good cause, postpone or withdraw referral of the debt to the Treasury.
(b)
Extensions of time.
At the discretion of an administrative judge of the OHA, time limitations required in these procedures may be extended in appropriate circumstances for good cause.
§ 17.77
Stay of referral for offset.
If the debtor timely submits evidence in accordance with § 17.69(b), the referral to the Treasury in § 17.65 shall be stayed until the date of the issuance of a written decision by an administrative judge of the OHA that determines that a debt or part of a debt is past due and legally enforceable.
§ 17.79
Administrative actions for nonpayment of debt.
(a)
Referrals for nonpayment of debt.
When a contractor, grantee, or other participant in a program sponsored by HUD, fails to pay its debt to HUD within a reasonable time after demand, HUD shall take such measures to:
(1) Refer such contractor, grantee, or other participant to the Office of General Counsel for investigation of the matter and possible suspension or debarment pursuant to 2 CFR part 2424, 2 CFR 180.800, and 48 CFR subpart 9.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR); and
(2) In the case of matters involving fraud or suspected fraud, refer such contractor, grantee, or other participant to the Office of Inspector General for investigation. However, the failure to pay HUD within a reasonable time after demand is not a prerequisite for referral for fraud or suspected fraud.
(b)
Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).
Depending upon the outcome of the referral in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD shall take such measures to insure that the contractor, grantee, or other participant is placed on the EPLS.
(c)
Report to the Treasury.
The failure of any surety to honor its obligations in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9304 shall be reported to the Chief Financial Officer, who shall inform the Treasury.

# Administrative Wage Garnishment
§ 17.81
Administrative wage garnishment.
(a)
In general.
HUD may collect a debt by using administrative wage garnishment pursuant to 31 CFR 285.11. To the extent that situations arise that are not covered by 31 CFR 285.11, those situations shall be governed by 24 CFR part 26, subpart A.
(b)
Hearing official.
Any hearing required to establish HUD's right to collect a debt through administrative wage garnishment shall be conducted by an administrative judge of the OHA under 24 CFR part 26, subpart A of part 26.

# Salary Offset
§ 17.83
Scope and definitions.
(a) The provisions set forth in §§ 17.83 through 17.113 are the Department's procedures for the collection of delinquent nontax debts by salary offset of a Federal employee's pay to satisfy certain debts owed the government, including centralized salary offsets in accordance with 31 CFR part 285.
(b)(1) This section and §§ 17.85 through 17.99 apply to collections by the Secretary through salary offset from current employees of the Department and other agencies who owe debts to the Department; and
(2) This section, § 17.85, and §§ 17.101 through 17.113 apply to HUD's offset of pay to current employees of the Department and of other agencies who owe debts to HUD or other agencies under noncentralized salary offset procedures, in accordance with 5 CFR 550.1109.
(c) These regulations do not apply to debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 1-9602), the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301-1397f), the tariff laws of the United States, or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.
(d) These regulations identify the types of salary offset available to the Department, as well as certain rights provided to the employee, which include a written notice before deductions begin, the opportunity to petition for a hearing, receiving a written decision if a hearing is granted, and the opportunity to propose a repayment agreement in lieu of offset. These employee rights do not apply to any adjustment to pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be
recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.
(e) Nothing in these regulations precludes the compromise, suspension, or termination of collection actions where appropriate under the Department's regulations contained elsewhere in this subpart (see 24 CFR 17.61 through 17.79).
(f) As used in the salary offset provisions at §§ 17.83 through 17.113:

(ii) Amounts withheld for Federal employment taxes;
(iii) Amounts properly withheld for Federal, state, or local income tax purposes, if the withholding of the amount is authorized or required by law and if amounts withheld are not greater than would be the case if the individual claimed all dependents to which he or she were entitled. The withholding of additional amounts under 26 U.S.C. 3402(i) may be permitted only when the individual presents evidence of tax obligation that supports the additional withholding;
(iv) Amounts deducted as health insurance premiums, including, but not limited to, amounts deducted from civil service annuities for Medicare where such deductions are requested by the Health Care Financing Administration;

offset is one type of administrative offset that may be used by the Department in the collection of claims.
Waiver
means the cancellation, remission, forgiveness, or nonrecovery of a debt allegedly owed by an employee of an agency as permitted or required by 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C. 716, or 5 U.S.C. 8346(b), or any other law.
§ 17.85

(a)
When HUD is owed the debt.

(1) The existence or amount of the debt; or
(2) The Secretary's proposed offset schedule.
(b) The petition must be signed by the employee, must include a copy of HUD's Notice of Intent to Offset Salary, and should admit or deny the existence of or the amount of the debt, or any part of the debt, briefly setting forth any basis for a denial. If the employee objects to the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted from each check, the petition should state the objection and the reasons for it. The petition should identify and explain with reasonable specificity and brevity the facts, evidence, and witnesses that the employee believes support his or her position.
(c) Upon receipt of the petition, the Office of Hearings and Appeals will send the employee a copy of the Salary Offset Hearing Procedures Manual of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
(d) If the employee files a petition for hearing later than the 20 calendar days as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the hearing officer may accept the request if the employee can show that the delay was because of circumstances beyond his or her control or because of failure to receive notice of the filing deadline (unless the employee has actual notice of the filing deadline).
§ 17.93
Result if employee fails to meet deadlines.
An employee waives the right to a hearing, and will have his or her disposable pay offset in accordance with the Secretary's offset schedule, if the employee:
(a) Fails to file a petition for a hearing as prescribed in § 17.91; or
(b) Is scheduled to appear and fails to appear at the hearing.
§ 17.95
Written decision following a hearing.
Written decisions provided after a request for a hearing will include:
(a) A statement of the facts presented to support the nature and origin of the alleged debt;
(b) The hearing officer's analysis, findings, and conclusions, in light of the hearing, concerning the employee's or the Department's grounds;
(c) The amount and validity of the alleged debt; and
(d) The repayment schedule, if applicable.
§ 17.97
Review of departmental records related to the debt.
(a)
Notification by employee.
An employee who intends to inspect or copy departmental records related to the debt must send a letter to the Secretary stating his or her intention. The letter must be received by the Secretary within 20 calendar days of the date of the Notice of Intent.
(b)
Secretary's response.
In response to timely notice submitted by the debtor as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary will notify the employee of the location and time when the employee may inspect and copy Department records related to the debt.
§ 17.99
Written agreement to repay debt as alternative to salary offset.
(a)
Notification by employee.
The employee may propose, in response to a Notice of Intent, a written agreement to repay the debt as an alternative to salary offset. Any employee who wishes to do this must submit a proposed written agreement to repay the debt, which is received by the Secretary within 20 calendar days of the date of the Notice of Intent.
(b)
Secretary's response.
In response to timely notice by the debtor as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary will notify the employee whether the employee's proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within the Secretary's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding by offset. In making this determination, the Secretary will balance the Department's interest in collecting the debt against hardship to the employee. If the debt is delinquent and the employee has not disputed its existence or amount, the Secretary will accept a repayment agreement instead of offset only if the employee is able to establish that offset would result in undue financial hardship or would be against equity and good conscience.
§ 17.101
Procedures for salary offset: when deductions may begin.
(a) Deductions to liquidate an employee's debt will be by the method and in the amount stated in the Secretary's Notice of Intent to collect from the employee's current pay.
(b) If the employee filed a petition for hearing with the Secretary before the expiration of the period provided for in § 17.91, then deductions will begin after:
(1) The hearing officer has provided the employee with a hearing; and
(2) The hearing officer has issued a final written decision in favor of the Secretary.
(c) If an employee retires or resigns before collection of the amount of the indebtedness is completed, the remaining indebtedness will be collected according to the procedures for the collection of claims under §§ 17.61 through 17.79.
§ 17.103
Procedures for salary offset: types of collection.
A debt will be collected in a lump sum or in installments. Collection will be by lump-sum collection unless the debt is for other than travel advances and training expenses, and the employee is financially unable to pay in one lump sum, or the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay. In these cases, deduction will be by installments.
§ 17.105
Procedures for salary offset: methods of collection.
(a)
General.
A debt will be collected by deductions at officially established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account, unless the employee and the Secretary agree to alternative arrangements for repayment. The alternative arrangement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the Secretary.
(b)
Installment deductions.
Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, the installment payment will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in 3 years. Installment payments of less than $25 per pay period or $50 a month will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.
(c)
Sources of deductions.
The Department will make deductions only from basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or, in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay.
§ 17.107
Procedures for salary offset: imposition of interest.
Interest will be charged in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards as provided in 31 CFR 901.9.
§ 17.109
Nonwaiver of rights.
So long as there are no statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary, no employee involuntary payment (of all or a portion of a debt) collected under these regulations will be interpreted as a waiver of any rights that the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other provision of contract or law.
§ 17.111
Refunds.
The Department will refund promptly to the appropriate individual amounts offset under these regulations when:
(a) A debt is waived or otherwise found not owing the United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or
(b) The Department is directed by an administrative or judicial order to refund amounts deducted from the employee's current pay.
§ 17.113
Miscellaneous provisions: correspondence with the Department.
The employee shall file a request for a hearing with the Clerk, OHA, 409 3rd Street SW., 2nd Floor, Washington, DC 20024, on official work days between the hours of 8:45 a.m. and 5:15 p.m. (or such other address as HUD may provide by notice from time to time). All other correspondence shall be submitted to the Departmental Claims Officer, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410 (or such other officer or address as HUD may provide by notice from time to time).

§ 18.1
Policy.
(a) The Department of Housing and Urban Development may indemnify, in whole or in part, a Department employee (which for the purpose of this part includes a former Department employee) for any verdict, judgment or other monetary award which is rendered against any such employee, provided the Secretary or his or her designee determines that:
(1) The conduct giving rise to the verdict, judgment or award was taken within the scope of his or her employment with the Department; and
(2) Such indemnification is in the interest of the United States.
(b) The Department of Housing and Urban Development may settle or compromise a personal damage claim against a Department employee by the payment of available funds, at any time, provided the Secretary or his or her designee determines that:
(1) The alleged conduct giving rise to the personal damage claim was taken within the scope of employment; and
(2) That such settlement or compromise is in the interest of the United States.
(c) Absent exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Secretary or his or her designee, the Department will not entertain a request either to agree to indemnify or to settle a personal damage claim before entry of an adverse verdict, judgment or monetary award.
(d) When an employee of the Department becomes aware that an action has been filed against the employee in his or her individual capacity as a result of conduct taken within the scope of his or her employment, the employee should immediately notify his or her supervisor that such an action is pending. The supervisor shall promptly notify the head of his or her operating component and the Associate General Counsel for Litigation and Fair Housing Enforcement, if the supervisor is located at headquarters, or Field Assistant General Counsel—who shall promptly notify the Associate General Counsel for Litigation and Fair Housing Enforcement—if the supervisor is located in the field. As used in this section, the term “principal operating component” means an office in the Department headed by an Assistant Secretary, the General Counsel, the Inspector General, or an equivalent departmental officer who reports directly to the Secretary. Questions regarding representation of the employee will be
determined by the Department of Justice pursuant to 28 CFR 50.15 (Representation of Federal officials and employees by Department of Justice attorneys or by private counsel furnished by the Department in civil, criminal, and congressional proceedings in which Federal employees are sued, subpoenaed, or charged in their individual capacities).
(e) The employee may, thereafter, request indemnification to satisfy a verdict, judgment or monetary award entered against the employee or to compromise a claim pending against the employee. The employee shall submit a written request, with appropriate documentation including a copy of the verdict, judgment, award or other order or settlement proposal, in a timely manner to the head of the employee's principal operating component. The head of the employee's principal operating component shall submit the written request and accompanying documentation, together with a recommended disposition of the request, in a timely manner to the General Counsel.
(f) The General Counsel shall seek the views of the Department of Justice on the request. Where the Department of Justice has rendered a decision denying representation of the employee pursuant to 28 CFR 50.15, the General Counsel shall seek the concurrence of the Department of Justice on the request. If the Department of Justice does not concur in the request, the General Counsel shall so advise the employee and no further action on the employee's request shall be taken.
(g) In all instances except those where the Department of Justice has non-concurred in the request, the General Counsel shall forward for decision to the Secretary or his or her designee the employee's request, the recommendation of the head of the employee's principal operating component, the views of the Department of Justice, and the General Counsel's recommendation.
(h) Any payment under this part, either to indemnify a Department employee or to settle a personal damage claim, is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds of the Department that are permitted by law to be utilized for this purpose.

Notice of violation.
(a)
General.
The Chairperson of the Board, or the Chairperson's designee, shall issue a written notice to the mortgagee at the mortgagee's address of record at least 30 days prior to taking any action under 12 U.S.C. 1708(c) against the mortgagee. Proof of delivery to the mortgagee's address of record shall establish the mortgagee's receipt of the notice. The notice shall state the specific violations that have been alleged, and shall direct the mortgagee to reply in writing to the Board within 30 days after receipt of the notice by the mortgagee. The notice shall also provide the address to which the response shall be sent. If the mortgagee fails to reply during such time period, the Board may make a determination without considering any comments of the mortgagee.
(b)
Mortgagee's response.
The mortgagee's response to the Board shall be in a format prescribed by the Secretary and shall not exceed 15 double-spaced typewritten pages. The response shall include an executive summary, a statement of the facts surrounding the matter, an argument, and a conclusion. Such response shall also address the factors listed in § 25.8. A more lengthy submission, including documents and other exhibits, may be simultaneously submitted to Board staff for review.
(c)
Exception for letter of reprimand.
Whenever information comes before the Board that discloses a basis for the issuance of a letter of reprimand, the Board may issue the letter without having previously issued a notice of violation.
(d)
Exception for immediate suspension.

action is required to protect the financial interests of the Department or the public, the Board may take a suspension action without having previously issued a notice of violation.
[73 FR 60541, Oct. 10, 2008]
§ 25.8
Factors considered in taking administrative action.
In determining which administrative action under 12 U.S.C. 1708(c), if any, should be taken, the Board will consider, among other factors, the seriousness and extent of the violations, the degree of mortgagee responsibility for the occurrences, and any other mitigating or aggravating facts. Where the Board is considering a withdrawal action, the Board will also consider whether the violations were egregious or willful, in order to determine whether a permanent withdrawal is mandated by 12 U.S.C. 1708(c).
[73 FR 60541, Oct. 10, 2008]
§ 25.9
Notice of administrative action.
(a) Whenever the Board decides to take an action in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 1708(c)(3), the Chairperson of the Board, or the Chairperson's designee, shall issue a written notice of the action to the mortgagee at the mortgagee's address of record of the determination. Proof of delivery to the mortgagee's address of record shall establish the mortgagee's receipt of the notice.
(b) In actions for probation, suspension, or withdrawal, the notice shall describe the nature and duration of the administrative action, and shall specifically state the reasons for the action. In actions for probation, suspension, or withdrawal, the notice shall inform the mortgagee of its right to a hearing regarding the administrative action and of the manner and time in which to request a hearing.

(b)
Hearing by Administrative Law Judge.
Hearings are to be conducted by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), as set forth in this part. The ALJ shall commence a de novo hearing within 30 days of HUD's receipt of the mortgagee's request, unless the mortgagee moves for an extension of time. The ALJ may extend this time period for good cause.
(c)
Procedural rules.
The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of 24 CFR part 26, with the following modifications:

§ 25.11
Modification of Board orders.

[73 FR 60542, Oct. 10, 2008]
§ 25.12
Public access to information; publication of actions.
(a) Where a notice of administrative action does not result in a hearing and in any cases in which a settlement is entered into by the Board and a mortgagee, all non-privileged information regarding the nature of the violation and the resolution of the action shall be available to the public.

The Secretary shall publish, in the
Federal Register,
a description of and the cause for each administrative action taken by the Board against a mortgagee.

[73 FR 60542, Oct. 10, 2008]

(a)
Method of Service.
One copy of all pleadings, motions, and other documents required or permitted under

Responses to motions.
Within 10 days after receipt of any written motion, or within any other period as may be designated by the hearing officer, the opposing party shall respond to the motion and set forth any objections to the motion.

Motions for extensions of time.
Either party may file a motion for extension. At the discretion of the hearing officer, a motion for an extension of time may be granted for good cause at any time, notwithstanding an objection or any reply to the motion consistent with the provisions of § 26.2(c)(5) and (7).

(c)
Requesting an order.
In connection with any discovery procedure, by motion addressed to the hearing officer and upon a showing of a good faith attempt to resolve the issue without the hearing officer's intervention, either party may:
(1) Request an order compelling a response with respect to any objection to or other failure to respond to the discovery requested or any part thereof, or any failure to respond as specifically requested, or
(2) Request a protective order limiting the scope, methods, time and place for discovery, and provisions for protecting privileged information or documents.
(d)
Limitations.
(1) By order, the hearing officer may set or alter limits on the number of document requests,
depositions, and interrogatories, or the length of depositions.
(2) Orders compelling discovery shall be issued only where such discovery will not compel the disclosure of privileged information, unduly delay the hearing, or result in prejudice to the public interest or the rights of the parties, and upon a showing of good cause.
(3) Protective orders may be issued by a hearing officer if the hearing officer determines such an order is necessary to protect a party or other person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense because:
(i) The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;
(ii) The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or
(iii) The burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties' resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation, and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues.
(4) A party need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the party identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective order, the party from whom discovery is sought must show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the hearing officer may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause or, when the party's refusal to provide the information sought is solely due to undue expense, if the party seeking the discovery agrees to bear the expense associated with the request.
(e)
Refusal to honor discovery order.
When a party refuses to honor a discovery order, the hearing officer may issue such orders in regard to the refusal as justice shall require.
§ 26.19
Request for production of documents.
(a)
Request to produce.
Any party may serve upon any other party a written request to produce, and permit the party making the request, or someone acting on the requestor's behalf, to inspect, copy, test, or sample any designated documents—including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, sound recordings, images, and other data or data compilations stored in any medium from which information can be obtained—translated, if necessary, by the respondent into reasonably usable form, or to inspect, copy, test, or sample any designated tangible things that constitute or contain matters within the scope of § 26.18(a) and which are in the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is served.
(b)
Procedure.
The request shall set forth, either by individual item or by category, the items to be inspected, and describe each with reasonable particularity. The request shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making the inspection and performing the related acts. The request may specify the form or forms in which electronically stored information is to be produced.
(c)
Response to request to produce.
The party upon whom the request is served shall serve a written response within 20 days after service of the request. A shorter or longer time may be directed by the hearing officer, or in the absence of such an order, agreed to by the parties in a written document that shall be timely submitted to the hearing officer. The response shall state, with respect to each item or category, whether inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested. If there are any objections to any requests, including objections to the requested form or forms for producing electronically stored information, the response shall state the reasons for such objections. If objection is made to part of an item or category, the part shall be specified and inspection of the remaining parts shall be permitted. If objection is made to the requested format or forms for producing electronically stored information—or if no form
was specified in the request—the responding party must state the form or forms it intends to use. The party submitting the request may move for an order under § 26.18(c)(1) with respect to any objection to or other failure to respond to the request or any part thereof, or any failure to permit inspection as requested.
(d)
Form of production.
Unless the parties otherwise agree, or the hearing officer otherwise orders:
(1) A party who produces documents for inspection shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the request;
(2) If a request does not specify the format or forms for producing electronically stored information, a responding party must produce the information in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a form or forms that are reasonably usable; and
(3) A party need not produce the same electronically stored information in more than one form.
§ 26.20
Depositions.
(a)
Taking oral deposition.
A party may take the oral deposition of any person. Reasonable written notice of deposition shall be served upon the opposing party and the deponent. The attendance of a deponent may be compelled by subpoena where authorized by law or by other order of the hearing officer.
(b)
Testifying on oral deposition.
Each person testifying on oral deposition shall be placed under oath by the person before whom the deposition is taken. The deponent may be examined and cross-examined. The questions and the answers, together with all objections made, shall be recorded by the person before whom the deposition is to be taken, or under that person's direction.
(c)
Objections.
Objection may be made to questions or answers for any reason that would require the exclusion of the testimony under § 26.24 as if the witness were present and testifying at hearing. Objections shall be in short form, stating every ground for objection. Failure to object to any question or answer shall be considered a waiver of objection, unless the parties agree otherwise. Rulings on any objections shall be made by the hearing officer at hearing, or at such other time requested by motion. The examination shall proceed, with the testimony being taken subject to the objections; the deponent may be instructed not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation directed by the hearing officer, or to present a motion for a protective order under § 26.18(c)(2).
(d)
Submission to deponent.
A transcript of the deposition shall be submitted to the deponent for examination and signature, unless submission is waived by the deponent and the parties. Any changes in form or substance that the deponent desires to make shall be entered upon the transcript by the person before whom the deposition was taken, with a statement of reasons given by the deponent for making them. The transcript shall then be signed by the deponent, unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing or the deponent is ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign. If the transcript is not signed, the person before whom the deposition was taken shall sign it and state on the record the reason that it is not signed.
(e)
Certification and filing.
The person before whom the deposition was taken shall make a certification on the transcript as to its accuracy. Interested parties shall make their own arrangements with the person recording the testimony for copies of the testimony and the exhibits.
(f)
Deposition as evidence.
Subject to appropriate rulings by the hearing officer on objections, the deposition or any part may be introduced into evidence for any purpose if the deponent is unavailable. Only that part of a deposition that is received in evidence at a hearing shall constitute a part of the record in the proceeding upon which a decision may be based. Nothing in this rule is intended to limit the use of a deposition for impeachment purposes.
(g)
Payment of fees.
Fees shall be paid by the person upon whose application the deposition is taken.
§ 26.21
Written interrogatories.
(a)
Service of interrogatories.
Any party may serve upon any other party written interrogatories, not to exceed 25 in number, including all discrete subparts, unless additional interrogatories are agreed to by the parties or leave to serve additional interrogatories is granted by the hearing officer.
(b)
Response to interrogatories.
Within 20 days after service of the request, the party upon whom the interrogatories are served shall serve a written response, unless the parties agree in a written document submitted to the hearing officer or the hearing officer determines that a shorter or longer period is appropriate under the circumstances. The response shall specifically answer each interrogatory, separately and fully in writing, unless it is objected to, in which event the objecting party shall state the reasons for any objections with specificity. Any ground not stated in a timely objection is waived unless the party's failure to object is excused by the hearing officer for good cause shown. If objection is made to only part of an interrogatory, the objectionable part shall be specified and the party shall answer to the extent that the interrogatory is not objectionable.
(c)
Option to produce business records.
Where the answer to an interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from the business records, including electronically stored information, of the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served or from an examination, audit, or inspection of such business records, including a compilation, abstract, or summary thereof, and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as for the party served, it is a sufficient answer to such interrogatory to specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to afford to the party serving the interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, audit, or inspect such records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts, or summaries. A specification shall be in sufficient detail to permit the interrogating party to locate and to identify, as readily as can by the party served, the records from which the answer may be ascertained.
§ 26.22
Requests for admissions.
(a) Any party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission of the genuineness of any relevant documents described in the request or of the truth of any relevant matters of fact. Copies of documents shall be delivered with the request unless copies have already been furnished. Each requested admission shall be considered admitted, unless within 30 days after service of the request, or within such other time as the parties may agree, or the hearing officer determines, the party from whom the admission is sought serves upon the party making the request either:
(1) A statement that:
(i) Denies specifically the relevant matters for which an admission is requested, or sets forth in detail the reasons why the party can neither truthfully admit nor deny them;
(ii) Fairly meets the substance of the requested admission and, when good faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, specifies as much of it as is true and qualifies or denies the remainder; and
(iii) Does not assert lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny, unless the party states that the party has made reasonable inquiry, and that the information known or readily obtainable by the party is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny; or
(2) Written objections to a requested admission that:
(i) State the grounds for the objection; and
(ii) Object to a requested admission, if necessary, either in whole or in part, on the basis of privilege or relevance.
(b) Responses to the request for admission on matters to which objections have been made may be deferred until the objection is ruled upon, but if written objections are made only to a part of a request, a response to the remainder of the request shall be provided.
(c) Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the hearing officer, on motion, permits
withdrawal or amendment of the admission. Admissions obtained pursuant to this procedure may be used in evidence only for the purposes of the pending action. The use of obtained admissions as evidence is permitted to the same extent and subject to the same objections as other evidence.

# Hearings
§ 26.23
Public nature and timing of hearings; transcripts.
(a)

All hearings in adjudicative proceedings shall be public.
(b)
Conduct of hearing.
Hearings shall proceed with all reasonable speed. The hearing officer may order recesses for good cause, stated on the record.

(c)
Transcripts.
Hearings shall be recorded and transcribed only by a reporter designated by the Department under the supervision of the hearing officer.

(a)
Evidence.
Every party shall have the right to present its case or defense by oral and documentary evidence, unless otherwise limited by law or regulation, to conduct such cross-examination and to submit rebuttal evidence as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. Irrelevant, immaterial, privileged, or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded. Unless otherwise provided for in this part, the Federal Rules of Evidence shall provide guidance to the hearing officer in the conduct of proceedings under this part, but shall not be binding. Parties may object to clearly irrelevant material, but technical and hearsay objections to testimony as used in a court of law will not be sustained.
(b)
Testimony under oath or affirmation.
All witnesses shall testify under oath or affirmation.
(c)
Objections.
Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objections. Rulings on objections shall be a part of the transcript. Failure to object to admission or exclusion of evidence or to any evidentiary ruling shall be considered a waiver of objection, but no exception to a ruling on an objection is necessary in order to preserve it for appeal.
(d)
Authenticity of documents.
Unless specifically challenged, it shall be presumed that all relevant documents are authentic. An objection to the authenticity of a document shall not be sustained merely on the basis that it is not the original.
(e)
Stipulations.
The parties may stipulate as to any relevant matters of fact. Stipulations may be received in evidence at a hearing, and when received shall be binding on the parties with respect to the matters stipulated. The parties are encouraged to enter into stipulations of fact whenever possible.
(f)
Official notice.
All matters officially noticed by the hearing officer shall appear on the record.
(g)
Burden of proof.
The burden of proof shall be upon the proponent of an action or affirmative defense, including, where applicable, mitigating factors, unless otherwise provided by law or regulation.
§ 26.25
Hearing officer's determination and order.
(a)
Scope of review.
The hearing officer shall conduct a de novo review of the administrative action to determine whether it is supported by a preponderance of the evidence, unless a different standard of proof is required by law or regulation. Each and every charge alleged by the Department need not be proven to support the administrative action. The hearing officer may modify or vacate the administrative action under review only upon a particularized finding of facts that justifies a deviation from the administrative action.
(b)
Closing of hearing.
At the discretion of the hearing officer, the closing of the record may be postponed in order to permit the admission of other evidence into the record. In the event further evidence is admitted, each
party shall be given an opportunity to respond to such evidence.
(c)
Briefs.
Upon conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer may request the parties to file proposed findings of fact and legal briefs. The hearing officer shall make a written determination and order based upon evidence and arguments presented by the parties. The determination shall be founded upon reliable and probative evidence. This determination and order shall be served upon all parties.
(d)
Bench decisions.
Where the parties agree and where appropriate in the judgment of the hearing officer, a bench decision will be issued.
(e)
Time period for issuance of decision.
The hearing officer shall endeavor to issue a determination within 60 days from the date of the closing of the record.
(f)
Finality of determination.
The determination and order shall be final unless a party timely appeals the determination in accordance with § 26.26. The determination shall inform the parties that, if provided for and consistent with Departmental regulations, any party may request, in writing, Secretarial review of the determination within 30 days after the hearing officer issues the determination, in accordance with § 26.26 of this part. The determination shall include the mailing address, facsimile number, and electronic submission information to which the request for Secretarial review should be sent. A request for Secretarial review may be made by mail, delivery, facsimile, or electronic submission.

(j)
Evidence in the record.
The Secretary or designee shall consider only evidence contained in the record forwarded by the hearing officer. However, if any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary or designee that additional evidence not presented at the hearing is material, and
that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present such evidence at the hearing, the Secretary or designee shall remand the matter to the hearing officer for reconsideration in light of the additional evidence.
(k)
Ex parte communications.
The prohibitions of ex parte communications in § 26.3 shall apply to contacts with the Secretary or the Secretary's designee.
(l)
Determination.
The Secretary or designee may affirm, modify, reverse, remand, reduce, compromise, or settle any determination made or action ordered in the initial determination or order. The Secretary or designee shall consider, and include in any final determination, such factors as may be set forth in applicable statutes or regulations.
(m)
Written determination.
Where a request for Secretarial review has been timely made, the Secretary, or designee, shall issue a written determination within 30 days after receipt of the request for review, and shall serve it upon the parties to the hearing and the hearing officer. The Secretary, or designee, may extend the time in which a written determination must be issued by an additional 60 days for good cause shown in a written justification issued to the parties. The written determination of the Secretary shall be final. If the Secretary, or designee, does not act upon the request for review of a determination within 90 days of service of the request, then the initial determination shall be the final agency action.
§ 26.27
Interlocutory rulings.
(a)
Interlocutory rulings by the hearing officer.
A party seeking review of an interlocutory ruling shall file a motion with the hearing officer within 10 days of the ruling requesting certification of the ruling for review by the Secretary, or in cases arising under 2 CFR part 2424, with the Debarring Official. Certification may be granted if the hearing officer believes that:
(1) It involves an important issue of law or policy as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and
(2) An immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.
(b)
Petition for review.
Any party may file a petition for review of an interlocutory ruling within 10 days of the hearing officer's determination regarding certification.
(c)
Secretarial review.
The Secretary, or designee, or Debarring Official shall review a certified ruling. The Secretary, designee, or Debarring Official has the discretion to grant or deny a petition for review from an uncertified ruling.
