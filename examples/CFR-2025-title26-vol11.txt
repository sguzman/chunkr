# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANIES AND REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS
§ 1.851-1
Definition of regulated investment company.
(a)
In general.
The term “regulated investment company” is defined to mean any domestic corporation (other than a personal holding company as defined in section 542) which meets (1) the requirements of section 851(a) and paragraph (b) of this section, and (2) the limitations of section 851(b) and § 1.851-2. As to the definition of the term “corporation”, see section 7701(a)(3).
(b)
Requirement.
To qualify as a regulated investment company, a corporation must be:
(1) Registered at all times during the taxable year, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 to 80b-2), either as a management company or a unit investment trust, or
(2) A common trust fund or similar fund excluded by section 3(c)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)) from the definition of “investment company” and not included in the definition of “common trust fund” by section 584(a).
§ 1.851-2
Limitations.
(a)
Election to be a regulated investment company.
Under the provisions of section 851(b)(1), a corporation, even though it satisfies the other requirements of part I, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code, for the taxable year, will not be considered a regulated investment company for such year, within the meaning of such part I, unless it elects to be a regulated investment company for such taxable year, or has made such an election for a previous taxable year which began after December 31, 1941. The election shall be made by the taxpayer by computing taxable income as a regulated investment company in its return for the first taxable year for which the election is applicable. No other method of making such election is permitted. An election once made is irrevocable for such taxable year and all succeeding taxable years.
(b)
Gross income requirement
—(1)
General rule.
A corporation will not be a regulated investment company for a taxable year unless 90 percent of its gross income for that year is income described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. Any loss from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities is not taken into account in the gross income computation.
(i)
Gross income amounts.
Income is described in this paragraph (b)(1)(i) if it is gross income derived from:
(A) Dividends;
(B) Interest;
(C) Payments with respect to securities loans (as defined in section 512(a)(5));
(D) Gains from the sale or other disposition of stocks or securities (as defined in section 2(a)(36) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended);
(E) Gains from the sale or other disposition of foreign currencies; or
(F) Other income (including but not limited to gains from options, futures, or forward contracts) derived with respect to the corporation's business of investing in such stock, securities, or currencies.
(ii)
Income from a publicly traded partnership.
Income is described in this paragraph (b)(1)(ii) if it is net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership (as defined in section 851(h)).
(2)
Special rules.
(i) For purposes of section 851(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section, amounts included in gross income for the taxable year under section 951(a)(1)(A) or 1293(a) are treated as dividends only to the extent that, under section 959(a)(1) or 1293(c) (as the case may be), there is a distribution out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year that are attributable to the amounts included in gross income for the taxable year under section 951(a)(1)(A) or 1293(a). For allocation of distributions to earnings and profits of foreign corporations, see § 1.959-3.
(ii) For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, if by reason of section 959(a)(1) a distribution of a foreign corporation's earnings and profits for a taxable year described in section 959(c)(2) is not included in a shareholder's gross income, then such distribution shall be allocated proportionately between amounts attributable to amounts included under each clause of section 951(a)(1)(A). Thus, for example, M is a United States shareholder in X Corporation, a controlled foreign corporation. M and X each use the calendar year as the taxable year. For 1977, M is required by section 951(a)(1)(a) to include $3,000 in its gross income, $1,000 of which is included under clause (i) thereof. In 1977, M received a distribution described in section 959(c)(2) of $2,700 out of X's earnings and profits for 1977, which is, by reason of section 959(a)(1), excluded from M's gross income. The amount of the distribution attributable to the amount included under section 951(a)(1)(A)(i) is $900, i.e., $2,700 multiplied by ($1,000/$3,000).
(iii) If an amount is included in gross income of the corporation referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section under section 951(a)(1) or 1293(a) and is derived with respect to that corporation's business of investing in stock, securities, or currencies, then the amount is other income described in section 851(b)(2)(A) and paragraph (b)(1)(i)(F) of this section. Notwithstanding paragraph (d) of this section, a taxpayer may rely on the rule in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) for taxable years that begin after September 28, 2016.
(c)
Diversification of investments.
(1) Subparagraph (A) of section 851(b)(4) requires that at the close of each quarter of the taxable year at least 50 percent of the value of the total assets of the taxpayer corporation be represented by one or more of the following:
(i) Cash and cash items, including receivables;
(ii) Government securities;
(iii) Securities of other regulated investment companies; or
(iv) Securities (other than those described in subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph) of any one or more issuers which meet the following limitations: (
a
) The entire amount of the securities of the issuer owned by the taxpayer corporation is not greater in value than 5 percent of the value of the total assets of the taxpayer corporation, and (
b
) the entire amount of the securities of such issuer owned by the taxpayer corporation does not represent more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer. For the modification of the percentage limitations applicable in the case of certain venture capital investment companies, see section 851(e) and § 1.851-6.
Assuming that at least 50 percent of the value of the total assets of the corporation satisfies the requirements specified in this subparagraph, and that the limiting provisions of subparagraph (B) of section 851(b)(4) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph are not violated, the corporation will satisfy the requirements of section 851(b)(4), notwithstanding that the remaining assets do not satisfy the diversification requirements of subparagraph (A) of section 851(b)(4). For example, a corporation may own all the stock of another corporation, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 851(b)(4).
(2) Subparagraph (B) of section 851(b)(4) prohibits the investment at the close of each quarter of the taxable year of more than 25 percent of the
value of the total assets of the corporation (including the 50 percent or more mentioned in subparagraph (A) of section 851(b)(4)) in the securities (other than Government securities or the securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or of two or more issuers which the taxpayer company controls and which are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses, including such issuers as are merely a part of a unit contributing to the completion and sale of a product or the rendering of a particular service. Two or more issuers are not considered as being in the same or similar trades or businesses merely because they are engaged in the broad field of manufacturing or of any other general classification of industry, but issuers shall be construed to be engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses if they are engaged in a distinct branch of business, trade, or manufacture in which they render the same kind of service or produce or deal in the same kind of product, and such service or products fulfill the same economic need. If two or more issuers produce more than one product or render more than one type of service, then the chief product or service of each shall be the basis for determining whether they are in the same trade or business.
(d)
Applicability date.
The rules in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2)(i) and (iii) of this section apply to taxable years that begin after June 17, 2019.

§ 1.851-4
Determination of status.
With respect to the effect which certain discrepancies between the value of its various investments and the requirements of section 851(b)(4) and paragraph (c) of § 1.851-2, or the effect that the elimination of such discrepancies will have on the status of a company as a regulated investment company for purposes of part I, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code, see section 851(d). A company claiming to be a regulated investment company shall keep sufficient records as to investments so as to be able to show that it has complied with the provisions of section 851 during the taxable year. Such records shall be kept at all times available for inspection by any internal revenue officer or employee and shall be retained so long as the contents thereof may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law.

# Example 4.
(i) Investment Company Y at the close of a particular quarter of its taxable year has its assets invested as follows:
Percent
Cash and Government securities
15
Securities of Corporation K (a regulated investment company)
30
Securities of Corporation A
10
Securities of Corporation B
20
Securities of various corporations (not exceeding 5 percent of its assets in any one company)

Corporation K owns more than 20 percent of the voting power of Corporation L.
(iii) At the end of that quarter, Investment Company Y is disqualified under subparagraph (B)(i) of section 851(b)(3) because, after applying section 851(c)(1), more than 25 percent of the value of Investment Company Y's total assets is invested in the securities of Corporation B. This result is shown by the following calculation:
Percent
Percentage of assets invested directly in Corporation B

# Example 5.
Investment Company Z, which keeps its books and makes its returns on the basis of the calendar year, at the close of the first quarter of 2016 meets the requirements of section 851(b)(3) and has 20 percent of its
assets invested in Corporation A. Later during the taxable year it makes distributions to its shareholders and because of such distributions, it finds at the close of the taxable year that it has more than 25 percent of its remaining assets invested in Corporation A. Investment Company Z does not lose its status as a regulated investment company for the taxable year 2016 because of such distributions, nor will it lose its status as a regulated investment company for any subsequent year solely as a result of such distributions.
See
section 851(d)(1).

# Example 6.
Investment Company Q, which keeps its books and makes its returns on the basis of the calendar year, at the close of the first quarter of 2016 meets the requirements of section 851(b)(3) and has 20 percent of its assets invested in Corporation P. At the close of the taxable year 2016, it finds that it has more than 25 percent of its assets invested in Corporation P. This situation results entirely from fluctuations in the market values of the securities in Investment Company Q's portfolio and is not due in whole or in part to the acquisition of any security or other property. Investment Company Q does not lose its status as a regulated investment company for the taxable year 2016 because of such fluctuations in the market values of the securities in its portfolio, nor will it lose its status as a regulated investment company for any subsequent year solely as a result of such market value fluctuations.

§ 1.851-6
Investment companies furnishing capital to development corporations.
(a)
Qualifying requirements.
(1) In the case of a regulated investment company which furnishes capital to development corporations, section 851 (e) provides an exception to the rule relating to the diversification of investments, made applicable to regulated investment companies by section 851(b)(4)(A). This exception (as provided in paragraph (b) of this section) is available only to registered management investment companies which the Securities and Exchange Commission determines, in accordance with regulations issued by it, and certifies to the Secretary or his delegate, not earlier than 60 days before the close of the taxable year of such investment company, to be principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available.
(2) For the purpose of the aforementioned determination and certification, unless the Securities and Exchange Commission determines otherwise, a corporation shall be considered to be principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available, for at least 10 years after the
date of the first acquisition of any security in such corporation or any predecessor thereof by such investment company if at the date of such acquisition the corporation or its predecessor was principally so engaged, and an investment company shall be considered at any date to be furnishing capital to any company whose securities it holds if within 10 years before such date it had acquired any of such securities, or any securities surrendered in exchange therefor, from such other company or its predecessor.
(b)
Exception to general rule.
(1) The registered management investment company, which for the taxable year meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, may (subject to the limitations of section 851(e)(2) and paragraph (c) of this section) in the computation of 50 percent of the value of its assets under section 851(b)(4)(A) and paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.851-2 for any quarter of such taxable year, include the value of any securities of an issuer (whether or not the investment company owns more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer) if at the time of the latest acquisition of any securities of such issuer the basis of all such securities in the hands of the investment company does not exceed 5 percent of the value of the total assets of the investment company at that time. The exception provided by section 851(e)(1) and this subparagraph is not applicable to the securities of an issuer if the investment company has continuously held any security of such issuer or of any predecessor company (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) for 10 or more years preceding such quarter of the taxable year. The rule of section 851(e)(1) with respect to the relationship of the basis of the securities of an issuer to the value of the total assets of the investment company is, in substance, a qualification of the 5-percent limitation in section 851(b)(4)(A)(ii) and paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of § 1.851-2. All other provisions and requirements of section 851 and §§ 1.851-1 through 1.851-6 are applicable in determining whether such registered management investment company qualifies as a regulated investment company.
(2) The application of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) The XYZ Corporation, a regulated investment company, qualified under section 851(e) as an investment company furnishing capital to development corporations. On June 30, 1954, the XYZ Corporation purchased 1,000 shares of the stock of the A Corporation at a cost of $30,000. On June 30, 1954, the value of the total assets of the XYZ Corporation was $1,000,000. Its investment in the stock of the A Corporation ($30,000) comprised 3 percent of the value of its total assets, and it therefore met the requirements prescribed by section 851(b)(4)(A)(ii) as modified by section 851(e)(1).
(ii) On June 30, 1955, the value of the total assets of the XYZ Corporation was $1,500,000 and the 1,000 shares of stock of the A Corporation which the XYZ Corporation owned appreciated in value so that they were then worth $60,000. On that date, the XYZ Investment Company increased its investment in the stock of the A Corporation by the purchase of an additional 500 shares of that stock at a total cost of $30,000. The securities of the A Corporation owned by the XYZ Corporation had a value of $90,000 (6 percent of the value of the total assets of the XYZ Corporation) which exceeded the limit provided by section 851(b)(4)(A)(ii). However, the investment of the XYZ Corporation in the A Corporation on June 30, 1955, qualified under section 851(b)(4)(A) as modified by section 851(e)(1), since the basis of those securities to the investment company did not exceed 5 percent of the value of its total assets as of June 30, 1955, illustrated as follows:
Basis to the XYZ Corporation of the A Corporation's stock acquired on June 30, 1954
$30,000
Basis of the 500 shares of the A Corporation's stock acquired by the XYZ Corporation on June 30, 1955
30,000
Basis of all stock of A Corporation
60,000
Basis of stock of A Corporation ($60,000)/Value of XYZ Corporation's total assets at June 30, 1955, time of the latest acquisition ($1,500,000) = 4 percent

# Example 2.
The same facts existed as in example 1, except that on June 30, 1955, the XYZ Corporation increased its investment in the stock of the A Corporation by the purchase of an additional 1,000 shares of that stock (instead of 500 shares) at a total cost of $60,000. No part of the investment of the XYZ Corporation in the A Corporation qualified under the 5 percent limitation provided by section 851(b)(4)(A) as modified by section 851(e)(1), illustrated as follows:
Basis to the XYZ Corporation of the 1,000 shares of the A Corporation's stock acquired on June 30, 1954
$30,000
Basis of the 1,000 shares of the A Corporation's stock acquired on June 30, 1955
60,000
Total
90,000
Basis of stock of A Corporation ($90,000)/Value of XYZ Corporation's total assets at June 30, 1955, time of the latest acquisition ($1,500,000)= 6 percent

# Example 3.
The same facts existed as in example 2 and on June 30, 1956, the XYZ Corporation increased its investment in the stock of the A Corporation by the purchase of an additional 100 shares of that stock at a total cost of $6,000. On June 30, 1956, the value of the total assets of the XYZ Corporation was $2,000,000 and on that date the investment in the A Corporation qualified under section 851(b)(4)(A) as modified by section 851(e)(1) illustrated as follows:
Basis to the XYZ Corporation of investments in the A Corporation's stock:
1,000 shares acquired June 30, 1954
$30,000
1,000 shares acquired June 30, 1955
60,000
100 shares acquired June 30, 1956
6,000
Total
96,000
Basis of stock of A Corporation ($96,000)/Value of XYZ Corporation's total assets at June 30, 1956, time of the latest acquisition ($2,000,000) = 4.8 percent
(c)
Limitation.
Section 851(e) and this section do not apply in the quarterly computation of 50 percent of the value of the assets of an investment company under subparagraph (A) of section 851(b)(4) and paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.851-2 for any taxable year if at the close of any quarter of such taxable year more than 25 percent of the value of its total assets (including the 50 percent or more mentioned in such subparagraph (A)) is represented by securities (other than Government securities or the securities of other regulated investment companies) of issuers as to each of which such investment company (1) holds more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (2) has continuously held any security of such issuer (or any security of a predecessor of such issuer) for 10 or more years preceding such quarter, unless the value of its total assets so represented is reduced to 25 percent or less within 30 days after the close of such quarter.
(d)
Definition of predecessor company.
As used in section 851(e) and this section, the term “predecessor company” means any corporation the basis of whose securities in the hands of the investment company was, under the provisions of section 358 or corresponding provisions of prior law, the same in whole or in part as the basis of any of the securities of the issuer and any corporation with respect to whose securities any of the securities of the issuer were received directly or indirectly by the investment company in a transaction or series of transactions involving nonrecognition of gain or loss in whole or in part. The other terms used in this section have the same meaning as when used in section 851(b)(4). See paragraph (c) of § 1.851-2 and § 1.851-3.
§ 1.851-7
Certain unit investment trusts.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, a unit investment trust (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) shall not be treated as a person (as defined in section 7701(a)(1)) except for years ending before January 1, 1969. A holder of an interest in such a trust will be treated as directly owning the assets of such trust for taxable years of such holder which end with or within any year of the trust to which section 851(f) and this section apply.
(b)
Treatment of unit investment trust.
A unit investment trust shall not be treated as an individual, a trust estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, a unit investment trust is not a taxpayer subject to taxation under the Internal Revenue Code. No gain or loss will be recognized by the unit investment trust if such trust distributes a holder's proportionate share of the trust assets in exchange for his interest in the trust. Also, no gain or loss will be recognized by the unit investment trust if such trust sells the holder's proportionate share of the trust assets and distributes the proceeds from such share to the holder in exchange for his interest in the trust.
(c)
Treatment of holder of interest in unit investment trust.
(1) Each holder of an interest in a unit investment trust shall be treated (to the extent of such interest) as owning a proportionate share of the assets of the trust. Accordingly, if the trust distributes to the holder of an interest in such trust his proportionate share of the trust assets
in exchange for his interest in the trust, no gain or loss shall be recognized by such holder (or by any other holder of an interest in such trust). For purposes of this paragraph, each purchase of an interest in the trust by the holder will be considered a separate interest in the trust. Items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit received by the trust or a custodian thereof shall be taxed to the holders of interests in the trust (and not to the trust) as though they had received their proportionate share of the items directly on the date such items were received by the trust or custodian.
(2) The basis of the assets of such trust which are treated under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph as being owned by the holder of an interest in such trust shall be the same as the basis of his interest in such trust. Accordingly, the amount of the gain or loss recognized by the holder upon the sale by the unit investment trust of the holder's pro rata share of the trust assets shall be determined with reference the basis, of his interest in the trust. Also, the basis of the assets received by the holder, if the trust distributes a holder's pro rata share of the trust assets in exchange for his interest in the trust, will be the same as the basis of his interest in the trust. If the unit investment trust sells less than all of the holder's pro rata share of the trust assets and the holder retains an interest in the trust, the amount of the gain or loss recognized by the holder upon the sale shall be determined with reference to the basis of his interest in the assets sold by the trust, and the basis of his interest in the trust shall be reduced accordingly. If the trust distributes a portion of the holder's pro rata share of the trust assets in exchange for a portion of his interest in the trust, the basis of the assets received by the holder shall be determined with reference to the basis of his interest in the assets distributed by the trust, and the basis of his interest in the trust shall be reduced accordingly. For purposes of this subparagraph the basis of the holder's interest in assets sold by the trust or distributed to him shall be an amount which bears the same relationship to the basis of his total interest in the trust that the fair market value of the assets so sold or distributed bears to the fair market value of such total interest in the trust, such fair market value to be determined on the date of such sale or distribution.
(3) The period for which the holder of an interest in such trust has held the assets of the trust which are treated under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph as being owned by him is the same as the period for which such holder has held his interest in such trust. Accordingly, the character of the gain, loss, deduction, or credit recognized by the holder upon the sale by the unit investment trust of the holder's proportionate share of the trust assets shall be determined with reference to the period for which he has held his interest in the trust. Also, the holding period of the assets received by the holder if the trust distributes the holder's proportionate share of the trust assets in exchange for his interest in the trust will include the period for which the holder has held his interest in the trust.
(4) The application of the provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
B entered a periodic payment plan of a unit investment trust (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) with X Bank as custodian and Z as plan sponsor. Under this plan, upon B's demand, X must either redeem B's interest at a price substantially equal to the fair market value of the number of shares in Y, a management company, which are credited to B's account by X in connection with the unit investment trust, or at B's option distribute such shares of Y to B. B's plan provides for quarterly payments of $1,000. On October 1, 1969, B made his initial quarterly payment of $1,000 and X credited B's account with 110 shares of Y. On December 1, 1969, Y declared and paid a dividend of 25 cents per share, 5 cents of which was designated as a capital gain dividend pursuant to section 852(b)(3) and § 1.852-4. X credited B's account with $27.50 but did not distribute the money to B in 1969. On December 31, 1969, X charged B's account with $1 for custodial fees for calendar year 1969. On January 1, 1970, B paid X $1,000 and X credited B's account with 105 shares of Y. On April 1, 1970, B paid X $1,000 and X credited B's account with 100 shares of Y. B must include in his tax return for 1969 a dividend of $22 and a long-term capital gain of $5.50. In addition, B is entitled to deduct the annual custodial fee of $1 under section 212 of the Code.
(a) On April 4, 1970, at B's request, X sells the shares of Y credited to B's account (315 shares) for $10 per share and distributes the proceeds ($3,150) to B together with the remaining balance of $26.50 in B's account. The receipt of the $26.50 does not result in any tax consequences to B. B recognizes a long-term capital gain of $100 and a short- term capital gain of $50, computed as follows:
(1) B is treated as owning 110 shares of Y as of October 1, 1969. The basis of these shares is $1,000, and they were sold for $1,100 (110 shares at $10 per share). Therefore, B recognizes a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 6 months in the amount of $100.
(2) B is treated as owning 105 shares of Y as of January 1, 1970, and 100 shares as of April 1, 1970. With respect to the shares acquired on April 1, 1970, there is no gain recognized as the shares were sold for $1,000, which is B's basis of the shares. The shares acquired on January 1, 1970, were sold for $1,050 (105 shares at $10 per share), and B's basis of these shares is $1,000. Therefore, B recognizes a gain of $50 from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for not more than 6 months.
(b) On April 4, 1970, at B's request, X distributes to B the shares of Y credited to his account and $26.50 in cash. The receipt of the $26.50 does not result in any tax consequences to B. B does not recognize gain or loss on the distribution of the shares of Y to him. The bases and holding periods of B's interests in Y are as follows:
Number of shares
Date acquired
Basis
110
10-1-69
$9.09

(i) The trust issues a separate series of periodic payment plan certificates (as defined in such Act) with respect to the securities of each separate single management company which it possesses; and
(ii) None of the periodic payment plan certificates issued by the trust permits joint acquisition of an interest in each series nor the application of payments in whole or in part first to a series issued by one of the single management companies and then to any other series issued by any other single management company.
(2) If a unit investment trust possesses securities of two or more separate single management companies as described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and issues a separate series of periodic payment plan certificates with respect to the securities of each such management company, then the holder of an interest in a series shall be treated as the owner of the securities in the single management company represented by such interest.
(i) A holder of an interest in a series of periodic payment plan certificates of a trust who transfers or sells his interest in the series in exchange for an interest in another series of periodic payment plan certificates of the trust shall recognize the gain or loss realized from the transfer or sale as if the trust had sold the shares credited to his interests in the series at fair market value and distributed the proceeds of the sale to him.
(ii) The basis of the interests in the series so acquired by the holder shall be the fair market value of his interests in the series transferred or sold.
(iii) The period for which the holder has held his interest in the series so acquired shall be measured from the date of his acquisition of his interest in that series.

§ 1.852-1
Taxation of regulated investment companies.
(a)
Requirements applicable thereto
—(1)
In general.
Section 852(a) denies the application of the provisions of part I, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code (other than section 852(c), relating to earnings and profits), to a regulated investment company for a taxable year beginning after February 28, 1958, unless—
(i) The deduction for dividends paid for such taxable year as defined in section 561 (computed without regard to capital gain dividends) is equal to at least 90 percent of its investment company taxable income for such taxable year (determined without regard to the provisions of section 852(b)(2)(D) and paragraph (d) of § 1.852-3); and
(ii) The company complies for such taxable year with the provisions of § 1.852-6 (relating to records required to be maintained by a regulated investment company).
See section 853(b)(1)(B) and paragraph (a) of § 1.853-2 for amounts to be added to the dividends paid deduction, and section 855 and § 1.855-1, relating to dividends paid after the close of the taxable year.
(2)
Special rule for taxable years of regulated investment companies beginning before March 1, 1958.
The provisions of part I of subchapter M (including section 852(c)) are not applicable to a regulated investment company for a taxable year beginning before March 1, 1958, unless such company meets the requirements of section 852(a) and subparagraph (1) (i) and (ii) of this paragraph.
(b)
Failure to qualify.
If a regulated investment company does not meet the requirements of section 852(a) and paragraph (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section for the taxable year, it will, even though it may otherwise be classified as a regulated investment company, be taxed in such year as an ordinary corporation and not as a regulated investment company. In such case, none of the provisions of part I of subchapter M (other than section 852(c) in the case of taxable years beginning after February 28, 1958) will be applicable to it. For the rules relating to the applicability of section 852(c), see § 1.852-5.
[T.D. 6598, 27 FR 4091, Apr. 28, 1962]
§ 1.852-2
Method of taxation of regulated investment companies.
(a)
Imposition of normal tax and surtax.
Section 852(b)(1) imposes a normal tax and surtax, computed at the rates and in the manner prescribed in section 11, on the investment company taxable income, as defined in section 852(b)(2) and § 1.852-3, for each taxable year of a regulated investment company. The tax is imposed as if the investment company taxable income were the taxable income referred to in section 11. In computing the normal tax under section 11, the regulated investment company's taxable income and the dividends paid deduction (computed without regard to the capital gains dividends) shall both be reduced by the deduction for partially tax-exempt interest provided by section 242.
(b)
Taxation of capital gains
—(1)
In general.
Section 852(b)(3)(A) imposes (i) in the case of a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, a tax of 25 percent, or (ii) in the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, a tax determined as provided in section 1201(a) and paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.1201-1, on the excess, if any, of the net long-term capital gain of a regulated investment company (subject to tax under part I, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code) over the sum of its net short-term capital loss and its deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) determined with reference to capital gain dividends only. For the definition of capital gain dividend paid by a regulated investment company, see section 852(b)(3)(C) and paragraph (c) of
§ 1.852-4. In the case of a taxable year ending after December 31, 1969, and beginning before January 1, 1975, such deduction for dividends paid shall first be made from the amount subject to tax in accordance with section 1201(a)(1)(B), to the extent thereof, and then from the amount subject to tax in accordance with section 1201(a)(1)(A). See § 1.852-10, relating to certain distributions in redemption of interests in unit investment trusts which, for purposes of the deduction for dividends paid with reference to capital gain dividends only, are not considered preferential dividends under section 562(c). See section 855 and § 1.855-1, relating to dividends paid after the close of the taxable year.
(2)
Undistributed capital gains
—(i)
In general.
A regulated investment company (subject to tax under part I of subchapter M) may, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1956, designate under section 852(b)(3)(D) an amount of undistributed capital gains to each shareholder of the company. For the definition of the term “undistributed capital gains” and for the treatment of such amounts by a shareholder, see paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.852-4. For the rules relating to the method of making such designation, the returns to be filed, and the payment of the tax in such cases, see paragraph (a) of § 1.852-9.
(ii)
Effect on earnings and profits of a regulated investment company.
If a regulated investment company designates an amount as undistributed capital gains for a taxable year, the earnings and profits of such regulated investment company for such taxable year shall be reduced by the total amount of the undistributed capital gains so designated. In such case, its capital account shall be increased—
(
a
) In the case of a taxable year ending before January 1, 1970, by 75 percent of the total amount designated,
(
b
) In the case of a taxable year ending after December 31, 1969, and beginning before January 1, 1975, by the total amount designated decreased by the amount of tax imposed by section 852(b)(3)(A) with respect to such amount, or
(
c
) In the case of a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1974, by 70 percent of the total amount designated. The earnings and profits of a regulated investment company shall not be reduced by the amount of tax which is imposed by section 852(b)(3)(A) on an amount designated as undistributed capital gains and which is paid by the corporation but deemed paid by the shareholder.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6598, 27 FR 4091, Apr. 28, 1962; T.D. 6921, 32 FR 8754, June 20, 1967; T.D. 7337, 39 FR 44972, Dec. 30, 1974]
§ 1.852-3
Investment company taxable income.
Section 852(b)(2) requires certain adjustments to be made to convert taxable income of the investment company to investment company taxable income, as follows:
(a) The excess, if any, of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss shall be excluded;
(b) The net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 shall not be allowed;
(c) The special deductions provided in part VIII (section 241 and following, except section 248), subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code, shall not be allowed. Those not allowed are the deduction for partially tax-exempt interest provided by section 242, the deductions for dividends received provided by sections 243, 244, and 245, and the deduction for certain dividends paid provided by section 247. However, the deduction provided by section 248 (relating to organizational expenditures), otherwise allowable in computing taxable income, shall likewise be allowed in computing the investment company taxable income. See section 852(b)(1) and paragraph (a) of § 1.852-2 for treatment of the deduction for partially tax-exempt interest (provided by section 242) for purposes of computing the normal tax under section 11;
(d) The deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) shall be allowed, but shall be computed without regard to capital gains dividends (as defined in section 852(b)(3)(C) and paragraph (c) of § 1.852-4); and
(e) The taxable income shall be computed without regard to section 443(b). Thus, the taxable income for a period of less than 12 months shall not be
placed on an annual basis even though such short taxable year results from a change of accounting period.
§ 1.852-4
Method of taxation of shareholders of regulated investment companies.
(a)
Ordinary income.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section (relating to capital gains), a shareholder receiving dividends from a regulated investment company shall include such dividends in gross income for the taxable year in which they are received.
(2) See section 853 (b)(2) and (c) and paragraph (b) of § 1.853-2 and § 1.853-3 for the treatment by shareholders of dividends received from a regulated investment company which has made an election under section 853(a) with respect to the foreign tax credit. See section 854 and §§ 1.854-1 through 1.854-3 for limitations applicable to dividends received from regulated investment companies for the purpose of the credit under section 34 (for dividends received on or before December 31, 1964), the exclusion from gross income under section 116, and the deduction under section 243. See section 855 (b) and (d) and paragraphs (c) and (f) of § 1.855-1 for treatment by shareholders of dividends paid by a regulated investment company after the close of the taxable year in the case of an election under section 855(a).
(b)
Capital gains
—(1)
In general.
Under section 852(b)(3)(B), shareholders of a regulated investment company who receive capital gain dividends (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section), in respect of the capital gains of an investment company for a taxable year for which it is taxable under part I, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code, as a regulated investment company, shall treat such capital gain dividends as gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) and realized in the taxable year of the shareholder in which the dividend was received. In the case of dividends with respect to any taxable year of a regulated investment company ending after December 31, 1969, and beginning before January 1, 1975, the portion of a shareholder's capital gain dividend to which section 1201(d) (1) or (2) applies is the portion so designated by the regulated investment company pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2)
Undistributed capital gains.
(i) A person who is a shareholder of a regulated investment company at the close of a taxable year of such company for which it is taxable under part I of subchapter M shall include in his gross income as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) any amount of undistributed capital gains. The term “undistributed capital gains” means the amount designated as undistributed capital gains in accordance with paragraph (a) of § 1.852-9, but the amount so designated shall not exceed the shareholder's proportionate part of the amount subject to tax under section 852(b)(3)(A). Such amount shall be included in gross income for the taxable year of the shareholder in which falls the last day of the taxable year of the regulated investment company in respect of which the undistributed capital gains were designated. The amount of such gains designated under paragraph (a) of § 1.852-9 as gain described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2) shall be included in the shareholder's gross income as gain described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2). For certain administrative provisions relating to undistributed capital gains, see § 1.852-9.
(ii) Any shareholder required to include an amount of undistributed capital gains in gross income under section 852(b)(3)(D)(i) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be deemed to have paid for his taxable year for which such amount is so includible—
(
a
) In the case of an amount designated with respect to a taxable year of the company ending before January 1, 1970, a tax equal to 25 percent of such amount.
(
b
) In the case of a taxable year of the company ending after December 31, 1969, and beginning before January 1, 1975, a tax equal to the tax designated under paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.852-9 by the regulated investment company as his proportionate share of the capital
gains tax paid with respect to such amount, or
(
c
) In the case of an amount designated with respect to a taxable year of the company beginning after December 31, 1974, a tax equal to 30 percent of such amount.
Such shareholder is entitled to a credit or refund of the tax so deemed paid in accordance with the rules provided in paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.852-9.
(iii) Any shareholder required to include an amount of undistributed capital gains in gross income under section 852(b)(3)(D)(i) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall increase the adjusted basis of the shares of stock with respect to which such amount is so includible—
(
a
) In the case of an amount designated with respect to a taxable year of the company ending before January 1, 1970, by 75 percent of such amount.
(
b
) In the case of an amount designated with respect to a taxable year of the company ending after December 31, 1969, and beginning before January 1, 1975, by the amount designated under paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of § 1.852-9 by the regulated investment company, or
(
c
) In the case of an amount designated with respect to a taxable year of the company beginning after December 31, 1974, by 70 percent of such amount.
(iv) For purposes of determining whether the purchaser or seller of a share or regulated investment company stock is the shareholder at the close of such company's taxable year who is required to include an amount of undistributed capital gains in gross income, the amount of the undistributed capital gains shall be treated in the same manner as a cash dividend payable to shareholders of record at the close of the company's taxable year. Thus, if a cash dividend paid to shareholders of record as of the close of the regulated investment company's taxable year would be considered income to the purchaser, then the purchaser is also considered to be the shareholder of such company at the close of its taxable year for purposes of including an amount of undistributed capital gains in gross income. If, in such a case, notice on Form 2439 is, pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.852-9, mailed by the regulated investment company to the seller, then the seller shall be considered the nominee of the purchaser and, as such, shall be subject to the provisions in paragraph (b) of § 1.852-9. For rules for determining whether a dividend is income to the purchaser or seller of a share of stock, see paragraph (c) of § 1.61-9.
(3)
Partners and partnerships.
If the shareholder required to include an amount of undistributed capital gains in gross income under section 852(b)(3)(D) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is a partnership, such amount shall be included in the gross income of the partnership for the taxable year of the partnership in which falls the last day of the taxable year of the regulated investment company in respect of which the undistributed capital gains were designated. The amount so includible by the partnership shall be taken into account by the partners as distributive shares of the partnership gains and losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) pursuant to section 702(a)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.702-1. The tax with respect to the undistributed capital gains is deemed paid by the partnership (under section 852(b)(3)(D)(ii) and subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph), and the credit or refund of such tax shall be taken into account by the partners in accordance with section 702(a)(8) and paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of § 1.702-1 and paragraph (c)(2) of § 1.852-9. In accordance with section 705(a), the partners shall increase the basis of their partnership interests under section 705(a)(1) by the distributive shares of such gains, and shall decrease the basis of their partnership interests by the distributive shares of the amount of the tax under section 705(a)(2)(B) (relating to certain nondeductible expenditures) and paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.705-1.
(4)
Nonresident alien individuals.
If the shareholder required to include an amount of undistributed capital gains in gross income under section 852(b)(3)(D) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is a nonresident alien individual, such shareholder shall be treated, for purposes of section 871 and the
regulations thereunder, as having realized a long-term capital gain in such amount on the last day of the taxable year of the regulated investment company in respect of which the undistributed capital gains were designated.
(5)
Effect on earnings and profits of corporate shareholders of a regulated investment company.
If a shareholder required to include an amount of undistributed capital gains in gross income under section 852(b)(3)(D) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is a corporation, such corporation, in computing its earnings and profits for the taxable year for which such amount is so includible, shall treat such amount as if it had actually been received and the taxes paid shall include any amount of tax liability satisfied by a credit under section 852(b)(3)(D) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(c)
Definition of capital gain dividend
—(1)
General rule.
A capital gain dividend, as defined in section 852(b)(3)(C), is any dividend or part thereof which is designated by a regulated investment company as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders within the period specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. If the aggregate amount so designated with respect to the taxable year (including capital gain dividends paid after the close of the taxable year pursuant to an election under section 855) is greater than the excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss of the taxable year, the portion of each distribution which shall be a capital gain dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount so designated which such excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss bears to the aggregate amount so designated. For example, a regulated investment company making its return on the calendar year basis advised its shareholders by written notice mailed December 30, 1955, that of a distribution of $500,000 made December 15, 1955, $200,000 constituted a capital gain dividend, amounting to $2 per share. It was later discovered that an error had been made in determining the excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss of the taxable year, and that such excess was $100,000 instead of $200,000. In such case each shareholder would have received a capital gain dividend of $1 per share instead of $2 per share.
(2)
Shareholder of record custodian of certain unit investment trusts.
In any case where a notice is mailed pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph by a regulated investment company with respect to a taxable year of the regulated investment company ending after December 8, 1970, to a shareholder of record who is a nominee acting as a custodian of a unit investment trust described in section 851(f)(1) and paragraph (d) of § 1.851-7, the nominee shall furnish each holder of an interest in such trust with a written notice mailed on or before the 55th day following the close of the regulated investment company's taxable year. The notice shall designate the holder's proportionate share of the capital gain dividend shown on the notice received by the nominee pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. The notice shall include the name and address of the nominee identified as such. This subparagraph shall not apply if the regulated investment company agrees with the nominee to satisfy the notice requirements of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph with respect to each holder of an interest in the unit investment trust whose shares are being held by the nominee as custodian and, not later than 45 days following the close of the company's taxable year, files with the Internal Revenue Service office where the company's income tax return is to be filed for the taxable year, a statement that the holders of the unit investment trust with whom the agreement was made have been directly notified by the regulated investment company. Such statement shall include the name, sponsor, and custodian of each unit investment trust whose holders have been directly notified. The nominee's requirements under this paragraph shall be deemed met if the regulated investment company transmits a copy of such statement to the nominee within such 45-day period; provided however, if the regulated investment company fails or is unable to satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph with respect to the holders of interest in the unit investment
trust, it shall so notify the Internal Revenue Service within 45 days following the close of its taxable year. The custodian shall, upon notice by the Internal Revenue Service that the regulated investment company has failed to comply with the agreement, satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph within 30 days of such notice. If a notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is mailed within the 120-day period following the date of a determination pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the 120-day period and the 130-day period following the date of the determination shall be substituted for the 45-day period and the 55-day period following the close of the regulated investment company's taxable year prescribed by this subparagraph (2).
(3)
Subsection (d) gain for certain taxable years.
In the case of capital gain dividends with respect to any taxable year of a regulated investment company ending after December 31, 1969, and beginning before January 1, 1975 (including capital gain dividends paid after the close of the taxable year pursuant to an election under section 855), the company must include in its written notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section a statement showing the shareholder's proportionate share of the capital gain dividend which is gain described in section 1201(d)(1) and his proportionate share of such dividend which is gain described in section 1201(d)(2). In determining the portion of the capital gain dividend which, in the hands of a shareholder, is gain described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2), the regulated investment company shall consider that capital gain dividends for a taxable year are first made from its long-term capital gains for such year which are not described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2), to the extent thereof, and then from its long-term capital gains for such year which are described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2). A shareholder's proportionate share of gains which are described in section 1201(d)(1) is the amount which bears the same ratio to the amount paid to him as a capital gain dividend in respect of such year as (i) the aggregate amount of the company's gains which are described in section 1201(d)(1) and paid to all shareholders bears to (ii) the aggregate amount of the capital gain dividend paid to all shareholders in respect of such year. A shareholder's proportionate share of gains which are described in section 1201(d)(2) shall be determined in a similar manner. Every regulated investment company shall keep a record of the proportion of each capital gain dividend (to which this paragraph applies) which is gain described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2). If, for his taxable year, a shareholder must include in his gross income a capital gain dividend to which this paragraph applies, he shall attach to his income tax return for such taxable year a statement showing, with respect to the total of such dividends for such taxable year received from each regulated investment company, the name and address of the regulated investment company from which such dividends are received, the amount of such dividends, the portion of such dividends which was designated as gain described in section 1201(d)(1), and the portion of such dividends which was designated as gain described in section 1201(d)(2).
(4)
Mailing of written notice to shareholders.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the written notice designating a dividend or part thereof as a capital gain dividend must be mailed to the shareholders not later than 45 days (30 days for a taxable year ending before February 26, 1964) after the close of the taxable year of the regulated investment company.
(ii) If a determination (as defined in section 860(e)) after November 6, 1978, increases the excess for the taxable year of the net capital gain over the deduction for capital gains dividends paid, then a regulated investment company may designate all or part of any dividend as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders at any time during the 120-day period immediately following the date of the determination. The aggregate amount designated during this period may not exceed this increase. A dividend may be designated if it is actually paid during the taxable year, is one paid after the close of the taxable year to which section 855 applies, or is a deficiency dividend (as defined in section 860(f)), including a deficiency dividend paid by an acquiring corporation to
which section 381(c)(25) applies. The date of a determination is established under § 1.860-2(b)(1).
(d)
Special treatment of loss on the sale or exchange of regulated investment company stock held less than 31 days
—(1)
In general.
Under section 852(b)(4), if any person, with respect to a share of regulated investment company stock acquired by such person after December 31, 1957, and held for a period of less than 31 days, is required by section 852(b)(3) (B) or (D) to include in gross income as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than six months—
(i) The amount of a capital gain dividend, or
(ii) An amount of undistributed capital gains,
then such person shall, to the extent of such amount, treat any loss on the sale or exchange of such share of stock as a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977). Such special treatment with respect to the sale of regulated investment company stock held for a period of less than 31 days is applicable to losses for taxable years ending after December 31, 1957.
(2)
Determination of holding period.
The rules contained in section 246(c)(3) (relating to the determination of holding periods for purposes of the deduction for dividends received) shall be applied in determining whether, for purposes of section 852(b)(4) and this paragraph, a share of regulated investment company stock has been held for a period of less than 31 days. In applying those rules, however, “30 days” shall be substituted for the number of days specified in subparagraph (B) of section 246(c)(3).
(3)
Example.
The application of section 852(b)(4) and this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On December 15, 1958, A purchased a share of stock in the X regulated investment company for $20. The X regulated investment company declared a capital gain dividend of $2 per share to shareholders of record on December 31, 1958. A, therefore, received a capital gain dividend of $2 which, pursuant to section 852(b)(3)(B), he must treat as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 6 months. On January 5, 1959, A sold his share of stock in the X regulated investment company for $17.50, which sale resulted in a loss of $2.50. Under section 852(b)(4) and this paragraph, A must treat $2 of such loss (an amount equal to the capital gain dividend received with respect to such share of stock) as a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 6 months.

§ 1.852-5
Earnings and profits of a regulated investment company.
(a) Any regulated investment company, whether or not such company meets the requirements of section 852(a) and paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of § 1.852-1, shall apply paragraph (b) of this section in computing its earnings and profits for a taxable year beginning after February 28, 1958. However, for a taxable year of a regulated investment company beginning before March 1, 1958, paragraph (b) of this section shall apply only if the regulated investment company meets the requirements of section 852(a) and paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of § 1.852-1.
(b) In the determination of the earnings and profits of a regulated investment company, section 852(c) provides that such earnings and profits for any taxable year (but not the accumulated earnings and profits) shall not be reduced by any amount which is not allowable as a deduction in computing its taxable income for the taxable year. Thus, if a corporation would have had earnings and profits of $500,000 for the taxable year except for the fact that it had a net capital loss of $100,000, which amount was not deductible in determining its taxable income, its earnings and profits for that year if it is a regulated investment company would be $500,000. If the regulated investment company had no accumulated earnings
and profits at the beginning of the taxable year, in determining its accumulated earnings and profits as of the beginning of the following taxable year, the earnings and profits for the taxable year to be considered in such computation would amount to $400,000 assuming that there had been no distribution from such earnings and profits. If distributions had been made in the taxable year in the amount of the earnings and profits then available for distribution, $500,000, the corporation would have as of the beginning of the following taxable year neither accumulated earnings and profits nor a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits, and would begin such year with its paid-in capital reduced by $100,000, an amount equal to the excess of the $500,000 distributed over the $400,000 accumulated earnings and profits which would otherwise have been carried into the following taxable year.
§ 1.852-6
Records to be kept for purpose of determining whether a corporation claiming to be a regulated investment company is a personal holding company.
(a) Every regulated investment company shall maintain in the internal revenue district in which it is required to file its income tax return permanent records showing the information relative to the actual owners of its stock contained in the written statements required by this section to be demanded from the shareholders. The actual owner of stock includes the person who is required to include in gross income in his return the dividends received on the stock. Such records shall be kept at all times available for inspection by any internal revenue officer or employee, and shall be retained so long as the contents thereof may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law.
(b) For the purpose of determining whether a domestic corporation claiming to be a regulated investment company is a personal holding company as defined in section 542, the permanent records of the company shall show the maximum number of shares of the corporation (including the number and face value of securities convertible into stock of the corporation) to be considered as actually or constructively owned by each of the actual owners of any of its stock at any time during the last half of the corporation's taxable year, as provided in section 544.
(c) Statements setting forth the information (required by paragraph (b) of this section) shall be demanded not later than 30 days after the close of the corporation's taxable year as follows:
(1) In the case of a corporation having 2,000 or more record owners of its stock on any dividend record date, from each record holder of 5 percent or more of its stock; or
(2) In the case of a corporation having less than 2,000 and more than 200 record owners of its stock, on any dividend record date, from each record holder of 1 percent or more of its stock; or
(3) In the case of a corporation having 200 or less record owners of its stock, on any dividend record date, from each record holder of one-half of 1 percent or more of its stock.
When making demand for the written statements required of each shareholder by this paragraph, the company shall inform each of the shareholders of his duty to submit as a part of his income tax return the statements which are required by § 1.852-7 if he fails or refuses to comply with such demand. A list of the persons failing or refusing to comply in whole or in part with a company's demand shall be maintained as a part of its record required by this section. A company which fails to keep such records to show the actual ownership of its outstanding stock as are required by this section shall be taxable as an ordinary corporation and not as a regulated investment company.
§ 1.852-7
Additional information required in returns of shareholders.
Any person who fails or refuses to comply with the demand of a regulated investment company for the written statements which § 1.852-6 requires the company to demand from its shareholders shall submit as a part of his income tax return a statement showing, to the best of his knowledge and belief—
(a) The number of shares actually owned by him at any and all times during the period for which the return is
filed in any company claiming to be a regulated investment company;
(b) The dates of acquisition of any such stock during such period and the names and addresses of persons from whom it was acquired;
(c) The dates of disposition of any such stock during such period and the names and addresses of the transferees thereof;
(d) The names and addresses of the members of his family (as defined in section 544(a)(2)); the names and addresses of his partners, if any, in any partnership; and the maximum number of shares, if any, actually owned by each in any corporation claiming to be a regulated investment company, at any time during the last half of the taxable year of such company;
(e) The names and addresses of any corporation, partnership, association, or trust in which he had a beneficial interest to the extent of at least 10 percent at any time during the period for which such return is made, and the number of shares of any corporation claiming to be a regulated investment company actually owned by each;
(f) The maximum number of shares (including the number and face value of securities convertible into stock of the corporation) in any domestic corporation claiming to be a regulated investment company to be considered as constructively owned by such individual at any time during the last half of the corporation's taxable year, as provided in section 544 and the regulations thereunder; and
(g) The amount and date of receipt of each dividend received during such period from every corporation claiming to be a regulated investment company.
§ 1.852-8
Information returns.
Nothing in §§ 1.852-6 and 1.852-7 shall be construed to relieve regulated investment companies or their shareholders from the duty of filing information returns required by regulations prescribed under the provisions of subchapter A, chapter 61 of the Code.
§ 1.852-9
Special procedural requirements applicable to designation under section 852(b)(3)(D).
(a)
Regulated investment company
—(1)
Notice to shareholders.
(i) A designation of undistributed capital gains under section 852(b)(3)(D) and paragraph (b)(2)(i) of § 1.852-2 shall be made by notice on Form 2439 mailed by the regulated investment company to each person who is a shareholder of record of the company at the close of the company's taxable year. The notice on Form 2439 shall show the name, address, and employer identification number of the regulated investment company; the taxable year of the company for which the designation is made; the name, address, and identifying number of the shareholder; the amount designated by the company for inclusion by the shareholder in computing his long-term capital gains; and the tax paid with respect thereto by the company which is deemed to have been paid by the shareholder.
(ii) In the case of a designation of undistributed capital gains with respect to a taxable year of the regulated investment company ending after December 31, 1969, and beginning before January 1, 1975, Form 2439 shall also show the shareholder's proportionate share of such gains which is gain described in section 1201(d)(1), his proportionate share of such gains which is gain described in section 1201(d)(2), and the amount (determined pursuant to subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph) by which the shareholder's adjusted basis in his shares shall be increased.
(iii) In determining under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph the portion of the undistributed capital gains which, in the hands of the shareholder, is gain described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2), the company shall consider that capital gain dividends for a taxable year are made first from its long-term capital gains for such year which are not described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2), to the extent thereof, and then from its long-term capital gains for such year which are described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2). A shareholder's proportionate share of undistributed capital gains for a taxable year which is gain described in section 1201(d)(1) is the amount which bears the same ratio to the amount included in his income as designated undistributed capital gains for such year as (
a
) the aggregate amount of the company's gains for such year which are described in section 1201(d)(1)
and designated as undistributed capital gains bears to (
b
) the aggregate amount of the company's gains for such year which are designated as undistributed capital gains. A shareholder's proportionate share of gains which are described in section 1201(d)(2) shall be determined in a similar manner. Every regulated investment company shall keep a record of the proportion of undistributed capital gains (to which this subdivision applies) which is gain described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2).
(iv) In the case of a designation of undistributed capital gains for any taxable year ending after December 31, 1969, and beginning before January 1, 1975, Form 2439 shall also show with respect to the undistributed capital gains of each shareholder the amount by which such shareholder's adjusted basis in his shares shall be increased under section 852(b)(3)(D)(iii). The amount by which each shareholders' adjusted basis in his shares shall be increased is the amount includible in his gross income with respect to such shares under section 852(b)(3)(D)(i) less the tax which the shareholder is deemed to have paid with respect to such shares. The tax which each shareholder is deemed to have paid with respect to such shares is the amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of the tax imposed by section 852(b)(3)(A) for such year with respect to the aggregate amount of the designated undistributed capital gains as the amount of such gains includible in the shareholder's gross income bears to the aggregate amount of such gains so designated.
(v) Form 2439 shall be prepared in triplicate, and copies B and C of the form shall be mailed to the shareholder on or before the 45th day (30th day for a taxable year ending before February 26, 1964) following the close of the company's taxable year. Copy A of each Form 2439 must be associated with the duplicate copy of the undistributed capital gains tax return of the company (Form 2438), as provided in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph.

Copies B and C of the Form 2439 prepared by the nominee shall be mailed to the actual owner—
(i) For taxable years of regulated investment companies ending after February 25, 1964, on or before the 75th day (55th day in the case of a nominee who is acting as a custodian of a unit investment trust described in section 851(f)(1) and paragraph (d) of § 1.851-7 for taxable years of regulated investment companies ending after December 8, 1970, and 135th day if the nominee is a resident of a foreign country) following the close of the regulated investment company's taxable year, or

§ 1.852-10
Distributions in redemption of interests in unit investment trusts.
(a)
In general.
In computing that part of the excess of its net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss on which it must pay a capital gains tax, a regulated investment company is allowed under section 852(b)(3)(A)(ii) a deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) determined with reference to capital gains dividends only. Section 561(b) provides that in determining the deduction for dividends paid, the rules provided in section 562 are applicable. Section 562(c) (relating to preferential dividends) provides that the amount of
any distribution shall not be considered as a dividend unless such distribution is pro-rata, with no preference to any share of stock as compared with other shares of the same class except to the extent that the former is entitled to such preference.
(b)
Redemption distributions made by unit investment trust
—(1)
In general.
Where a unit investment trust (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) liquidates part of its portfolio represented by shares in a management company in order to make a distribution to a holder of an interest in the trust in redemption of part or all of such interest, and by so doing, the trust realizes net long-term capital gain, that portion of the distribution by the trust which is equal to the amount of the net long-term capital gain realized by the trust on the liquidation of the shares in the management company will not be considered a preferential dividend under section 562(c). For example, where the entire amount of net long-term capital gain realized by the trust on such a liquidation is distributed to the redeeming interest holder, the trust will be allowed the entire amount of net long-term capital gain so realized in determining the deduction under section 852(b)(3)(A)(ii) for dividends paid determined with reference to capital gains dividends only. This paragraph and section 852(d) shall apply only with respect to the capital gain net income (net capital gain for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977) realized by the trust which is attributable to a redemption by a holder of an interest in such trust. Such dividend may be designated as a capital gain dividend by a written notice to the certificate holder. Such designation should clearly indicate to the holder that the holder's gain or loss on the redemption of the certificate may differ from such designated amount, depending upon the holder's basis for the redeemed certificate, and that the holder's own records are to be used in computing the holder's gain or loss on the redemption of the certificate.
(2)
Example.
The application of the provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
B entered into a periodic payment plan contract with X as custodian and Z as plan sponsor under which he purchased a plan certificate of X. Under this contract, upon B's demand, X must redeem B's certificate at a price substantially equal to the value of the number of shares in Y, a management company, which are credited to B's account by X in connection with the unit investment trust. Except for a small amount of cash which X is holding to satisfy liabilities and to invest for other plan certificate holders, all of the assets held by X in connection with the trust consist of shares in Y. Pursuant to the terms of the periodic payment plan contract, 100 shares of Y are credited to B's account. Both X and Y have elected to be treated as regulated investment companies. On March 1, 1965, B notified X that he wished to have his entire interest in the unit investment trust redeemed. In order to redeem B's interest, X caused Y to redeem 100 shares of Y which X held. At the time of redemption, each share of Y had a value of $15. X then distributed the $1,500 to B. X's basis for each of the Y shares which was redeemed was $10. Therefore, X realized a long-term capital gain of $500 ($5 × 100 shares) which is attributable to the redemption by B of his interest in the trust. Under section 852(d), the $500 capital gain distributed to B will not be considered a preferential dividend. Therefore, X is allowed a deduction of $500 under section 852(b)(3)(A)(ii) for dividends paid determined with reference to capital gains dividends only, with the result that X will not pay a capital gains tax with respect to such amount.
(c)

means—
(i) Any net capital loss attributable to the portion of a regulated investment company's taxable year after October 31; or
(ii) If there is no such net capital loss, any net long-term capital loss attributable to the portion of a regulated investment company's taxable year after October 31.
(2)
Methodology.
The amount of any net capital loss or any net long-term capital loss attributable to the portion of the regulated investment company's
taxable year after October 31 shall be determined in accordance with general tax law principles (other than section 1212) by treating the period beginning on November 1 of the taxable year of the regulated investment company and ending on the last day of such taxable year as though it were the taxable year of the regulated investment company. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), any item (other than a capital loss carryover) that is required to be taken into account or any rule that must be applied, for purposes of section 4982, on October 31 as if it were the last day of the regulated investment company's taxable year must also be taken into account or applied in the same manner as required under section 4982, both on October 31 and again on the last day of the regulated investment company's taxable year.
(3)
October 31 treated as last day of taxable year for purpose of determining taxable income under certain circumstances
—(i)
In general.
If a regulated investment company has a post-October capital loss for a taxable year, any item that must be marked to market for purposes of section 4982 on October 31 as if it were the last day of the regulated investment company's taxable year must also be marked to market on October 31 and again on the last day of the regulated investment company's taxable year for purposes of determining its taxable income. If the regulated investment company does not have a post-October capital loss for a taxable year, the regulated investment company must treat items that must be marked to market for purposes of section 4982 on October 31 as if it were the last day of the regulated investment company's taxable year as marked to market only on the last day of its taxable year for purposes of determining its taxable income.
(ii)
Effect on gross income.
The marking to market of any item on October 31 of a regulated investment company's taxable year for purposes of determining its taxable income under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section shall not affect the amount of the gross income of such company for such taxable year for purposes of section 851(b)(2) or (3).
(d)
Post-October currency loss defined.
For purposes of this section—
(1)
Post-October currency loss.
The term

(2)
Net foreign currency loss.

Net capital loss.
If the post-October capital loss referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is a post-October capital loss as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the net capital gain of the company for the taxable year in which the loss arose shall be determined without regard to any capital gains or losses (both long-term and short-term) taken into account in computing the post-October capital loss for the taxable year.
(ii)
Net long-term capital loss.
If the post-October capital loss referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is a post-October capital loss as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the net capital gain of the company for the taxable year in which the loss arose shall be determined without regard to any long-term capital gain or loss taken into account in computing the post-October capital loss for the taxable year.
(3)
Amount taken into account in succeeding year.
If a regulated investment company has a post-October capital loss (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this section) for any taxable year, then, for purposes of determining the amount the company may designate as capital gain dividends for the
succeeding year, the net capital gain for the succeeding year shall be determined by treating all gains and losses taken into account in computing the post-October capital loss as arising on the first day of the succeeding year.
(f)
Regulated investment company may elect to defer certain losses for purposes of determining taxable income
—(1)
In general.
A regulated investment company may elect, in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (i) of this section, to compute its taxable income for a taxable year without regard to part or all of any post-October capital loss or post-October currency loss for that year.
(2)

The taxable income of a regulated investment company for a taxable year to which an election under paragraph (f)(1) of this section applies shall be computed without regard to that part of any post-October capital loss or post-October currency loss to which the election applies.
(3)

No amount of capital gain taken into account in computing the post-October capital loss for the taxable year shall be taken into account in the determination.
(B)
Character of capital loss not deferred.
The capital loss includible in the taxable income of the company under this paragraph (f)(3)(ii) for the taxable year in which the loss arose shall consist first of any short-term capital losses to the extent thereof, and then of any long-term capital losses, taken into account in computing the post-October capital loss for the taxable year.

Earnings and profits
—(1)
General rule.
The earnings and profits of a regulated investment company for a taxable year are determined without regard to any post-October capital loss or post-October currency loss for that year. If a regulated investment company distributes with respect to a calendar year amounts in excess of the limitation described in the succeeding sentence, then, with respect to those excess amounts, for the taxable year with respect to which the amounts are distributed, the earnings and profits of the company are computed without regard to the preceding sentence. The limitation described in this sentence is the amount that would be the required distribution for that calendar year under section 4982 if “100 percent” were substituted for each percentage set forth in section 4982(b)(1).
(2)
Special Rule—Treatment of losses that are deferred for purposes of determining taxable income.
If a regulated investment company elects to defer, under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, any part of a post-October capital loss or post-October currency loss arising in a taxable year, then, for both the taxable year in which the loss arose and the succeeding year, both the earnings and profits and the accumulated earnings and profits of the company are determined as if the part of the loss so deferred had arisen on the first day of the succeeding year.
(h)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. For each example, assume that X is a regulated investment company that computes its income on a calendar year basis, and that no election is in effect under section 4982(e)(4).

# Example 1.
X has a $25 net foreign currency gain, a $50 net short-term capital loss, and a $75 net long-term capital gain for the post-October period of 1988. X has no post-October currency loss and no post-October capital loss for 1988, and this section does not apply.

# Example 2.

X has a post-October capital loss of $75 for its 1988 taxable year due to a net long-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988. X does not make an election under paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(i)
Capital gain dividends.
X may designate up to $100 as a capital gain dividend for 1988 because X must disregard the $75 long-term capital gain and the $150 long-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988 in computing its net capital gain for this purpose. In computing its net capital gain for 1989 for the purposes of determining the amount it may designate as a capital gain dividend for 1989, X must take into account the $75 long-term capital gain and the $150 long-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988 in addition to the long-term and short-term capital gains and losses for 1989. Accordingly, X may not designate any amount as a capital gain dividend for 1989.
(ii)
Taxable income.
X must include the $75 long-term capital gain and the $150 long-term capital loss for its post-October period of 1988 in its taxable income for 1988 because it did not make an election under paragraph (f)(1) of this section for 1988. Accordingly, X's taxable income for 1988 will include a net capital gain of $25 and a net short-term capital gain of $160. X's taxable income for 1989 will include a net capital gain of $60 and a net short-term capital gain of $70.
(iii)
Earnings and profits.
X must determine its earnings and profits for 1988 without regard to the $75 long-term capital gain and the $150 long-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988. X must, however, include the $75 long-term capital gain and $150 long-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988 in determining its accumulated earnings and profits for 1988. Thus, X includes $260 of capital gain in its earnings and profits for 1988, includes $185 in its accumulated earnings and profits for 1988, and includes $130 of capital gain in its earnings and profits for 1989.

# Example 3.
Same facts as example 2, except that X elects to defer the entire $75 post-October capital loss for 1988 under paragraph (f)(1) of this section for purposes of determining its taxable income for 1988.
(i)
Capital gain dividends.
Same result as in example 2.
(ii)
Taxable income.
X must compute its taxable income for 1988 without regard to the $75 long-term capital gain and the $150 long-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988 because it made an election to defer the entire $75 post-October capital loss for 1988 under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Accordingly, X's taxable income for 1988 will include a net capital gain of $100 and a net short-term capital gain of $160. X must include the $75 long-term capital gain and the $150 long-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988 in its taxable income for 1989 in addition to the long-term and short-term capital gains and losses for 1989. Accordingly, X's taxable income for 1989 will include a net long-term capital loss of $15 and a net short-term capital gain of $70.
(iii)
Earnings and profits.
For 1988, X must determine both its earnings and profits and its accumulated earnings and profits without regard to the $75 long-term capital gain and $150 long-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988. In determining both its earnings and profits and its accumulated earnings and profits for 1989, X must include (in addition to the long-term and short-term capital gains and losses for 1989) the $75 long-term capital gain and $150 long-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988 as if those deferred gains and losses arose on January 1, 1989. Thus, X will include $260 of capital gain in its earnings and profits for 1988 and $55 of capital gain in its earnings and profits for 1989.

# Example 4.
Same facts as example 2, except that X elects to defer only $50 of the post-October capital loss for 1988 under paragraph (f)(1) of this section for purposes of determining its taxable income for 1988.
(i)
Capital gain dividends.
Same results as in example 2.
(ii)
Taxable income.
X must compute its taxable income for 1988 without regard to the $75 long-term capital gain and $125 of the $150 long-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988 because it made an election to defer $50 of the $75 post-October capital loss for 1988 under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Accordingly, X's taxable income for 1988 will include a net capital gain of $75 and a net short-term capital gain of $160. X must include the $75 long-term capital gain and $125 of the $150 long-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988 in its taxable income for 1989 in addition to the long-term and short-term capital gains and losses for 1989. Accordingly, X's taxable income for 1989 will include a net capital gain of $10 and a net short-term capital gain of $70.
(iii)
Earnings and profits.
X must determine its earnings and profits for 1988 without regard to the $75 long-term capital gain and the $150 long-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988. X must include $25 of the $150 long-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988 in determining its accumulated earnings and profits for 1988. In determining both its earnings and profits and its accumulated earnings and profits for 1989, X must include (in addition to the long-term and short-term capital gains and losses for 1989) the $75 long-term capital gain and $125 of the $150 long-term capital loss for the
post-October period of 1988 as if those deferred gains and losses arose on January 1, 1989. Thus, X includes $260 of capital gain in its earnings and profits for 1988, includes $235 in its accumulated earnings and profits for 1988, and includes $80 of capital gain in its earnings and profits for 1989.

In computing its net capital gain for 1989 for purposes of determining the amount it may designate as a capital gain dividend for 1989, X must take into account the $150 long-term capital gain, the $75 long-term capital loss, the $50 short-term capital gain, and the $150 short-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988 in addition to the long-term and short-term capital gains and losses for 1989.

Accordingly, X's taxable income for 1988 will include a net capital gain of $135 (consisting of a net long-term capital gain of $175 and a net short-term capital loss of $40). X's taxable income for 1989 will include a net capital gain of $60 and a net short-term capital gain of $70.
(iii)
Earnings and profits.
X must determine its earnings and profits for 1988 without regard to the $150 long-term capital gain, the $75 long-term capital loss, the $50 short-term capital gain, and the $150 short-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988. X must, however, include the $150 long-term capital gain, the $75 long-term capital loss, the $50 short-term capital gain, and the $150 short-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988 in determining its accumulated earnings and profits for 1988. Thus, X includes $160 of capital gain in its earnings and profits for 1988, includes $135 in its accumulated earnings and profits for 1988, and includes $130 of capital gain in its earnings and profits for 1989.

X's taxable income for 1989 will include a net capital gain of $130 for 1989 (consisting of a net long-term capital gain of $160 and a net short-term capital loss of $30).
(iii)

Thus, X includes $160 of capital gain in its earnings
and profits for 1988, includes $115 in its accumulated earnings and profits for 1988, and includes $130 of capital gain in its earnings and profits for 1989.

# Example 9.
Same facts as example 8, except that X elects to defer the entire $45 post-October capital loss for 1988 under paragraph (f)(1) of this section for purposes of determining its taxable income for 1988.
(i)
Capital gain dividends.
Same result as in example 8.
(ii)
Taxable income.
X must compute its taxable income for 1988 without regard to the $15 long-term capital gain, the $75 long-term capital loss, the $25 short-term capital gain, and the $10 short-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988 because it made an election to defer the entire $45 post-October capital loss for 1988 under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Accordingly, X's taxable income for 1988 will include a net capital gain of $100 and a net short-term capital gain of $60. X must include the $15 long-term capital gain, the $75 long-term capital loss, the $25 short-term capital gain, and the $10 short-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988 in its taxable income for 1989 in addition to the long-term and short-term capital gains and losses for 1989. Accordingly, X's taxable income for 1989 will include a net capital gain of $85 (consisting of a net long-term capital gain of $100 and a net short-term capital loss of $15).
(iii)
Earnings and profits.
For 1988, X must determine both its earnings and profits and its accumulated earnings and profits without regard to the $15 long-term capital gain, the $75 long-term capital loss, the $25 short-term capital gain, and the $10 short-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988. In determining both its earnings and profits and its accumulated earnings and profits for 1989, X must include (in addition to the long-term and short-term capital gains and losses for 1989) the $15 long-term capital gain, the $75 long-term capital loss, the $25 short-term capital gain, and the $10 short-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988 as if those deferred gains and losses arose on January 1, 1989. Thus, X will include $160 of capital gain in its earnings and profits for 1988 and $85 of capital gain in its earnings and profits for 1989.

# Example 10.
Same facts as example 8, except that X elects to defer only $30 of the post-October capital loss for 1988 under paragraph (f)(1) of this section for purposes of determining its taxable income for 1988.
(i)
Capital gain dividends.
Same result as in example 8.
(ii)
Taxable income.
X must compute its taxable income for 1988 by including $5 of the $75 long-term capital loss and the $10 short-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988, but without regard to the $15 long-term capital gain, $70 of the $75 long-term capital loss, and the $25 short-term capital gain for the post-October period of 1988 because it made an election to defer $30 of the $45 post-October capital loss for 1988 under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Accordingly, X's taxable income for 1988 will include a net capital gain of $95 and a net short-term capital gain of $50. X must include the $15 long-term capital gain, $70 of the $75 long-term capital loss, and the $25 short-term capital gain for the post-October period of 1988 in its taxable income for 1989 in addition to the long-term and short-term capital gains and losses for 1989. Accordingly, X's taxable income for 1989 will include a net capital gain of $100 (consisting of a net long-term capital gain of $105 and a net short-term capital loss of $5).
(iii)
Earnings and profits.
X must determine its earnings and profits for 1988 without regard to the $15 long-term capital gain, the $75 long-term capital loss, the $25 short-term capital gain, and the $10 short-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988. In determining its accumulated earnings and profits for 1988, X must include $5 of the $75 long-term capital loss and the $10 short-term capital loss for the post-October period of 1988. In determining both its earnings and profits and its accumulated earnings and profits for 1989, X must include (in addition to the long-term and short-term capital gains and losses for 1989) the $15 long-term capital gain, $70 of the $75 long-term capital loss, and the $25 short-term capital gain for the post-October period of 1988 as if those deferred gains and losses arose on January 1, 1989. Thus, X includes $160 of capital gain in its earnings and profits for 1988, includes $145 in its accumulated earnings and profits for 1989, and includes $100 of capital gain in its earnings and profits for 1989 (consisting of a net long-term capital gain of $105 and a net short-term capital loss of $5).

# Example 11.
X has the following foreign currency gains and losses attributable to the periods indicated:
01/01 to 10/31/88
200
11/01 to 12/31/88
(100)
01/01 to 10/31/89
110
11/01 to 12/31/89
40
X has a $100 post-October currency loss for its 1988 taxable year due to a net foreign currency loss for the post-October period of 1988. X does not make an election under paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
(i)
Taxable income.
X must compute its taxable income for 1988 by including the $100 foreign currency loss for the post-October period of 1988 because it did not make an election under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Accordingly, X's taxable income for 1988 will include a net foreign currency gain of $100. X's taxable income for 1989 will include a net foreign currency gain of $150.
(ii)
Earnings and profits.
X must determine its earnings and profits for 1988 without regard to the foreign currency loss for the post-October period of 1988. X must, however, include the $100 foreign currency loss for the post-October period 1988 in determining its accumulated earnings and profits for 1988. Thus, X includes $200 of foreign currency gain in its earnings and profits for 1988, includes $100 in its accumulated earnings and profits for 1988, and includes $150 of foreign currency gain in its earnings and profits for 1989.

# Example 12.
Same facts as example 11, except that X elects to defer the entire $100 post-October currency loss for 1988 under paragraph (f)(1) of this section for purposes of determining its taxable income for 1988.
(i)
Taxable income.
X must compute its taxable income for 1988 without regard to the $100 foreign currency loss for the post-October period of 1988 because it made an election to defer the entire $100 post-October currency loss for 1988 under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Accordingly, X's taxable income for 1988 will include a net foreign currency gain of $200. X's taxable income for 1989 will include a net foreign currency gain of $50 because X must compute its taxable income for 1989 by including the $100 foreign currency loss for the post-October period of 1988 in addition to the foreign currency gains and losses for 1989.
(ii)
Earnings and profits.
For 1988, X must determine both its earnings and profits and its accumulated earnings and profits without regard to the $100 foreign currency loss for the post-October period of 1988. In determining both its earnings and profits and its accumulated earnings and profits for 1989, X must include (in addition to the foreign currency gains and losses for 1989) the $100 foreign currency loss for the post-October period 1988 as if that deferred loss arose on January 1, 1989. Thus, X will include $200 of foreign currency gain in its earnings and profits for 1988 and $50 of foreign currency gain in its earnings and profits for 1989.

# Example 13.
Same facts as example 11, except that X elects to defer only $75 of the post-October currency loss under paragraph (f)(1) of this section for purposes of determining its taxable income for 1988.
(i)
Taxable income.
X must compute its taxable income for 1988 by including $25 of the $100 foreign currency loss for the post-October period of 1988, but without regard to $75 of the $100 foreign currency loss for the post-October period of 1988 because it made an election to defer $75 of the $100 post-October currency loss for 1988 under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Accordingly, X's taxable income for 1988 will include a net foreign currency gain of $175. X's taxable income will include a net foreign currency gain of $75 for 1989 because X must compute its taxable income for 1989 by including $75 of the $100 foreign currency loss for the post-October period of 1988 in addition to the foreign currency gains and losses for 1989.
(ii)
Earnings and profits.
X must determine its earnings and profits for 1988 without regard to the $100 foreign currency loss for the post-October period of 1988. X must, however, include $25 of the $100 foreign currency loss for the post-October period of 1988 in determining its accumulated earnings and profits for 1988. In determining both its earnings and profits and its accumulated earnings and profits for 1989, X must include (in addition to the foreign currency gains and losses for 1989) the $75 of the $100 foreign currency loss for the post-October period of 1988 as if that loss arose on January 1, 1989. Thus, X includes $200 of foreign currency gain in its earnings and profits for 1988, includes $175 in its accumulated earnings and profits for 1988, and includes $75 of foreign currency gain in its earnings and profits for 1989.
(i)
Procedure for making election
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, a regulated investment company may make an election under paragraph (f)(1) of this section for a taxable year to which this section applies by completing its income tax return (including any necessary schedules) for that taxable year in accordance with the instructions for the form that are applicable to the election.
(2)
When applicable instructions not available.
If the instructions for the income tax returns of regulated investment companies for a taxable year to which this section applies do not reflect the provisions of this section, a regulated investment company may make an election under paragraph (f)(1) of this section for that year by entering the appropriate amounts on its income tax return (including any necessary schedules) for that year, and by attaching a written statement to the return that states—
(i) The taxable year for which the election under this section is made;
(ii) The fact that the regulated investment company elects to defer all or a part of its post-October capital loss or post-October currency loss for that taxable year for purposes of computing its taxable income under the terms of this section;
(iii) The amount of the post-October capital loss or post-October currency loss that the regulated investment
company elects to defer for that taxable year; and
(iv) The name, address, and employer identification number of the regulated investment company.
(j)
Transition rules
—(1)
In general.
For a taxable year ending before March 2, 1990 in which a regulated investment company incurred a post-October capital loss or post-October currency loss, the company may use any method that is consistently applied and in accordance with reasonable business practice to determine the amounts taken into account in that taxable year for purposes of paragraphs (e)(2), (f)(3), and (g) of this section and to determine the amount taken into account in the succeeding year for purposes of paragraphs (e)(3), (f)(4), and (g) of this section. For example, for purposes of paragraph (e), a taxpayer may use a method that treats as incurred in a taxable year all capital gains taken into account in computing the post-October capital loss for that year and an amount of capital loss for such period equal to the amount of such gains and that treats the remaining amount of capital loss for such period as arising on the first day of the succeeding year.
Similarly, for purposes of paragraph (e)(3), a taxpayer may use a method that treats as arising on the first day of the succeeding year only the excess of the capital losses from sales or exchanges after October 31 over the capital gains for such period (that is, the net capital loss or net long-term capital loss for such period).
(2)
Retroactive election
—(i)
In general.
A regulated investment company may make an election (a “retroactive election”) under paragraph (f)(1) for a taxable year with respect to which it has filed an income tax return on or before May 1, 1990 (a “retroactive election year”) by filing an amended return (including any necessary schedules) for the retroactive election year reflecting the appropriate amounts and by attaching a written statement to the return that complies with the requirements of paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
(ii)
Deadline for making election.
A retroactive election may be made no later than December 31, 1990.
(3)
Amended return required for succeeding year in certain circumstances
—(i)
In general.
If, at the time a regulated investment company makes a retroactive election under this section, it has already filed an income tax return for the succeeding year, the company must file an amended return for such succeeding year reflecting the appropriate amounts.
(ii)
Time for filing amended return.
An amended return required under paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section must be filed together with the amended return described in paragraph (j)(2)(i).
(4)
Retroactive dividend
—(i)
In general.
A regulated investment company that makes a retroactive election under this section for a retroactive election year may elect to treat any dividend (or portion thereof) declared and paid (or treated as paid under section 852(b)(7)) by the regulated investment company after the retroactive election year and on or before December 31, 1990 as having been paid during the retroactive election year (a “retroactive dividend”). This election shall be irrevocable with respect to the retroactive dividend to which it applies.
(ii)
Method of making election.
The election under this paragraph (j)(4) must be made by the regulated investment company by treating the dividend (or portion thereof) to which the election applies as a dividend paid during the retroactive election year in computing its deduction for dividends paid in its tax returns for all applicable years (including the amended return(s) required to be filed under paragraphs (j)(2) and (3) of this section).
(iii)
Deduction for dividends paid
—(A)
In general.
Subject to the rules of sections 561 and 562, a regulated investment company shall include the amount of any retroactive dividend in computing its deduction for dividends paid for the retroactive election year. No deduction for dividends paid shall be allowed under this paragraph (j)(4)(iii)(A) for any amount not paid (or treated as paid under section 852(b)(7)) on or before December 31, 1990.
(B)
Limitation on ordinary dividends.
The amount of retroactive dividends (other than retroactive dividends qualifying as capital gain dividends)
paid for a retroactive election year under this section shall not exceed the increase, if any, in the investment company taxable income of the regulated investment company (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561)) that is attributable solely to the regulated investment company having made the retroactive election.
(C)
Limitation on capital gain dividends.
The amount of retroactive dividends qualifying as capital gain dividends paid for a retroactive election year under this section shall not exceed the increase, if any, in the amount of the excess described in section 852(b)(3)(A) (relating to the excess of the net capital gain over the deduction for capital gain dividends paid) that is attributable solely to the regulated investment company having made the retroactive election.
(D)
Effect on other years.
A retroactive dividend shall not be includible in computing the deduction for dividends paid for—
(
1
) The taxable year in which such distribution is actually paid (or treated as paid under section 852(b)(7)); or
(
2
) Under section 855(a), the taxable year preceding the retroactive election year.
(iv)
Earnings and profits.
A retroactive dividend shall be considered as paid out of the earnings and profits of the retroactive election year (computed with the application of sections 852(c) and 855, § 1.852-5, § 1.855-1, and this section), and not out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year in which the distribution is actually paid (or treated as paid under section 852(b)(7)).
(v)
Receipt by shareholders.
Except as provided in section 852(b)(7), a retroactive dividend shall be included in the gross income of the shareholders of the regulated investment company for the taxable year in which the dividend is received by them.
(vi)
Foreign tax election.
If a regulated investment company to which section 853 (relating to foreign taxes) is applicable for a retroactive election year elects to treat a dividend paid (or treated as paid under section 852(b)(7)) during the taxable year as a retroactive dividend, the shareholders of the regulated investment company shall consider the amounts described in section 853(b)(2) allocable to such distribution as paid or received, as the case may be, in the shareholder's taxable year in which the distribution is made.
(vii)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph (j)(4) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
X is a regulated investment company that computes its income on a calendar year basis. No election is in effect under section 4982(e)(4). X has the following income for 1988:

# Foreign Currency Gains and Losses

# Gains and Losses
Jan. 1-Oct. 31—100
Nov. 1-Dec. 31—(75)

# Capital Gains and Losses
Jan. 1-Oct. 31—short term, 100; long term, 100
Nov. 1-Dec. 31—short term, 50; long term, (100)
(A) X had investment company taxable income of $175 and no net capital gain for 1988 for taxable income purposes. X distributed $175 of investment company taxable income as an ordinary dividend for 1988.
(B) If X makes a retroactive election under this section to defer the entire $75 post-October currency loss and the entire $50 post-October capital loss for the post-October period of its 1988 taxable year for purposes of computing its taxable income, that deferral increases X's investment company taxable income for 1988 by $25 (due to an increase in foreign currency gain of $75 and a decrease in short-term capital gain of $50) to $200 and increases the excess described in section 852(b)(3)(A) for 1988 by $100 from $0 to $100. The amount that X may treat as a retroactive ordinary dividend is limited to $25, and the amount that X may treat as a retroactive capital gain dividend is limited to $100.
(5)
Certain distributions may be designated retroactively as capital gain dividends.
To the extent that a regulated investment company designated as capital gain dividends for a taxable year less than the maximum amount permitted under paragraph (e) of this section for that taxable year, the regulated investment company may designate an additional amount of dividends paid (or treated as paid under sections 852(b)(7) or 855, or paragraph (j)(4) of this section) for the taxable year as capital gain dividends, notwithstanding that a written notice was not
mailed to its shareholders within 60 days after the close of the taxable year in which the distribution was paid (or treated as paid under section 852(b)(7)).
(k)
Effective date.
the provisions of this section shall apply to taxable years ending after October 31, 1987.

Foreign tax credit allowed to shareholders.
(a)
In general.
Under section 853, a regulated investment company, meeting the requirements set forth in section 853(a) and paragraph (b) of this section, may make an election with respect to the income, war-profits, and excess profits taxes described in section 901(b)(1) which it pays to foreign countries or possessions of the United States during the taxable year, including such taxes as are deemed paid by it under the provisions of any income tax convention to which the United States is a party. If an election is made, the shareholders of the regulated investment company shall apply their proportionate share of such foreign taxes paid, or deemed to have been paid by it pursuant to any income tax convention, as either a credit (under section 901) or as a deduction (under section 164(a)) as provided by section 853(b)(2) and paragraph (b) of § 1.853-2. The election is not applicable with respect to taxes deemed to have been paid under section 902 (relating to the credit allowed to corporate stockholders of a foreign corporation for taxes paid by such foreign corporation). In addition, the election is not applicable to any tax with respect to which the regulated investment company is not allowed a credit by reason of any provision of the
Internal Revenue Code other than section 853(b)(1), including, but not limited to, section 901(j), section 901(k), or section 901(l).
(b)
Requirements.
To qualify for the election provided in section 853(a), a regulated investment company (1) must have more than 50 percent of the value of its total assets, at the close of the taxable year for which the election is made, invested in stocks and securities of foreign corporations, and (2) must also, for that year, comply with the requirements prescribed in section 852(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.852-1. The term “value”, for purposes of the first requirement, is defined in section 851(c)(4). For the definition of foreign corporation, see section 7701(a).

§ 1.853-2
Effect of election.
(a)
Regulated investment company.
A regulated investment company making a valid election with respect to a taxable year under the provisions of section 853(a) is, for such year, denied both the deduction for foreign taxes provided by section 164(a) and the credit for foreign taxes provided by section 901 with respect to all income, war-profits, and excess profits taxes (described in section 901(b)(1)) which it has paid to any foreign country or possession of the United States. See section 853(b)(1)(A). However, under section 853(b)(1)(B), the regulated investment company is permitted to add the amount of such foreign taxes paid to its dividends paid deduction for that taxable year. See paragraph (a) of § 1.852-1.
(b)
Shareholder.
Under section 853(b)(2), a shareholder of an investment company, which has made the election under section 853, is, in effect, placed in the same position as a person directly owning stock in foreign corporations, in that he must include in his gross income (in addition to taxable dividends actually received) his proportionate share of such foreign taxes paid and must treat such amount as foreign taxes paid by him for the purposes of the deduction under section 164(a) and the credit under section 901. For such purposes he must treat as gross income from a foreign country or possession of the United States (1) his proportionate share of the taxes paid by the regulated investment company to such foreign country or possession and (2) the portion of any dividend paid by the investment company which represents income derived from such sources.
(c)
Dividends paid after the close of the taxable year.
For additional rules applicable to certain distributions made after the close of the taxable year which may be designated as income received from sources within and taxes paid to foreign countries or possessions of the United States, see section 855(d) and paragraph (f) of § 1.855-1.
(d)
Example.
This section is illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i)
Facts.
X Corporation, a regulated investment company with 250,000 shares of common stock outstanding, has total assets, at the close of the taxable year, of $10 million ($4 million invested in domestic corporations, $3.5 million in Foreign Country A corporations, and $2.5 million in Foreign Country B corporations). X Corporation received dividend income of $800,000 from the following sources: $300,000 from domestic corporations, $250,000 from Country A corporations, and $250,000 from Country B corporations. All dividends from Country A corporations and from Country B corporations were properly characterized as income from sources without the United States. The dividends from Country A corporations were subject to a 10 percent withholding tax ($25,000) and the dividends from Country B corporations were subject to a 20 percent withholding tax ($50,000). X Corporation's only expenses for the taxable year were $80,000 of operation and management expenses related to both its U.S. and foreign investments. In this case, Corporation X properly apportioned the $80,000 expense based on the relative amounts of its U.S. and foreign source gross income. Thus, $50,000 in expense was apportioned to foreign source income ($80,000 × $500,000 / $800,000, total expense times the fraction of foreign dividend income over total dividend income) and $30,000 in expense was apportioned to U.S. source income ($80,000 × $300,000 / $800,000, total expense times the fraction of U.S. source dividend income over total dividend income). During the taxable year, X Corporation distributed to its shareholders the entire $645,000 income that was available for
distribution ($800,000, less $80,000 in expenses, less $75,000 in foreign taxes withheld).
(ii)
Section 853 election.
X Corporation meets the requirements of section 851 to be considered a RIC for the taxable year and the requirements of section 852(a) for part 1 of subchapter M to apply for the taxable year. X Corporation notifies each shareholder by mail, within the time prescribed by section 853(c), that by reason of the election the shareholders are to treat as foreign taxes paid $0.30 per share of stock ($75,000 of foreign taxes paid, divided by the 250,000 shares of stock outstanding). The shareholders must report as income $2.88 per share ($2.58 of dividends actually received plus the $0.30 representing foreign taxes paid). Of the $2.88 per share, $1.80 per share ($450,000 of foreign source taxable income divided by 250,000 shares) is to be considered as received from foreign sources. The $1.80 consists of $0.30, the foreign taxes treated as paid by the shareholder and $1.50, the portion of the dividends received by the shareholder from the RIC that represents income of the RIC treated as derived from foreign sources ($500,000 of foreign source income, less $50,000 of expense apportioned to foreign source income, less $75,000 of foreign tax withheld, which is $375,000, divided by 250,000 shares).

If a regulated investment company makes an election under section 853(a), in the manner provided in § 1.853-4, the regulated investment company is required under section 853(c) to furnish its shareholders with a written notice mailed not later than 60 days after the close of its taxable year. The notice must designate the shareholder's portion of creditable foreign taxes paid to foreign countries or possessions of the United States and the portion of the dividend that represents income derived from sources within each country that is attributable to a period during which section 901(j) applies to such country, if any, and the portion of the dividend that represents income derived from other foreign countries and possessions of the United States. For purposes of section 853(b)(2) and § 1.853-2(b), the amount that a shareholder may treat as the shareholder's proportionate share of foreign taxes paid and the amount to be included as gross income derived from any foreign country that is attributable to a period during which section 901(j) applies to such country or gross income from sources within other foreign countries or possessions of the United States shall not exceed the amount so designated by the regulated investment company in such written notice. If, however, the amount designated by the regulated investment company in the notice exceeds the shareholder's proper proportionate share of foreign taxes or gross income from sources within foreign countries or possessions of the United States, the shareholder is limited to the amount correctly ascertained.
(b)
Shareholder of record custodian of certain unit investment trusts.
In any case where a notice is mailed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section by a regulated investment company with respect to a taxable year of the regulated investment company ending after December 8, 1970 to a shareholder of record who is a nominee acting as a custodian of a unit investment trust described in section 851(f)(1) and paragraph (b) of § 1.851-7, the nominee shall furnish each holder of an interest in such trust with a written notice mailed on or before the 70th day following the close of the regulated investment company's taxable year. The notice shall designate the holder's proportionate share of the amounts of creditable foreign taxes paid to foreign countries or possessions of the United States and the holder's proportionate share of the dividend that represents income derived from sources within each country that is attributable to a period during which section 901(j) applies to such country, if any, and the holder's proportionate share of the dividend that represents income derived from other foreign countries or possessions of the United States shown on the notice received by the nominee pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. This
paragraph shall not apply if the regulated investment company agrees with the nominee to satisfy the notice requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to each holder of an interest in the unit investment trust whose shares are being held by the nominee as custodian and not later than 45 days following the close of the company's taxable year, files with the Internal Revenue Service office where such company's return for the taxable year is to be filed, a statement that the holders of the unit investment trust with whom the agreement was made have been directly notified by the regulated investment company. Such statement shall include the name, sponsor, and custodian of each unit investment trust whose holders have been directly notified. The nominee's requirements under this paragraph shall be deemed met if the regulated investment company transmits a copy of such statement to the nominee within such 60-day period:
Provided however,
if the regulated investment company fails or is unable to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph with respect to the holders of interest in the unit investment trust, it shall so notify the Internal Revenue Service within 60 days following the close of its taxable year. The custodian shall, upon notice by the Internal Revenue Service that the regulated investment company has failed to comply with the agreement, satisfy the requirements of this paragraph within 30 days of such notice.

[T.D. 9357, 72 FR 48554, Aug. 24, 2007]
§ 1.854-1
Limitations applicable to dividends received from regulated investment company.
(a)
In general.
Section 854 provides special limitations applicable to dividends received from a regulated investment company for purposes of the exclusion under section 116 for dividends received by individuals, the deduction under section 243 for dividends received by corporations, and, in the case of dividends received by individuals before January 1, 1965, the credit under section 34.
(b)
Capital gain dividend.
Under the provisions of section 854(a) a capital gain dividend as defined in section 852(b)(3) and paragraph (c) of § 1.852-4 shall not be considered a dividend for purposes of the exclusion under section 116, the deduction under section 243, and, in the case of taxable years ending before January 1, 1965, the credit under section 34.
(c)
Rule for dividends other than capital gain dividends.
(1) Section 854(b)(1) limits the amount that may be treated as a dividend (other than a capital gain dividend) by the shareholder of a regulated investment company, for the purposes of the credit, exclusion, and deduction specified in paragraph (b) of this section, where the investment company receives substantial amounts of income (such as interest, etc.) from sources other than dividends from domestic corporations, which dividends qualify for the exclusion under section 116.
(2) Where the “aggregate dividends received” (as defined in section 854(b)(3)(B) and paragraph (b) of § 1.854-3) during the taxable year by a regulated investment company (which meets the requirements of section 852(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.852-1 for the taxable year during which it paid such dividend) are less than 75 percent of its gross income for such taxable year (as defined in section 854(b)(3)(A) and paragraph (a) of § 1.854-3), only that portion of the dividend paid by the regulated investment company which bears the same ratio to the amount of such dividend paid as the aggregate dividends received by the regulated investment company, during the taxable year, bears to its gross income for such taxable year (computed without regard to gains from the sale or other disposition of stocks or securities) may be treated as a dividend for purposes of such credit, exclusion, and deduction.
(3) Subparagraph (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
The XYZ regulated investment company meets the requirements of section 852(a) for the taxable year and has received income from the following sources:
Capital gains (from the sale of stock or securities)
$100,000
Dividends (from domestic sources other than dividends described in section 116(b))
70,000
Dividend (from foreign corporations)
5,000
Interest
25,000
Total
200,000
Expenses
20,000
Taxable income
180,000
The regulated investment company decides to distribute the entire $180,000. It distributes a capital gain dividend of $100,000 and a dividend of ordinary income of $80,000. The aggregate dividends received by the regulated investment company from domestic corporations ($70,000) is less than 75 percent of its gross income ($100,000) computed without regard to capital gains from sales of securities. Therefore, an apportionment is required. Since $70,000 is 70 percent of $100,000, out of every $1 dividend of ordinary income paid by the regulated investment company only 70 cents would be available for the credit, exclusion, or deduction referred to in section 854(b)(1). The capital gains dividend and the dividend received from foreign corporations are excluded from the computation.
(d)
Dividends received from a regulated investment company during taxable years of shareholders ending after July 31, 1954, and subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
For the application of section 854 to taxable years of shareholders of
a regulated investment company ending after July 31, 1954, and subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, see § 1.34-5 and § 1.116-2.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6921, 32 FR 8756, June 20, 1967]
§ 1.854-2
Notice to shareholders.
(a)
General rule.
Section 854(b)(2) provides that the amount that a shareholder may treat as a dividend for purposes of the exclusion under section 116 for dividends received by individuals, the deduction under section 243 for dividends received by corporation, and, in the case of dividends received by individuals before January 1, 1965, the credit under section 34, shall not exceed the amount so designated by the company in a written notice to its shareholders mailed not later than 45 days (30 days for a taxable year ending before Feb. 26, 1964) after the close of the company's taxable year. If, however, the amount so designated by the company in the notice exceeds the amount which may be treated by the shareholder as a dividend for such purposes, the shareholder is limited to the amount as correctly ascertained under section 854(b)(1) and paragraph (c) of § 1.854-1.
(b)
Shareholder of record custodian of certain unit investment trusts.
In any case where a notice is mailed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section by a regulated investment company with respect to a taxable year of the regulated investment company ending after December 8, 1970 to a shareholder of record who is a nominee acting as a custodian of a unit investment trust described in section 851(f)(1) and paragraph (d) of § 1.851-7, the nominee shall furnish each holder of an interest in such trust with a written notice mailed on or before the 55th day following the close of the regulated investment company's taxable year. The notice shall designate the holder's proportionate share of the amounts that may be treated as a dividend for purposes of the exclusion under section 116 for dividends received by individuals and the deduction under section 243 for dividends received by corporations shown on the notice received by the nominee pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. This notice shall include the name and address of the nominee identified as such. This paragraph shall not apply if the regulated investment company agrees with the nominee to satisfy the notice requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to each holder of an interest in the unit investment trust whose shares are being held by the nominee as custodian and not later than 45 days following the close of the company's taxable year, files with the Internal Revenue Service office where such company's return is to be filed for the taxable year, a statement that the holders of the unit investment trust with whom the agreement was made have been directly notified by the regulated investment company. Such statement shall include the name, sponsor, and custodian of each unit investment trust whose holders have been directly notified. The nominee's requirements under this paragraph shall be deemed met if the regulated investment company transmits a copy of such statement to the nominee within such 45-day period; provided however, if the regulated investment company fails or is unable to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph with respect to the holders of interest in the unit investment trust, it shall so notify the Internal Revenue Service within 45 days following the close of its taxable year. The custodian shall, upon notice by the Internal Revenue Service that the regulated investment company has failed to comply with the agreement, satisfy the requirements of this paragraph within 30 days of such notice.
[T.D. 7187, 37 FR 13257, July 6, 1972]
§ 1.854-3
Definitions.
(a) For the purpose of computing the limitation prescribed by section 854(b)(1)(B) and paragraph (c) of § 1.854-1, the term “gross income” does not include gain from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities. However, capital gains arising from the sale or other disposition of capital assets, other than stock or securities, shall not be excluded from gross income for this purpose.
(b) The term “aggregate dividends received” includes only dividends received from domestic corporations
other than dividends described in section 116(b) (relating to dividends not eligible for exclusion from gross income). Accordingly, dividends received from foreign corporations will not be included in the computation of “aggregate dividends received”. In determining the amount of any dividend for purposes of this section, the rules provided in section 116(c) (relating to certain distributions) shall apply.
§ 1.855-1
Dividends paid by regulated investment company after close of taxable year.
(a)
General rule.
In—
(1) Determining under section 852(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.852-1 whether the deduction for dividends paid during the taxable year (without regard to capital gain dividends) by a regulated investment company equals or exceeds 90 percent of its investment company taxable income (determined without regard to the provisions of section 852(b)(2)(D)),
(2) Computing its investment company taxable income (under section 852(b)(2) and § 1.852-3), and
(3) Determining the amount of capital gain dividends (as defined in section 852(b)(3) and paragraph (c) of § 1.852-4 paid during the taxable year, any dividend (or portion thereof) declared by the investment company either before or after the close of the taxable year but in any event before the time prescribed by law for the filing of its return for the taxable year (including the period of any extension of time granted for filing such return) shall, to the extent the company so elects in such return, be treated as having been paid during such taxable year. This rule is applicable only if the entire amount of such dividend is actually distributed to the shareholders in the 12-month period following the close of such taxable year and not later than the date of the first regular dividend payment made after such declaration.
(b)
Election
—(1)
Method of making election.
The election must be made in the return filed by the company for the taxable year. The election shall be made by the taxpayer (the regulated investment company) by treating the dividend (or portion thereof) to which such election applies as a dividend paid during the taxable year in computing its investment company taxable income, or if the dividend (or portion thereof) to which such election applies is to be designated by the company as a capital gain dividend, in computing the amount of capital gain dividends paid during such taxable year. The election provided in section 855(a) may be made only to the extent that the earnings and profits of the taxable year (computed with the application of section 852(c) and § 1.852-5) exceed the total amount of distributions out of such earnings and profits actually made during the taxable year (not including distributions with respect to which an election has been made for a prior year under section 855(a)). The dividend or portion thereof, with respect to which the regulated investment company has made a valid election under section 855(a), shall be considered as paid out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year for which such election is made, and not out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year in which the distribution is actually made.
(2)
Irrevocability of the election.
After the expiration of the time for filing the return for the taxable year for which an election is made under section 855(a), such election shall be irrevocable with respect to the dividend or portion thereof to which it applies.
(c)
Receipt by shareholders.
Under section 855(b), the dividend or portion thereof, with respect to which a valid election has been made, will be includible in the gross income of the shareholders of the regulated investment company for the taxable year in which the dividend is received by them.
(d)
Examples.
The application of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The X Company, a regulated investment company, had taxable income (and earnings or profits) for the calendar year 1954 of $100,000. During that year the company distributed to shareholders taxable dividends aggregating $88,000. On March 10, 1955, the company declared a dividend of $37,000 payable to shareholders on March 20, 1955. Such dividend consisted of the first regular quarterly dividend for 1955 of $25,000 plus an additional $12,000 representing that part of the
taxable income for 1954 which was not distributed in 1954. On March 15, 1955, the X Company filed its federal income tax return and elected therein to treat $12,000 of the total dividend of $37,000 to be paid to shareholders on March 20, 1955, as having been paid during the taxable year 1954. Assuming that the X Company actually distributed the entire amount of the dividend of $37,000 on March 20, 1955, an amount equal to $12,000 thereof will be treated for the purposes of section 852(a) as having been paid during the taxable year 1954. Such amount ($12,000) will be considered by the X Company as a distribution out of the earnings and profits for the taxable year 1954, and will be treated by the shareholders as a taxable dividend for the taxable year in which such distribution is received by them.

# Example 2.
The Y Company, a regulated investment company, had taxable income (and earnings or profits) for the calendar year 1954 of $100,000, and for 1955 taxable income (and earnings or profits) of $125,000. On January 1, 1954, the company had a deficit in its earnings and profits accumulated since February 28, 1913, of $115,000. During the year 1954 the company distributed to shareholders taxable dividends aggregating $85,000. On March 5, 1955, the company declared a dividend of $65,000 payable to shareholders on March 31, 1955. On March 15, 1955, the Y Company filed its federal income tax return in which it included $40,000 of the total dividend of $65,000 payable to shareholders on March 31, 1955, as a dividend paid by it during the taxable year 1954. On March 31, 1955, the Y Company distributed the entire amount of the dividend of $65,000 declared on March 5, 1955. The election under section 855(a) is valid only to the extent of $15,000, the amount of the undistributed earnings and profits for 1954 ($100,000 earnings and profits less $85,000 distributed during 1954). The remainder ($50,000) of the $65,000 dividend paid on March 31, 1955, could not be the subject of an election, and such amount will be regarded as a distribution by the Y Company out of earnings and profits for the taxable year 1955. Assuming that the only other distribution by the Y Company during 1955 was a distribution of $75,000 paid as a dividend on October 31, 1955, the total amount of the distribution of $65,000 paid on March 31, 1955, is to be treated by the shareholders as taxable dividends for the taxable year in which such dividend is received. The Y Company will treat the amount of $15,000 as a distribution of the earnings or profits of the company for the taxable year 1954, and the remaining $50,000 as a distribution of the earnings or profits for the year 1955. The distribution of $75,000 on October 31, 1955, is, of course, a taxable dividend out of the earnings and profits for the year 1955.
(e)
Notice to shareholders.
Section 855(c) provides that in the case of dividends, with respect to which a regulated investment company has made an election under section 855(a), any notice to shareholders required under subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code, with respect to such amounts, shall be made not later than 45 days (30 days for a taxable year ending before February 26, 1964) after the close of the taxable year in which the distribution is made. Thus, the notice requirements of section 852(b)(3)(C) and paragraph (c) of § 1.852-4 with respect to capital gain dividends, section 853(c) and § 1.853-3 with respect to allowance to shareholder of foreign tax credit, and section 854(b)(2) and § 1.854-2 with respect to the amount of a distribution which may be treated as a dividend, may be satisfied with respect to amounts to which section 855(a) and this section apply if the notice relating to such amounts is mailed to the shareholders not later than 45 days (30 days for a taxable year ending before February 26, 1964) after the close of the taxable year in which the distribution is made. If the notice under section 855(c) relates to an election with respect to any capital gain dividends, such capital gain dividends shall be aggregated by the investment company with the designated capital gain dividends actually paid during the taxable year to which the election applies (not including such dividends with respect to which an election has been made for a prior year under section 855) for the purpose of determining whether the aggregate of the designated capital gain dividends with respect to such taxable year of the company is greater than the excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss of the company. See section 852(b)(3)(C) and paragraph (c) of § 1.852-4.
(f)
Foreign tax election.
Section 855(d) provides that in the case of an election made under section 853 (relating to foreign taxes), the shareholder of the investment company shall consider the foreign income received, and the foreign tax paid, as received and paid, respectively, in the shareholder's taxable year in which distribution is made.

For example, in a taxable year of 310 days, the actual number of days prescribed would be 284
38/73
days (
310/365
of 335). The fractional day is disregarded so that the required condition in such taxable year need exist for only 284 days.
(d)
Rules applicable to status requirements.
For purposes of determining whether an organization meets the conditions and requirements in section 856(a), the following rules shall apply.
(1)
Trustee.
The term “trustee” means a person who holds legal title to the property of the real estate investment trust, and has such rights and powers as will meet the requirement of “centralization of management” under paragraph (c) of § 301.7701-2 of this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration). Thus, the trustee must have continuing exclusive authority over the management of the trust, the conduct of its affairs, and (except as limited by section 856(d)(3)
and § 1.856-4) the management and disposition of the trust property. For example, such authority will be considered to exist even though the trust instrument grants to the shareholders any or all of the following rights and powers: To elect or remove trustees; to terminate the trust; and to ratify amendments to the trust instrument proposed by the trustee. The existence of a mere fiduciary relationship does not, in itself, make one a trustee for purposes of section 856(a)(1). The trustee will be considered to hold legal title to the property of the trust, for purposes of this subparagraph, whether the title is held in the name of the trust itself, in the name of one or more of the trustees, or in the name of a nominee for the exclusive benefit of the trust.
(2)
Beneficial ownership.
Beneficial ownership shall be evidenced by transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest, and (subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section) must be held by 100 or more persons, determined without reference to any rules of attribution. Provisions in the trust instrument or corporate charter or bylaws which permit the trustee or directors to redeem shares or to refuse to transfer shares in any case where the trustee or directors, in good faith, believe that a failure to redeem shares or that a transfer of shares would result in the loss of status as a real estate investment trust will not render the shares “nontransferable.” For purposes of the regulations under part II of subchapter M, the terms “stockholder,” “stockholders,” “shareholder,” and “shareholders” include holders of beneficial interest in a real estate investment trust, the terms “stock,” “shares,” and “shares of stock” include certificates of beneficial interest, and the term “shares” includes shares of stock.
(3)
Unincorporated organization taxable as a domestic corporation.
The determination of whether an unincorporated organization would be taxable as a domestic corporation, in the absence of the provisions of part II of subchapter M, shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 7701(a) (3) and (4) and the regulations thereunder and for such purposes an otherwise qualified real estate investment trust is deemed to satisfy the “objective to carry on business” requirement of paragraph (a) of § 301.7701-2 of this chapter. (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
(4)
Property held for sale to customers.
In the case of a taxable year beginning before October 5, 1976, a real estate investment trust may not hold any property (other than foreclosure property) primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business. Whether property is held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the trade or business of a real estate investment trust depends upon the facts and circumstances in each case.
(5)
Personal holding company.
A corporation, trust, or association, even though it may otherwise meet the requirements of part II of subchapter M, will not be a real estate investment trust if, by considering all of its gross income as personal holding company income under section 543, it would be a personal holding company as defined in section 542. Thus, if at any time during the last half of the trust's taxable year more than 50 percent in value of its outstanding stock is owned (directly or indirectly under the provisions of section 544) by or for not more than 5 individuals, the stock ownership requirement in section 542(a)(2) will be met and the trust would be a personal holding company. See § 1.857-8, relating to record requirements for purposes of determining whether the trust is a personal holding company.
(e)
Other rules applicable.
To the extent that other provisions of chapter 1 of the Code are not inconsistent with those under part II of subchapter M there of and the regulations thereunder, such provisions will apply with respect to both the real estate investment trust and its shareholders in the same manner that they would apply to any other organization which would be taxable as a domestic corporation. For example:
(1) Taxable income of a real estate investment trust is computed in the same manner as that of a domestic corporation;
(2) Section 301, relating to distributions of property, applies to distributions by a real estate investment trust
in the same manner as it would apply to a domestic corporation;
(3) Sections 302, 303, 304, and 331 are applicable in determining whether distributions by a real estate investment trust are to be treated as in exchange for stock;
(4) Section 305 applies to distributions by a real estate investment trust of its own stock;
(5) Section 311 applies to distributions by a real estate investment trust;
(6) Except as provided in section 857(d), earnings and profits of a real estate investment trust are computed in the same manner as in the case of a domestic corporation;
(7) Section 316, relating to the definition of a dividend, applies to distributions by a real estate investment trust; and
(8) Section 341, relating to collapsible corporations, applies to gain on the sale or exchange of, or a distribution which is in exchange for, stock in a real estate investment trust in the same manner that it would apply to a domestic corporation.
(f)
Unincorporated status required for certain taxable years.
In the case of a taxable year beginning before October 5, 1976, a real estate investment trust must be an unincorporated trust or unincorporated association. Accordingly, in applying the regulations under part II of subchapter M of the Code with respect to such a taxable year, the term “an unincorporated trust or unincorporated association” is to be substituted for the term “a corporation, trust, or association” each place it appears, and the references to “directors” and “corporate charter or bylaws” are to be disregarded.

[T.D. 6598, 27 FR 4082, Apr. 28, 1962, as amended by T.D. 6928, 32 FR 13221, Sept. 19, 1967; T.D. 7767, 46 FR 11265, Feb. 6, 1981]
§ 1.856-2
Limitations.
(a)
Effective date.
The provisions of part II, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder apply only to taxable years of a real estate investment trust beginning after December 31, 1960.
(b)
Election.
Under the provisions of section 856(c)(1), a trust, even though it satisfies the other requirements of part II of subchapter M for the taxable year, will not be considered a “real estate investment trust” for such year, within the meaning of such part II, unless it elects to be a real estate investment trust for such taxable year, or has made such an election for a previous taxable year which has not been terminated or revoked under section 856(g)(1) or (2). The election shall be made by the trust by computing taxable income as a real estate investment trust in its return for the first taxable year for which it desires the election to apply, even though it may have otherwise qualified as a real estate investment trust for a prior year. No other method of making such election is permitted. An election cannot be revoked with respect to a taxable year beginning before October 5, 1976. Thus, the failure of an organization to be a qualified real estate investment trust for a taxable year beginning before October 5, 1976, does not have the effect of revoking a prior election by the organization to be a real estate investment trust, even though the organization is not taxable under part II of subchapter M for such taxable year. See section 856(g) and § 1.856-8 for rules under which an election may be revoked with respect to taxable years beginning after October 4, 1976.
(c)
Gross income requirements.
Section 856(c) (2), (3), and (4), provides that a corporation, trust, or association is not a “real estate investment trust” for a taxable year unless it meets certain requirements with respect to the sources of its gross income for the taxable year. In determining whether the gross income of a real estate investment trust satisfies the percentage requirements of section 856(c) (2), (3), and (4), the following rules shall apply:
(1)
Gross income.
For purposes of both the numerator and denominator in the
computation of the specified percentages, the term “gross income” has the same meaning as that term has under section 61 and the regulations thereunder. Thus, in determining the gross income requirements under section 856(c) (2), (3), and (4), a loss from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities, real property, etc. does not enter into the computation.
(2)
Lapse of options.
Under section 856(c)(6)(C), the term “interests in real property” includes options to acquire land or improvements thereon, and options to acquire leaseholds of land and improvements thereon. However, where a corporation, trust, or association writes an option giving the holder the right to acquire land or improvements thereon, or writes an option giving the holder the right to acquire a leasehold of land or improvements thereon, any income that the corporation, trust, or association recognizes because the option expires unexercised is not considered to be gain from the sale or other disposition of real property (including interests in real property) for purposes of section 856(c) (2)(D) and (3)(C). The rule in the preceding sentence also applies for purposes of section 856(c)(4)(C) in determining gain from the sale or other disposition of real property for the 30-percent-of-gross-income limitation.
(3)
Commitment fees.
For purposes of section 856(c) (2)(G) and (3)(G), if consideration is received or accrued for an agreement to make a loan secured by a mortgage covering both real property and other property, or for an agreement to purchase or lease both real property and other property, an apportionment of the consideration is required. The apportionment of consideration received or accrued for an agreement to make a loan secured by a mortgage covering both real property and other property shall be made under the principles of § 1.856-5(c), relating to the apportionment of interest income.
(4)
Holding period of property.
For purposes of the 30-percent limitation of section 856(c)(4), the determination of the period for which property described in such section has been held is governed by the provisions of section 1223 and the regulations thereunder.
(5)
Rents from real property and interest.
See §§ 1.856-4 and 1.856-5 for rules relating to rents from real property and interest.
(d)
Diversification of investment requirements
—(1)
75-percent test.
Section 856(c)(5)(A) requires that at the close of each quarter of the taxable year at least 75 percent of the value of the total assets of the trust be represented by one or more of the following:
(i) Real estate assets;
(ii) Government securities; and
(iii) Cash and cash items (including receivables).
For purposes of this subparagraph the term “receivables” means only those receivables which arise in the ordinary course of the trust's operation and does not include receivables purchased from another person. Subject to the limitations in section 856(c)(5)(B) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the character of the remaining 25 percent (or less) of the value of the total assets is not restricted.
(2)
Limitations on certain securities.
Under section 856(c)(5)(B), not more than 25 percent of the value of the total assets of the trust may be represented by securities other than those described in section 856(c)(5)(A). The ownership of securities under the 25-percent limitation in section 856(c)(5)(B) is further limited in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater in value than 5 percent of the value of the total assets of the trust and to not more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer. Thus, if the real estate investment trust meets the 75-percent asset diversification requirement in section 856(c)(5)(A), it will also meet the first test under section 856(c)(5)(B) since it will, of necessity, have not more than 25 percent of its total assets represented by securities other than those described in section 856(c)(5)(A). However, the trust must also meet two additional tests under section 856(c)(5)(B), i.e. it cannot own the securities of any one issuer in an amount (i) greater in value than 5 percent of the value of the trust's total assets, or (ii) representing more than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer.
(3)
Determination of investment status.
The term “total assets” means the gross assets of the trust determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In order to determine the effect, if any, which an acquisition of any security or other property may have with respect to the status of a trust as a real estate investment trust, section 856(c)(5) requires a revaluation of the trust's assets at the end of the quarter in which such acquisition was made. A revaluation of assets is not required at the end of any quarter during which there has been no acquisition of a security or other property since the mere change in market value of property held by the trust does not, of itself, affect the status of the trust as a real estate investment trust. A change in the nature of “cash items”, for example, the prepayment of insurance or taxes, does not constitute the acquisition of “other property” for purposes of this subparagraph. A real estate investment trust shall keep sufficient records as to investments so as to be able to show that it has complied with the provisions of section 856(c)(5) during the taxable year. Such records shall be kept at all times available for inspection by any internal revenue officer or employee and shall be retained so long as the contents thereof may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law.
(4)
Illustrations.
The application of section 856(c)(5) and this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Real Estate Investment Trust M, at the close of the first quarter of its taxable year, has its assets invested as follows:
Percent
Cash
6
Government securities
7
Real estate assets
63
Securities of various corporations (not exceeding, with respect to any one issuer, 5 percent of the value of the total assets of the trust nor 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer)
24
Total
100
Trust M meets the requirements of section 856(c)(5) for that quarter of its taxable year.

# Example 2.
Real Estate Investment Trust P, at the close of the first quarter of its taxable year, has its assets invested as follows:
Percent
Cash
6
Government securities
7
Real estate assets
63
Securities of Corporation Z
20
Securities of Corporation X
4
Total
100
Trust P meets the requirement of section 856(c)(5)(A) since at least 75 percent of the value of the total assets is represented by cash, Government securities, and real estate assets. However, Trust P does not meet the diversification requirements of section 856(c)(5)(B) because its investment in the voting securities of Corporation Z exceeds 5 percent of the value of the trust's total assets.

# Example 3.
Real Estate Investment Trust G, at the close of the first quarter of its taxable year, has its assets invested as follows:
Percent
Cash
4
Government securities
9
Real estate assets
70
Securities of Corporation S
5
Securities of Corporation L
4
Securities of Corporation U
4
Securities of Corporation M (which equals 25 percent of Corporation M's outstanding voting securities)
4
Total
100
Trust G meets the 75-percent requirement of section 856(c)(5)(A), but does not meet the requirements of section 856(c)(5)(B) because its investment in the voting securities of Corporation M exceeds 10 percent of Corporation M's outstanding voting securities.

# Example 4.
Real Estate Investment Trust R, at the close of the first quarter of its taxable year (i.e. calendar year), is a qualified real estate investment trust and has its assets invested as follows:
Cash
$5,000
Government securities
4,000
Receivables
4,000
Real estate assets
68,000
Securities of Corporation P
4,000
Securities of Corporation O
5,000
Securities of Corporation U
5,000
Securities of Corporation T
5,000
Total assets
100,000
During the second calendar quarter the stock in Corporation P increases in value to $50,000 while the value of the remaining assets has not changed. If Real Estate Investment Trust R has made no acquisition of stock or other property during such second quarter it will not lose its status as a real estate investment trust merely by reason of the appreciation in the value of P's stock. If, during the third quarter, Trust R acquires
stock of Corporation S worth $2,000, such acquisition will necessitate a revaluation of all of the assets of Trust R as follows:
Cash
$3,000
Government securities
4,000
Receivables
4,000
Real estate assets
68,000
Securities in Corporation P
50,000
Securities in Corporation O
5,000
Securities in Corporation U
5,000
Securities in Corporation T
5,000
Securities in Corporation S
2,000
Total assets
146,000
Because of the discrepancy between the value of its various investments and the 25-percent limitation in section 856(c)(5), resulting in part from the acquisition of the stock of Corporation S, Trust R, at the end of the third quarter, loses its status as a real estate investment trust. However, if Trust R, within 30 days after the close of such quarter, eliminates the discrepancy so that it meets the 25-percent limitation, the trust will be considered to have met the requirements of section 856(c)(5) at the close of the third quarter, even though the discrepancy between the value of its investment in Corporation P and the 5-percent limitation in section 856(c)(5) (resulting solely from appreciation) may still exist. If instead of acquiring stock of Corporation S, Trust R had acquired additional stock of Corporation P, then because of the discrepancy between the value of its investments and both the 5-percent and the 25-percent limitations in section 856(c)(5) resulting in part from this acquisition, trust R, at the end of the third quarter, would lose its status as a real estate investment trust, unless within 30 days after the close of such quarter both of the discrepancies are eliminated.

# Example 5.
If, in the previous example, the stock of Corporation P appreciates only to $10,000 during the second quarter and, in the third quarter, Trust R acquires stock of Corporation S worth $1,000, the assets as of the end of the third quarter would be as follows:
Cash
$4,000
Government securities
4,000
Receivables
4,000
Real estate assets
68,000
Securities in Corporation P
10,000
Securities in Corporation O
5,000
Securities in Corporation U
5,000
Securities in Corporation T
5,000
Securities in Corporation S
1,000
Total assets
106,000
Because the discrepancy between the value of its investment in Corporation P and the 6-percent limitation in section 856(c)(5) results solely from appreciation, and because there is no discrepancy between the value of its various investments and the 25-percent limitation, Trust R, at the end of the third quarter, does not lose its status as a real estate investment trust. If, instead of acquiring stock of Corporation S, Trust R had acquired additional stock of Corporation P worth $1,000, then, because of the discrepancy between the value of its investment in Corporation P and the 5-percent limitation resulting in part from this acquisition, Trust R, at the end of the third quarter, would lose its status as a real estate investment trust, unless within 30 days after the close of such quarter this discrepancy is eliminated.

§ 1.856-3
Definitions.
For purposes of the regulations under part II, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code, the following definitions shall apply.
(a)
Value.
The term “value” means, with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market value of such securities; and with respect to other securities and assets, fair value as determined in good faith by the trustees of the real estate investment trust. In the case of securities of other qualified real estate investment trusts, fair value shall not exceed market value or asset value, whichever is higher.
(b)
Real estate assets
—(1)
In general.
The term “real estate assets” means real property, interests in mortgages on real property (including interests in mortgages on leaseholds of land or improvements thereon), and shares in other qualified real estate investment trusts. The term “mortgages on real property” includes deeds of trust on real property.
(2)
Treatment of REMIC interests as real estate assets
—(i)
In general.
If, for any calendar quarter, at least 95 percent of a REMIC's assets (as determined in accordance with § 1.860F-4(e)(1)(ii) or § 1.6049-7(f)(3)) are real estate assets (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), then, for that
calendar quarter, all the regular and residual interests in that REMIC are treated as real estate assets and, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, any amount includible in gross income with respect to those interests is treated as interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property. If less than 95 percent of a REMIC's assets are real estate assets, then the real estate investment trust is treated as holding directly its proportionate share of the assets and as receiving directly its proportionate share of the income of the REMIC. See §§ 1.860F-4(e)(1)(ii)(B) and 1.6049-7(f)(3) for information required to be provided to regular and residual interest holders if the 95-percent test is not met.
(ii)
Treatment of REMIC assets for section 856 purposes
—(A)
Manufactured housing treated as real estate asset.
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the term “real estate asset” includes manufactured housing treated as a single family residence under section 25(e)(10).
(B)
Status of cash flow investments.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), cash flow investments (as defined in section 860G(a)(6) and § 1.860G-2(g)(1)) are real estate assets.
(iii)
Certain contingent interest payment obligations held by a REIT.
If a REIT holds a residual interest in a REMIC for a principal purpose of avoiding the limitation set out in section 856(f) (concerning interest based on mortgagor net profits) or section 856(j) (concerning shared appreciation provisions), then, even if the REMIC satisfies the 95-percent test of paragraph (b)(i) of this section, the REIT is treated as receiving directly the REMIC's items of income for purposes of section 856.
(c)
Interests in real property.
The term “interests in real property” includes fee ownership and co-ownership of land or improvements thereon, leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, options to acquire land or improvements thereon, and options to acquire leaseholds of land or improvements thereon. The term also includes timeshare interests that represent an undivided fractional fee interest, or undivided leasehold interest, in real property, and that entitle the holders of the interests to the use and enjoyment of the property for a specified period of time each year. The term also includes stock held by a person as a tenant-stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation (as those terms are defined in section 216). Such term does not, however, include mineral, oil, or gas royalty interests, such as a retained economic interest in coal or iron ore with respect to which the special provisions of section 631(c) apply.
(d)
Real property.
See § 1.856-10 for the definition of
real property.
A regulation that adopts the definition of real property in this paragraph is to be interpreted as if it had referred to § 1.856-10.
(e)
Securities.
The term “securities” does not include “interests in real property” or “real estate assets” as those terms are defined in section 856 and this section.
(f)
Qualified real estate investment trusts.
The term “qualified real estate investment trust” means a real estate investment trust within the meaning of part II of subchapter M which is taxable under such part as a real estate investment trust. For purposes of the 75-percent requirement in section 856(c)(5)(A), the trust whose stock has been included by another trust as “real estate assets” must be a “qualified real estate investment trust” for its full taxable year in which falls the close of each quarter of the trust's taxable year for which the computation is made. For example, Real Estate Investment Trust Z for its taxable year ending December 31, 1963, holds as “real estate assets” stock in Real Estate Investment Trust Y, which is also on a calendar year. If Trust Y is not a qualified real estate investment trust for its full taxable year ending December 31, 1963, Trust Z may not include the stock of Trust Y as “real estate assets” in computing the 75-percent requirement as of the close of any quarter of its taxable year ending December 31, 1963.
(g)
Partnership interest.
In the case of a real estate investment trust which is a partner in a partnership, as defined in section 7701(a)(2) and the regulations thereunder, the trust will be deemed to own its proportionate share of each of the assets of the partnership and will be deemed to be entitled to the income of the partnership attributable to such
share. For purposes of section 856, the interest of a partner in the partnership's assets shall be determined in accordance with his capital interest in the partnership. The character of the various assets in the hands of the partnership and items of gross income of the partnership shall retain the same character in the hands of the partners for all purposes of section 856. Thus, for example, if the trust owns a 30-percent capital interest in a partnership which owns a piece of rental property the trust will be treated as owning 30 percent of such property and as being entitled to 30 percent of the rent derived from the property by the partnership. Similarly, if the partnership holds any property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business, the trust will be treated as holding its proportionate share of such property primarily for such purpose. Also, for example, where a partnership sells real property or a trust sells its interest in a partnership which owns real property, any gross income realized from such sale, to the extent that it is attributable to the real property, shall be deemed gross income from the sale or disposition of real property held for either the period that the partnership has held the real property of the period that the trust was a member of the partnership, whichever is the shorter.
(h)
Net capital gain.
The term “net capital gain” means the excess of the net long-term capital gain for the taxable year over the net short-term capital loss for the taxable year.

§ 1.856-4
Rents from real property.
(a)
In general.
Subject to the exceptions of section 856(d) and paragraph (b) of this section, the term “rents from real property” means, generally, the gross amounts received for the use of, or the right to use, real property of the real estate investment trust.
(b)
Amounts specifically included or excluded
—(1)
Charges for customary services.
For taxable years beginning after October 4, 1976, the term “rents from real property”, for purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 856(c), includes charges for services customarily furnished or rendered in connection with the rental of real property, whether or not the charges are separately stated. Services furnished to the tenants of a particular building will be considered as customary if, in the geographic market in which the building is located, tenants in buildings which are of a similar class (such as luxury apartment buildings) are customarily provided with the service. The furnishing of water, heat, light, and air-conditioning, the cleaning of windows, public entrances, exits, and lobbies, the performance of general maintenance and of janitorial and cleaning services, the collection of trash, and the furnishing of elevator services, telephone answering services, incidental storage space, laundry equipment, watchman or guard services, parking facilities, and swimming pool facilities are examples of services which are customarily furnished to the tenants of a particular class of buildings in many geographic marketing areas. Where it is customary, in a particular geographic marketing area, to furnish electricity or other utilities to tenants in buildings of a particular class, the submetering of such utilities to tenants in such buildings will be considered a customary service. To qualify as a service customarily furnished, the service must be furnished or rendered to the tenants of the real estate investment trust or, primarily for the convenience or benefit of the tenant, to the guests, customers, or subtenants of the tenant. The service must be furnished through an independent contractor from whom the trust does not derive or receive any income. See paragraph (b)(5) of this section. For taxable years beginning
before October 5, 1976, the rules in paragraph (b)(3) of 26 CFR 1.856-4 (revised as of April 1, 1977), relating to the furnishing of services, shall continue to apply.
(2)
Amounts received with respect to certain personal property
—(i)
In general.
In the case of taxable years beginning after October 4, 1976, rent attributable to personal property that is leased under, or in connection with, the lease of real property is treated under section 856(d)(1)(C) as “rents from real property” (and thus qualified for purposes of the income source requirements) if the rent attributable to the personal property is not more than 15 percent of the total rent received or accrued under the lease for the taxable year. If, however, the rent attributable to personal property is greater than 15 percent of the total rent received or accrued under the lease for the taxable year, then the portion of the rent from the lease that is attributable to personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property”.
(ii)
Application.
In general, the 15-percent test in section 856(d)(1)(C) is applied separately to each lease of real property. However, where the real estate investment trust rents all (or a portion of all) the units in a multiple unit project under substantially similar leases (such as the leasing of apartments in an apartment building or complex to individual tenants), the 15-percent test may be applied with respect to the aggregate rent received or accrued for the taxable year under the similar leases of the property, by using the average of the trust's aggregate adjusted bases of all of the personal property subject to such leases, and the average of the trust's aggregate adjusted bases of all real and personal property subject to such leases. A lease of a furnished apartment is not considered to be substantially similar to a lease of an unfurnished apartment (including an apartment where the trust provides only personal property, such as major appliances, that is commonly provided by a landlord in connection with the rental of unfurnished living quarters).
(iii)
Taxable years beginning before October 5, 1976.
In the case of taxable years beginning before October 5, 1976, any amount of rent that is attributable to personal property does not qualify as rent from real property.
(3)
Disqualification of rent which depends on income or profits of any person.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, no amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, with respect to any real property (or personal property leased under, or in connection with, real property) qualifies as “rents from real property” where the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits derived by any person from the property. However, any amount so accrued or received shall not be excluded from the term “rents from real property” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales (whether or not receipts or sales are adjusted for returned merchandise, or Federal, State, or local sales taxes). Thus, for example, “rents from real property” would include rents where the lease provides for differing percentages or receipts or sales from different departments or from separate floors of a retail store so long as each percentage is fixed at the time of entering into the lease and a change in such percentage is not renegotiated during the term of the lease (including any renewal periods of the lease, in a manner which has the effect of basing the rent on income of profits. See paragraph (b)(6) of this section for rules relating to certain amounts received or accrued by a trust which are considered to be based on the income or profits of a sublessee of the prime tenant. The amount received or accrued as rent for the taxable year which is based on a fixed percentage or percentages of the lessee's receipts or sales reduced by escalation receipts (including those determined under a formula clause) will qualify as “rents from real property”. Escalation receipts include amounts received by a prime tenant from subtenants by reason of an agreement that rent shall be increased to reflect all or a portion of an increase in real estate taxes, property insurance, operating costs of the prime tenant, or similar items customarily included in lease escalation clauses. Where in accordance with the
terms of an agreement an amount received or accrued as rent for the taxable year includes both a fixed rental and a percentage of all or a portion of the lessee's income or profits, neither the fixed rental nor the additional amount will qualify as “rents from real property”. However, where the amount received or accrued for the taxable year under such an agreement includes only the fixed rental, the determination of which does not depend in whole or in part on the income or profits derived by the lessee, such amount may qualify as “rents from real property”. An amount received or accrued as rent for the taxable year which consists, in whole or in part, of one or more percentages of the lessee's receipts or sales in excess of determinable dollar amounts may qualify as “rents from real property”, but only if two conditions exist. First, the determinable amounts must not depend in whole or in part on the income or profits of the lessee. Second, the percentages and, in the case of leases entered into after July 7, 1978, the determinable amounts, must be fixed at the time the lease is entered into and a change in percentages and determinable amounts is not renegotiated during the term of the lease (including any renewal periods of the lease) in a manner which has the effect of basing rent on income or profits. In any event, an amount will not qualify as “rents from real property” if, considering the lease and all the surrounding circumstances, the arrangement does not conform with normal business practice but is in reality used as a means of basing the rent on income or profits. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A real estate investment trust owns land underlying an office building. On January 1, 1975, the trust leases the land for 50 years to a prime tenant for an annual rental of $100x plus 20 percent of the prime tenant's annual gross receipts from the office building in excess of a fixed base amount of $5,000x and 10 percent of such gross receipts in excess of $10,000x. For this purpose the lease defines gross receipts as all amounts received by the prime tenant from occupancy tenants pursuant to leases of space in the office building reduced by the amount by which real estate taxes, property insurance, and operating costs related to the office building for a particular year exceed the amount of such items for 1974. The exclusion from gross receipts of increases since 1974 in real estate taxes, property insurance, and other expenses relating to the office building reflects the fact that the prime tenant passes on to occupancy tenants by way of a customary lease escalation provision the risk that such expenses might increase during the term of an occupancy lease. The exclusion from gross receipts of these expense escalation items will not cause the rental received by the real estate investment trust from the prime tenant to fail to qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of section 856(c).
(4)
Disqualification of amounts received from persons owned in whole or in part by the trust.
“Rents from real property” does not include any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, from any person in which the real estate investment trust owns, at any time during the taxable year, the specified percentage or number of shares of stock (or interest in the assets or net profits) of that person. Any amount received from such person will not qualify as “rents from real property” if such person is a corporation and the trust owns 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of its stock entitled to vote or 10 percent or more of the total number of shares of all classes of its outstanding stock, or if such person is not a corporation and the trust owns a 10-percent-or-more interest in its assets or net profits. For example, a trust leases an office building to a tenant for which it receives rent of $100,000 for the taxable year 1962. The lessee of the building subleases space to various subtenants for which it receives gross rent of $500,000 for the year 1962. The trust owns 15 percent of the total assets of an unincorporated subtenant. The rent paid by this subtenant for the taxable year is $50,000. Therefore, $10,000 (50,000/500,000 × $100,000) of the rent paid to the trust does not qualify as “rents from real property”. Where the real estate investment trust receives, directly or indirectly, any amount of rent from any person in which it owns any proprietary interest, the trust shall submit, at the time it files its return for the taxable year (or before June 1, 1962, whichever is later), a schedule setting forth—
(i) The name and address of such person and the amount received as rent from such person; and
(ii) If such person is a corporation, the highest percentage of the total combined voting power of all classes of its stock entitled to vote, and the highest percentage of the total number of shares of all classes of its outstanding stock, owned by the trust at any time during the trust's taxable year; or
(iii) If such person is not a corporation, the highest percentage of the trust's interest in the assets or net profits of such person, owned by the trust at any time during its taxable year.
(5)
Furnishing of services or management of property must be through an independent contractor
—(i)
In general.
No amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, with respect to any real property (or any personal property leased under, or in connection with, the real property) qualifies as “rents from real property” if the real estate investment trust furnishes or renders services to the tenants of the property or manages or operates the property, other than through an independent contractor from whom the trust itself does not derive or receive any income. The prohibition against the trust deriving or receiving any income from the independent contractor applies regardless of the source from which the income was derived by the independent contractor. Thus, for example, the trust may not receive any dividends from the independent contractor. The requirement that the trust not receive any income from an independent contractor requires that the relationship between the two be an arm's-length relationship. The independent contractor must be adequately compensated for any services which are performed for the trust. Compensation to an independent contractor determined by reference to an unadjusted percentage of gross rents will generally be considered to be adequate where the percentage is reasonable taking into account the going rate of compensation for managing similar property in the same locality, the services rendered, and other relevant factors. The independent contractor must not be an employee of the trust (
i.e.,
the manner in which he carries out his duties as independent contractor must not be subject to the control of the trust). Although the cost of services which are customarily rendered or furnished in connection with the rental of real property may be borne by the trust, the services must be furnished or rendered through an independent contractor. Furthermore, the facilities through which the services are furnished must be maintained and operated by an independent contractor. For example, if a heating plant is located in the building, it must be maintained and operated by an independent contractor. To the extent that services (other than those customarily furnished or rendered in connection with the rental of real property) are rendered to the tenants of the property by the independent contractor, the cost of the services must be borne by the independent contractor, a separate charge must be made for the services, the amount of the separate charge must be received and retained by the independent contractor, and the independent contractor must be adequately compensated for the services.
(ii)
Trustee or director functions.
The trustees or directors of the real estate investment trust are not required to delegate or contract out their fiduciary duty to manage the trust itself, as distinguished from rendering or furnishing services to the tenants of its property or managing or operating the property. Thus, the trustees or directors may do all those things necessary, in their fiduciary capacities, to manage and conduct the affairs of the trust itself. For example, the trustees or directors may establish rental terms, choose tenants, enter into and renew leases, and deal with taxes, interest, and insurance, relating to the trust's property. The trustees or directors may also make capital expenditures with respect to the trust's property (as defined in section 263) and may make decisions as to repairs of the trust's property (of the type which would be deductible under section 162), the cost of which may be borne by the trust.
(iii)
Independent contractor defined.
The term “independent contractor” means—
(
a
) A person who does not own, directly or indirectly, at any time during
the trust's taxable year more than 35 percent of the shares in the real estate investment trust, or
(
b
) A person—
(
1
) If a corporation, not more than 35 percent of the total combined voting power of whose stock (or 35 percent of the total shares of all classes of whose stock), or
(
2
) If not a corporation, not more than 35 percent of the interest in whose assets or net profits is owned, directly or indirectly, at any time during the trust's taxable year by one or more persons owning at any time during such taxable year 35 percent or more of the shares in the trust.
(iv)
Information required.
The real estate investment trust shall submit with its return for the taxable year (or before June 1, 1962, whichever is later) a statement setting forth the name and address of each independent contractor; and
(
a
) The highest percentage of the outstanding shares in the trust owned at any time during its taxable year by such independent contractor and by any person owning at any time during such taxable year any shares of stock or interest in the independent contractor.
(
b
) If the independent contractor is a corporation such statement shall set forth the highest percentage of the total combined voting power of its stock and the highest percentage of the total number of shares of all classes of its stock owned at any time during its taxable year by any person owning shares in the trust at any time during such taxable year.
(
c
) If the independent contractor is not a corporation such statement shall set forth the highest percentage of any interest in its assets or net profits owned at any time during its taxable year by any person owning shares in the trust at any time during such taxable year.
(6)
Amounts based on income or profits of subtenants.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section, if a trust leases real property to a tenant under terms other than solely on a fixed sum rental (for example, a percentage of the tenant's gross receipts), and the tenant subleases all or a part of such property under an agreement which provides for a rental based in whole or in part on the income or profits of the sublessee, the entire amount of the rent received by the trust from the prime tenant with respect to such property is disqualified as “rents from real property”.
(ii)
Exception.
For taxable years beginning after October 4, 1976, section 856(d)(4) provides an exception to the general rule that amounts received or accrued, directly or indirectly, by a real estate investment trust do not qualify as rents from real property if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits derived by any person from the property. This exception applies where the trust rents property to a tenant (the prime tenant) for a rental which is based, in whole or in part, on a fixed percentage or percentages of the receipts or sales of the prime tenant, and the rent which the trust receives or accrues from the prime tenant pursuant to the lease would not qualify as “rents from real property” solely because the prime tenant receives or accrues from subtenants (including concessionaires) rents or other amounts based on the income or profits derived by a person from the property. Under the exception, only a proportionate part of the rent received or accrued by the trust does not qualify as “rents from real property”. The proportionate part of the rent received or accrued by the trust which is non-qualified is the lesser of the following two amounts:
(A) The rent received or accrued by the trust from the prime tenant pursuant to the lease, that is based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales, or
(B) The product determined by multiplying the total rent which the trust receives or accrues from the prime tenant pursuant to the lease by a fraction, the numerator of which is the rent or other amount received by the prime tenant that is based, in whole or in part, on the income or profits derived by any person from the property, and the denominator of which is the total rent or other amount received by the prime tenant from the property. For example, assume that a real estate investment trust owns land underlying a
shopping center. The trust rents the land to the owner of the shopping center for an annual rent of $10x plus 2 percent of the gross receipts which the prime tenant receives from subtenants who lease space in the shopping center. Assume further that, for the year in question, the prime tenant derives total rent from the shopping center of $100x and, of that amount, $25x is received from subtenants whose rent is based, in whole or in part, on the income or profits derived from the property. Accordingly, the trust will receive a total rent of $12x, of which $2x is based on a percentage of the gross receipts of the prime tenant. The portion of the rent which is disqualified is the lesser of $2x (the rent received by the trust which is based on a percentage of gross receipts), or $3x, ($12x multiplied by $25x/$100x). Accordingly, $10x of the rent received by the trust qualifies as “rents from real property” and $2x does not qualify.
(7)
Attribution rules.
Paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 856(d) relate to direct or indirect ownership of stock, assets, or net profits by the persons described therein. For purposes of determining such direct or indirect ownership, the rules prescribed by section 318(a) (for determining the ownership of stock) shall apply except that “10 percent” shall be substituted for “50 percent” in section 318(a) (2)(C) and (3)(C).

§ 1.856-5
Interest.
(a)
In general.
In computing the percentage requirements in section 856(c) (2)(B) and (3)(B), the term “interest” includes only an amount which constitutes compensation for the use or forbearance of money. For example, a fee received or accrued by a lender which is in fact a charge for services performed for a borrower rather than a charge for the use of borrowed money is not includable as interest.
(b)
Where amount depends on income or profits of any person.
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, with respect to an obligation is not includable as interest for purposes of section 856(c) (2)(B) and (3)(B) if, under the principles set forth in paragraphs (b)(3) and (6)(i) of § 1.856-4, the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person (whether or not derived from property secured by the obligation). Thus, for example, if in accordance with a loan agreement an amount is received or accrued by the trust with respect to an obligation which includes both a fixed amount of interest and a percentage of the borrower's income or profits, neither the fixed interest nor the amount based upon the percentage will qualify as interest for purposes of section 856(c) (2)(B) and (3)(B). This paragraph and paragraph (d) of this section apply only to amounts received or accrued in taxable years beginning after October 4, 1976, pursuant to loans made after May 27, 1976. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a loan is considered to be made before May 28, 1976, if it is made pursuant to a binding commitment entered into before May 28, 1976.
(c)
Apportionment of interest
—(1)
In general.
Where a mortgage covers both real property and other property, an apportionment of the interest income must be made for purposes of the 75-percent requirement of section 856(c)(3). For purposes of the 75-percent requirement, the apportionment shall be made as follows:
(i) If the loan value of the real property is equal to or exceeds the amount of the loan, then the entire interest income shall be apportioned to the real property.
(ii) If the amount of the loan exceeds the loan value of the real property, then the interest income apportioned to the real property is an amount equal to the interest income multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the loan value of the real property, and the
denominator of which is the amount of the loan. The interest income apportioned to the other property is an amount equal to the excess of the total interest income over the interest income apportioned to the real property.
(2)
Loan value.
For purposes of this paragraph, the loan value of the real property is the fair market value of the property, determined as of the date on which the commitment by the trust to make the loan becomes binding on the trust. In the case of a loan purchased by the trust, the loan value of the real property is the fair market value of the property, determined as of the date on which the commitment by the trust to purchase the loan becomes binding on the trust. However, in the case of a construction loan or other loan made for purposes of improving or developing real property, the loan value of the real property is the fair market value of the land plus the reasonably estimated cost of the improvements or developments (other than personal property) which will secure the loan and which are to be constructed from the proceeds of the loan. The fair market value of the land and the reasonably estimated cost of improvements or developments shall be determined as of the date on which a commitment to make the loan becomes binding on the trust. If the trust does not make the construction loan but commits itself to provide long-term financing following completion of construction, the loan value of the real property is determined by using the principles for determining the loan value for a construction loan. Moreover, if the mortgage on the real property is given as additional security (or as a substitute for other security) for the loan after the trust's commitment is binding, the real property loan value is its fair market value when it becomes security for the loan (or, if earlier, when the borrower makes a binding commitment to add or substitute the property as security).
(3)
Amount of loan.
For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of the loan means the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during the taxable year.
(d)
Exception.
Section 856(f)(2) provides an exception to the general rule that amounts received, directly or indirectly, with respect to an obligation do not qualify as “interest” where the determination of the amounts depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person. The exception applies where the trust receives or accrues, with respect to the obligation of its debtor, an amount that is based in whole or in part on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales of the debtor, and the amount would not qualify as interest solely because the debtor has receipts or sale proceeds that are based on the income or profits of any person. Under this exception only a proportionate part of the amount received or accrued by the trust fails to qualify as interest for purposes of the percentage-of-income requirements of section 856(c) (2) and (3). The proportionate part of the amount received or accrued by the trust that is non-qualified is the lesser of the following two amounts:
(1) The amount received or accrued by the trust from the debtor with respect to the obligation that is based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales, or
(2) The product determined by multiplying by a fraction the total amount received or accrued by the trust from the debtor with respect to the obligation. The numerator of the fraction is the amount of receipts or sales of the debtor that is based, in whole or in part, on the income or profits of any person and the denominator is the total amount of the receipts or sales of the debtor. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the only receipts or sales to be taken into account are those taken into account in determining the payment to the trust pursuant to the loan agreement.

§ 1.856-6
Foreclosure property.
(a)
In general.
Under section 856(e) a real estate investment trust may make an irrevocable election to treat as “foreclosure property” certain real property (including interests in real property), and any personal property incident to the real property, acquired by the trust after December 31, 1973. This section prescribes rules relating to the election, including rules relating to property eligible for the election. This section also prescribes rules relating to extensions of the general two-year period (hereinafter the “grace period”) during which property retains its status as foreclosure property, as well as rules relating to early termination of the grace period under section 856(e)(4). The election to treat property as foreclosure property does not alter the character of the income derived therefrom (other than for purposes of section 856(c)(2)(F) and (3)(F)). For example, if foreclosure property is sold, the determination of whether it is property described in section 1221(1) will not be affected by the fact that it is foreclosure property.
(b)
Property eligible for the election
—(1)
Rules relating to acquisitions.
In general, the trust must acquire the property after December 31, 1973, as the result of having bid in the property at foreclosure, or having otherwise reduced the property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law, after there was default (or default was imminent) on a lease of the property (where the trust was the lessor) or on an indebtedness owed to the trust which the property secured. Foreclosure property which secured an indebtedness owed to the trust is acquired for purposes of section 856(e) on the date on which the trust acquires ownership of the property for Federal income tax purposes. Foreclosure property which a trust owned and leased to another is acquired for purposes of section 856(e) on the date on which the trust acquires possession of the property from its lessee. A trust will not be considered to have acquired ownership of property for purposes of section 856(e) where it takes control of the property as a mortgagee-in-possession and cannot receive any profit or sustain any loss with respect to the property except as a creditor of the mortgagor. A trust may be considered to have acquired ownership of property for purposes of section 856(e) even through legal title to the property is held by another person. For example, where, upon foreclosure of a mortgage held by the trust, legal title to the property is acquired in the name of a nominee for the exclusive benefit of the trust and the trust is the equitable owner of the property, the trust will be considered to have acquired ownership of the property for purposes of section 856(e). Generally, the fact that under local law the mortgagor has a right of redemption after foreclosure is not relevant in determining whether the trust has acquired ownership of the property for purposes of section 856(e). Property is not ineligible for the election solely because the property, in addition to securing an indebtedness owed to the trust, also secures debts owed to other creditors. Property eligible for the election includes a building or other improvement which has been constructed on land owned by the trust and which is acquired by the trust upon default of a lease of the land.
(2)
Personal property.
Personal property (including personal property not subject to a mortgage or lease of the real property) will be considered incident to a particular item of real property if the personal property is used in a trade or business conducted on the property or the use of the personal property is otherwise an ordinary and necessary corollary of the use to which the real property is put. In the case of a hotel, such items as furniture, appliances, linens, china, food, etc. would be examples of incidental personal property. Personal property incident to the real property is eligible for the election even though it is acquired after the real property is acquired or is placed in the building or other improvement in the course of the completion of construction.
(3)
Property with respect to which default is anticipated.
Property is not eligible for the election to be treated as foreclosure property if the loan or lease with respect to which the default occurs (or is imminent) was made or entered into (or the lease or indebtedness
was acquired) by the trust with an intent to evict or foreclose, or when the trust knew or had reason to know that default would occur (“improper knowledge”). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a trust will not be considered to have improper knowledge with respect to a particular lease or loan, if the lease or loan was made pursuant to a binding commitment entered into by the trust at a time when it did not have improper knowledge. Moreover, if the trust, in an attempt to avoid default or foreclosure, advances additional amounts to the borrower in excess of amounts contemplated in the original loan commitment or modifies the lease or loan, such advance or modification will be considered not to have been made with an intent to evict or foreclose, or with improper knowledge, unless the original loan or lease was entered into with that intent or knowledge.
(c)
Election
—(1)
In general.
(i) An election to treat property as foreclosure property applies to all of the eligible real property acquired in the same taxable year by the trust upon the default (or as a result of the imminence of default) on a particular lease (where the trust is the lessor) or on a particular indebtedness owed to the trust. For example, if a loan made by a trust is secured by two separate tracts of land located in different cities, and in the same taxable year the trust acquires both tracts on foreclosure upon the default (or imminence of default) of the loan, the trust must include both tracts in the election. For a further example, the trust may choose to make a separate election for only one of the tracts if they are acquired in different taxable years or were not security for the same loan. If real property subject to the same election is acquired at different times in the same taxable year, the grace period for a particular property begins when that property is acquired.
(ii) If the trust acquires separate pieces of real property that secure the same indebtedness (or are under the same lease) in different taxable years because the trust delays acquiring one of them until a later taxable year, and the primary purpose for the delay is to include only one of them in an election, then if the trust makes an election for one piece it must also make an election for the other piece. A trust will not be considered to have delayed the acquisition of property for this purpose if there is a legitimate business reason for the delay (such as an attempt to avoid foreclosure by further negotiations with the debtor or lessee).
(iii) All of the eligible personal property incident to the real property must also be included in the election.
(2)
Time for making election.
The election to treat property as foreclosure property must be made on or before the due date (including extensions of time) for filing the trust's income tax return for the taxable year in which the trust acquires the property with respect to which the election is being made, or April 3, 1975, whichever is later.
(3)
Manner of making the election.
An election made after February 6, 1981, shall be made by a statement attached to the income tax return for the taxable year in which the trust acquired the property with respect to which the election is being made. The statement shall indicate that the election is made under section 856(e) and shall identify the property to which the election applies. The statement shall also set forth—
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the trust,
(ii) The date the property was acquired by the trust, and
(iii) A brief description of how the real property was acquired, including the name of the person or persons from whom the real property was acquired and a description of the lease or indebtedness with respect to which default occurred or was imminent.
An election made on or before February 6, 1981 shall be filed in the manner prescribed in 26 CFR 10.1(f) (revised as of April 1, 1977) (temporary regulations relating to the election to treat property as foreclosure property) as in effect when the election is made.
(4)
Status of taxpayer.
In general, a taxpayer may make an election with respect to an acquisition of property only if the taxpayer is a qualified real estate investment trust for the taxable year in which the acquisition occurs. If, however, the taxpayer establishes,
to the satisfaction of the district director for the internal revenue district in which the taxpayer maintains its principal place of business or principal office or agency, that its failure to be a qualified real estate investment trust for a taxable year was to due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the taxpayer may make the election with respect to property acquired in such taxable year. The principles of §§ 1.856.7(c) and 1.856.8(d) (including the principles relating to expert advice) will apply in determining whether, for purposes of this subparagraph, the failure of the taxpayer to be a qualified real estate investment trust for the taxable year in which the property is acquired was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. If a taxpayer makes a valid election to treat property as foreclosure property, the property will not lose its status as foreclosure property solely because the taxpayer is not a qualified real estate investment trust for a subsequent taxable year (including a taxable year which encompasses an extension of the grace period). However, the rules relating to the termination of foreclosure property status in section 856(e)(4) (but not the tax on income from foreclosure property imposed by section 857(b)(4)) apply to the year in which the property is acquired and all subsequent years, even though the taxpayer is not a qualified real estate investment trust for such year.
(d)
Termination of 2-year grace period; subsequent leases
—(1)
In general.
Under section 856(e)(4)(A), all real property (and any incidental personal property) for which a particular election has been made (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section) shall cease to be foreclosure property on the first day (occurring on or after the day on which the trust acquired the property) on which the trust either—
(i) Enters into a lease with respect to any of the property which, by its terms, will give rise to income of the trust which is not described in section 856(c)(3) (other than section 856(c)(3)(F)), or
(ii) Receives or accrues, directly or indirectly, any amount which is not described in section 856(c)(3) (other than section 856(c)(3)(F)) pursuant to a lease with respect to any of the real property entered into by the trust on or after the day the trust acquired the property.
For example, assume the trust acquires, in a particular taxable year, a shopping center upon the default of an indebtedness owed to the trust. Also assume that the trust subsequently enters into a lease with respect to one of several stores in the shopping center that requires the lessee to pay rent to the trust which is not income described in section 856(c)(3) (other than section 856(c)(3)(F)). In such case, the entire shopping center will cease to be foreclosure property on the day the trust enters into the lease.
(2)
Extensions or renewals of leases.
Generally, the extension or renewal of a lease of foreclosure property will be treated as the entering into of a new lease only if the trust has a right to renegotiate the terms of the lease. If, however, by operation of law or by contract, the acquisition of the foreclosure property by the trust terminates a preexisting lease of the property, or gives the trust a right to terminate the lease, then for purposes of section 856(e)(4)(A), a trust, in such circumstances, will not be considered to have entered into a lease with respect to the property solely because the terms of the preexisting lease are continued in effect after foreclosure without substantial modification. The letting of rooms in a hotel or motel does not constitute the entering into a lease for purposes of section 856(e)(4)(A).
(3)
Rent attributable to personal property.
Solely for the purposes of section 856(e)(4)(A), if a trust enters into a lease with respect to real property on or after the day upon which the trust acquires such real property by foreclosure, and a portion of the rent from such lease is attributable to personal property which is foreclosure property incident to such real property, such rent attributable to the incidental personal property will not be considered to terminate the status of such real property (or such incidental personal property) as foreclosure property.
(e)
Termination of 2-year grace period; completion of construction
—(1)
In general.
Under section 856(e)(4)(B), all real property (and any incidental personal
property) for which a particular election has been made (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section) shall cease to be foreclosure property on the first day (occurring on or after the day on which the trust acquired the property) on which any construction takes place on the property, other than completion of a building (or completion of any other improvement) where more than 10 percent of the construction of the building (or other improvement) was completed before default became imminent. If more than one default occurred with respect to an indebtedness or lease in respect of which there is an acquisition, the more-than-10-percent test (including the rule prescribed in this paragraph relating to the test) will not be applied at the time a particular default became imminent if it is clear that the acquisition did not occur as the result of such default. For example, if the debtor fails to make four consecutive payments of principal and interest on the due dates, and the trust takes action to acquire the property securing the debt only after the fourth default becomes imminent, the 10-percent test is applied at the time the fourth default became imminent (even though the trust would not have foreclosed on the property had not all four defaults occurred).
(2)
Determination of percentage of completion.
The determination of whether the construction of a building or other improvement was more than 10 percent complete when default became imminent shall be made by comparing the total direct costs of construction incurred with respect to the building or other improvement as of the date default became imminent with the estimated total direct costs of construction as of such date. If the building or other improvement qualifies as more than 10 percent complete under this method, the building or other improvement shall be considered to be more than 10 percent complete. For purposes of this subparagraph, direct costs of construction include the cost of labor and materials which are directly connected with the construction of the building or improvement.
Thus, for example, direct costs of construction incurred as of the date default became imminent would include amounts paid, or for which liability has been incurred, for labor which has been performed as of such date that is directly connected with the construction of the building or other improvement and for building materials and supplies used or consumed in connection with the construction as of such date. For purposes of applying the 10-percent test the trust may also take into account the cost of building materials and supplies which have been delivered to the construction site as of the date default became imminent and which are to be used or consumed in connection with the construction. On the other hand, architect's fees, administrative costs of the developer or builder, lawyers' fees, and expenses incurred in connection with obtaining zoning approval or building permits are not considered to be direct costs of construction. Any construction by the trust as mortgagee-in-possession is considered to have taken place after default resulting in acquisition of the property became imminent. Generally, the trust's estimate of the total direct costs of completing construction as of the date the default became imminent will be accepted, provided that the estimate is reasonable, in good faith, and is based on all of the data reasonably available to the trust when the trust undertakes completion of construction of the building or other improvement. Appropriate documentation which shows that construction was more than 10 percent complete when default became imminent must be available at the principal place of business of the trust for inspection in connection with an examination of the income tax return. Construction includes the renovation of a building, such as the remodeling of apartments, or the renovation of an apartment building to convert rental units to a condominium. The renovation must be more than 10 percent complete (determined by comparing the total direct cost of the physical renovation which has been incurred when default became imminent with the estimated total direct cost of renovation as of such date) when default became imminent in order for the property not to lose its status as foreclosure property if the trust undertakes the renovation.
(3)
Modification of a building or improvement.
Generally, the terms “building” and “improvement” in section 856(e)(4)(B) mean the building or improvement (including any integral part thereof) as planned by the mortgagor or lessee (or other person in possession of the property, if appropriate) as of the date default became imminent. The trust, however, may estimate the total direct costs of construction and complete the construction of the building or other improvement by modifying the building or other improvement as planned as of the date default became imminent so as to reduce the estimated direct cost of construction of the building or improvement. If the trust does so modify the planned construction of the building or improvement, the 10-percent test is to be applied by comparing the direct costs of construction incurred as of the date default became imminent that are attributable to the building or improvement as modified, with the estimated total direct costs (as of such date) of construction of the building or other improvement as modified. The trust, in order to meet the 10-percent test, may not, however, modify the planned building or improvement by reducing the estimated direct cost of construction to such an extent that the building or improvement is not functional.
Also, the trust may make subsequent modifications which increase the direct cost of construction of the building or improvement if such modifications—
(i) Are required by a Federal, State, or local agency, or
(ii) Are alterations that are either required by a prospective lessee or purchaser as a condition of leasing or buying the property or are necessary for the property to be used for the purpose planned at the time default became imminent.
Subdivision (ii) of the preceding sentence applies, however, only if the building or improvement, as modified, was more than 10 percent complete when default became imminent. A building completed by the trust will not cease to be foreclosure property solely because the building is used in a manner other than that planed by the defaulting mortgagor or lessee. Thus, for example, assume a trust acquired on foreclosure a planned apartment building which was 20 percent complete when default became imminent and that the trust completes the building without modifications which increase the direct cost of construction. The property will not cease to be foreclosure property by reason of section 856(e)(4)(B) solely because the trust sells the dwelling units in the building as condominium units, rather than holding them for rent as planned by the defaulting mortgagor. (See, however, section 856(e)(4)(C) and paragraph (f)(2) of this section for rules relating to the requirement that where foreclosure property is used in a trade or business (including a trade or business of selling the foreclosure property), the trade or business must be conducted through an independent contractor after 90 days after the property is acquired.)
(4)
Application on building-by-building basis.
Generally the more than 10 percent test is to be applied on a building-by-building basis. Thus, for example, if a trust has foreclosed on land held by a developer building a housing subdivision, the trust may complete construction of the houses which were more than 10 percent complete when default became imminent. The trust, however, may not complete construction of houses which were only 10 percent (or less) complete, nor may the trust begin construction of other houses planned for the subdivision on which construction has not begun. The trust, however, may construct an additional building or improvement (whether or not the construction thereof has begun) which is an integral part of another building or other improvement that was more than 10 percent complete when default became imminent if the additional building or improvement and the other building or improvement, taken together as a unit, meet the more than 10 percent test. For purposes of this paragraph, an additional building or other improvement will be considered to be an integral part of another building or improvement if—
(i) It is ancillary to the other building or improvement and its principal intended use is to furnish services or facilities which either supplement the
use of such other building or improvement or are necessary for such other building or improvement to be utilized in the manner or for the purpose for which it is intended, or
(ii) The buildings or improvements are intended to comprise constituent parts of an interdependent group of buildings or other improvements.
However, a building or other improvement will not be considered to be an integral part of another building or improvement unless the buildings or improvements were planned as part of the same overall construction plan or project before default became imminent. An additional building or other improvement (such as, for example, an outdoor swimming pool or a parking garage) may be considered to be an integral part of another building or improvement, even though the additional building or improvement was also intended to be used to provide facilities or services for use in connection with several other buildings or improvements which will not be completed. If the trust chooses not to undertake the construction of an additional building or other improvement which qualifies as an integral part of another building or improvement, so much of the costs of construction (including both the direct costs of construction incurred before the default became imminent and the estimated costs of completion) as are attributable to that “integral part” shall not be taken into account in determining whether any other building or improvement was more than 10 percent complete when default became imminent. For example, assume the trust acquires on foreclosure a property on which the defaulting mortgagor has begun construction of a motel. The motel, as planned by the mortgagor, was to consist of a two-story building containing 30 units, and two detached one-story wings, each of which was to contain 20 units. At the time default became imminent, the defaulting mortgagor had completed more than 10 percent of the construction of the two-story structure but the two wings, an access road, a parking lot, and an outdoor swimming pool planned for the motel were each less than 10 percent complete. The trust may construct the two wings of the motel, the access road, the parking lot, and the swimming pool:
Provided,
That the motel and the other improvements which the trust undertakes to construct, taken together as a unit, were more than 10 percent complete when default became imminent. If, however, the trust chooses not to undertake construction of the swimming pool, the cost of construction attributable to the swimming pool, whether incurred before default became imminent or estimated as the cost of completion, shall not be taken into account in determining whether the trust can complete construction of the other buildings and improvements. For another example, assume that the trust acquires a planned shopping center on foreclosure. At the time default became imminent several large buildings intended to house shops and stores in the shopping center were more than 10 percent complete. Less than 10 percent of the construction, however, had been completed on a separate structure intended to house a bank. The bank was planned as a component of the shopping center in order to provide, in conjunction with the other shops and stores, a specific range and variety of goods and services with which to attract customers to the shopping center. The trust may complete construction of the bank:
Provided,
That the bank and the other buildings and improvements which the trust undertakes to complete, taken together as a unit, were more than 10 percent complete when default became imminent. If the trust chooses not to construct the bank, no actual or estimated construction costs attributable to the bank are to be taken into account in applying the 10-percent test with respect to the other buildings and improvements in the shopping center. For a third example, assume that a defaulting mortgagor had planned to construct two identical apartment buildings, A and B, on the same tract of land, that neither building is to provide substantial facilities or services to be used in connection with the other, and that only building A was more than 10 percent complete when default became imminent. The trust, in this case, may not complete building B. On the other hand, if the facts are the same except that pursuant to the plans
of the defaulting mortgagor, one of the buildings is to contain the furnace and central air conditioning machinery for both buildings A and B, the trust may complete both buildings A and B:
Provided,
That, taken together as a unit, the two buildings meet the more-than-10-percent test.
(5)
Repair and maintenance.
Under this paragraph (e), “construction” does not include—
(i) The repair or maintenance of a building or other improvement (such as the replacement of worn or obsolete furniture and appliances) to offset normal wear and tear or obsolescence, and the restoration of property required because of damage from fire, storm, vandalism or other casualty,
(ii) The preparation of leased space for a new tenant which does not substantially extend the useful life of the building or other improvement or significantly increase its value, even though, in the case of commercial space, this preparation includes adapting the property to the conduct of a different business, or
(iii) The performing of repair or maintenance described in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section after property is acquired that was deferred by the defaulting party and that does not constitute renovation under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(6)
Independent contractor required.
If any construction takes place on the foreclosure property more than 90 days after the day on which such property was acquired by the trust, such construction must be performed by an independent contractor (as defined in section 856(d)(3) and § 1.856-4(b)(5)(iii)) from whom the trust does not derive or receive any income. Otherwise, the property will cease to be foreclosure property.
(7)
Failure to complete construction.
Property will not cease to be foreclosure property solely because a trust which undertakes the completion of construction of a building or other improvement on the property that was more than 10 percent complete when default became imminent does not complete the construction. Thus, for example, if a trust continues construction of a building that was 20 percent complete when default became imminent, and the trust constructs an additional 40 percent of the building and then sells the property, the property will not lose its status as foreclosure property solely because the trust fails to complete construction of the building.
(f)
Termination of 2-year grace period; use of foreclosure property in a trade or business
—(1)
In general.
Under section 856(e)(4)(C), all real property (and any incidental personal property) for which a particular election has been made (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section) shall cease to be foreclosure property on the first day (occurring more than 90 days after the day on which the trust acquired the property) on which the property is used in a trade or business conducted by the trust, other than a trade or business conducted by the trust through an independent contractor from whom the trust itself does not derive or receive any income. (See section 856(d)(3) for the definition of independent contractor.)
(2)
Property held primarily for sale to customers.
For the purposes of section 856(e)(4)(C), foreclosure property held by the trust primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business is considered to be property used in a trade or business conducted by the trust. Thus, if a trust holds foreclosure property (whether real property or personal property incident to real property) for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business more than 90 days after the day on which the trust acquired the real property, the trade or business of selling the property must be conducted by the trust through an independent contractor from whom the trust does not derive or receive any income. Otherwise, after such 90th day the property will cease to be foreclosure property.
(3)
Change in use.
Foreclosure property will not cease to be foreclosure property solely because the use of the property in a trade or business by the trust differs from the use to which the property was put by the person from whom it was acquired. Thus, for example, if a trust acquires a rental apartment building on foreclosure, the property will not cease to be foreclosure
property solely because the trust converts the building to a condominium apartment building and, through an independent contractor from whom the trust derives no income, engages in the trade or business of selling the individual condominium units.
(g)
Extension of 2-year grace period
—(1)
In general.
A real estate investment trust may apply to the district director of the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of business (or principal office or agency) of the trust for an extension of the 2-year grace period. If the trust establishes to the satisfaction of the district director that an extension of the grace period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of the trust's interest in foreclosure property, or for an orderly renegotiation of a lease or leases of the property, the district director may extend the 2-year grace period. See section 856(e)(3) (as in effect with respect to the particular extension) for rules relating to the maximum length of an extension, and the number of extensions which may be granted. An extension of the grace period may be granted by the district director either before or after the date on which the grace period, but for the extension, would expire. The extension shall be effective as of the date on which the grace period, but for the extension, would expire.
(2)
Showing required.
Generally, in order to establish the necessity of an extension, the trust must demonstrate that it has made good faith efforts to renegotiate leases with respect to, or dispose of, the foreclosure property. In certain cases, however, the trust may establish the necessity of an extension even though it has not made such efforts. For example, if the trust demonstrates that, for valid business reasons, construction of the foreclosure property could not be completed before the expiration of the grace period, the necessity of the extension could be established even though the trust had made no effort to sell the property. For another example, if the trust demonstrates that due to a depressed real estate market, it could not sell the foreclosure property before the expiration of the grace period except at a distress price, the necessity of an extension could be established even though the trust had made no effort to sell the property. The fact that property was acquired as foreclosure property prior to January 3, 1975 (the date of enactment of section 856(e)), generally will be considered as a factor (but not a controlling factor) which tends to establish that an extension of the grace period is necessary.
(3)
Time for requesting an extension of the grace period.
A request for an extension of the grace period must be filed with the appropriate district director more than 60 days before the day on which the grace period would otherwise expire. In the case of a grace period which would otherwise expire before August 6, 1976, a request for an extension will be considered to be timely filed if filed on or before June 7, 1976.
(4)
Information required.
The request for an extension of the grace period shall identify the property with respect to which the request is being made and shall also include the following information:
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the trust,
(ii) The date the property was acquired as foreclosure property by the trust,
(iii) The taxable year of the trust in which the property was acquired,
(iv) If the trust has been previously granted an extension of the grace period with respect to the property, a statement to that effect (which shall include the date on which the grace period, as extended, expires) and a copy of the information which accompanied the request for the previous extension,
(v) A statement of the reasons why the grace period should be extended,
(vi) A description of any efforts made by the trust after the acquisition of the property to dispose of the property or to renegotiate any lease with respect to the property, and
(vii) A description of any other factors which tend to establish that an extension of the grace period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of the trust's interest in the property, or for an orderly renegotiation of a lease or leases of the property.
The trust shall also furnish any additional information requested by the district director after the request for extension is filed.
(5)
Automatic extension.
If a real estate investment trust files a request for an extension with the district director more than 60 days before the expiration of the grace period, the grace period shall be considered to be extended until the end of the 30th day after the date on which the district director notifies the trust by certified mail sent to its last known address that the period of extension requested by the trust is not granted. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see § 301.6212-2 of this chapter. In no event, however, shall the rule in the preceding sentence extend the grace period beyond the expiration of (i) the period of extension requested by the trust, or (ii) the 1-year period following the date that the grace period (but for the automatic extension) would expire. The date of the postmark on the sender's receipt is considered to be the date of the certified mail for purposes of this subparagraph. This subparagraph does not apply, however, if the date of the notification by certified mail described in the first sentence is more than 30 days before the date that the grace period (determined without regard to this subparagraph) expires. Moreover, this subparagraph shall not operate to allow any period of extension that is prohibited by the last sentence of section 856(e)(3) (as in effect with respect to the particular extension).
(6)
Extension of time for filing.
If a real estate investment trust fails to file the request for an extension of the grace period within the time provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, then the district director shall grant a reasonable extension of time for filing such request, provided (i) it is established to the satisfaction of the district director that there was reasonable cause for failure to file the request within the prescribed time and (ii) a request for such extension is filed within such time as the district director considers reasonable under the circumstances.
(7)
Status of taxpayer.
The reference to “real estate investment trust” or “trust” in this paragraph (g) shall be considered to include a taxpayer that is not a qualified real estate investment trust, if the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the district director that its failure to be a qualified real estate investment trust for the taxable year was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. The principles of § 1.856-7(c) and § 1.856-8(d) (including the principles relating to expert advice) shall apply for determining reasonable cause (and absence of willful neglect) for this purpose.

§ 1.856-7
Certain corporations, etc., that are considered to meet the gross income requirements.
(a)
In general.
A corporation, trust, or association which fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c), or of both such paragraphs, for any taxable year nevertheless is considered to have satisfied these requirements if the corporation, trust, or association meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of section 856(c)(7) (relating to a schedule attached to the return, the absence of fraud, and reasonable cause).
(b)
Contents of the schedule.
The schedule required by subparagraph (A) of section 856(c)(7) must contain a breakdown, or listing, of the total amount of gross income falling under each of the separate subparagraphs of section 856(c) (2) and (3). Thus, for example, the real estate investment trust, for purposes of listing its income from the sources described in section 856(c)(2), would list separately the total amount of dividends, the total amount of interest, the total amount of rents from real property, etc. The listing is not required to be on a lease-by-lease, loan-by-loan, or project-by-project basis, but the real estate investment
trust must maintain adequate records on such a basis with which to substantiate each total amount listed in the schedule.
(c)
Reasonable cause
—(1)
In general.
The failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c) (or of both paragraphs) will be considered due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect if the real estate investment trust exercised ordinary business care and prudence in attempting to satisfy the requirements. Such care and prudence must be exercised at the time each transaction is entered into by the trust. However, even if the trust exercised ordinary business care and prudence in entering into a transaction, if the trust later determines that the transaction results in the receipt or accrual of nonqualified income and that the amounts of such nonqualified income, in the context of the trust's overall portfolio, reasonably can be expected to cause a source-of-income requirement to be failed, the trust must use ordinary business care and prudence in an effort to renegotiate the terms of the transaction, dispose of property acquired or leased in the transaction, or alter other elements of its portfolio. In any case, failure to meet an income source requirement will be considered due to willful neglect and not due to reasonable cause if the failure is willful and the trust could have avoided such failure by taking actions not inconsistent with ordinary business care and prudence. For example, if the trust enters into a lease knowing that it will produce nonqualified income which reasonably can be expected to cause a source-of-income requirement to be failed, the failure is due to willful neglect even if the trust has a legitimate business purpose for entering into the lease.
(2)
Expert advice
—(i)
In general.
The reasonable reliance on a reasoned, written opinion as to the characterization for purposes of section 856 of gross income to be derived (or being derived) from a transaction generally constitutes “reasonable cause” if income from that transaction causes the trust to fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c) (or of both paragraphs). The absence of such a reasoned, written opinion with respect to a transaction does not, by itself, give rise to any inference that the failure to meet a percentage of income requirement was without reasonable cause. An opinion as to the character of income from a transaction includes an opinion pertaining to the use of a standard form of transaction or standard operating procedure in a case where such standard form or procedure is in fact used or followed.
(ii) If the opinion indicates that a portion of the income from a transaction will be nonqualifed income, the trust must still exercise ordinary business care and prudence with respect to the nonqualified income and determine that the amount of that income, in the context of its overall portfolio, reasonably cannot be expected to cause a source-of-income requirement to be failed. Reliance on an opinion is not reasonable if the trust has reason to believe that the opinion is incorrect (for example, because the trust withholds facts from the person rendering the opinion).
(iii)
Reasoned written opinion.
For purposes of this subparagraph (2), a written opinion means an opinion, in writing, rendered by a tax advisor (including house counsel) whose opinion would be relied on by a person exercising ordinary business care and prudence in the circumstances of the particular transaction. A written opinion is considered “reasoned” even if it reaches a conclusion which is subsequently determined to be incorrect, so long as the opinion is based on a full disclosure of the factual situation by the real estate investment trust and is addressed to the facts and law which the person rendering the opinion believes to be applicable. However, an opinion is not considered “reasoned” if it does nothing more than recite the facts and express a conclusion.
(d)
Application of section 856(c)(7) to taxable years beginning before October 5, 1976.
Pursuant to section 1608(b) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, paragraph (7) of section 856(c) and this section apply to a taxable year of a real estate investment trust which begins before October 5, 1976, only if as the result of a determination occurring after October
4, 1976, the trust does not meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c), or both paragraphs, as in effect for the taxable year. The requirement that the schedule described in subparagraph (A) of section 856(c)(7) be attached to the income tax return of a real estate investment trust in order for section 856(c)(7) to apply is not applicable to taxable years beginning before October 5, 1976. For purposes of section 1608(b) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 and this paragraph, the rules relating to determinations prescribed in section 860(e) and § 1.860-2(b)(1) (other than the second, third, and last sentences of § 1.860-2(b)(1)(ii)) shall apply. However, a determination consisting of an agreement between the taxpayer and the district director (or other official to whom authority to sign the agreement is delegated) shall set forth the amount of gross income for the taxable year to which the determination applies, the amount of the 90 percent and 75 percent source-of-income requirements for the taxable year to which the determination applies, and the amount by which the real estate investment trust failed to meet either or both of the requirements. The agreement shall also set forth the amount of tax for which the trust is liable pursuant to section 857(b)(5). The agreement shall also contain a finding as to whether the failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c) (or of both paragraphs) was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.

§ 1.856-8
Revocation or termination of election.
(a)
Revocation of an election to be a real estate investment trust.
A corporation, trust, or association that has made an election under section 856(c)(1) to be a real estate investment trust may revoke the election for any taxable year after the first taxable year for which the election is effective. The revocation must be made by filing a statement with the district director for the internal revenue district in which the taxpayer maintains its principal place of business or principal office or agency. The statement must be filed on or before the 90th day after the first day of the first taxable year for which the revocation is to be effective. The statement must be signed by an official authorized to sign the income tax return of the taxpayer and must—
(1) Contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the taxpayer,
(2) Specify the taxable year for which the election was made, and
(3) Include a statement that the taxpayer, pursuant to section 856(g)(2), revokes its election under section 856(c)(1) to be a real estate investment trust.
The revocation may be made only with respect to a taxable year beginning after October 4, 1976, and is effective for the taxable year in which made and for all succeeding taxable years. A revocation with respect to a taxable year beginning after October 4, 1976, that is filed before February 6, 1981, in the time and manner prescribed in § 7.856(g)-1 of this chapter (as in effect when the revocation was filed) is considered to meet the requirements of this paragraph.
(b)
Termination of election to be a real estate investment trust.
An election of a corporation, trust, or association under section 856(c)(1) to be a real estate investment trust shall terminate if the corporation, trust, or association is not a qualified real estate investment trust for any taxable year (including the taxable year with respect to which the election is made) beginning after October 4, 1976. (This election terminates whether the failure to be a qualified
real estate investment trust is intentional or inadvertent.) The term “taxable year” includes a taxable year of less than 12 months for which a return is made under section 443. The termination of the election is effective for the first taxable year beginning after October 4, 1976, for which the corporation, trust, or association is not a qualified real estate investment trust and for all succeeding taxable years.
(c)
Restrictions on election after termination or revocation
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, if a corporation, trust, or association has made an election under section 856(c)(1) to be a real estate investment trust and the election has been terminated or revoked under section 856(g)(1) or (2), the corporation, trust, or association (and any successor corporation, trust, or association) is not eligible to make a new election under section 856(c)(1) for any taxable year prior to the fifth taxable year which begins after the first taxable year for which the termination or revocation is effective.
(2)
Successor corporation.
The term “successor corporation, trust, or association”, as used in section 856(g)(3), means a corporation, trust, or association which meets both a continuity of ownership requirement and a continuity of assets requirement with respect to the corporation, trust, or association whose election has been terminated under section 856(g)(1) or revoked under section 856(g)(2). A corporation, trust, or association meets the continuity of ownership requirement only if at any time during the taxable year the persons who own, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more in value of its outstanding shares owned, at any time during the first taxable year for which the termination or revocation was effective, 50 percent or more in value of the outstanding shares of the corporation, trust, or association whose election has been terminated or revoked. A corporation, trust, or association meets the continuity of assets requirement only if either (i) a substantial portion of its assets were assets of the corporation, trust, or association whose election has been revoked or terminated, or (ii) it acquires a substantial portion of the assets of the corporation, trust, or association whose election has been terminated or revoked.
(3)
Effective date.
Section 856(g)(3) does not apply to the termination of an election that was made by a taxpayer pursuant to section 856(c)(1) on or before October 4, 1976, unless the taxpayer is a qualified real estate investment trust for a taxable year ending after October 4, 1976, for which the pre-October 5, 1976, election is in effect. For example, assume that Trust X, a calendar year taxpayer, files a timely election under section 856(c)(1) with respect to its taxable year 1974, and is a qualified real estate investment trust for calendar years 1974 and 1975. Assume further that Trust X is not a qualified real estate investment trust for 1976 and 1977 because it willfully fails to meet the asset diversification requirements of section 856(c)(5) for both years. The failure (whether or not willful) to meet these requirements in 1977 terminates the election to be a real estate investment trust made with respect to 1974. (See paragraph (b) of this section.) The termination is effective for 1977 and all succeeding taxable years. However, under section 1608(d)(3) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976, Trust X is not prohibited by section 856(g)(3) from making a new election under section 856(c)(1) with respect to 1978.
(d)
Exceptions.
Section 856(g)(4) provides an exception to the general rule of section 856(g)(3) that the termination of an election to be a real estate investment trust disqualifies the corporation, trust, or association from making a new election for the 4 taxable years following the first taxable year for which the termination is effective. This exception applies where the corporation, trust, or association meets the requirements of section 856(g)(4)(A), (B) and (C) (relating to the timely filing of a return, the absence of fraud, and reasonable cause, respectively) for the taxable year with respect to which the termination of election occurs. In order to meet the requirements of section 856(g)(4)(C), the corporation, trust, or association must establish, to the satisfaction of the district director for the internal revenue district in which the corporation, trust, or association maintains its
principal place of business or principal office or agency, that its failure to be a qualified real estate investment trust for the taxable year in question was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. The principles of § 1.856-7(c) (including the principles relating to expert advice) will apply in determining whether, for purposes of section 856(g)(4), the failure of a corporation, trust, or association to be a qualified real estate investment trust for a taxable year was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. Thus, for example, the corporation, trust, or association must exercise ordinary business care and prudence in attempting to meet the status conditions of section 856(a) and the distribution and recordkeeping requirements of section 857(a), as well as the gross income requirements of section 856(c). The provisions of section 856(g)(4) do not apply to a taxable year in which the corporation, trust, or association makes a valid revocation, under section 856(g)(2), of an election to be a real estate investment trust.

§ 1.856-9
Treatment of certain qualified REIT subsidiaries.
(a)
In general.
A qualified REIT subsidiary, even though it is otherwise not treated as a corporation separate from the REIT, is treated as a separate corporation for purposes of:
(1) Federal tax liabilities of the qualified REIT subsidiary with respect to any taxable period for which the qualified REIT subsidiary was treated as a separate corporation.
(2) Federal tax liabilities of any other entity for which the qualified REIT subsidiary is liable.
(3) Refunds or credits of Federal tax.
(b)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (a) of this section:

# Example 1.
X, a calendar year taxpayer, is a domestic corporation 100 percent of the stock of which is acquired by Y, a real estate investment trust, in 2002. X was not a member of a consolidated group at any time during its taxable year ending in December 2001. Consequently, X is treated as a qualified REIT subsidiary under the provisions of section 856(i) for 2002 and later periods. In 2004, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seeks to extend the period of limitations on assessment for X's 2001 taxable year. Because X was treated as a separate corporation for its 2001 taxable year, X is the proper party to sign the consent to extend the period of limitations.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
, except that upon Y's acquisition of X, Y and X jointly elect under section 856(l) to treat X as a taxable REIT subsidiary of Y. In 2003, Y and X jointly revoke that election. Consequently, X is treated as a qualified REIT subsidiary under the provisions of section 856(i) for 2003 and later periods. In 2004, the IRS determines that X miscalculated and underreported its income tax liability for 2001. Because X was treated as a separate corporation for its 2001 taxable year, the deficiency may be assessed against X and, in the event that X fails to pay the liability after notice and demand, a general tax lien will arise against all of X's property and rights to property.

# Example 3.
X is a qualified REIT subsidiary of Y under the provisions of section 856(i). In 2001, Z, a domestic corporation that reports its taxes on a calendar year basis, merges into X in a state law merger. Z was not a member of a consolidated group at any time during its taxable year ending in December 2000. Under the applicable state law, X is the successor to Z and is liable for all of Z's debts. In 2004, the IRS seeks to extend the period of limitations on assessment for Z's 2000 taxable year. Because X is the successor to Z and is liable for Z's 2000 taxes that remain unpaid, X is the proper party to sign the consent to extend the period of limitations.
(c)
Effective date.
This section applies on or after April 1, 2004.
[T.D. 9183, 70 FR 9221, Feb. 25, 2005]
§ 1.856-10
Definition of real property.
(a)
In general.
This section provides definitions for purposes of part II, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. Paragraph (b) of this section defines real property, which includes land as defined under paragraph
(c) of this section and improvements to land as defined under paragraph (d) of this section. Improvements to land include inherently permanent structures as defined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section and structural components of inherently permanent structures as defined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for determining whether an item is a distinct asset for purposes of applying the definitions in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section identifies intangible assets that are real property or interests in real property. Paragraph (g) of this section provides examples illustrating the rules of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. Paragraph (h) of this section provides the effective/applicability date for this section.
(b)
Real property.
The term
real property
means land and improvements to land. Local law definitions are not controlling for purposes of determining the meaning of the term real property.
(c)
Land.
Land includes water and air space superjacent to land and natural products and deposits that are unsevered from the land. Natural products and deposits, such as crops, water, ores, and minerals, cease to be real property when they are severed, extracted, or removed from the land. The storage of severed or extracted natural products or deposits, such as crops, water, ores, and minerals, in or upon real property does not cause the stored property to be recharacterized as real property.
(d)
Improvements to land
—(1)
In general.
The term
improvements to land
means inherently permanent structures and their structural components.
(2)
Inherently permanent structure
—(i)
In general.
The term
inherently permanent structure
means any permanently affixed building or other permanently affixed structure. Affixation may be to land or to another inherently permanent structure and may be by weight alone. If the affixation is reasonably expected to last indefinitely based on all the facts and circumstances, the affixation is considered permanent. A distinct asset that serves an active function, such as an item of machinery or equipment, is not a building or other inherently permanent structure.
(ii)
Building
—(A)
In general.
A building encloses a space within its walls and is covered by a roof.
(B)
Types of buildings.
Buildings include the following distinct assets if permanently affixed: Houses; apartments; hotels; motels; enclosed stadiums and arenas; enclosed shopping malls; factory and office buildings; warehouses; barns; enclosed garages; enclosed transportation stations and terminals; and stores.
(iii)
Other inherently permanent structures
—(A)
In general.
Other inherently permanent structures serve a passive function, such as to contain, support, shelter, cover, protect, or provide a conduit or a route, and do not serve an active function, such as to manufacture, create, produce, convert, or transport.
(B)
Types of other inherently permanent structures.
Other inherently permanent structures include the following distinct assets if permanently affixed: Microwave transmission, cell, broadcast, and electrical transmission towers; telephone poles; parking facilities; bridges; tunnels; roadbeds; railroad tracks; transmission lines; pipelines; fences; in-ground swimming pools; offshore drilling platforms; storage structures such as silos and oil and gas storage tanks; and stationary wharves and docks. Other inherently permanent structures also include outdoor advertising displays for which an election has been properly made under section 1033(g)(3).
(iv)
Facts and circumstances determination.
If a distinct asset (within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section) does not serve an active function as described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this section and is not otherwise listed in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) or (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section or in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter), the determination of whether that asset is an inherently permanent structure is based on all the facts and circumstances. In particular, the following factors must be taken into account:
(A) The manner in which the distinct asset is affixed to real property;
(B) Whether the distinct asset is designed to be removed or to remain in place indefinitely;
(C) The damage that removal of the distinct asset would cause to the item itself or to the real property to which it is affixed;
(D) Any circumstances that suggest the expected period of affixation is not indefinite (for example, a lease that requires or permits removal of the distinct asset upon the expiration of the lease); and
(E) The time and expense required to move the distinct asset.
(3)
Structural components
—(i)
In general.
The term
structural component
means any distinct asset (within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section) that is a constituent part of and integrated into an inherently permanent structure, serves the inherently permanent structure in its passive function, and, even if capable of producing income other than consideration for the use or occupancy of space, does not produce or contribute to the production of such income. If interconnected assets work together to serve an inherently permanent structure with a utility-like function (for example, systems that provide a building with electricity, heat, or water), the assets are analyzed together as one distinct asset that may be a structural component. A structural component may qualify as real property only if the real estate investment trust (REIT) holds its interest in the structural component together with a real property interest in the space in the inherently permanent structure served by the structural component. A mortgage secured by a structural component is a real estate asset only if the mortgage is also secured by a real property interest in the inherently permanent structure served by the structural component. If a distinct asset is customized in connection with the rental of space in or on an inherently permanent structure to which the asset relates, the customization does not affect whether the distinct asset is a structural component.
(ii)
Types of structural components.
Structural components include the following distinct assets and systems if integrated into the inherently permanent structure and held together with a real property interest in the space in the inherently permanent structure served by that distinct asset or system: Wiring; plumbing systems; central heating and air-conditioning systems; elevators or escalators; walls; floors; ceilings; permanent coverings of walls, floors, and ceilings; windows; doors; insulation; chimneys; fire suppression systems, such as sprinkler systems and fire alarms; fire escapes; central refrigeration systems; security systems; and humidity control systems.
(iii)
Facts and circumstances determination.
If an interest in a distinct asset (within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section) is held together with a real property interest in the space in the inherently permanent structure served by that distinct asset and that asset is not otherwise listed in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section or in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter), the determination of whether that asset is a structural component is based on all the facts and circumstances. In particular, the following factors must be taken into account:
(A) The manner, time, and expense of installing and removing the distinct asset;
(B) Whether the distinct asset is designed to be moved;
(C) The damage that removal of the distinct asset would cause to the item itself or to the inherently permanent structure to which it is affixed;
(D) Whether the distinct asset serves a utility-like function with respect to the inherently permanent structure;
(E) Whether the distinct asset serves the inherently permanent structure in its passive function;
(F) Whether the distinct asset produces income from consideration for the use or occupancy of space in or upon the inherently permanent structure;
(G) Whether the distinct asset is installed during construction of the inherently permanent structure; and
(H) Whether the distinct asset will remain if the tenant vacates the premises.
(e)
Distinct asset
—(1)
In general.
A distinct asset is analyzed separately from
any other assets to which the asset relates to determine if the asset is real property, whether as land, an inherently permanent structure, or a structural component of an inherently permanent structure.
(2)
Facts and circumstances.
The determination of whether a particular separately identifiable item of property is a distinct asset is based on all the facts and circumstances. In particular, the following factors must be taken into account:
(i) Whether the item is customarily sold or acquired as a single unit rather than as a component part of a larger asset;
(ii) Whether the item can be separated from a larger asset, and if so, the cost of separating the item from the larger asset;
(iii) Whether the item is commonly viewed as serving a useful function independent of a larger asset of which it is a part; and
(iv) Whether separating the item from a larger asset of which it is a part impairs the functionality of the larger asset.
(f)
Intangible assets
—(1)
In general.
To the extent that an intangible asset, including an intangible asset established under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as a result of an acquisition of real property or an interest in real property, derives its value from real property or an interest in real property, is inseparable from that real property or interest in real property, and does not produce or contribute to the production of income other than consideration for the use or occupancy of space, the intangible asset is real property or an interest in real property.
(2)
Licenses and permits.
A license, permit, or other similar right that is solely for the use, enjoyment, or occupation of land or an inherently permanent structure and that is in the nature of a leasehold or easement generally is an interest in real property. A license or permit to engage in or operate a business is not real property or an interest in real property if the license or permit produces or contributes to the production of income other than consideration for the use or occupancy of space.

Examples.
The following examples demonstrate the rules of this section.
Examples 1
and
2
illustrate the definition of land as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
Examples 3
through
10
illustrate the definition of improvements to land as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. Finally,
Examples 11
through
13
illustrate whether certain intangible assets are real property or interests in real property as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.

# Example 1.
Natural products of land.
A is a REIT. REIT A owns land with perennial fruit-bearing plants. REIT A leases the fruit-bearing plants to a tenant and grants the tenant an easement to enter the land to cultivate the plants and to harvest the fruit. The lease and easement are long-term and REIT A provides no services to the tenant. The unsevered plants are natural products of the land and are land within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section. The tenant annually harvests fruit from the plants. Upon severance from the land, the harvested fruit ceases to qualify as land. Storage of the harvested fruit upon or within real property does not cause the harvested fruit to be real property.

# Example 2.
Water space superjacent to land.
REIT B leases a marina from a governmental entity. The marina is comprised of U-shaped boat slips and end ties. The U-shaped boat slips are spaces on the water that are surrounded by a dock on three sides. The end ties are spaces on the water at the end of a slip or on a long, straight dock. REIT B rents the boat slips and end ties to boat owners. The boat slips and end ties are water space superjacent to land that is land within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section and, therefore, are real property.

# Example 3.
Indoor sculpture.
(i) REIT C owns an office building and a large sculpture in the atrium of the building. The sculpture measures 30 feet tall by 18 feet wide and weighs five tons. The building was specifically designed to support the sculpture, which is permanently affixed to the building by supports embedded in the building's foundation. The sculpture was constructed within the building. Removal would be costly and time consuming and would destroy the sculpture. The sculpture is reasonably expected to remain in the building indefinitely. The sculpture does not manufacture, create, produce, convert, transport, or serve any similar active function.
(ii) The sculpture is not an asset listed in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, and, therefore, the sculpture is an asset that must be analyzed to determine whether it is an inherently permanent structure using the factors provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section. The sculpture—
(A) Is permanently affixed to the building by supports embedded in the building's foundation;
(B) Is not designed to be removed and is designed to remain in place indefinitely;
(C) Would be damaged if removed and would damage the building to which it is affixed;
(D) Will remain affixed to the building after any tenant vacates the premises and will remain affixed to the building indefinitely; and
(E) Would require significant time and expense to move.
(iii) The factors described in this paragraph (g)
Example 3
(ii)(A) through (E) all support the conclusion that the sculpture is an inherently permanent structure within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section and, therefore, is real property.

# Example 4.
Bus shelters.
(i) REIT D owns 400 bus shelters, each of which consists of four posts, a roof, and panels enclosing two or three sides. REIT D enters into a long-term lease with a local transit authority for use of the bus shelters. Each bus shelter is prefabricated from steel and is bolted to the sidewalk. Bus shelters are disassembled and moved when bus routes change. Moving a bus shelter takes less than a day and does not significantly damage either the bus shelter or the real property to which it was affixed.
(ii) The bus shelters are not permanently affixed enclosed transportation stations or terminals and do not otherwise meet the definition of a building in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section nor are they listed as types of other inherently permanent structures in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. Therefore, the bus shelters must be analyzed to determine whether they are inherently permanent structures using the factors provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section. The bus shelters—
(A) Are not permanently affixed to the land or an inherently permanent structure;
(B) Are designed to be removed and are not designed to remain in place indefinitely;
(C) Would not be damaged if removed and would not damage the sidewalks to which they are affixed;
(D) Will not remain affixed after the local transit authority vacates the site and will not remain affixed indefinitely; and
(E) Would not require significant time and expense to move.
(iii) The factors described in this paragraph (g)
Example 4
(ii)(A) through (E) all support the conclusion that the bus shelters are not inherently permanent structures within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Although the bus shelters serve a passive function of sheltering, the bus shelters are not permanently affixed, which means the bus shelters are not inherently permanent structures within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section and, therefore, are not real property.

# Example 5.
Cold storage warehouse.
(i) REIT E owns a refrigerated warehouse (Cold Storage Warehouse). REIT E enters into a long-term lease with a tenant. REIT E neither operates the Cold Storage Warehouse nor provides services to its tenant. The tenant uses the Cold Storage Warehouse to store perishable products. Certain components and utility systems that are integrated into the Cold Storage Warehouse have been customized to accommodate the tenant's need for refrigerated storage space. For example, the Cold Storage Warehouse has customized freezer walls and a central refrigeration system. Freezer walls within the Cold Storage Warehouse are specifically designed to maintain the desired temperature within the Cold Storage Warehouse. The freezer walls and central refrigeration system comprise a series of interconnected assets that work together to serve a utility-like function within the Cold Storage Warehouse, were installed during construction of the building, and will remain in place when the tenant vacates the premises. The freezer walls and central refrigeration system were designed to remain permanently in place.
(ii) Walls and central refrigeration systems are listed as structural components in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section and, therefore, are real property. The customization of the freezer walls does not affect their qualification as structural components of REIT E's Cold Storage Warehouse within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Therefore, the freezer walls and central refrigeration system are structural components of REIT E's Cold Storage Warehouse.

# Example 6.
Data center.
(i) REIT F owns a building that it leases to a tenant under a long-term lease. REIT F neither operates the building nor provides services to its tenant. To accommodate the particular requirements for housing computer servers, certain interior components and utility systems within the building have been customized to provide a higher level of functionality than a conventional office building. These customized systems are owned by REIT F and include an electrical distribution and redundancy system (Electrical System), a central heating and air-conditioning system, a telecommunication infrastructure system, an integrated security system, a fire suppression system, and a humidity control system (each, a System). In addition, the space for computer servers in REIT F's building has been constructed with raised flooring that is integrated into the building to accommodate the Systems. Each System is comprised of a series of interconnected assets that work together to serve a utility-like function within the building. The Systems are integrated
into the office building, were installed during construction of the building, and will remain in place when the tenant vacates the premises. Each of the Systems was customized to enhance the capacity of the System in connection with the rental of space within the building.
(ii) The central heating and air-conditioning system, integrated security system, fire suppression system, and humidity control system are listed as structural components in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section and, therefore, are real property. The customization of these Systems does not affect the qualification of these Systems as structural components of REIT F's building within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Therefore, these Systems are structural components of REIT F's building.
(iii) In addition to wiring and flooring, which are listed as structural components in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section and, therefore, are real property, the Electrical System and telecommunication infrastructure system include equipment used to ensure that the tenant is provided with uninterruptable, stable power and telecommunication services. The Electrical System and telecommunication infrastructure system are not listed in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, and, therefore, they must be analyzed to determine whether they are structural components of the building using the factors provided in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section. The Electrical System and telecommunication infrastructure system—
(A) Are embedded within the walls and floors of the building and would be costly to remove;
(B) Are not designed to be moved and are designed specifically for the particular building of which they are a part;
(C) Would not be significantly damaged upon removal and, although removing them would damage the walls and floors in which they are embedded, their removal would not significantly damage the building;
(D) Serve a utility-like function with respect to the building;
(E) Serve the building in its passive functions of containing, sheltering, and protecting computer servers;
(F) Produce income as consideration for the use or occupancy of space within the building;
(G) Were installed during construction of the building; and
(H) Will remain in place when the tenant vacates the premises.
(iv) The factors described in this paragraph (g)
Example 6
(iii)(A), (B), and (D) through (H) all support the conclusion that the Electrical System and telecommunication infrastructure system are structural components of REIT F's building within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section and, therefore, are real property. The factor described in this paragraph (g)
Example 6
(iii)(C) would support a conclusion that the Electrical System and telecommunication infrastructure system are not structural components. However this factor does not outweigh the factors supporting the conclusion that the Electric System and telecommunication infrastructure system are structural components.

# Example 7.
Partitions.
(i) REIT G owns an office building that it leases to tenants under long-term leases. REIT G neither operates the office building nor provides services to its tenants. Partitions are owned by REIT G and are used to delineate space between tenants and within each tenant's space. The office building has two types of interior, non-load-bearing drywall partition systems: a conventional drywall partition system (Conventional Partition System) and a modular drywall partition system (Modular Partition System). Neither the Conventional Partition System nor the Modular Partition System was installed during construction of the office building. Conventional Partition Systems are comprised of fully integrated gypsum board partitions, studs, joint tape, and covering joint compound. Modular Partition Systems are comprised of assembled panels, studs, tracks, and exposed joints. Both the Conventional Partition System and the Modular Partition System reach from the floor to the ceiling.
(ii) Depending on the needs of a new tenant, the Conventional Partition System may remain in place when a tenant vacates the premises. The Conventional Partition System is integrated into the office building and is designed and constructed to remain in areas not subject to reconfiguration or expansion. The Conventional Partition System can be removed only by demolition, and, once removed, neither the Conventional Partition System nor its components can be reused. Removal of the Conventional Partition System causes substantial damage to the Conventional Partition System itself but does not cause substantial damage to the building.
(iii) Modular Partition Systems are typically removed when a tenant vacates the premises. Modular Partition Systems are not designed or constructed to remain permanently in place. Modular Partition Systems are designed and constructed to be movable. Each Modular Partition System can be readily removed, remains in substantially the same condition as before, and can be reused. Removal of a Modular Partition System does not cause any substantial damage to the Modular Partition System itself or to the building. The Modular Partition System may be moved to accommodate the reconfigurations of the interior space within the office building for various tenants that occupy the building.
(iv) The Conventional Partition System is comprised of walls that are integrated into
an inherently permanent structure, and thus are listed as structural components in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. The Conventional Partition System, therefore, is real property.
(v) The Modular Partition System is not integrated into the building and, therefore, is not listed in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. Thus, the Modular Partition System must be analyzed to determine whether it is a structural component using the factors provided in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section. The Modular Partition System—
(A) Is installed and removed quickly and with little expense;
(B) Is designed to be moved and is not designed specifically for the particular building of which it is a part;
(C) Is not damaged, and the building is not damaged, upon its removal;
(D) Does not serve a utility-like function with respect to the building;
(E) Serves the building in its passive functions of containing and protecting the tenants' assets;
(F) Produces income only as consideration for the use or occupancy of space within the building;
(G) Was not installed during construction of the building; and
(H) Will not remain in place when a tenant vacates the premises.
(vi) The factors described in this paragraph (g)
Example 7
(v)(A) through (D), (G) and (H) all support the conclusion that the Modular Partition System is not a structural component of REIT G's building within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section and, therefore, is not real property. The factors described in this paragraph (g)
Example 7
(v)(E) and (F) would support a conclusion that the Modular Partition System is a structural component. These factors, however, do not outweigh the factors supporting the conclusion that the Modular Partition System is not a structural component.

# Example 8.
Solar energy site.
(i) REIT H owns a solar energy site, among the components of which are land, photovoltaic modules (PV Modules), mounts and an exit wire. REIT H enters into a long-term lease with a tenant for the solar energy site. REIT H neither operates the solar energy site nor provides services to its tenant. The mounts support the PV Modules. The racks are affixed to the land through foundations made from poured concrete. The mounts will remain in place when the tenant vacates the solar energy site. The PV Modules convert solar photons into electric energy (electricity). The exit wire is buried underground, is connected to equipment that is in turn connected to the PV Modules, and transmits the electricity produced by the PV Modules to an electrical power grid, through which the electricity is distributed for sale to third parties.
(ii) REIT H's PV Modules, mounts, and exit wire are each separately identifiable items. Separation from a mount does not affect the ability of a PV Module to convert photons to electricity. Separation from the equipment to which it is attached does not affect the ability of the exit wire to transmit electricity to the electrical power grid. The types of PV Modules and exit wire that REIT H owns are each customarily sold or acquired as single units. Removal of the PV Modules from the mounts that support them does not damage the function of the mounts as support structures and removal is not costly. The PV Modules serve the active function of converting photons to electricity. Disconnecting the exit wire from the equipment to which it is attached does not damage the function of that equipment, and the disconnection is not costly. The PV Modules, mounts, and exit wire are each distinct assets within the meaning of paragraph (e) of this section.
(iii) The land is real property as defined in paragraph (c) of this section.
(iv) The mounts are designed and constructed to remain in place indefinitely, and they have a passive function of supporting the PV Modules. The mounts are not listed in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, and, therefore, the mounts are assets that must be analyzed to determine whether they are inherently permanent structures using the factors provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section. The mounts—
(A) Are permanently affixed to the land through the concrete foundations or molded concrete anchors (which are part of the mounts);
(B) Are not designed to be removed and are designed to remain in place indefinitely;
(C) Would be damaged if removed;
(D) Will remain affixed to the land after the tenant vacates the premises and will remain affixed to the land indefinitely; and
(E) Would require significant time and expense to move.
(v) The factors described in this paragraph (g)
Example 8
(iv)(A) through (E) all support the conclusion that the mounts are inherently permanent structures within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section and, therefore, are real property.
(vi) The PV Modules convert solar photons into electricity that is transmitted through an electrical power grid for sale to third parties. The conversion is an active function. Thus, the PV Modules are items of machinery or equipment and therefore are not inherently permanent structures within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section and, so, are not real property. The PV Modules do not serve the mounts in their passive function of providing support; instead, the PV Modules produce electricity for sale to third parties, which is income other than consideration for the use or occupancy of
space. Thus, the PV Modules are not structural components of REIT H's mounts within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section and, therefore, are not real property.
(vii) The exit wire is buried under the ground and transmits the electricity produced by the PV Modules to the electrical power grid. The exit wire was installed during construction of the solar energy site and is designed to remain permanently in place. The exit wire is permanently affixed and is a transmission line, which is listed as an inherently permanent structure in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this section. Therefore, the exit wire is real property.

# Example 9.
Solar-powered building.
(i) REIT I owns a solar energy site similar to that described in
Example 8,
except that REIT I's solar energy site assets (Solar Energy Site Assets) are mounted on land adjacent to an office building owned by REIT I. REIT I leases the office building and the solar energy site to a single tenant. REIT I does not operate the office building or the solar energy site and does not provide services to its tenant. Although the tenant occasionally transfers excess electricity produced by the Solar Energy Site Assets to a utility company, the Solar Energy Site Assets are designed and intended to produce electricity only to serve the office building. The size and specifications of the Solar Energy Site Assets were designed to be appropriate to serve only the electricity needs of the office building. Although the Solar Energy Site Assets were not installed during construction of the office building, no facts indicate either that the Solar Energy Site Assets will not remain in place indefinitely or that they may be removed if the tenant vacates the premises.
(ii) With the exception of the occasional transfers of excess electricity to a utility company, the Solar Energy Site Assets serve the office building to which they are adjacent, and, therefore, the Solar Energy Site Assets are analyzed to determine whether they are a structural component using the factors provided in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section. The Solar Energy Site Assets—
(A) Are expensive and time consuming to install and remove;
(B) Were designed with the size and specifications needed to serve only the office building;
(C) Will be damaged, but will not cause damage to the office building, upon removal;
(D) Serve a utility-like function with respect to the office building;
(E) Serve the office building in its passive functions of containing, sheltering, and protecting the tenant and the tenant's assets;
(F) Produce income from consideration for the use or occupancy of space within the office building;
(G) Were not installed during construction of the office building; and
(H) Will remain in place when the tenant vacates the premises.
(iii) The factors described in this paragraph (g)
Example 9
(ii)(A) through (C) (in part), (ii)(D) through (F), and (ii)(H) all support the conclusion that the Solar Energy Site Assets are a structural component of REIT I's office building within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section and, therefore, are real property. The factors described in this paragraph (g)
Example 9
(ii)(C) (in part) and (ii)(G) would support a conclusion that the Solar Energy Site Assets are not a structural component, but these factors do not outweigh the factors supporting the conclusion that the Solar Energy Site Assets are a structural component.
(iv) The result in this
Example 9
would not change if, instead of the Solar Energy Site Assets, solar shingles were used as the roof of REIT I's office building. Solar shingles are roofing shingles like those commonly used for residential housing, except that they contain built-in PV modules. The solar shingle installation was specifically designed and constructed to serve only the needs of REIT I's office building, and the solar shingles were installed as a structural component to provide solar energy to REIT I's office building (although REIT I's tenant occasionally transfers excess electricity produced by the solar shingles to a utility company). The analysis of the application of the factors provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section would be similar to the analysis of the application of the factors to the Solar Energy Site Assets in this paragraph (g)
Example 9
(ii) and (iii).

# Example 10.
Pipeline transmission system.
(i) REIT J owns a natural gas pipeline transmission system that provides a conduit to transport natural gas from unrelated third-party producers and gathering facilities to unrelated third-party distributors and end users. REIT J enters into a long-term lease with a tenant for the pipeline transmission system. REIT J neither operates the pipeline transmission system nor provides services to its tenant. The pipeline transmission system is comprised of underground pipelines, isolation valves and vents, pressure control and relief valves, meters, and compressors. Although the pipeline transmission system as a whole serves an active function (transporting natural gas), one or more distinct assets within the system may nevertheless be inherently permanent structures that do not themselves perform active functions. Each of these distinct assets was installed during construction of the pipeline transmission system and will remain in place when the tenant vacates the pipeline transmission system. Each of these assets was designed to remain permanently in place.
(ii) The pipelines are permanently affixed and are listed as other inherently permanent structures in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(B) of this
section. Therefore, the pipelines are real property.
(iii) Isolation valves and vents are placed at regular intervals along the pipelines to isolate and evacuate sections of the pipelines in case there is need for a shut-down or maintenance of the pipelines. Pressure control and relief valves are installed at regular intervals along the pipelines to provide overpressure protection. The isolation valves and vents and pressure control and relief valves are not listed in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) and, therefore, must be analyzed to determine whether they are structural components using the factors provided in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section. The isolation valves and vents and pressure control and relief valves—
(A) Are time consuming and expensive to install and remove from the pipelines;
(B) Are designed specifically for the particular pipelines for which they are a part;
(C) Will sustain damage and will damage the pipelines if removed;
(D) Do not serve a utility-like function with respect to the pipelines;
(E) Serve the pipelines in their passive function of providing a conduit for natural gas;
(F) Produce income only from consideration for the use or occupancy of space within the pipelines;
(G) Were installed during construction of the pipelines; and
(H) Will remain in place when the tenant vacates the premises.
(iv) The factors described in this paragraph (g)
Example 10
(iii)(A) through (C) and (iii)(E) through (H) support the conclusion that the isolation valves and vents and pressure control and relief valves are structural components of REIT J's pipelines within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section and, therefore, are real property.The factor described in this paragraph (g)
Example 10
(iii)(D) would support a conclusion that the isolation valves and vents and pressure control and relief valves are not structural components, but this factor does not outweigh the factors that support the conclusion that the isolation valves and vents and pressure control and relief valves are structural components.
(v) Meters are used to measure the natural gas passing into or out of the pipeline transmission system for purposes of determining the end users' consumption. Over long distances, pressure is lost due to friction in the pipeline transmission system.Compressors are required to add pressure to transport natural gas through the entirety of the pipeline transmission system.The meters and compressors do not serve the pipelines in their passive function of providing a conduit for the natural gas, and are used in connection with the production of income from the sale and transportation of natural gas, rather than as consideration for the use or occupancy of space within the pipelines. The meters and compressors are not structural components within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section and, therefore, are not real property.

# Example 11.
Above-market lease.
REIT K acquires an office building from an unrelated third party subject to a long-term lease with a single tenant under which the tenant pays above-market rents. The above-market lease is an intangible asset under GAAP. Seventy percent of the value of the above-market lease asset is attributable to income from the long-term lease that qualifies as rents from real property, as defined in section 856(d)(1). The remaining thirty percent of the value of the above-market lease asset is attributable to income from the long-term lease that does not qualify as rents from real property. The portion of the value of the above-market lease asset that is attributable to rents from real property (here, seventy percent) derives its value from real property, is inseparable from that real property, does not produce or contribute to the production of income other than consideration for the use or occupancy of space, and, therefore, is an interest in real property under section 856(c)(5)(C) and a real estate asset under section 856(c)(5)(B). The remaining portion of the above-market lease asset does not derive its value from real property and, therefore, is not a real estate asset.

# Example 12.
Land use permit.
REIT L receives a special use permit from the government to place a cell tower on Federal Government land that abuts a federal highway. Government regulations provide that the permit is not a lease of the land, but is a permit to use the land for a cell tower. Under the permit, the government reserves the right to cancel the permit and compensate REIT L if the site is needed for a higher public purpose. REIT L leases space on the tower to various cell service providers. Each cell service provider installs its equipment on a designated space on REIT L's cell tower. The permit does not produce, or contribute to the production of, any income other than REIT L's receipt of payments from the cell service providers in consideration for their being allowed to use space on the tower. The permit is in the nature of a leasehold that allows REIT L to place a cell tower in a specific location on government land. Therefore, the permit is an interest in real property.

# Example 13.
License to operate a business.
REIT M owns a building and receives a license from State to operate a casino in the building. The license applies only to REIT M's building and cannot be transferred to another location. REIT M's building is an inherently permanent structure under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section and, therefore, is real property. However, REIT M's license
to operate a casino is not a right for the use, enjoyment, or occupation of REIT M's building but is rather a license to engage in the business of operating a casino in the building. Therefore, the casino license is not real property.
(h)
Effective/applicability date.
The rules of this section apply for taxable years beginning after August 31, 2016. For purposes of applying the first sentence of the flush language of section 856(c)(4) to a quarter in a taxable year that begins after August 31, 2016, the rules of this section apply in determining whether the taxpayer met the requirements of section 856(c)(4) at the close of prior quarters. Taxpayers may rely on this section for quarters that end before the applicability date.

§ 1.857-1
Taxation of real estate investment trusts.
(a)
Requirements applicable thereto.
Section 857(a) denies the application of the provisions of part II, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code (other than sections 856(g), relating to the revocation or termination of an election, and 857(d), relating to earnings and profits) to a real estate investment trust for a taxable year unless—
(1) The deduction for dividends paid for the taxable year as defined in section 561 (computed without regard to capital gain dividends) equals or exceeds the amount specified in section 857(a)(1), as in effect for the taxable year; and
(2) The trust complies for such taxable year with the provisions of § 1.857-8 (relating to records required to be maintained by a real estate investment trust).
See section 858 and § 1.858-1, relating to dividends paid after the close of the taxable year.
(b)
Failure to qualify.
If a real estate investment trust does not meet the requirements of section 857(a) and paragraph (a) of this section for the taxable year, it will, even though it may otherwise be classified as a real estate investment trust, be taxed in such year as an ordinary corporation and not as a real estate investment trust. In such case, none of the provisions of part II of subchapter M (other than sections 856(g) and 857(d)) will be applicable to it. For the rules relating to the applicability of sections 856(g) and 857(d), see § 1.857-7.

§ 1.857-2
Real estate investment trust taxable income and net capital gain.
(a)
Real estate investment trust taxable income.
Section 857(b)(1) imposes a nominal tax and surtax, computed at the rates and in the manner prescribed in section 11, on the “real estate investment trust taxable income”, as defined in section 857(b)(2). Section 857(b)(2) requires certain adjustments to be made to convert taxable income of the real estate investment trust to “real estate investment trust taxable income”. The adjustments are as follows:
(1)
Net capital gain.
In the case of taxable years ending before October 5, 1976, the net capital gain, if any, is excluded.
(2)
Special deductions disallowed.
The special deductions provided in part VIII, subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code (except the deduction under section 248) are not allowed.
(3)
Deduction for dividends paid
—(i)
General rule.
The deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) is allowed. In the case of taxable years ending before October 5, 1976, the deduction for dividends paid is computed without regard to capital gains dividends.
(ii)
Deduction for dividends paid if there is net income from foreclosure property.
If for any taxable year the trust has net income from foreclosure property (as defined in section 857(b)(4)(B) and § 1.857-3), the deduction for dividends paid is an amount equal to the
amount which bears the same proportion to the total dividends paid or considered as paid during the taxable year that otherwise meet the requirements for the deduction for dividends paid (as defined in section 561) as the real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid) bears to the sum of—
(A) The real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), and
(B) The amount by which the net income from foreclosure property exceeds the tax imposed on such income by section 857(b)(4)(A).
For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “total dividends paid or considered as paid during the taxable year” includes deficiency dividends paid with respect to the taxable year that are not otherwise excluded under this subdivision or section 857(b)(3)(A). The term, however, does not include either deficiency dividends paid during the taxable year with respect to a preceding taxable year ending before October 5, 1976, capital gains dividends.
(iii)
Deduction for dividends paid for purposes of the alternative tax.
The rules in section 857(b)(3)(A) apply in determining the amount of the deduction for dividends paid that is taken into account in computing the alternative tax. Thus, for example, if a real estate investment trust has net income from foreclosure property for a taxable year ending after October 4, 1976, then for purposes of determining the partial tax described in section 857(b)(3)(A)(i), the amount of the deduction for dividends paid is computed pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, except that capital gains dividends are excluded from the dividends paid or considered as paid during the taxable year, and the net capital gain is excluded in computing real estate investment trust taxable income.
(4)
Section 443(b) disregarded.
The taxable income is computed without regard to section 443(b). Thus, the taxable income for a period of less than 12 months is not placed on an annual basis even though the short taxable year results from a change of accounting period.
(5)
Net operating loss deduction.
In the case of a taxable year ending before October 5, 1976, the net operating loss deduction provided in section 172 is not allowed.
(6)
Net income from foreclosure property.
An amount equal to the net income from foreclosure property (as defined in section 857(b)(4)(B) and paragraph (a) of § 1.857-3), if any, is excluded.
(7)
Tax imposed by section 857(b)(5).
An amount equal to the tax (if any) imposed on the trust by section 857(b)(5) for the taxable year is excluded.
(8)
Net income or loss from prohibited transactions.
An amount equal to the amount of any net income derived from prohibited transactions (as defined in section 857(b)(6)(B)(i)) is excluded. On the other hand, an amount equal to amount of any net loss derived from prohibited transactions (as defined in section 857(b)(6)(B)(ii)) is included. Because the amount of the net loss derived from prohibited transactions is taken into account in computing taxable income before the adjustments required by section 857(b)(2) and this section are made, the effect of including an amount equal to the amount of the loss is to disallow a deduction for the loss.
(b)
Net capital gain in taxable years ending October 5, 1976.
The rules relating to the taxation of capital gains in 26 CFR 1.857-2(b) (revised as of April 1, 1977) apply to taxable years ending before October 5, 1976.

[T.D. 7767, 46 FR 11277, Feb. 6, 1981]
§ 1.857-3
Net income from foreclosure property.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of section 857(b)(40(B), net income from foreclosure property means the aggregate of—
(1) All gains and losses from sales or other dispositions of foreclosure property described in section 1221(1), and,
(2) The difference (hereinafter called “net gain or loss from operations”) between (i) the gross income derived from foreclosure property (as defined in section 856(e)) to the extent such gross income is not described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), or (G) of section 856(c)(3), and (ii) the deductions allowed by chapter 1 of the Code which are directly connected with the production of such gross income.
Thus, the sum of the gains and losses from sales or other dispositions of foreclosure property described in section 1221(1) is aggregated with the net gain or loss from operations in arriving at net income from foreclosure property. For example, if for a taxable year a real estate investment trust has gain of $100 from the sale of an item of foreclosure property described in section 1221(1), a loss of $50 from the sale of an item of foreclosure property described in section 1221(1), gross income of $25 from the rental of foreclosure property that is not gross income described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), or (G) of section 856(c)(3), and deductions of $35 allowed by chapter 1 of the Code which are directly connected with the production of the rental income, the net income from foreclosure property for the taxable years is $40 (($100−$50) + ($25−$35)).
(b)
Directly connected deductions.
A deduction which is otherwise allowed by chapter 1 of the Code is “directly connected” with the production of gross income from the foreclosure property if it has a proximate and primary relationship to the earning of the income. Thus, in the case of gross income from real property that is foreclosure property, “directly connected” deductions would include depreciation on the property, interest paid or accrued on the indebtedness of the trust (whether or not secured by the property) to the extent attributable to the carrying of the property, real estate taxes, and fees paid to an independent contractor hired to manage the property. On the other hand, general overhead and administrative expenses of the trust are not “directly connected” deductions. Thus, salaries of officers and other administrative employees of the trust are not “directly connected” deductions. The net operating loss deduction provided by section 172 is not allowed in computing net income from foreclosure property.
(c)
Net loss from foreclosure property.
The tax imposed by section 857(b)(4) applies only if there is net income from foreclosure property. If there is a net loss from foreclosure property (that is, if the aggregate computed under paragraph (a) of this section results in a negative amount) the loss is taken into account in computing real estate investment trust taxable income under section 857(b)(2).
(d)
Gross income not subject to tax on foreclosure property.
If the gross income derived from foreclosure property consists of two classes, a deduction directly connected with the production of both classes (including interest attributable to the carrying of the property) must be apportioned between them. The two classes are:
(1) Gross income which is taken into account in computing net income from foreclosure property and
(2) Other income (such as income described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), (D), or (G) of section 856(c)(3)).
The apportionment may be made on any reasonable basis.
(e)
Allocation and apportionment of interest.
For purposes of determining the amount of interest attributable to the carrying of foreclosure property under paragraph (b) of this section, the following rules apply:
(1)
Deductible interest.
Interest is taken into account under this paragraph (e) only if it is otherwise deductible under chapter 1 of the Code.
(2)
Interest specifically allocated to property.
Interest that is specifically allocated to an item of property is attributable only to the carrying of that property. Interest is specifically allocated to an item of property if (i) the indebtedness on which the interest is paid or accrued is secured only by that property, (ii) such indebtedness was specifically incurred for the purpose of purchasing, constructing, maintaining, or improving that property, and (iii) the proceeds of the borrowing were applied for that purpose.
(3)
Other interest.
Interest which is not specifically allocated to property is apportioned between foreclosure property and other property under the principles of § 1.861-8(e)(2)(v).
(4)
Effective date.
The rules in this paragraph (e) are mandatory for all taxable years ending after February 6, 1981.

§ 1.857-4
Tax imposed by reason of the failure to meet certain source-of-income requirements.
Section 857(b)(5) imposes a tax on a real estate investment trust that is considered, by reason of section 856(c)(7), as meeting the source-of-income requirements of paragraph (2) or (3) of section 856(c) (or both such paragraphs). The amount of the tax is determined in the manner prescribed in section 857(b)(5).

§ 1.857-5
Net income and loss from prohibited transactions.
(a)
In general.
Section 857(b)(6) imposes, for each taxable year, a tax equal to 100 percent of the net income derived from prohibited transactions. A prohibited transaction is a sale or other disposition of property described in section 1221(1) that is not foreclosure property. The 100-percent tax is imposed to preclude a real estate investment trust from retaining any profit from ordinary retailing activities such as sales to customers of condominium units or subdivided lots in a development tract. In order to prevent a trust from receiving any tax benefit from such activities, a net loss from prohibited transactions effectively is disallowed in computing real estate investment trust taxable income. See § 1.857-2(a)(8). Such loss, however, does reduce the amount which a trust is required to distribute as dividends. For purposes of applying the provisions of the Code, other than those provisions of part II of subchapter M which relate to prohibited transactions, no inference is to be drawn from the fact that a type of transaction does not constitute a prohibited transaction.
(b)
Special rules.
In determining whether a particular transaction constitutes a prohibited transaction, the activities of a real estate investment trust with respect to foreclosure property and its sales of such property are disregarded. Also, if a real estate investment trust enters into a purchase and leaseback of real property with an option in the seller-lessee to repurchase the property at the end of the lease period, and the seller exercises the option pursuant to its terms, income from the sale generally will not be considered to be income from a prohibited transaction solely because the purchase and leaseback was entered into with an option in the seller to repurchase and because the option was exercised pursuant to its terms. Other facts and circumstances, however, may require a conclusion that the property is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Gain from the sale or other disposition of property described in section 1221(1) (other than foreclosure property) that is included in gross income for a taxable year of a qualified real estate investment trust constitutes income from a prohibited transaction, even though the sale or other disposition from which the gain is derived occurred in a prior taxable year. For example, if a corporation that is a qualified real estate investment trust for the current taxable year
elected to report the income from the sale of an item of section 1221(1) property (other than foreclosure property) on the installment method of reporting income, the gain from the sale that is taken into income by the real estate investment trust for the current taxable year is income from a prohibited transaction. This result follows even though the sale occurred in a prior taxable year for which the corporation did not qualify as a real estate investment trust. On the other hand, if the gain is taken into income in a taxable year for which the taxpayer is not a qualified real estate investment trust, the 100-percent tax does not apply.
(c)
Net income or loss from prohibited transactions.
Net income or net loss from prohibited transactions is determined by aggregating all gains from the sale or other disposition of property (other than foreclosure property) described in section 1221(1) with all losses from the sale or other disposition of such property. Thus, for example, if a real estate investment trust sells two items of property described in section 1221(1) (other than foreclosure property) and recognizes a gain of $100 on the sale of one item and a loss of $40 on the sale of the second item, the net income from prohibited transactions will be $60.

[T.D. 7767, 46 FR 11278, Feb. 6, 1981]
§ 1.857-6
Method of taxation of shareholders of real estate investment trusts.
(a)
Ordinary income.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section (relating to capital gains), a shareholder receiving dividends from a real estate investment trust shall include such dividends in gross income for the taxable year in which they are received. See section 858(b) and paragraph (c) of § 1.858-1 for treatment by shareholders of dividends paid by a real estate investment trust after the close of its taxable year in the case of an election under section 858(a).
(b)
Capital gains.
Under section 857(b)(3)(B), shareholders of a real estate investment trust who receive capital gain dividends (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section), in respect of the capital gains of a corporation, trust, or association for a taxable year for which it is taxable under part II of subchapter M as a real estate investment trust, shall treat such capital gain dividends as gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) and realized in the taxable year of the shareholder in which the dividend was received. In the case of dividends with respect to any taxable year of a real estate investment trust ending after December 31, 1969, and beginning before January 1, 1975, the portion of a shareholder's capital gain dividend which in his hands is gain to which section 1201(d) (1) or (2) applies is the portion so designated by the real estate investment trust pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(c)
Special treatment of loss on the sale or exchange of real estate investment trust stock held less than 31 days
—(1)
In general.
Under section 857(b)(7), if any person with respect to a share of real estate investment trust stock held for a period of less than 31 days, is required by section 857(b)(3)(B) to include in gross income as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) the amount of a capital gains dividend, then such person shall, to the extent of such amount, treat any loss on the sale or exchange of such share as a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977).
(2)
Determination of holding period.
The rules contained in section 246(c)(3)
(relating to the determination of holding periods for purposes of the deduction for dividends received) shall be applied in determining whether, for purposes of section 857(b)(7)(B) and this paragraph, a share of real estate investment trust stock has been held for a period of less than 31 days. In applying those rules, however, “30 days” shall be substituted for the number of days specified in subparagraph (B) of such section.
(3)
Illustration.
The application of section 857(b)(7) and this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
On December 15, 1961, A purchased a share of stock in the S Real Estate Investment Trust for $20. The S trust declared a capital gains dividend of $2 per share to shareholders of record on December 31, 1961. A, therefore, received a capital gain dividend of $2 which, pursuant to section 857(b)(3)(B), he must treat as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than six months. On January 5, 1962, A sold his share of stock in the S trust for $17.50, which sale resulted in a loss of $2.50. Under section 857(b)(4) and this paragraph, A must treat $2 of such loss (an amount equal to the capital gain dividend received with respect to such share of stock) as a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than six months.
(d)
Dividend received credit, exclusion, and deduction not allowed.
Any dividend received from a real estate investment trust which, for the taxable year to which the dividend relates, is a qualified real estate investment trust, shall not be eligible for the dividend received credit (for dividends received on or before December 31, 1964) under section 34(a), the dividend received exclusion under section 116, or the dividend received deduction under section 243.
(e)
Definition of capital gain dividend.
(1)(i) A capital gain dividend, as defined in section 857(b)(3)(C), is any dividend or part thereof which is designated by a real estate investment trust as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders within the period specified in section 857(b)(3)(C) and paragraph (f) of this section. If the aggregate amount so designated with respect to the taxable year (including capital gain dividends paid after the close of the taxable year pursuant to an election under section 858) is greater than the net capital gain of the taxable year, the portion of each distribution which shall be a capital gain dividend shall be only that proportion of the amount so designated which such excess of the net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss bears to the aggregate of the amount so designated. For example, a real estate investment trust making its return on the calendar year basis advised its shareholders by written notice mailed December 30, 1961, that $200,000 of a distribution of $500,000 made December 15, 1961, constituted a capital gain dividend, amounting to $2 per share. It was later discovered that an error had been made in determining the net capital gain of the taxable year and the net capital gain was $100,000 instead of $200,000. In such case, each shareholder would have received a capital gain dividend of $1 per share instead of $2 per share.
(ii) For purposes of section 857(b)(3)(C) and this paragraph, the net capital gain for a taxable year ending after October 4, 1976, is deemed not to exceed the real estate investment trust taxable income determined by taking into account the net operating loss deduction for the taxable year but not the deduction for dividends paid. See example 2 in § 1.172-5(a)(4).
(2) In the case of capital gain dividends designated with respect to any taxable year of a real estate investment trust ending after December 31, 1969, and beginning before January 1, 1975 (including capital gain dividends paid after the close of the taxable year pursuant to an election under section 858), the real estate investment trust must include in its written notice designating the capital gain dividend a statement showing the shareholder's proportionate share of such dividend which is gain described in section 1201(d)(1) and his proportionate share of such dividend which is gain described in section 1201(d)(2). In determining the portion of the capital gain dividend which, in the hands of a shareholder, is gain described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2), the real estate investment trust shall consider that capital gain dividends for a taxable year are first made from its long-term capital gains which
are not described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2), to the extent thereof, and then from its long-term capital gains for such year which are described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2). A shareholder's proportionate share of gains which are described in section 1201(d)(1) is the amount which bears the same ratio to the amount paid to him as a capital gain dividend in respect of such year as (i) the aggregate amount of the trust's gains which are described in section 1201(d)(1) and paid to all shareholders bears to (ii) the aggregate amount of the capital gain dividend paid to all shareholders in respect of such year. A shareholder's proportionate share of gains which are described in section 1201(d)(2) shall be determined in a similar manner. Every real estate investment trust shall keep a record of the proportion of each capital gain divided (to which this subparagraph applies) which is gain described in section 1201(d) (1) or (2).
(f)
Mailing of written notice to shareholders
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the written notice designating a dividend or part thereof as a capital gain dividend must be mailed to the shareholders not later than 30 days after the close of the taxable year of the real estate investment trust.
(2)
Net capital gain resulting from a determination.
If, as a result of a determination (as defined in section 860(e)), occurring after October 4, 1976, there is an increase in the amount by which the net capital gain exceeds the deduction for dividends paid (determined with reference to capital gains dividends only) for the taxable year, then a real estate investment trust may designate a dividend (or part thereof) as a capital gain dividend in a written notice mailed to its shareholders at any time during the 120-day period immediately following the date of the determination. The designation may be made with respect to a dividend (or part thereof) paid during the taxable year to which the determination applies (including a dividend considered as paid during the taxable year pursuant to section 858). A deficiency dividend (as defined in section 860(f)), or a part thereof, that is paid with respect to the taxable year also may be designated as a capital gain dividend by the real estate investment trust (or by the acquiring corporation to which section 381(c)(25) applies) before the expiration of the 120-day period immediately following the determination. However, the aggregate amount of the dividends (or parts thereof) that may be designated as capital gain dividends after the date of the determination shall not exceed the amount of the increase in the excess of the net capital gain over the deduction for dividends paid (determined with reference to capital gains dividends only) that results from the determination. The date of a determination shall be established in accordance with § 1.860-2(b)(1).

(b) In the determination of the earnings and profits of a real estate investment trust, section 857(d) provides that such earnings and profits for any taxable year (but not the accumulated earnings and profits) shall not be reduced by any amount which is not allowable as a deduction in computing its taxable income for the taxable year.
Thus, if a trust would have had earnings and profits of $500,000 for the taxable year except for the fact that it had a net capital loss of $100,000, which amount was not deductible in determining its taxable income, its earnings and profits for that year if it is a real estate investment trust would be $500,000. If the real estate investment trust had no accumulated earnings and profits at the beginning of the taxable year, in determining its accumulated earnings and profits as of the beginning of the following taxable year, the earnings and profits for the taxable year to be considered in such computation would amount to $400,000 assuming that there had been no distribution from such earnings and profits. If distributions had been made in the taxable year in the amount of the earnings and profits then available for distribution, $500,000, the trust would have as of the beginning of the following taxable year neither accumulated earnings and profits nor a deficit in accumulated earnings and profits, and would begin such year with its paid-in capital reduced by $100,000, an amount equal to the excess of the $500,000 distributed over the $400,000 accumulated earnings and profits which would otherwise have been carried into the following taxable year. For purposes of section 857(d) and this section, if an amount equal to any net loss derived from prohibited transactions is included in real estate investment trust taxable income pursuant to section 857(b)(2)(F), that amount shall be considered to be an amount which is not allowable as a deduction in computing taxable income for the taxable year. The earnings and profits for the taxable year (but not the accumulated earnings and profits) shall not be considered to be less than (i) in the case of a taxable year ending before October 5, 1976, the amount (if any) of the net capital gain for the taxable year, or (ii) in the case of a taxable year ending after December 31, 1973, the amount (if any), of the excess of the net income from foreclosure property for the taxable year over the tax imposed thereon by section 857(b)(4)(A).

§ 1.857-8
Records to be kept by a real estate investment trust.
(a)
In general.
Under section 857(a)(2) a real estate investment trust is required to keep such records as will disclose the actual ownership of its outstanding stock. Thus, every real estate investment trust shall maintain in the internal revenue district in which it is required to file its income tax return permanent records showing the information relative to the actual owners of its stock contained in the written statements required by this section to be demanded from its shareholders. Such records shall be kept at all times available for inspection by any internal revenue officer or employee, and shall be retained so long as the contents thereof may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law.
(b)
Actual owner of stock.
The actual owner of stock of a real estate investment trust is the person who is required to include in gross income in his return the dividends received on the stock. Generally, such person is the shareholder of record of the real estate investment trust. However, where the shareholder of record is not the actual owner of the stock, the stockholding record of the real estate investment trust may not disclose the actual ownership of such stock. Accordingly, the real estate investment trust shall demand written statements from shareholders of record disclosing the actual owners of stock as required in paragraph (d) of this section.
(c)
Stock ownership for personal holding company determination.
For the purpose of determining under section 856(a)(6) whether a trust, claiming to be a real estate investment trust, is a personal holding company, the permanent records of the trust shall show the maximum number of shares of the trust (including the number and face value of securities convertible into stock of the trust) to be considered as actually or constructively owned by each of the actual owners of any of its stock at any time during the last half of the trust's taxable year, as provided in section 544.
(d)
Statements to be demanded from shareholders.
The information required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be set forth in written statements which shall be demanded from shareholders of record as follows:
(1) In the case of a trust having 2,000 or more shareholders of record of its stock on any dividend record date, from each record holder of 5 percent or more of its stock; or
(2) In the case of a trust having less than 2,000 and more than 200 shareholders of record of its stock on any dividend record date, from each record holder of 1 percent or more of its stock; or
(3) In the case of a trust having 200 or less shareholders of record of its stock on any dividend record date, from each record holder of one-half of 1 percent or more of its stock.
(e)
Demands for statements.
The written statements from shareholders of record shall be demanded by the real estate investment trust in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section within 30 days after the close of the real estate investment trust's taxable year (or before June 1, 1962, whichever is later). When making demand for such written statements, the trust shall inform each such shareholder of his duty to submit at the time he files his income tax return (or before July 1, 1962, whichever is later) the statements which are required by § 1.857-9 if he fails or refuses to comply with such demand. A list of the persons failing or refusing to comply in whole or in part with the trust's demand for statements under this section shall be maintained as a part of the trust's records required by this section. A trust which fails to keep such records to show, to the extent required by this section, the actual ownership of its outstanding stock shall be taxable as an ordinary corporation and not as a real estate investment trust.

§ 1.858-1
Dividends paid by a real estate investment trust after close of taxable year.
(a)
General rule.
Under section 858, a real estate investment trust may elect to treat certain dividends that are distributed within a specified period after the close of a taxable year as having been paid during the taxable year. The dividend is taken into account in determining the deduction for dividends paid for the taxable year in which it is treated as paid. The dividend may be an ordinary dividend or, subject to the requirements of sections 857(b)(3)(C) and 858(c), a capital gain dividend. The trust may make the dividend declaration required by section 858(a)(1) either before or after the close of the taxable year as long as the declaration is made before the time prescribed by law for filing its return for the taxable year (including the period of any extension of time granted for filing the return).
(b)
Election
—(1)
Method of making election.
The election must be made in the return filed by the trust for the taxable year. The election shall be made by treating the dividend (or portion thereof) to which the election applies as a dividend paid during the taxable year of the trust in computing its real estate investment trust taxable income and, if applicable, the alternative tax imposed by section 857(b)(3)(A). (In the case of an election with respect to a taxable year ending before October 5, 1976, if the dividend (or portion thereof) to which the election is to apply is a capital gain dividend, the trust shall treat the dividend as paid during such taxable year in computing the amount of capital gains dividends paid during the taxable year.) In the case of an election with respect to a taxable year beginning after October 4, 1976, the trust must also specify in its return (or in a statement attached to its return) the exact dollar amount that is to be treated as having been paid during the taxable year.
(2)
Limitation based on earnings and profits.
The election provided in section 858(a) may be made only to the extent that the earnings and profits of the taxable year (computed with the application of sections 857(d) and § 1.857-7) exceed the total amount of distributions out of such earnings and profits actually made during the taxable year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, deficiency dividends and distributions with respect to which an election has been made for a prior year under section 858(a) are disregarded in determining the total amount of distributions out of earnings and profits actually made during the taxable year. The dividend or portion thereof, with respect to which the real estate investment trust has made a valid election under section 858(a), shall be considered as paid out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year for which such election is made, and not out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year in which the distribution is actually made.
(3)
Additional limitation based on amount specified.
The amount treated under section 858(a) as having been paid in a taxable year beginning after October 4, 1976, cannot exceed the lesser of (i) the dollar amount specified by the trust in its return (or a statement attached thereto) in making the election or (ii) the amount allowable under the limitation prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(4)
Irrevocability of the election.
After the expiration of the time for filing the return for the taxable year for which an election is made under section 858(a), such election shall be irrevocable with respect to the dividend or portion thereof to which it applies.
(c)
Receipt by shareholders.
Under section 858(b), the dividend or portion thereof, with respect to which a valid election has been made, will be includable in the gross income of the shareholders of the real estate investment trust for the taxable year in which the dividend is received by them.
(d)
Illustrations.
The application of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The X Trust, a real estate investment trust, had taxable income (and earnings and profits) for the calendar year 1961 of $100,000. During that year the trust distributed to shareholders taxable dividends aggregating $88,000. On March 10, 1962, the trust declared a dividend of $37,000 payable to shareholders on March 20, 1962. Such dividend consisted of the first regular quarterly dividend for 1962 of $25,000 plus an additional $12,000 representing that part of the taxable income for 1961 which was not distributed in 1961. On March 15, 1962, the X Trust filed its Federal income tax return and elected therein to treat $12,000 of the total dividend of $37,000 to be paid to shareholders on March 20, 1962, as having been paid during the taxable year 1961. Assuming that the X Trust actually distributed the entire amount of the dividend of $37,000 on March 20, 1962, an amount equal to $12,000 thereof will be treated for the purposes of section 857(a) as having been paid during the taxable year 1961. Upon distribution of such dividend the trust becomes a qualified real estate investment trust for the taxable year 1961. Such amount ($12,000) will be considered by the X Trust as a distribution out of the earnings and profits for the taxable year 1961, and will be treated by the shareholders as a taxable dividend for the taxable year in which such distribution is received by them. However, assuming that the X Trust is not a qualified real estate investment trust for the calendar year 1962, nevertheless, the $12,000 portion of the dividend (paid on March 20, 1962) which the trust elected to relate to the calendar year 1961, will not qualify as a dividend for purposes of section 34, 116, or 243.

# Example 2.
The Y Trust, a real estate investment trust, had taxable income (and earnings and profits) for the calendar year 1964 of $100,000, and for 1965 taxable income (and earnings and profits) of $125,000. On January 1, 1964, the trust had a deficit in its earnings and profits accumulated since February 28, 1913, of $115,000. During the year 1964 the trust distributed to shareholders taxable dividends aggregating $85,000. On March 5, 1965, the trust declared a dividend of $65,000 payable to shareholders on March 31, 1965. On March 15, 1965, the Y Trust filed its Federal income tax return in which it included $40,000 of the total dividend of $65,000 payable to shareholders on March 31, 1965, as a dividend paid by it during the taxable year 1964. On March 31, 1965, the Y Trust distributed the entire amount of the dividend of $65,000 declared on March 5, 1965. The election under section 858(a) is valid only to the extent of $15,000, the amount of the undistributed earnings and profits for 1964 ($100,000 earnings and profits less $85,000 distributed during 1964). The remainder ($50,000) of the $65,000 dividend paid on March 31, 1965, could not be the subject of an election, and such amount will be regarded as a distribution by the Y Trust out of earnings and profits for the taxable year 1965. Assuming that the only other distribution by the Y Trust during 1965 was a distribution of $75,000 paid as a dividend on October 31, 1965, the total amount of the distribution of $65,000 paid on March 31, 1965, is to be treated by the shareholders as taxable dividends for the taxable year in which such dividend is received. The Y Trust will treat the amount of $15,000 as a distribution of the earnings or profits of the trust for the taxable year 1964, and the remaining $50,000 as a distribution of the earnings or profits for the year 1965. The distribution of $75,000 on October 31, 1966, is, of course, a taxable dividend out of the earnings and profits for the year 1965.

# Example 3.
Assume the facts are the same as in example 2, except that the taxable years involved are calendar years 1977 and 1978, and Y Trust specified in its Federal income tax return for 1977 that the dollar amount of $40,000 of the $65,000 distribution payable to shareholders on March 31, 1978, is to be treated as having been paid in 1977. The result will be the same as in example 2, since the amount of the undistributed earnings and profits for 1977 is less than the $40,000 amount specified by Y Trust in making its election. Accordingly, the election is valid only to the extent of $15,000. Y Trust will treat the amount of $15,000 as a distribution, in 1977, of earnings and profits of the trust for the taxable year 1977 and the remaining $50,000 as a distribution, in 1978, of the earnings and profits for 1978.
(e)
Notice to shareholders.
Section 858(c) provides that, in the case of dividends with respect to which a real estate investment trust has made an election under section 858(a), any notice to shareholders required under part II, subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code, with respect to such amounts, shall be made not later than 30 days after the close of the taxable year in which the distribution is made. Thus, the notice requirement of section 857(b)(3)(C) and paragraph (f) of § 1.857-6 with respect to capital gains dividends may be satisfied with respect to amounts to which section 858(a) and this section apply if the notice relating to such amounts is mailed to the shareholders not later than 30 days after the close of the taxable year in which the distribution is made. If the notice
under section 858(c) reltes to an election with respect to any capital gains dividends, such capital gains dividends shall be aggregated by the real estate investment trust with the designated capital gains dividends actually paid during the taxable year to which the election applies (not including deficiency dividends or dividends with respect to which an election has been made for a prior taxable year under section 858) to determine whether the aggregate of the designated capital gains dividends with respect to such taxable year exceeds the net capital gain of the trust. See section 857(b)(3)(C) and paragraph (f) of § 1.857-6.

§ 1.860-1
Deficiency dividends.
Section 860 allows a qualified investment entity to be relieved from the payment of a deficiency in (or to be allowed a credit or refund of) certain taxes. “Qualified investment entity” is defined in section 860(b). The taxes referred to are those imposed by sections 852(b)(1) and (3), 857(b)(1) or (3), the minimum tax on tax preferences imposed by section 56 and, if the entity fails the distribution requirements of section 852(a)(1)(A) or 857(a)(1) (as applicable), the corporate income tax imposed by section 11(a) or 1201(a). The method provided by section 860 is to allow an additional deduction for a dividend distribution (that meets the requirements of section 860 and § 1.860-2) in computing the deduction for dividends paid for the taxable year for which the deficiency is determined. A deficiency divided may be an ordinary dividend or, subject to the limitations of sections 852(b)(3)(C), 857(b)(3)(C), and 860(f)(2)(B), may be a capital gain dividend.

§ 1.860-2
Requirements for deficiency dividends.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Determination, etc.
A qualified investment entity is allowed a deduction for a deficiency dividend only if there is a determination (as defined in section 860(e) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section) that results in an adjustment (as defined in section 860(d) (1) or (2)) for the taxable year for which the deficiency dividend is paid. An adjustment does not include an increase in the excess of (i) the taxpayer's interest income excludable from gross income under section 103(a) over (ii) its deductions disallowed under sections 265 and 171(a)(2).
(2)
Payment date and claim.
The deficiency dividend must be paid on, or within 90 days after, the date of the determination and before the filing of a claim under section 860(g) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This claim must be filed within 120 days after the date of the determination.
(3)
Nature and amount of distribution.
(i) The deficiency dividend must be a distribution of property (including money) that would have been properly taken into account in computing the dividends paid deduction under section 561 for the taxable year for which tax liability resulting from the determination exists if the property had been distributed during that year. Thus, if the distribution would have been a dividend under section 316(a) if it had been made during the taxable year for which the determination applies, and the distribution may qualify under sections 316(b)(3), 562(a), and 860(f)(1), even though the distributing corporation, trust, or association has no current or accumulated earnings and profits for the taxable year in which the distribution is actually made. The amount of the distribution is determined under section 301 as of the date of the distribution.
The amount of the deduction is subject to the applicable limitations under sections 562 and 860(f)(2). Thus, if the entity distributes to an individual shareholder property (other than money) which on the date of the distribution has a fair market value in excess of its adjusted basis in the hands of the entity, the amount of the deficiency dividend in the individual's hands for purposes of section 316(b)(3) is determined by using the property's fair market value on that date. Nevertheless, the amount of the deficiency dividend the entity may deduct is limited, under § 1.562-1(a), to the adjusted basis of the property and the amount taxable to the individual as a dividend is determined by reference to the current and accumulated earnings and profits for the year to which the determination applies.
(ii) The qualified investment entity does not have to distribute the full amount of the adjustment in order to pay a deficiency dividend. For example, assume that in 1983 a determination with respect to a calendar year regulated investment company results in an increase of $100 in investment company taxable income (computed without the dividends paid deduction) for 1981 and no other change. The regulated investment company may choose to pay a deficiency dividend of $100 or of any lesser amount and be allowed a dividends paid deduction for 1981 for the amount of that deficiency dividend.
(4)
Status of distributor.
The corporation, trust, or association that pays the deficiency dividend does not have to be a qualified investment entity at the time of payment.
(5)
Certain definitions to apply.
For purposes of sections 860(d) (defining adjustment) and (f)(2) (limitations) the definitions of the terms “investment company taxable income,” “real estate investment trust taxable income,” and “capital gains dividends” in sections 852(b)(2), 857(b)(2), 852(b)(3)(C), and 857(b)(3)(C) apply, as appropriate to the particular entity.
(b)
Determination and claim for deduction
—(1)
Determination.
For purposes of applying section 860(e), the following rules apply:
(i) The date of determination by a decision of the United States Tax Court, the date upon which a judgment of a court becomes final, and the date of determination by a closing agreement shall be determined under the rules in § 1.547-2(b)(1) (ii), (iii), and (iv).
(ii) A determination under section 860(e)(3) may be made by an agreement signed by the district director or another official to whom authority to sign the agreement is delegated, and by or on behalf of the taxpayer. The agreement shall set forth the amount, if any, of each adjustment described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of section 860(d) (1) or (2) (as appropriate) for the taxable year and the amount of the liability for any tax imposed by section 11(a), 56(a), 852(b)(1), 852(b)(3)(A), 857(b)(1), 857(b)(3)(A), or 1201(a) for the taxable year. The agreement shall also set forth the amount of the limitation (determined under section 860(f)(2)) on the amount of deficiency dividends that can qualify as capital gain dividends and ordinary dividends, respectively, for the taxable year. An agreement under this subdivision (ii) which is signed by the district director (or other delegate) shall be sent to the taxpayer at its last known address by either registered or certified mail. For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address, see § 301.6212-2 of this chapter. If registered mail is used, the date of registration is the date of determination. If certified mail is used, the date of the postmark on the sender's receipt is the date of determination. However, if a dividend is paid by the taxpayer before the registration or postmark date, but on or after the date the agreement is signed by the district director (or other delegate), the date of determination is the date of signing.
(2)
Claim for deduction.
A claim for deduction for a deficiency dividend shall be made, with the requisite declaration, on Form 976 and shall contain the following information and have the following attachments:
(i) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the corporation, trust, or association;
(ii) The amount of the deficiency and the taxable year or years involved;
(iii) The amount of the unpaid deficiency or, if the deficiency has been
paid in whole or in part, the date of payment and the amount thereof;
(iv) A statement as to how the deficiency was established (
i.e.,
by an agreement under section 860(e)(3), by a closing agreement under section 7121, or by a decision of the Tax Court or court judgment);
(v) Any date or other information with respect to the determination that is required by Form 976;
(vi) The amount and date of payment of the dividend with respect to which the claim for the deduction for deficiency dividends is filed;
(vii) The amount claimed as a deduction for deficiency dividends;
(viii) If the amount claimed as a deduction for deficiency dividends includes any amount designated (or to be designated) as capital gain dividends, the amount of capital gain dividends for which a deficiency dividend deduction is claimed;
(ix) Any other information required by the claim form;
(x) A certified copy of the resolution of the trustees, directors, or other authority authorizing the payment of the dividend with respect to which the claim is filed; and
(xi) A copy of any court decision, judgment, agreement, or other document required by Form 976.
(3)
Filing claim.
The claim, together with the accompanying documents, shall be filed with the district director, or director of the internal revenue service center, with whom the income tax return for the taxable year for which the determination applies was filed. In the event that the determination is an agreement with the district director (or other delegate) described in section 860(e)(3) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the claim may be filed with the district director with whom (or pursuant to whose delegation) the agreement was made.

§ 1.860-3
Interest and additions to tax.
(a)
In general.
If a qualified investment entity is allowed a deduction for deficiency dividends with respect to a taxable year, under section 860(c)(1) the tax imposed on the entity by chapter 1 of the Code (computed by taking into account the deduction) for that year is deemed to be increased by the amount of the deduction. This deemed increase in tax, however, applies solely for purposes of determining the liability of the entity for interest under subchapter A of chapter 67 of the Code and for additions to tax and additional amounts under chapter 68 of the Code. For purposes of applying subchapter A of chapter 67 and 68, the last date prescribed for payment of the deemed increase in tax is considered to be the last date prescribed for the payment of tax (determined in the manner provided in section 6601(b)) for the taxable year for which the deduction for deficiency dividends is allowed. The deemed increase in tax is considered to be paid as of the date that the claim for the deficiency dividend deduction described in section 860(g) is filed.
(b)
Overpayments of tax.
If a qualified investment entity is entitled to a credit or refund of an overpayment of the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year for which the deficiency dividend deduction is allowed, then, for purposes of computing interest, additions to tax, and additional amounts, the payment (or payments) that result in the overpayment and that precede the filing of the claim described in section 860(g) will be applied against and reduce the increase in tax that is deemed to occur under section 860(c)(1).
(c)
Examples.
This section is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X is a real estate investment trust that files its income tax return on a calendar year basis. X receives an extension of time until June 15, 1978, to file its 1977 income tax return and files the return on May 15, 1978. X does not elect to pay any tax due in installments. For 1977, X reports real estate investment trust taxable income (computed without the dividends paid deduction) of $100, a dividends paid deduction of $100, and no tax liability. Following an examination of X's 1977 return, the district director and X enter into an agreement which is a determination under section
860(e)(3). The determination is dated November 1, 1979, and increases X's real estate investment trust taxable income (computed without the dividends paid deduction) by $20 to $120. Thus, taking into account the $100 of dividends paid in 1977, X has undistributed real estate investment trust taxable income of $20 as a result of the determination. X pays a dividend of $20 on November 10, 1979, files a claim for a deficiency dividend deduction of this $20 pursuant to section 860(g) on November 15, 1979, and is allowed a deficiency dividend deduction of $20 for 1977. After taking into account this deduction, X has no real estate investment trust taxable income and meets the distribution requirements of section 857(a)(1). However, for purposes of section 6601 (relating to interest on underpayment of tax), the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code on X for 1977 is deemed increased by this $20, and the last date prescribed for payment of the tax is March 15, 1978 (the due date of the 1977 return determined without any extension of time). The tax of $20 is deemed paid on November 15, 1979, the date the claim for the deficiency dividend deduction is filed. Thus, X is liable for interest on $20, at the rate established under section 6621, for the period from March 15, 1978, to November 15, 1979. Also, for purposes of determining whether X is liable for any addition to tax or additional amount imposed by chapter 68 of the Code (including the penalty prescribed by section 6697), the amount of tax imposed on X by chapter 1 of the Code is deemed to be increased by $20 (the amount of the deficiency dividend deduction allowed), the last date prescribed for payment of such tax is March 15, 1978, and the tax of $20 is deemed to be paid on November 15, 1979. X, however, is not subject to interest and penalties for the amount of any tax for which it would have been liable under section 11(a), 56(a), 1201(a), or 857(b) had it not been allowed the $20 deduction for deficiency dividends.

# Example 2.
Assume the facts are the same as in example (1) except that the district director, upon examining X's income tax return, asserts an income tax deficiency of $4, based on an asserted increase of $10 in real estate investment trust taxable income, and no agreement is entered into between the parties. X pays the $4 on June 1, 1979, and files suit for refund in the United States District Court. The District Court, in a decision which becomes final on November 1, 1980, holds that X did fail to report $10 of real estate investment trust taxable income and is not entitled to any refund. (No other item of income or deduction is in issue.) X pays a dividend of $10 on November 10, 1980, files a claim for a deficiency dividend deduction of this $10 on November 15, 1980, and is allowed a deficiency dividend deduction of $10 for 1977. Assume further that $4 is refunded to X on December 31, 1980, as the result of the $10 deficiency dividend deduction being allowed. Also assume that any assessable penalties, additional amounts, and additions to tax (including the penalty imposed by section 6697) for which X is liable are paid within 10 days of notice and demand, so that no interest is imposed on such penalties, etc. X's liability for interest for the period March 15, 1978, to June 1, 1979, is determined with respect to $10 (the amount of the deficiency dividend deduction allowed). X's liability for interest for the period June 1, 1979, to November 15, 1980, is determined with respect to $6,
i.e.,
$10 minus the $4 payment. X is entitled to interest on the $4 overpayment for the period described in section 6611(b)(2), beginning on November 15, 1980.

§ 1.860-4
Claim for credit or refund.
If the allowance of a deduction for a deficiency dividend results in an overpayment of tax, the taxpayer, in order to secure credit or refund of the overpayment, must file a claim on Form 1120X in addition to the claim for the deficiency dividend deduction required under section 860(g). The credit or refund will be allowed as if on the date of the determination (as defined in section 860(e)) two years remained before the expiration of the period of limitations on the filing of claim for refund for the taxable year to which the overpayment relates.

(2)
Tax avoidance rules
—(i)
Transfers of certain residual interests.
Section 1.860E-1(c) (concerning transfers of noneconomic residual interests) and § 1.860G-3(a)(4) (concerning transfers by a foreign holder to a United States person) are effective for transfers of residual interests on or after September 27, 1991.
(ii)
Transfers to foreign holders.
Generally, § 1.860G-3(a) (concerning transfers of residual interests to foreign holders) is effective for transfers of residual interests after April 20, 1992. However, § 1.860G-3(a) does not apply to a transfer of a residual interest in a REMIC by the REMIC's sponsor (or by another transferor contemporaneously with formation of the REMIC) on or before June 30, 1992, if—
(A) The terms of the regular interests and the prices at which regular interests were offered had been fixed on or before April 20, 1992;
(B) On or before June 30, 1992, a substantial portion of the regular interests in the REMIC were transferred, with the terms and at the prices that were fixed on or before April 20, 1992, to investors who were unrelated to the REMIC's sponsor at the time of the transfer; and
(C) At the time of the transfer of the residual interest, the expected future distributions on the residual interest were equal to at least 30 percent of the anticipated excess inclusions (as defined in § 1.860E-2(a)(3)), and the transferor reasonably expected that the transferee would receive sufficient distributions from the REMIC at or after the time at which the excess inclusions accrue in an amount sufficient to satisfy the taxes on the excess inclusions.
(iii)
Residual interests that lack significant value.
The significant value requirement in § 1.860E-1(a)(1) and (3) (concerning excess inclusions accruing to organizations to which section 593 applies) generally is effective for residual interests acquired on or after September 27, 1991. The significant value requirement in § 1.860E-1(a)(1) and (3) does not apply, however, to residual interests acquired by an organization to which section 593 applies as a sponsor at formation of a REMIC in a transaction described in § 1.860F-2(a)(1) if more than 50 percent of the interests in the REMIC (determined by reference to issue price) were sold to unrelated investors before November 12, 1991. The exception from the significant value requirement provided by the preceding sentence applies only so long as the sponsor owns the residual interests.
(3)
Excise taxes.
Section 1.860E-2(a)(1) is effective for transfers of residual interests to disqualified organizations after March 31, 1988. Section 1.860E-2(b)(1) is effective for excess inclusions
accruing to pass-thru entities after March 31, 1988.
(4)
Rate based on current interest rate
—(i)
In general.
Section 1.860G-1(a)(3)(i) applies to obligations (other than transition obligations described in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section) intended to qualify as regular interests that are issued on or after April 4, 1994.
(ii)
Rate based on index.
Section 1.860G-1(a)(3)(i) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 1994) applies to obligations intended to qualify as regular interests that—
(A) Are issued by a qualified entity (as defined in § 1.860D-1(c)(3)) whose startup date (as defined in section 860G(a)(9) and § 1.860G-2(k)) is on or after November 12, 1991; and
(B) Are either—
(
1
) Issued before April 4, 1994; or
(
2
) Transition obligations described in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.
(iii)
Transition obligations.
Obligations are described in this paragraph (b)(4)(iii) if—
(A) The terms of the obligations and the prices at which the obligations are offered are fixed before April 4, 1994; and
(B) On or before June 1, 1994, a substantial portion of the obligations are transferred, with the terms and at the prices that are fixed before April 4, 1994, to investors who are unrelated to the REMIC's sponsor at the time of the transfer.
(5) Accounting for REMIC net income of foreign persons. Section 1.860G-3(b) is applicable to REMIC net income (including excess inclusions) of a foreign person with respect to a REMIC residual interest if the first net income allocation under section 860C(a)(1) to the foreign person with respect to that interest occurs on or after August 1, 2006.
(6)
Exceptions for certain modified obligations.
Paragraphs (a)(8)(i), (b)(3)(v), (b)(3)(vi), and (b)(7) of § 1.860G-2 apply to modifications made to the terms of an obligation on or after September 16, 2009.
(7)
Exceptions for certain modifications of obligations that refer to certain interbank offered rates.
(i) Paragraphs (e)(2) and (4) of § 1.860G-1 apply with respect to a covered modification that occurs on or after March 7, 2022. However, paragraphs (e)(2) and (4) of § 1.860G-1 may be applied with respect to a covered modification that occurs before March 7, 2022. See section 7805(b)(7).
(ii) Paragraph (e)(3) of § 1.860G-1 applies to a regular interest in a REMIC issued on or after March 7, 2022. However, paragraph (e)(3) of § 1.860G-1 may be applied to a regular interest in a REMIC issued before March 7, 2022. See section 7805(b)(7).

§ 1.860C-1
Taxation of holders of residual interests.
(a)
Pass-thru of income or loss.
Any holder of a residual interest in a REMIC must take into account the holder's daily portion of the taxable income or net loss of the REMIC for each day during the taxable year on which the holder owned the residual interest.
(b)
Adjustments to basis of residual interests
—(1)
Increase in basis.
A holder's basis in a residual interest is increased by—
(i) The daily portions of taxable income taken into account by that holder under section 860C(a) with respect to that interest; and
(ii) The amount of any contribution described in section 860G(d)(2) made by that holder.
(2)
Decrease in basis.
A holder's basis in a residual interest is reduced (but not below zero) by—
(i) First, the amount of any cash or the fair market value of any property distributed to that holder with respect to that interest; and
(ii) Second, the daily portions of net loss of the REMIC taken into account under section 860C(a) by that holder with respect to that interest.
(3)
Adjustments made before disposition.
If any person disposes of a residual interest, the adjustments to basis prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) and (2) of this section are deemed to occur immediately before the disposition.
(c)
Counting conventions.
For purposes of determining the daily portion of REMIC taxable income or net loss under section 860C(a)(2), any reasonable convention may be used. An example of
a reasonable convention is “30 days per month/90 days per quarter/360 days per year.”
(d) For rules on the proper accounting for income from inducement fees,
see
§ 1.446-6.
[T.D. 8458, 57 FR 61301, Dec. 24, 1992, as amended by T.D. 9128, 69 FR 26041, May 11, 2004]
§ 1.860C-2
Determination of REMIC taxable income or net loss.
(a)
Treatment of gain or loss.
For purposes of determining the taxable income or net loss of a REMIC under section 860C(b), any gain or loss from the disposition of any asset, including a qualified mortgage (as defined in section 860G(a)(3)) or a permitted investment (as defined in section 860G(a)(5) and § 1.860G-2(g)), is treated as gain or loss from the sale or exchange of property that is not a capital asset.
(b)
Deductions allowable to a REMIC
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in section 860C(b) and in paragraph (b)(2) through (5) of this section, the deductions allowable to a REMIC for purposes of determining its taxable income or net loss are those deductions that would be allowable to an individual, determined by taking into account the same limitations that apply to an individual.
(2)
Deduction allowable under section 163.
(i) A REMIC is allowed a deduction, determined without regard to section 163(d), for any interest expense accrued during the taxable year.
(ii) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, a REMIC is allowed a deduction, determined without regard to section 163(j), for any interest expense accrued during the taxable year.
(3)
Deduction allowable under section 166.
For purposes of determining a REMIC's bad debt deduction under section 166, debt owed to the REMIC is not treated as nonbusiness debt under section 166(d).
(4)
Deduction allowable under section 212.
A REMIC is not treated as carrying on a trade or business for purposes of section 162. Ordinary and necessary operating expenses paid or incurred by the REMIC during the taxable year are deductible under section 212, without regard to section 67. Any expenses that are incurred in connection with the formation of the REMIC and that relate to the organization of the REMIC and the issuance of regular and residual interests are not treated as expenses of the REMIC for which a deduction is allowable under section 212. See § 1.860F-2(b)(3)(ii) for treatment of those expenses.
(5)
Expenses and interest relating to tax-exempt income.
Pursuant to section 265(a), a REMIC is not allowed a deduction for expenses and interest allocable to tax-exempt income. The portion of a REMIC's interest expense that is allocable to tax-exempt interest is determined in the manner prescribed in section 265(b)(2), without regard to section 265(b)(3).
[T.D. 8458, 57 FR 61301, Dec. 24, 1992, as amended by T.D. 9905, 85 FR 56842, Sept. 14, 2020]
§ 1.860D-1
Definition of a REMIC.
(a)
In general.
A real estate mortgage investment conduit (or REMIC) is a qualified entity, as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, that satisfies the requirements of section 860D(a). See paragraph (d)(1) of this section for the manner of electing REMIC status.
(b)
Specific requirements
—(1)
Interests in a REMIC
—(i)
In general.
A REMIC must have one class, and only one class, of residual interests. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, every interest in a REMIC must be either a regular interest (as defined in section 860G(a)(1) and § 1.860G-1(a)) or a residual interest (as defined in section 860G(a)(2) and § 1.860G-1(c)).
(ii)
De minimis interests.
If, to facilitate the creation of an entity that elects REMIC status, an interest in the entity is created and, as of the startup day (as defined in section 860G(a)(9) and § 1.860G-2(k)), the fair market value of that interest is less than the lesser of $1,000 or 1/1,000 of one percent of the aggregate fair market value of all the regular and residual interests in the REMIC, then, unless that interest is specifically designated as an interest in the REMIC, the interest is not treated as an interest in the REMIC for purposes of section 860D(a) (2) and (3) and paragraph (B)(1)(i) of this section.
(2)
Certain rights not treated as interests.
Certain rights are not treated as interests in a REMIC. Although not an exclusive list, the following rights are not interests in a REMIC.
(i)
Payments for services.
The right to receive from the REMIC payments that represent reasonable compensation for services provided to the REMIC in the ordinary course of its operation is not an interest in the REMIC. Payments made by the REMIC in exchange for services may be expressed as a specified percentage of interest payments due on qualified mortgages or as a specified percentage of earnings from permitted investments. For example, a mortgage servicer's right to receive reasonable compensation for servicing the mortgages owned by the REMIC is not an interest in the REMIC.
(ii)
Stripped interests.
Stripped bonds or stripped coupons not held by the REMIC are not interests in the REMIC even if, in a transaction preceding or contemporaneous with the formation of the REMIC, they and the REMIC's qualified mortgages were created from the same mortgage obligation. For example, the right of a mortgage servicer to receive a servicing fee in excess of reasonable compensation from payments it receives on mortgages held by a REMIC is not an interest in the REMIC. Further, if an obligation with a fixed principal amount provides for interest at a fixed or variable rate and for certain contingent payment rights (
e.g.,
a shared appreciation provision or a percentage of mortgagor profits provision), and the owner of the obligation contributes the fixed payment rights to a REMIC and retains the contingent payment rights, the retained contingent payment rights are not an interest in the REMIC.
(iii)
Reimbursement rights under credit enhancement contracts.
A credit enhancer's right to be reimbursed for amounts advanced to a REMIC pursuant to the terms of a credit enhancement contract (as defined in § 1.860G-2 (c)(2)) is not an interest in the REMIC even if the credit enhancer is entitled to receive interest on the amounts advanced.
(iv)
Rights to acquire mortgages.
The right to acquire or the obligation to purchase mortgages and other assets from a REMIC pursuant to a clean-up call (as defined in § 1.860G-2(j)) or a qualified liquidation (as defined in section 860F(a)(4)), or on conversion of a convertible mortgage (as defined in § 1.860G-2(d)(5)), is not an interest in the REMIC.
(3)
Asset test
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of the asset test of section 860D(a)(4), substantially all of a qualified entity's assets are qualified mortgages and permitted investments if the qualified entity owns no more than a de minimis amount of other assets.
(ii)
Safe harbor.
The amount of assets other than qualified mortgages and permitted investments is de minimis if the aggregate of the adjusted bases of those assets is less than one percent of the aggregate of the adjusted bases of all of the REMIC's assets. Nonetheless, a qualified entity that does not meet this safe harbor may demonstrate that it owns no more than a de minimis amount of other assets.
(4)
Arrangements test.
Generally, a qualified entity must adopt reasonable arrangements designed to ensure that—
(i) Disqualified organizations (as defined in section 860E(e)(5)) do not hold residual interests in the qualified entity; and
(ii) If a residual interest is acquired by a disqualified organization, the qualified entity will provide to the Internal Revenue Service, and to the persons specified in section 860E(e)(3), information needed to compute the tax imposed under section 860E(e) on transfers of residual interests to disqualified organizations.
(5)
Reasonable arrangements
—(i)
Arrangements to prevent disqualified organizations from holding residual interests.
A qualified entity is considered to have adopted reasonable arrangements to ensure that a disqualified organization (as defined in section 860E(e)(5)) will not hold a residual interest if—
(A) The residual interest is in registered form (as defined in § 5f.103-1(c) of this chapter); and
(B) The qualified entity's organizational documents clearly and expressly prohibit a disqualified organization from acquiring beneficial ownership of a residual interest, and notice of the
prohibition is provided through a legend on the document that evidences ownership of the residual interest or through a conspicuous statement in a prospectus or private offering document used to offer the residual interest for sale.
(ii)
Arrangements to ensure that information will be provided.
A qualified entity is considered to have made reasonable arrangements to ensure that the Internal Revenue Service and persons specified in section 860E(e)(3) as liable for the tax imposed under section 860E(e) receive the information needed to compute the tax if the qualified entity's organizational documents require that it provide to the Internal Revenue Service and those persons a computation showing the present value of the total anticipated excess inclusions with respect to the residual interest for periods after the transfer. See § 1.860E-2(a)(5) for the obligation to furnish information on request.
(6)
Calendar year requirement.
A REMIC's taxable year is the calendar year. The first taxable year of a REMIC begins on the startup day and ends on December 31 of the same year. If the startup day is other than January 1, the REMIC has a short first taxable year.
(c)
Segregated pool of assets
—(1)
Formation of REMIC.
A REMIC may be formed as a segregated pool of assets rather than as a separate entity. To constitute a REMIC, the assets identified as part of the segregated pool must be treated for all Federal income tax purposes as assets of the REMIC and interests in the REMIC must be based solely on assets of the REMIC.
(2)
Identification of assets.
Formation of the REMIC does not occur until—
(i) The sponsor identifies the assets of the REMIC, such as through execution of an indenture with respect to the assets; and
(ii) The REMIC issues the regular and residual interests in the REMIC.
(3)
Qualified entity defined.
For purposes of this section, the term “qualified entity” includes an entity or a segregated pool of assets within an entity.
(d)
Election to be treated as a real estate mortgage investment conduit
—(1)
In general.
A qualified entity, as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, elects to be treated as a REMIC by timely filing, for the first taxable year of its existence, a Form 1066, U.S. Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit Income Tax Return, signed by a person authorized to sign that return under § 1.860F-4(c). See § 1.9100-1 for rules regarding extensions of time for making elections. Once made, this election is irrevocable for that taxable year and all succeeding taxable years.
(2)
Information required to be reported in the REMIC's first taxable year.
For the first taxable year of the REMIC's existence, the qualified entity, as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, must provide either on its return or in a separate statement attached to its return—
(i) The REMIC's employer identification number, which must not be the same as the identification number of any other entity,
(ii) Information concerning the terms and conditions of the regular interests and the residual interest of the REMIC, or a copy of the offering circular or prospectus containing such information,
(iii) A description of the prepayment and reinvestment assumptions that are made pursuant to section 1272(a)(6) and the regulations thereunder, including a statement supporting the selection of the prepayment assumption,
(iv) The form of the electing qualified entity under State law or, if an election is being made with respect to a segregated pool of assets within an entity, the form of the entity that holds the segregated pool of assets, and
(v) Any other information required by the form.
(3)
Requirement to keep sufficient records.
A qualified entity, as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, that elects to be a REMIC must keep sufficient records concerning its investments to show that it has complied with the provisions of sections 860A through 860G and the regulations thereunder during each taxable year.
[T.D. 8366, 56 FR 49516, Sept. 30, 1991; T.D. 8458, 57 FR 61301, Dec. 24, 1992]
§ 1.860E-1
Treatment of taxable income of a residual interest holder in excess of daily accruals.
(a)
Excess inclusion cannot be offset by otherwise allowable deductions
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the taxable income of any holder of a residual interest for any taxable year is in no event less than the sum of the excess inclusions attributable to that holder's residual interests for that taxable year. In computing the amount of a net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c)) or the amount of any net operating loss carryover (as defined in section 172(b)(2)), the amount of any excess inclusion is not included in gross income or taxable income. Thus, for example, if a residual interest holder has $100 of gross income, $25 of which is an excess inclusion, and $90 of business deductions, the holder has taxable income of $25, the amount of the excess inclusion, and a net operating loss of $15 ($75 of other income − $90 of business deductions).
(2)
Affiliated groups.
If a holder of a REMIC residual interest is a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated income tax return, the taxable income of the affiliated group cannot be less than the sum of the excess inclusions attributable to all residual interests held by members of the affiliated group.
(3)
Special rule for certain financial institutions
—(i)
In general.
If an organization to which section 593 applies holds a residual interest that has significant value (as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section), section 860E(a)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not apply to that organization with respect to that interest. Consequently, an organization to which section 593 applies may use its allowable deductions to offset an excess inclusion attributable to a residual interest that has significant value, but, except as provided in section 860E(a)(4)(A), may not use its allowable deductions to offset an excess inclusion attributable to a residual interest held by any other member of an affiliated group, if any, of which the organization is a member. Further, a net operating loss of any other member of an affiliated group of which the organization is a member may not be used to offset an excess inclusion attributable to a residual interest held by that organization.
(ii)
Ordering rule
—(A)
In general.
In computing taxable income for any year, an organization to which section 593 applies is treated as having applied its allowable deductions for the year first to offset that portion of its gross income that is not an excess inclusion and then to offset that portion of its income that is an excess inclusion.
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section:

# Example.
Corp.
X,
a corporation to which section 593 applies, is a member of an affiliated group that files a consolidated return. For a particular taxable year, Corp.
X
has gross income of $1,000, and of this amount, $150 is an excess inclusion attributable to a residual interest that has significant value. Corp.
X
has $975 of allowable deductions for the taxable year. Corp.
X
must apply its allowable deductions first to offset the $850 of gross income that is not an excess inclusion, and then to offset the portion of its gross income that is an excess inclusion. Thus, Corp.
X
has $25 of taxable income ($1,000−$975), and that $25 is an excess inclusion that may not be offset by losses sustained by other members of the affiliated group.
(iii)
Significant value.
A residual interest has significant value if—
(A) The aggregate of the issue prices of the residual interests in the REMIC is at least 2 percent of the aggregate of the issue prices of all residual and regular interests in the REMIC; and
(B) The anticipated weighted average life of the residual interests is at least 20 percent of the anticipated weighted average life of the REMIC.
(iv)
Determining anticipated weighted average life
—(A)
Anticipated weighted average life of the REMIC.
The anticipated weighted average life of a REMIC is the weighted average of the anticipated weighted average lives of all classes of interests in the REMIC. This weighted average is determined under the formula in paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, applied by treating all payments taken into account in computing the anticipated weighted average lives of regular and residual interests in the REMIC as principal payments on a single regular interest.
(B)
Regular interests that have a specified principal amount.
Generally, the anticipated weighted average life of a regular interest is determined by—
(
1
) Multiplying the amount of each anticipated principal payment to be made on the interest by the number of years (including fractions thereof) from the startup day (as defined in section 860G(a)(9) and § 1.860G-2(k)) to the related principal payment date;
(
2
) Adding the results; and
(
3
) Dividing the sum by the total principal paid on the regular interest.
(C)
Regular interests that have no specified principal amount or that have only a nominal principal amount, and all residual interests.
If a regular interest has no specified principal amount, or if the interest payments to be made on a regular interest are disproportionately high relative to its specified principal amount (as determined by reference to § 1.860G-1(b)(5)(i)), then, for purposes of computing the anticipated weighted average life of the interest, all anticipated payments on that interest, regardless of their designation as principal or interest, must be taken into account in applying the formula set out in paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(B) of this section. Moreover, for purposes of computing the weighted average life of a residual interest, all anticipated payments on that interest, regardless of their designation as principal or interest, must be taken into account in applying the formula set out in paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(B) of this section.
(D)
Anticipated payments.
The anticipated principal payments to be made on a regular interest subject to paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, and the anticipated payments to be made on a regular interest subject to paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(C) of this section or on a residual interest, must be determined based on—
(
1
) The prepayment and reinvestment assumptions adopted under section 1272(a)(6), or that would have been adopted had the REMIC's regular interests been issued with original issue discount; and
(
2
) Any required or permitted clean up calls or any required qualified liquidation provided for in the REMIC's organizational documents.
(b)
Treatment of residual interests held by REITs, RICs, common trust funds, and subchapter T cooperatives.
[Reserved]
(c)
Transfers of noneconomic residual interests
—(1)
In general.
A transfer of a noneconomic residual interest is disregarded for all Federal tax purposes if a significant purpose of the transfer was to enable the transferor to impede the assessment or collection of tax. A significant purpose to impede the assessment or collection of tax exists if the transferor, at the time of the transfer, either knew or should have known (had “improper knowledge”) that the transferee would be unwilling or unable to pay taxes due on its share of the taxable income of the REMIC.
(2)
Noneconomic residual interest.
A residual interest is a noneconomic residual interest unless, at the time of the transfer—
(i) The present value of the expected future distributions on the residual interest at least equals the product of the present value of the anticipated excess inclusions and the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b)(1) for the year in which the transfer occurs; and
(ii) The transferor reasonably expects that, for each anticipated excess inclusion, the transferee will receive distributions from the REMIC at or after the time at which the taxes accrue on the anticipated excess inclusion in an amount sufficient to satisfy the accrued taxes.
(3)
Computations.
The present value of the expected future distributions and the present value of the anticipated excess inclusions must be computed under the procedure specified in § 1.860E-2(a)(4) for determining the present value of anticipated excess inclusions in connection with the transfer of a residual interest to a disqualified organization.
(4)
Safe harbor for establishing lack of improper knowledge.
A transferor is presumed not to have improper knowledge if—
(i) The transferor conducted, at the time of the transfer, a reasonable investigation of the financial condition of the transferee and, as a result of the investigation, the transferor found that the transferee had historically paid its debts as they came due and
found no significant evidence to indicate that the transferee will not continue to pay its debts as they come due in the future;
(ii) The transferee represents to the transferor that it understands that, as the holder of the noneconomic residual interest, the transferee may incur tax liabilities in excess of any cash flows generated by the interest and that the transferee intends to pay taxes associated with holding the residual interest as they become due;
(iii) The transferee represents that it will not cause income from the noneconomic residual interest to be attributable to a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base (within the meaning of an applicable income tax treaty) of the transferee or another U.S. taxpayer; and
(iv) The transfer satisfies either the asset test in paragraph (c)(5) of this section or the formula test in paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
(5)
Asset test.
The transfer satisfies the asset test if it meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(5)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this section.
(i) At the time of the transfer, and at the close of each of the transferee's two fiscal years preceding the transferee's fiscal year of transfer, the transferee's gross assets for financial reporting purposes exceed $100 million and its net assets for financial reporting purposes exceed $10 million. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the gross assets and net assets of a transferee do not include any obligation of any related person (as defined in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section) or any other asset if a principal purpose for holding or acquiring the other asset is to permit the transferee to satisfy the conditions of this paragraph (c)(5)(i).
(ii) The transferee must be an eligible corporation (defined in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section) and must agree in writing that any subsequent transfer of the interest will be to another eligible corporation in a transaction that satisfies paragraphs (c)(4)(i), (ii), and (iii) and this paragraph (c)(5). The direct or indirect transfer of the residual interest to a foreign permanent establishment (within the meaning of an applicable income tax treaty) of a domestic corporation is a transfer that is not a transfer to an eligible corporation. A transfer also fails to meet the requirements of this paragraph (c)(5)(ii) if the transferor knows, or has reason to know, that the transferee will not honor the restrictions on subsequent transfers of the residual interest.
(iii) A reasonable person would not conclude, based on the facts and circumstances known to the transferor on or before the date of the transfer, that the taxes associated with the residual interest will not be paid. The consideration given to the transferee to acquire the noneconomic residual interest in the REMIC is only one factor to be considered, but the transferor will be deemed to know that the transferee cannot or will not pay if the amount of consideration is so low compared to the liabilities assumed that a reasonable person would conclude that the taxes associated with holding the residual interest will not be paid. In determining whether the amount of consideration is too low, the specific terms of the formula test in paragraph (c)(7) of this section need not be used.
(6)
Definitions for asset test.
The following definitions apply for purposes of paragraph (c)(5) of this section:
(i)
Eligible corporation
means any domestic C corporation (as defined in section 1361(a)(2)) other than—
(A) A corporation which is exempt from, or is not subject to, tax under section 11;
(B) An entity described in section 851(a) or 856(a);
(C) A REMIC; or
(D) An organization to which part I of subchapter T of chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code applies.
(ii)
Related person
is any person that—
(A) Bears a relationship to the transferee enumerated in section 267(b) or 707(b)(1), using “20 percent” instead of “50 percent” where it appears under the provisions; or
(B) Is under common control (within the meaning of section 52(a) and (b)) with the transferee.
(7)
Formula test.
The transfer satisfies the formula test if the present value of the anticipated tax liabilities associated with holding the residual interest does not exceed the sum of—
(i) The present value of any consideration given to the transferee to acquire the interest;
(ii) The present value of the expected future distributions on the interest; and
(iii) The present value of the anticipated tax savings associated with holding the interest as the REMIC generates losses.
(8)
Conditions and limitations on formula test.
The following rules apply for purposes of the formula test in paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
(i) The transferee is assumed to pay tax at a rate equal to the highest rate of tax specified in section 11(b)(1). If the transferee has been subject to the alternative minimum tax under section 55 in the preceding two years and will compute its taxable income in the current taxable year using the alternative minimum tax rate, then the tax rate specified in section 55(b)(1)(B) may be used in lieu of the highest rate specified in section 11(b)(1).
(ii) The direct or indirect transfer of the residual interest to a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base (within the meaning of an applicable income tax treaty) of a domestic transferee is not eligible for the formula test.
(iii) Present values are computed using a discount rate equal to the Federal short-term rate prescribed by section 1274(d) for the month of the transfer and the compounding period used by the taxpayer.
(9)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1. Transfer to partnership. X
transfers a noneconomic residual interest in a REMIC to Partnership
P
in a transaction that does not satisfy the formula test of paragraph (c)(7) of this section.
Y
and
Z
are the partners of
P.
Even if
Y
and
Z
are eligible corporations that satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, the transfer fails to satisfy the asset test requirements found in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section because
P
is a partnership rather than an eligible corporation within the meaning of (c)(6)(i) of this section.

# Example 2. Transfer to a corporation without capacity to carry additional residual interests.
During the first ten months of a year, Bank transfers five residual interests to Corporation
U
under circumstances meeting the requirements of the asset test in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Bank is the major creditor of
U
and consequently has access to
U
's financial records and has knowledge of
U
's financial circumstances. During the last month of the year, Bank transfers three additional residual interests to
U
in a transaction that does not meet the formula test of paragraph (c)(7) of this section. At the time of this transfer,
U
's financial records indicate it has retained the previously transferred residual interests.
U
's financial circumstances, including the aggregate tax liabilities it has assumed with respect to REMIC residual interests, would cause a reasonable person to conclude that
U
will be unable to meet its tax liabilities when due. The transfers in the last month of the year fail to satisfy the investigation requirement in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section and the asset test requirement of paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section because Bank has reason to know that
U
will not be able to pay the tax due on those interests.

# Example 3. Transfer to a foreign permanent establishment of an eligible corporation. R
transfers a noneconomic residual interest in a REMIC to the foreign permanent establishment of Corporation
T.
Solely because of paragraph (c)(8)(ii) of this section, the transfer does not satisfy the formula test of paragraph (c)(7) of this section. In addition, even if
T
is an eligible corporation, the transfer does not satisfy the asset test because the transfer fails the requirements of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.
(10)
Effective dates.
Paragraphs (c)(4) through (c)(9) of this section are applicable to transfers occurring on or after February 4, 2000, except for paragraphs (c)(4)(iii) and (c)(8)(iii) of this section, which are applicable for transfers occurring on or after August 19, 2002. For the dates of applicability of paragraphs (a) through (c)(3) and (d) of this section, see § 1.860A-1.
(d)
Transfers to foreign persons.
Paragraph (c) of this section does not apply to transfers of residual interests to which § 1.860G-3(a)(1), concerning transfers to certain foreign persons, applies.
[T.D. 8458, 57 FR 61302, Dec. 24, 1992; 58 FR 8098, Feb. 11, 1993; T.D. 9004, 67 FR 47453, July 19, 2002]
§ 1.860E-2
Tax on transfers of residual interests to certain organizations.
(a)
Transfers to disqualified organizations
—(1)
Payment of tax.
Any excise tax due under section 860E(e)(1) must be paid by the later of March 24, 1993, or
April 15th of the year following the calendar year in which the residual interest is transferred to a disqualified organization. The Commissioner may prescribe rules for the manner and method of collecting the tax.
(2)
Transitory ownership.
For purposes of section 860E (e) and this section, a transfer of a residual interest to a disqualified organization in connection with the formation of a REMIC is disregarded if the disqualified organization has a binding contract to sell the interest and the sale occurs within 7 days of the startup day (as defined in section 860G(a)(9) and § 1.860G-2(k)).
(3)
Anticipated excess inclusions.
The anticipated excess inclusions are the excess inclusions that are expected to accrue in each calendar quarter (or portion thereof) following the transfer of the residual interest. The anticipated excess inclusions must be determined as of the date the residual interest is transferred and must be based on—
(i) Events that have occurred up to the time of the transfer;
(ii) The prepayment and reinvestment assumptions adopted under section 1272(a)(6), or that would have been adopted had the REMIC's regular interests been issued with original issue discount; and
(iii) Any required or permitted clean up calls, or required qualified liquidation provided for in the REMIC's organizational documents.
(4)
Present value computation.
The present value of the anticipated excess inclusions is determined by discounting the anticipated excess inclusions from the end of each remaining calendar quarter in which those excess inclusions are expected to accrue to the date the disqualified organization acquires the residual interest. The discount rate to be used for this present value computation is the applicable Federal rate (as specified in section 1274(d)(1)) that would apply to a debt instrument that was issued on the date the disqualified organization acquired the residual interest and whose term ended on the close of the last quarter in which excess inclusions were expected to accrue with respect to the residual interest.
(5)
Obligation of REMIC to furnish information.
A REMIC is not obligated to determine if its residual interests have been transferred to a disqualified organization. However, upon request of a person designated in section 860E(e)(3), the REMIC must furnish information sufficient to compute the present value of the anticipated excess inclusions. The information must be furnished to the requesting party and to the Internal Revenue Service within 60 days of the request. A reasonable fee charged to the requestor is not income derived from a prohibited transaction within the meaning of section 860F(a).
(6)
Agent.
For purposes of section 860E(e)(3), the term “agent” includes a broker (as defined in section 6045(c) and § 1.6045-1(a)(1)), nominee, or other middleman.
(7)
Relief from liability
—(i)
Transferee furnishes information under penalties of perjury.
For purposes of section 860E(e)(4), a transferee is treated as having furnished an affidavit if the transferee furnishes—
(A) A social security number, and states under penalties of perjury that the social security number is that of the transferee; or
(B) A statement under penalties of perjury that it is not a disqualified organization.
(ii)
Amount required to be paid.
The amount required to be paid under section 860E(e)(7)(B) is equal to the product of the highest rate specified in section 11(b)(1) for the taxable year in which the transfer described in section 860E(e)(1) occurs and the amount of excess inclusions that accrued and were allocable to the residual interest during the period that the disqualified organization held the interest.
(b)
Tax on pass-thru entities
—(1)
Tax on excess inclusions.
Any tax due under section 860E(e)(6) must be paid by the later of March 24, 1993, or by the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year of the pass-thru entity in which the disqualified person is a record holder. The Commissioner may prescribe rules for the manner and method of collecting the tax.
(2)
Record holder furnishes information under penalties of perjury.
For purposes of section 860E(e)(6)(D), a record holder
is treated as having furnished an affidavit if the record holder furnishes—
(i) A social security number and states, under penalties of perjury, that the social security number is that of the record holder; or
(ii) A statement under penalties of perjury that it is not a disqualified organization.
(3)
Deductibility of tax.
Any tax imposed on a pass-thru entity pursuant to section 860E(e)(6)(A) is deductible against the gross amount of ordinary income of the pass-thru entity. For example, in the case of a REIT, the tax is deductible in determining real estate investment trust taxable income under section 857(b)(2).
(4)
Allocation of tax.
Dividends paid by a RIC or by a REIT are not preferential dividends within the meaning of section 562(c) solely because the tax expense incurred by the RIC or REIT under section 860E(e)(6) is allocated solely to the shares held by disqualified organizations.
[T.D. 8458, 57 FR 61304, Dec. 24, 1992]
§ 1.860F-1
Qualified liquidations.
A plan of liquidation need not be in any special form. If a REMIC specifies the first day in the 90-day liquidation period in a statement attached to its final return, then the REMIC will be considered to have adopted a plan of liquidation on the specified date.
[T.D. 8458, 57 FR 61304, Dec. 24, 1992]
§ 1.860F-2
Transfers to a REMIC.
(a)
Formation of a REMIC
—(1)
In general.
For Federal income tax purposes, a REMIC formation is characterized as the contribution of assets by a sponsor (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) to a REMIC in exchange for REMIC regular and residual interests. If, instead of exchanging its interest in mortgages and related assets for regular and residual interests, the sponsor arranges to have the REMIC issue some or all of the regular and residual interests for cash, after which the sponsor sells its interests in mortgages and related assets to the REMIC, the transaction is, nevertheless, viewed for Federal income tax purposes as the sponsor's exchange of mortgages and related assets for regular and residual interests, followed by a sale of some or all of those interests. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that the tax consequences associated with the formation of a REMIC are not affected by the actual sequence of steps taken by the sponsor.
(2)
Tiered arrangements
—(i)
Two or more REMICs formed pursuant to a single set of organizational documents.
Two or more REMICs can be created pursuant to a single set of organizational documents even if for state law purposes or for Federal securities law purposes those documents create only one organization. The organizational documents must, however, clearly and expressly identify the assets of, and the interests in, each REMIC, and each REMIC must satisfy all of the requirements of section 860D and the related regulations.
(ii)
A REMIC and one or more investment trusts formed pursuant to a single set of documents.
A REMIC (or two or more REMICs) and one or more investment trusts can be created pursuant to a single set of organizational documents and the separate existence of the REMIC(s) and the investment trust(s) will be respected for Federal income tax purposes even if for state law purposes or for Federal securities law purposes those documents create only one organization. The organizational documents for the REMIC(s) and the investment trust(s) must, however, require both the REMIC(s) and the investment trust(s) to account for items of income and ownership of assets for Federal tax purposes in a manner that respects the separate existence of the multiple entities. See § 1.860G-2(i) concerning issuance of regular interests coupled with other contractual rights for an illustration of the provisions of this paragraph.
(b)
Treatment of sponsor
—(1)
Sponsor defined.
A sponsor is a person who directly or indirectly exchanges qualified mortgages and related assets for regular and residual interests in a REMIC. A person indirectly exchanges interests in qualified mortgages and related assets for regular and residual interests in a REMIC if the person transfers, other than in a nonrecognition transaction, the mortgages and related assets to another person who acquires a
transitory ownership interest in those assets before exchanging them for interests in the REMIC, after which the transitory owner then transfers some or all of the interests in the REMIC to the first person.
(2)
Nonrecognition of gain or loss.
The sponsor does not recognize gain or loss on the direct or indirect transfer of any property to a REMIC in exchange for regular or residual interests in the REMIC. However, the sponsor, upon a subsequent sale of the REMIC regular or residual interests, may recognize gain or loss with respect to those interests.
(3)
Basis of contributed assets allocated among interests
—(i)
In general.
The aggregate of the adjusted bases of the regular and residual interests received by the sponsor in the exchange described in paragraph (a) of this section is equal to the aggregate of the adjusted bases of the property transferred by the sponsor in the exchange, increased by the amount of organizational expenses (as described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section). That total is allocated among all the interests received in proportion to their fair market values on the pricing date (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section) if any, or, if none, the startup day (as defined in section 860G(a)(9) and § 1.860G-2(k)).
(ii)
Organizational expenses
—(A)
Organizational expense defined.
An organizational expense is an expense that is incurred by the sponsor or by the REMIC and that is directly related to the creation of the REMIC. Further, the organizational expense must be incurred during a period beginning a reasonable time before the startup day and ending before the date prescribed by law for filing the first REMIC tax return (determined without regard to any extensions of time to file). The following are examples of organizational expenses: legal fees for services related to the formation of the REMIC, such as preparation of a pooling and servicing agreement and trust indenture; accounting fees related to the formation of the REMIC; and other administrative costs related to the formation of the REMIC.
(B)
Syndication expenses.
Syndication expenses are not organizational expenses. Syndication expenses are those expenses incurred by the sponsor or other person to market the interests in a REMIC, and, thus, are applied to reduce the amount realized on the sale of the interests. Examples of syndication expenses are brokerage fees, registration fees, fees of an underwriter or placement agent, and printing costs of the prospectus or placement memorandum and other selling or promotional material.
(iii)
Pricing date.
The term “pricing date” means the date on which the terms of the regular and residual interests are fixed and the prices at which a substantial portion of the regular interests will be sold are fixed.
(4)
Treatment of unrecognized gain or loss
—(i)
Unrecognized gain on regular interests.
For purposes of section 860F(b)(1)(C)(i), the sponsor must include in gross income the excess of the issue price of a regular interest over the sponsor's basis in the interest as if the excess were market discount (as defined in section 1278(a)(2)) on a bond and the sponsor had made an election under section 1278(b) to include this market discount currently in gross income. The sponsor is not, however, by reason of this paragraph (b)(4)(i), deemed to have made an election under section 1278(b) with respect to any other bonds.
(ii)
Unrecognized loss on regular interests.
For purposes of section 860F(b)(1)(D)(i), the sponsor treats the excess of the sponsor's basis in a regular interest over the issue price of the interest as if that excess were amortizable bond premium (as defined in section 171(b)) on a taxable bond and the sponsor had made an election under section 171(c). The sponsor is not, however, by reason of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), deemed to have made an election under section 171(c) with respect to any other bonds.
(iii)
Unrecognized gain on residual interests.
For purposes of section 860F(b)(1)(C)(ii), the sponsor must include in gross income the excess of the issue price of a residual interest over the sponsor's basis in the interest ratably over the anticipated weighted average life of the REMIC (as defined in § 1.860E-1(a)(3)(iv)).
(iv)
Unrecognized loss on residual interests.
For purposes of section
860F(b)(1)(D)(ii), the sponsor deducts the excess of the sponsor's basis in a residual interest over the issue price of the interest ratably over the anticipated weighted average life of the REMIC.
(5)
Additions to or reductions of the sponsor's basis.
The sponsor's basis in a regular or residual interest is increased by any amount included in the sponsor's gross income under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The sponsor's basis in a regular or residual interest is decreased by any amount allowed as a deduction and by any amount applied to reduce interest payments to the sponsor under paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.
(6)
Transferred basis property.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a transferee of a regular or residual interest is treated in the same manner as the sponsor to the extent that the basis of the transferee in the interest is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of the interest in the hands of the sponsor.
(c)
REMIC's basis in contributed assets.
For purposes of section 860F(b)(2), the aggregate of the REMIC's bases in the assets contributed by the sponsor to the REMIC in a transaction described in paragraph (a) of this section is equal to the aggregate of the issue prices (determined under section 860G(a)(10) and § 1.86G-1(d)) of all regular and residual interests in the REMIC.
[T.D. 8458, 57 FR 61304, Dec. 24, 1992; 58 FR 8098, Feb. 11, 1993]
§ 1.860F-4
REMIC reporting requirements and other administrative rules.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, for purposes of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code, a REMIC is treated as a partnership and any holder of a residual interest in the REMIC is treated as a partner. A REMIC is not subject, however, to the rules of subchapter C of chapter 63 of the Internal Revenue Code, relating to the treatment of partnership items, for a taxable year if there is at no time during the taxable year more than one holder of a residual interest in the REMIC. The identity of a holder of a residual interest in a REMIC is not treated as a partnership item with respect to the REMIC for purposes of subchapter C of chapter 63.
(b)
REMIC tax return
—(1)
In general.
To satisfy the requirement under section 6031 to make a return of income for each taxable year, a REMIC must file the return required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The due date and any extensions for filing the REMIC's annual return are determined as if the REMIC were a partnership.
(2)
Income tax return.
The REMIC must make a return, as required by section 6011(a), for each taxable year on Form 1066, U.S. Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit Income Tax Return. The return must include—
(i) The amount of principal outstanding on each class of regular interests as of the close of the taxable year,
(ii) The amount of the daily accruals determined under section 860E(c), and
(iii) The information specified in § 1.860D-1(d)(2) (i), (iv), and (v).
(c)
Signing of REMIC return
—(1)
In general.
Although a REMIC is generally treated as a partnership for purposes of subtitle F, for purposes of determining who is authorized to sign a REMIC's income tax return for any taxable year, the REMIC is not treated as a partnership and the holders of residual interests in the REMIC are not treated as partners. Rather, the REMIC return must be signed by a person who could sign the return of the entity absent the REMIC election. Thus, the return of a REMIC that is a corporation or trust under applicable State law must be signed by a corporate officer or a trustee, respectively. The return of a REMIC that consists of a segregated pool of assets must be signed by a person who could sign the return of the entity that owns the assets of the REMIC under applicable State law.
(2)
REMIC whose startup day is before November 10, 1988
—(i)
In general.
The income tax return of a REMIC whose startup day is before November 10, 1988, may be signed by any person who held a residual interest during the taxable year to which the return relates, or, as provided in section 6903, by a fiduciary, as defined in section 7701(a)(6), who is acting for the REMIC and who has furnished adequate notice in the manner prescribed in § 301.6903-1(b) of this chapter.
(ii)
Startup day.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, startup day means any day selected by a REMIC that is on or before the first day on which interests in such REMIC are issued.
(iii)
Exception.
A REMIC whose startup day is before November 10, 1988, may elect to have paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply, instead of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, in determining who is authorized to sign the REMIC return. See section 1006(t)(18)(B) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (102 Stat. 3426) and § 5h.6(a)(1) of this chapter for the time and manner for making this election.
(d)
Designation of tax matters person.
A REMIC may designate a tax matters person in the same manner in which a partnership may designate a tax matters partner under § 301.6231(a)(7)-1T of this chapter. For purposes of applying that section, all holders of residual interests in the REMIC are treated as general partners.
(e)
Notice to holders of residual interests
—(1)
Information required.
As of the close of each calendar quarter, a REMIC must provide to each person who held a residual interest in the REMIC during that quarter notice on Schedule Q (Form 1066) of information specified in paragraphs (e)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.
(i)
In general.
Each REMIC must provide to each of its residual interest holders the following information—
(A) That person's share of the taxable income or net loss of the REMIC for the calendar quarter;
(B) The amount of the excess inclusion (as defined in section 860E and the regulations thereunder), if any, with respect to that person's residual interest for the calendar quarter;
(C) If the holder of a residual interest is also a pass-through interest holder (as defined in § 1.67-3T(a)(2)), the allocable investment expenses (as defined in § 1.67-3T(a)(4)) for the calendar quarter, and
(D) Any other information required by Schedule Q (Form 1066).
(ii)
Information with respect to REMIC assets
—(A)
95 percent asset test.
For calendar quarters after 1988, each REMIC must provide to each of its residual interest holders the following information—
(
1
) The percentage of REMIC assets that are qualifying real property loans under section 593,
(
2
) The percentage of REMIC assets that are assets described in section 7701(a)(19), and
(
3
) The percentage of REMIC assets that are real estate assets defined in section 856(c)(6)(B), computed by reference to the average adjusted basis (as defined in section 1011) of the REMIC assets during the calendar quarter (as described in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section). If the percentage of REMIC assets represented by a category is at least 95 percent, then the REMIC need only specify that the percentage for that category was at least 95 percent.
(B)
Additional information required if the 95 percent test not met.
If, for any calendar quarter after 1988, less than 95 percent of the assets of the REMIC are real estate assets defined in section 856(c)(6)(B), then, for that calendar quarter, the REMIC must also provide to any real estate investment trust (REIT) that holds a residual interest the following information—
(
1
) The percentage of REMIC assets described in section 856(c)(5)(A), computed by reference to the average adjusted basis of the REMIC assets during the calendar quarter (as described in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section),
(
2
) The percentage of REMIC gross income (other than gross income from prohibited transactions defined in section 860F(a)(2)) described in section 856(c)(3)(A) through (E), computed as of the close of the calendar quarter, and
(
3
) The percentage of REMIC gross income (other than gross income from prohibited transactions defined in section 860F(a)(2)) described in section 856(c)(3)(F), computed as of the close of the calendar quarter. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B)(
3
), the term “foreclosure property” contained in section 856(c)(3)(F) has the meaning specified in section 860G(a)(8).
In determining whether a REIT satisfies the limitations of section 856(c)(2), all REMIC gross income is deemed to be derived from a source specified in section 856(c)(2).
(C)
For calendar quarters in 1987.
For calendar quarters in 1987, the percentages of assets required in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section may be computed by reference to the fair market value of the assets of the REMIC as of the close of the calendar quarter (as described in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section), instead of by reference to the average adjusted basis during the calendar quarter.
(D)
For calendar quarters in 1988 and 1989.
For calendar quarters in 1988 and 1989, the percentages of assets required in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section may be computed by reference to the average fair market value of the assets of the REMIC during the calendar quarter (as described in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section), instead of by reference to the average adjusted basis of the assets of the REMIC during the calendar quarter.
(iii)
Special provisions.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the percentage of REMIC assets represented by a specified category computed by reference to average adjusted basis (or fair market value) of the assets during a calendar quarter is determined by dividing the average adjusted bases (or for calendar quarters before 1990, fair market value) of the assets in the specified category by the average adjusted basis (or, for calendar quarters before 1990, fair market value) of all the assets of the REMIC as of the close of each month, week, or day during that calendar quarter. The monthly, weekly, or daily computation period must be applied uniformly during the calendar quarter to all categories of assets and may not be changed in succeeding calendar quarters without the consent of the Commissioner.
(2)
Quarterly notice required
—(i)
In general.
Schedule Q must be mailed (or otherwise delivered) to each holder of a residual interest during a calendar quarter no later than the last day of the month following the close of the calendar quarter.
(ii)
Special rule for 1987.
Notice to any holder of a REMIC residual interest of the information required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for any of the four calendar quarters of 1987 must be mailed (or otherwise delivered) to each holder no later than March 28, 1988.
(3)
Nominee reporting
—(i)
In general.
If a REMIC is required under paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section to provide notice to an interest holder who is a nominee of another person with respect to an interest in the REMIC, the nominee must furnish that notice to the person for whom it is a nominee.
(ii)
Time for furnishing statement.
The nominee must furnish the notice required under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section to the person for whom it is a nominee no later than 30 days after receiving this information.
(4)
Reports to the Internal Revenue Service.
For each person who was a residual interest holder at any time during a REMIC's taxable year, the REMIC must attach a copy of Schedule Q to its income tax return for that year for each quarter in which that person was a residual interest holder. Quarterly notice to the Internal Revenue Service is not required.
(f)
Information returns for persons engaged in a trade or business.
See § 1.6041-1(b)(2) for the treatment of a REMIC under sections 6041 and 6041A.
[T.D. 8366, 56 FR 49516, Sept. 30, 1991, as amended by T.D. 8458, 57 FR 61306, Dec. 24, 1992; 58 FR 8098, Feb. 11, 1993; T.D. 9184, 70 FR 9219, Feb. 25, 2005]
§ 1.860G-1
Definition of regular and residual interests.
(a)
Regular interest
—(1)
Designation as a regular interest.
For purposes of section 860G(a)(1), a REMIC designates an interest as a regular interest by providing to the Internal Revenue Service the information specified in § 1.860D-1(d)(2)(ii) in the time and manner specified in § 1.860D-1(d)(2).
(2)
Specified portion of the interest payments on qualified mortgages
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of section 860G(a)(1)(B)(ii), a specified portion of the interest payments on qualified mortgages means a portion of the interest payable on qualified mortgages, but only if the portion can be expressed as—
(A) A fixed percentage of the interest that is payable at either a fixed rate or at a variable rate described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section on some or all of the qualified mortgages;
(B) A fixed number of basis points of the interest payable on some or all of the qualified mortgages; or
(C) The interest payable at either a fixed rate or at a variable rate described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section on some or all of the qualified mortgages in excess of a fixed number of basis points or in excess of a variable rate described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(ii)
Specified portion cannot vary.
The portion must be established as of the startup day (as defined in section 860G(a)(9) and § 1.860G-2(k)) and, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, it cannot vary over the period that begins on the startup day and ends on the day that the interest holder is no longer entitled to receive payments.
(iii)
Defaulted or delinquent mortgages.
A portion is not treated as varying over time if an interest holder's entitlement to a portion of the interest on some or all of the qualified mortgages is dependent on the absence of defaults or delinquencies on those mortgages.
(iv)
No minimum specified principal amount is required.
If an interest in a REMIC consists of a specified portion of the interest payments on the REMIC's qualified mortgages, no minimum specified principal amount need be assigned to that interest. The specified principal amount can be zero.
(v)
Specified portion includes portion of interest payable on regular interest.
(A) The specified portions that meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section include a specified portion that can be expressed as a fixed percentage of the interest that is payable on some or all of the qualified mortgages where—
(
1
) Each of those qualified mortgages is a regular interest issued by another REMIC; and
(
2
) With respect to that REMIC in which it is a regular interest, each of those regular interests bears interest that can be expressed as a specified portion as described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.
(B) See § 1.860A-1(a) for the effective date of this paragraph (a)(2)(v).
(vi)
Examples.
The following examples, each of which describes a pass-thru trust that is intended to qualify as a REMIC, illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (a)(2).

# Example 1.
(i) A sponsor transferred a pool of fixed rate mortgages to a trustee in exchange for two classes of certificates. The Class A certificate holders are entitled to all principal payments on the mortgages and to interest on outstanding principal at a variable rate based on the current value of One-Month LIBOR, subject to a lifetime cap equal to the weighted average rate payable on the mortgages. The Class B certificate holders are entitled to all interest payable on the mortgages in excess of the interest paid on the Class A certificates. The Class B certificates are subordinate to the Class A certificates so that cash flow shortfalls due to defaults or delinquencies on the mortgages will be borne first by the Class B certificate holders.
(ii) The Class B certificate holders are entitled to all interest payable on the pooled mortgages in excess of a variable rate described in paragraph (a)(3)(vi) of this section. Moreover, the portion of the interest payable to the Class B certificate holders is not treated as varying over time solely because payments on the Class B certificates may be reduced as a result of defaults or delinquencies on the pooled mortgages. Thus, the Class B certificates provide for interest payments that consist of a specified portion of the interest payable on the pooled mortgages under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C) of this section.

# Example 2.
(i) A sponsor transferred a pool of variable rate mortgages to a trustee in exchange for two classes of certificates. The mortgages call for interest payments at a variable rate based on the current value of the One-Year Constant Maturity Treasury Index (hereinafter “CMTI”) plus 200 basis points, subject to a lifetime cap of 12 percent. Class C certificate holders are entitled to all principal payments on the mortgages and interest on the outstanding principal at a variable rate based on the One-Year CMTI plus 100 basis points, subject to a lifetime cap of 12 percent. The interest rate on the Class C certificates is reset at the same time the rate is reset on the pooled mortgages.
(ii) The Class D certificate holders are entitled to all interest payments on the mortgages in excess of the interest paid on the Class C certificates. So long as the One-Year CMTI is at 10 percent or lower, the Class D certificate holders are entitled to 100 basis points of interest on the pooled mortgages. If, however, the index exceeds 10 percent on a reset date, the Class D certificate holders' entitlement shrinks, and it disappears if the index is at 11 percent or higher.
(iii) The Class D certificate holders are entitled to all interest payable on the pooled mortgages in excess of a qualified variable rate described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Thus, the Class D certificates provide
for interest payments that consist of a specified portion of the interest payable on the qualified mortgages under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C) of this section.

# Example 3.
(i) A sponsor transferred a pool of fixed rate mortgages to a trustee in exchange for two classes of certificates. The fixed interest rate payable on the mortgages varies from mortgage to mortgage, but all rates are between 8 and 10 percent. The Class E certificate holders are entitled to receive all principal payments on the mortgages and interest on outstanding principal at 7 percent. The Class F certificate holders are entitled to receive all interest on the mortgages in excess of the interest paid on the Class E certificates.
(ii) The Class F certificates provide for interest payments that consist of a specified portion of the interest payable on the mortgages under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Although the portion of the interest payable to the Class F certificate holders varies from mortgage to mortgage, the interest payable can be expressed as a fixed percentage of the interest payable on each particular mortgage.
(3)
Variable rate.
A regular interest may bear interest at a variable rate. For purposes of section 860G(a)(1)(B)(i), a variable rate of interest is a rate described in this paragraph (a)(3).
(i)
Rate based on current interest rate.
A qualified floating rate as defined in § 1.1275-5(b)(1) (but without the application of paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of that section) set at a current value, as defined in § 1.1275-5(a)(4), is a variable rate. In addition, a rate equal to the highest, lowest, or average of two or more qualified floating rates is a variable rate. For example, a rate based on the average cost of funds of one or more financial institutions is a variable rate.
(ii)
Weighted average rate
—(A)
In general.
A rate based on a weighted average of the interest rates on some or all of the qualified mortgages held by a REMIC is a variable rate. The qualified mortgages taken into account must, however, bear interest at a fixed rate or at a rate described in this paragraph (a)(3). Generally, a weighted average interest rate is a rate that, if applied to the aggregate outstanding principal balance of a pool of mortgage loans for an accrual period, produces an amount of interest that equals the sum of the interest payable on the pooled loans for that accrual period. Thus, for an accrual period in which a pool of mortgage loans comprises $300,000 of loans bearing a 7 percent interest rate and $700,000 of loans bearing a 9.5 percent interest rate, the weighted average rate for the pool of loans is 8.75 percent.
(B)
Reduction in underlying rate.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, an interest rate is considered to be based on a weighted average rate even if, in determining that rate, the interest rate on some or all of the qualified mortgages is first subject to a cap or a floor, or is first reduced by a number of basis points or a fixed percentage. A rate determined by taking a weighted average of the interest rates on the qualified mortgage loans net of any servicing spread, credit enhancement fees, or other expenses of the REMIC is a rate based on a weighted average rate for the qualified mortgages. Further, the amount of any rate reduction described above may vary from mortgage to mortgage.
(iii)
Additions, subtractions, and multiplications.
A rate is a variable rate if it is—
(A) Expressed as the product of a rate described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section and a fixed multiplier;
(B) Expressed as a constant number of basis points more or less than a rate described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section; or
(C) Expressed as the product, plus or minus a constant number of basis points, of a rate described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section and a fixed multiplier (which may be either a positive or a negative number).
(iv)
Caps and floors.
A rate is a variable rate if it is a rate that would be described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section except that it is—
(A) Limited by a cap or ceiling that establishes either a maximum rate or a maximum number of basis points by which the rate may increase from one accrual or payment period to another or over the term of the interest; or
(B) Limited by a floor that establishes either a minimum rate or a maximum number of basis points by which the rate may decrease from one accrual or payment period to another or over the term of the interest.
(v)
Funds-available caps
—(A)
In general.
A rate is a variable rate if it is a
rate that would be described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section except that it is subject to a “funds-available” cap. A funds-available cap is a limit on the amount of interest to be paid on an instrument in any accrual or payment period that is based on the total amount available for the distribution, including both principal and interest received by an issuing entity on some or all of its qualified mortgages as well as amounts held in a reserve fund. The term “funds-available cap” does not, however, include any cap or limit on interest payments used as a device to avoid the standards of paragraph (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(B)
Facts and circumstances test.
In determining whether a cap or limit on interest payments is a funds-available cap within the meaning of this section and not a device used to avoid the standards of paragraph (a)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section, one must consider all of the facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances that must be taken into consideration are—
(
1
) Whether the rate of the interest payable to the regular interest holders is below the rate payable on the REMIC's qualified mortgages on the start-up day; and
(
2
) Whether, historically, the rate of interest payable to the regular interest holders has been consistently below that payable on the qualified mortgages.
(C)
Examples.
The following examples, both of which describe a pass-thru trust that is intended to qualify as a REMIC, illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (a)(3)(v).

# Example 1.
(i) A sponsor transferred a pool of mortgages to a trustee in exchange for two classes of certificates. The pool of mortgages has an aggregate principal balance of $100
x.
Each mortgage in the pool provides for interest payments based on the eleventh district cost of funds index (hereinafter COFI) plus a margin. The initial weighted average rate for the pool is COFI plus 200 basis points. The trust issued a Class X certificate that has a principal amount of $100
x
and that provides for interest payments at a rate equal to One-Year LIBOR plus 100 basis points, subject to a cap described below. The Class R certificate, which the sponsor designated as the residual interest, entitles its holder to all funds left in the trust after the Class X certificates have been retired. The Class R certificate holder is not entitled to current distributions.
(ii) At the time the certificates were issued, COFI equaled 4.874 percent and One-Year LIBOR equaled 3.375 percent. Thus, the initial weighted average pool rate was 6.874 percent and the Class X certificate rate was 4.375 percent. Based on historical data, the sponsor does not expect the rate paid on the Class X certificate to exceed the weighted average rate on the pool.
(iii) Initially, under the terms of the trust instrument, the excess of COFI plus 200 over One-Year LIBOR plus 100 (excess interest) will be applied to pay expenses of the trust, to fund any required reserves, and then to reduce the principal balance on the Class X certificate. Consequently, although the aggregate principal balance of the mortgages initially matched the principal balance of the Class X certificate, the principal balance on the Class X certificate will pay down faster than the principal balance on the mortgages as long as the weighted average rate on the mortgages is greater than One-Year LIBOR plus 100. If, however, the rate on the Class X certificate (One-Year LIBOR plus 100) ever exceeds the weighted average rate on the mortgages, then the Class X certificate holders will receive One-Year LIBOR plus 100 subject to a cap based on the current funds that are available for distribution.
(iv) The funds available cap here is not a device used to avoid the standards of paragraph (a)(3) (i) through (iv) of this section. First, on the date the Class X certificates were issued, a significant spread existed between the weighted average rate payable on the mortgages and the rate payable on the Class X certificate. Second, historical data suggest that the weighted average rate payable on the mortgages will continue to exceed the rate payable on the Class X certificate. Finally, because the excess interest will be applied to reduce the outstanding principal balance of the Class X certificate more rapidly than the outstanding principal balance on the mortgages is reduced, One-Year LIBOR plus 100 basis points would have to exceed the weighted average rate on the mortgages by an increasingly larger amount before the funds available cap would be triggered. Accordingly, the rate paid on the Class X certificates is a variable rate.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as those in
Example 1,
except that the pooled mortgages are commercial mortgages that provide for interest payments based on the gross profits of the mortgagors, and the rate on the Class X certificates is 400 percent on One-Year LIBOR (a variable rate under paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section), subject to a cap equal to current funds available to the trustee for distribution.
(ii) Initially, 400 percent of One-Year LIBOR exceeds the weighted average rate
payable on the mortgages. Furthermore, historical data suggest that there is a significant possibility that, in the future, 400 percent of One-Year LIBOR will exceed the weighted average rate on the mortgages.
(iii) The facts and circumstances here indicate that the use of 400 percent of One-Year LIBOR with the above-described cap is a device to pass through to the Class X certificate holder contingent interest based on mortgagor profits. Consequently, the rate paid on the Class X certificate here is not a variable rate.
(vi)
Combination of rates.
A rate is a variable rate if it is based on—
(A) One fixed rate during one or more accrual or payment periods and a different fixed rate or rates, or a rate or rates described in paragraph (a)(3) (i) through (v) of this section, during other accrual or payment periods; or
(B) A rate described in paragraph (a)(3) (i) through (v) of this section during one or more accrual or payment periods and a fixed rate or rates, or a different rate or rates described in paragraph (a)(3) (i) through (v) of this section in other periods.
(4)
Fixed terms on the startup day.
For purposes of section 860G(a)(1), a regular interest in a REMIC has fixed terms on the startup day if, on the startup day, the REMIC's organizational documents irrevocably specify—
(i) The principal amount (or other similar amount) of the regular interest;
(ii) The interest rate or rates used to compute any interest payments (or other similar amounts) on the regular interest; and
(iii) The latest possible maturity date of the interest.
(5)
Contingencies prohibited.
Except for the contingencies specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (e)(4) of this section, the principal amount (or other similar amount) and the latest possible maturity date of the interest must not be contingent.
(b)
Special rules for regular interests
—(1)
Call premium.
An interest in a REMIC does not qualify as a regular interest if the terms of the interest entitle the holder of that interest to the payment of any premium that is determined with reference to the length of time that the regular interest is outstanding and is not described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(2)
Customary prepayment penalties received with respect to qualified mortgages.
An interest in a REMIC does not fail to qualify as a regular interest solely because the REMIC's organizational documents provide that the REMIC must allocate among and pay to its regular interest holders any customary prepayment penalties that the REMIC receives with respect to its qualified mortgages. Moreover, a REMIC may allocate prepayment penalties among its classes of interests in any manner specified in the REMIC's organizational documents. For example, a REMIC could allocate all or substantially all of a prepayment penalty that it receives to holders of an interest-only class of interests because that class would be most significantly affected by prepayments.
(3)
Certain contingencies disregarded.
An interest in a REMIC does not fail to qualify as a regular interest solely because it is issued subject to some or all of the contingencies described in paragraph (b)(3) (i) through (vi) of this section.
(i)
Prepayments, income, and expenses.
An interest does not fail to qualify as a regular interest solely because—
(A) The timing of (but not the right to or amount of) principal payments (or other similar amounts) is affected by the extent of prepayments on some or all of the qualified mortgages held by the REMIC or the amount of income from permitted investments (as defined in § 1.860G-2(g)); or
(B) The timing of interest and principal payments is affected by the payment of expenses incurred by the REMIC.
(ii)
Credit losses.
An interest does not fail to qualify as a regular interest solely because the amount or the timing of payments of principal or interest (or other similar amounts) with respect to a regular interest is affected by defaults on qualified mortgages and permitted investments, unanticipated expenses incurred by the REMIC, or lower than expected returns on permitted investments.
(iii)
Subordinated interests.
An interest does not fail to qualify as a regular interest solely because that interest bears all, or a disproportionate share, of the losses stemming from cash flow
shortfalls due to defaults or delinquencies on qualified mortgages or permitted investments, unanticipated expenses incurred by the REMIC, lower than expected returns on permitted investments, or prepayment interest shortfalls before other regular interests or the residual interest bear losses occasioned by those shortfalls.
(iv)
Deferral of interest.
An interest does not fail to qualify as a regular interest solely because that interest, by its terms, provides for deferral of interest payments.
(v)
Prepayment interest shortfalls.
An interest does not fail to qualify as a regular interest solely because the amount of interest payments is affected by prepayments of the underlying mortgages.
(vi)
Remote and incidental contingencies.
An interest does not fail to qualify as a regular interest solely because the amount or timing of payments of principal or interest (or other similar amounts) with respect to the interest is subject to a contingency if there is only a remote likelihood that the contingency will occur. For example, an interest could qualify as a regular interest even though full payment of principal and interest on that interest is contingent upon the absence of significant cash flow shortfalls due to the operation of the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act, 50 U.S.C. app. 526 (1988).
(4)
Form of regular interest.
A regular interest in a REMIC may be issued in the form of debt, stock, an interest in a partnership or trust, or any other form permitted by state law. If a regular interest in a REMIC is not in the form of debt, it must, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section, entitle the holder to a specified amount that would, were the interest issued in debt form, be identified as the principal amount of the debt.
(5)
Interest disproportionate to principal
—(i)
In general.
An interest in a REMIC does not qualify as a regular interest if the amount of interest (or other similar amount) payable to the holder is disproportionately high relative to the principal amount or other specified amount described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section (specified principal amount). Interest payments (or other similar amounts) are considered disproportionately high if the issue price (as determined under paragraph (d) of this section) of the interest in the REMIC exceeds 125 percent of its specified principal amount.
(ii)
Exception.
A regular interest in a REMIC that entitles the holder to interest payments consisting of a specified portion of interest payments on qualified mortgages qualifies as a regular interest even if the amount of interest is disproportionately high relative to the specified principal amount.
(6)
Regular interest treated as a debt instrument for all Federal income tax purposes.
In determining the tax under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, a REMIC regular interest (as defined in section 860G(a)(1)) is treated as a debt instrument that is an obligation of the REMIC. Thus, sections 1271 through 1288, relating to bonds and other debt instruments, apply to a regular interest. For special rules relating to the accrual of original issue discount on regular interests, see section 1272(a)(6).
(c)
Residual interest.
A residual interest is an interest in a REMIC that is issued on the startup day and that is designated as a residual interest by providing the information specified in § 1.860D-1(d)(2)(ii) at the time and in the manner provided in § 1.860D-1(d)(2). A residual interest need not entitle the holder to any distributions from the REMIC.
(d)
Issue price of regular and residual interests
—(1)
In general.
The issue price of any REMIC regular or residual interest is determined under section 1273(b) as if the interest were a debt instrument and, if issued for property, as if the requirements of section 1273(b)(3) were met. Thus, if a class of interests is publicly offered, then the issue price of an interest in that class is the initial offering price to the public at which a substantial amount of the class is sold. If the interest is in a class that is not publicly offered, the issue price is the price paid by the first buyer of that interest regardless of the price paid for the remainder of the class. If the interest is in a class that is retained by the sponsor, the issue price is its fair market value on the pricing date (as defined in § 1.860F-2(b)(3)(iii)), if any, or, if none, the
startup day, regardless of whether the property exchanged therefor is publicly traded.
(2)
The public.
The term “the public” for purposes of this section does not include brokers or other middlemen, nor does it include the sponsor who acquires all of the regular and residual interests from the REMIC on the startup day in a transaction described in § 1.860F-2(a).
(e)
Transition from certain interbank offered rates
—(1)
In general.
This paragraph (e) provides rules relating to the modification of the terms of a regular interest in a REMIC or the terms of an asset held by a REMIC as part of the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate and certain other interbank offered rates. For purposes of this paragraph (e),
covered modification
and
discontinued IBOR
have the meanings provided in § 1.1001-6(h)(1) and (4), respectively. See § 1.1001-6 for additional rules that may apply to an interest in a REMIC that provides for a rate referencing a discontinued IBOR.
(2)
Change in reference rate for a regular interest after the startup day.
A covered modification of a regular interest in a REMIC that occurs after the startup day is disregarded in determining whether the modified regular interest has fixed terms on the startup day under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(3)
Contingencies of rate on a regular interest.
An interest in a REMIC does not fail to qualify as a regular interest solely because it is subject to a contingency whereby a rate that references a discontinued IBOR and is a variable rate permitted under paragraph (a)(3) of this section may change to a fixed rate or a different variable rate permitted under paragraph (a)(3) of this section in anticipation of the discontinued IBOR becoming unavailable or unreliable.
(4)
Reasonable expenses incurred to make covered modifications.
An interest in a REMIC does not fail to qualify as a regular interest solely because it is subject to a contingency whereby the amount of payments of principal or interest (or other similar amounts) with respect to the interest in the REMIC is reduced by reasonable costs incurred to effect a covered modification. In addition, payment by a party other than the REMIC of reasonable costs incurred to effect a covered modification is not a contribution to the REMIC for purposes of section 860G(d).
[T.D. 8458, 57 FR 61306, Dec. 24, 1992; 58 FR 8098, Feb. 11, 1993; 58 FR 15089, Mar. 19, 1993; T.D. 8614, 60 FR 42787, Aug. 17, 1995; T.D. 9961, 87 FR 175, Jan. 4, 2022]
§ 1.860G-2
Other rules.
(a)
Obligations principally secured by an interest in real property
—(1)
Tests for determining whether an obligation is principally secured.
For purposes of section 860G(a)(3)(A), an obligation is principally secured by an interest in real property only if it satisfies either the test set out in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or the test set out in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.
(i)
The 80-percent test.
An obligation is principally secured by an interest in real property if the fair market value of the interest in real property securing the obligation—
(A) Was at least equal to 80 percent of the adjusted issue price of the obligation at the time the obligation was originated (see paragraph (b)(1) of this section concerning the origination date for obligations that have been significantly modified); or
(B) Is at least equal to 80 percent of the adjusted issue price of the obligation at the time the sponsor contributes the obligation to the REMIC.
(ii)
Alternative test.
For purposes of section 860G(a)(3)(A), an obligation is principally secured by an interest in real property if substantially all of the proceeds of the obligation were used to acquire or to improve or protect an interest in real property that, at the origination date, is the only security for the obligation. For purposes of this test, loan guarantees made by the United States or any state (or any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of the United States or of any state), or other third party credit enhancement are not viewed as additional security for a loan. An obligation is not considered to be secured by property other than real property solely because the obligor is personally liable on the obligation.
(2)
Treatment of liens.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the fair market value of the real property
interest must be first reduced by the amount of any lien on the real property interest that is senior to the obligation being tested, and must be further reduced by a proportionate amount of any lien that is in parity with the obligation being tested.
(3)
Safe harbor
—(i)
Reasonable belief that an obligation is principally secured.
If, at the time the sponsor contributes an obligation to a REMIC, the sponsor reasonably believes that the obligation is principally secured by an interest in real property within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, then the obligation is deemed to be so secured for purposes of section 860G(a)(3). A sponsor cannot avail itself of this safe harbor with respect to an obligation if the sponsor actually knows or has reason to know that the obligation fails both of the tests set out in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Basis for reasonable belief.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, a sponsor may base a reasonable belief concerning any obligation on—
(A) Representations and warranties made by the originator of the obligation; or
(B) Evidence indicating that the originator of the obligation typically made mortgage loans in accordance with an established set of parameters, and that any mortgage loan originated in accordance with those parameters would satisfy at least one of the tests set out in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(iii)
Later discovery that an obligation is not principally secured.
If, despite the sponsor's reasonable belief concerning an obligation at the time it contributed the obligation to the REMIC, the REMIC later discovers that the obligation is not principally secured by an interest in real property, the obligation is a defective obligation and loses its status as a qualified mortgage 90 days after the date of discovery. See paragraph (f) of this section, relating to defective obligations.
(4)
Interests in real property; real property.
The definition of “interests in real property” set out in § 1.856-3(c), and the definition of “real property” set out in § 1.856-3(d), apply to define those terms for purposes of section 860G(a)(3) and paragraph (a) of this section.
(5)
Obligations secured by an interest in real property.
Obligations secured by interests in real property include the following: mortgages, deeds of trust, and installment land contracts; mortgage pass-thru certificates guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC, or CMHC (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation); other investment trust interests that represent undivided beneficial ownership in a pool of obligations principally secured by interests in real property and related assets that would be considered to be permitted investments if the investment trust were a REMIC, and provided the investment trust is classified as a trust under § 301.7701-4(c) of this chapter; and obligations secured by manufactured housing treated as single family residences under section 25(e)(10) (without regard to the treatment of the obligations or the properties under state law).
(6)
Obligations secured by other obligations; residual interests.
Obligations (other than regular interests in a REMIC) that are secured by other obligations are not principally secured by interests in real property even if the underlying obligations are secured by interests in real property. Thus, for example, a collateralized mortgage obligation issued by an issuer that is not a REMIC is not an obligation principally secured by an interest in real property. A residual interest (as defined in section 860G(a)(2)) is not an obligation principally secured by an interest in real property.
(7)
Certain instruments that call for contingent payments are obligations.
For purposes of section 860G(a)(3) and (4), the term “obligation” includes any instrument that provides for total noncontingent principal payments that at least equal the instrument's issue price even if that instrument also provides for contingent payments. Thus, for example, an instrument that was issued for $100
x
and that provides for noncontingent principal payments of $100
x,
interest payments at a fixed rate, and contingent payments based on a percentage of the mortgagor's gross receipts, is an obligation.
(8)
Release of a lien on an interest in real property securing a qualified mortgage; defeasance.
If a REMIC releases its lien on an interest in real property
that secures a qualified mortgage, that mortgage ceases to be a qualified mortgage on the date the lien is released unless—
(i) The REMIC releases its lien in a modification that—
(A) Either is not a significant modification as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section or is one of the listed exceptions set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and
(B) Following that modification, the obligation continues to be principally secured by an interest in real property as determined by paragraph (b)(7) of this section; or
(ii) The mortgage is defeased in the following manner—
(A) The mortgagor pledges substitute collateral that consists solely of government securities (as defined in section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended
(15 U.S.C. 80a-1)
);
(B) The mortgage documents allow such a substitution;
(C) The lien is released to facilitate the disposition of the property or any other customary commercial transaction, and not as part of an arrangement to collateralize a REMIC offering with obligations that are not real estate mortgages; and
(D) The release is not within 2 years of the startup day.
(9)
Stripped bonds and coupons.
The term “qualified mortgage” includes stripped bonds and stripped coupons (as defined in section 1286(e) (2) and (3)) if the bonds (as defined in section 1286(e)(1)) from which such stripped bonds or stripped coupons arose would have been qualified mortgages.
(b)
Assumptions and modifications
—(1)
Significant modifications are treated as exchanges of obligations.
If an obligation is significantly modified in a manner or under circumstances other than those described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, then the modified obligation is treated as one that was newly issued in exchange for the unmodified obligation that it replaced. Consequently—
(i) If such a significant modification occurs after the obligation has been contributed to the REMIC and the modified obligation is not a qualified replacement mortgage, the modified obligation will not be a qualified mortgage and the deemed disposition of the unmodified obligation will be a prohibited transaction under section 860F(a)(2); and
(ii) If such a significant modification occurs before the obligation is contributed to the REMIC, the modified obligation will be viewed as having been originated on the date the modification occurs for purposes of the tests set out in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(2)
Significant modification defined.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a “significant modification” is any change in the terms of an obligation that would be treated as an exchange of obligations under section 1001 and the related regulations.
(3)
Exceptions.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the following changes in the terms of an obligation are not significant modifications regardless of whether they would be significant modifications under paragraph (b)(2) of this section—
(i) Changes in the terms of the obligation occasioned by default or a reasonably foreseeable default;
(ii) Assumption of the obligation;
(iii) Waiver of a due-on-sale clause or a due-on-encumbrance clause;
(iv) Conversion of an interest rate by a mortgagor pursuant to the terms of a convertible mortgage;
(v) A modification that releases, substitutes, adds, or otherwise alters a substantial amount of the collateral for, a guarantee on, or other form of credit enhancement for, a recourse or nonrecourse obligation, so long as the obligation continues to be principally secured by an interest in real property following the release, substitution, addition, or other alteration as determined by paragraph (b)(7) of this section; and
(vi) A change in the nature of the obligation from recourse (or substantially all recourse) to nonrecourse (or substantially all nonrecourse), or from nonrecourse (or substantially all nonrecourse) to recourse (or substantially all recourse), so long as the obligation continues to be principally secured by an interest in real property following such a change as determined by paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
(4)
Modifications that are not significant modifications.
If an obligation is modified and the modification is not a significant modification for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, then the modified obligation is not treated as one that was newly originated on the date of modification.
(5)
Assumption defined.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a mortgage has been assumed if—
(i) The buyer of the mortgaged property acquires the property subject to the mortgage, without assuming any personal liability;
(ii) The buyer becomes liable for the debt but the seller also remains liable; or
(iii) The buyer becomes liable for the debt and the seller is released by the lender.
(6)
Pass-thru certificates.
If a REMIC holds as a qualified mortgage a pass-thru certificate or other investment trust interest of the type described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the modification of a mortgage loan that backs the pass-thru certificate or other interest is not a modification of the pass-thru certificate or other interest unless the investment trust structure was created to avoid the prohibited transaction rules of section 860F(a).
(7)
Test for determining whether an obligation continues to be principally secured following certain types of modifications.
(i) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(8)(i), (b)(3)(v), and (b)(3)(vi) of this section, the obligation continues to be principally secured by an interest in real property following the modification only if, as of the date of the modification, the obligation satisfies either paragraph (b)(7)(ii) or paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section.
(ii) The fair market value of the interest in real property securing the obligation, determined as of the date of the modification, must be at least 80 percent of the adjusted issue price of the modified obligation, determined as of the date of the modification. If, as of the date of the modification, the servicer reasonably believes that the obligation satisfies the criterion in the preceding sentence, then the obligation is deemed to do so. A reasonable belief does not exist if the servicer actually knows, or has reason to know, that the criterion is not satisfied. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(7)(ii), a servicer must base a reasonable belief on—
(A) A current appraisal performed by an independent appraiser;
(B) An appraisal that was obtained in connection with the origination of the obligation and, if appropriate, that has been updated for the passage of time and for any other changes that might affect the value of the interest in real property;
(C) The sales price of the interest in real property in the case of a substantially contemporary sale in which the buyer assumes the seller's obligations under the mortgage; or
(D) Some other commercially reasonable valuation method.
(iii) If paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section is not satisfied, the fair market value of the interest in real property that secures the obligation immediately after the modification must equal or exceed the fair market value of the interest in real property that secured the obligation immediately before the modification. The criterion in the preceding sentence must be established by a current appraisal, an original (and updated) appraisal, or some other commercially reasonable valuation method; and the servicer must not actually know, or have reason to know, that the criterion in the preceding sentence is not satisfied.
(iv)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (b)(7).

# Example.
(i) S services mortgage loans that are held by R, a REMIC. Borrower B is the issuer of one of the mortgage loans held by R. The original amount of B's mortgage loan was $100,000, and the loan was secured by real property X. At the time the loan was contributed to R, property X had a fair market value of $90,000. Sometime after the loan was contributed to R, B experienced financial difficulties such that it was reasonably foreseeable that B might default on the loan if the loan was not modified. Accordingly, S altered various terms of B's loan to substantially reduce the risk of default. The alterations included the release of the lien on property X and the substitution of real property Y for property X as collateral for the loan. At the time the loan was modified, its adjusted issue price was $100,000. The fair market value of property X immediately before the modification (as determined by a commercially reasonable valuation method)
was $70,000, and the fair market value of property Y immediately after the modification (as determined by a commercially reasonable valuation method) was $75,000.
(ii) The alterations to B's loan are a significant modification within the meaning of § 1.1001-3(e). The modification, however, is described in paragraphs (a)(8)(i) and (b)(3) of this section. Accordingly, the modified loan continues to be a qualified mortgage if, immediately after the modification, the modified loan continues to be principally secured by an interest in real property, as determined by paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
(iii) Because the modification includes the release of the lien on property X and substitution of property Y for property X, the modified loan must satisfy paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section (which requires satisfaction of either paragraph (b)(7)(ii) or paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section). The modified loan does not satisfy paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section because property Y is worth less than $80,000 (the amount equal to 80 percent of the adjusted issue price of the modified mortgage loan). The modified loan, however, satisfies paragraph (b)(7)(iii) of this section because the fair market value of the interest in real estate (real property Y) that secures the obligation immediately after the modification ($75,000) exceeds the fair market value of the interest in real estate (real property X) that secured the obligation immediately before the modification ($70,000). Accordingly, the modified loan satisfies paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section and continues to be principally secured by an interest in real property.
(c)
Treatment of certain credit enhancement contracts
—(1)
In general.
A credit enhancement contract (as defined in paragraph (c) (2) and (3) of this section) is not treated as a separate asset of the REMIC for purposes of the asset test set out in section 860D(a)(4) and § 1.860D-1(b)(3), but instead is treated as part of the mortgage or pool of mortgages to which it relates. Furthermore, any collateral supporting a credit enhancement contract is not treated as an asset of the REMIC solely because it supports the guarantee represented by that contract. See paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section for the treatment of payments made pursuant to credit enhancement contracts as payments received under a qualified mortgage.
(2)
Credit enhancement contracts.
For purposes of this section, a credit enhancement contract is any arrangement whereby a person agrees to guarantee full or partial payment of the principal or interest payable on a qualified mortgage or on a pool of such mortgages, or full or partial payment on one or more classes of regular interests or on the class of residual interests, in the event of defaults or delinquencies on qualified mortgages, unanticipated losses or expenses incurred by the REMIC, or lower than expected returns on cash flow investments. Types of credit enhancement contracts may include, but are not limited to, pool insurance contracts, certificate guarantee insurance contracts, letters of credit, guarantees, or agreements whereby the REMIC sponsor, a mortgage servicer, or other third party agrees to make advances described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(3)
Arrangements to make certain advances.
The arrangements described in this paragraph (c)(3) are credit enhancement contracts regardless of whether, under the terms of the arrangement, the payor is obligated, or merely permitted, to advance funds to the REMIC.
(i)
Advances of delinquent principal and interest.
An arrangement by a REMIC sponsor, mortgage servicer, or other third party to advance to the REMIC out of its own funds an amount to make up for delinquent payments on qualified mortgages is a credit enhancement contract.
(ii)
Advances of taxes, insurance payments, and expenses.
An arrangement by a REMIC sponsor, mortgage servicer, or other third party to pay taxes and hazard insurance premiums on, or other expenses incurred to protect the REMIC's security interest in, property securing a qualified mortgage in the event that the mortgagor fails to pay such taxes, insurance premiums, or other expenses is a credit enhancement contract.
(iii)
Advances to ease REMIC administration.
An agreement by a REMIC sponsor, mortgage servicer, or other third party to advance temporarily to a REMIC amounts payable on qualified mortgages before such amounts are actually due to level out the stream of cash flows to the REMIC or to provide for orderly administration of the REMIC is a credit enhancement contract. For example, if two mortgages in a pool have payment due dates on the twentieth of the month, and all the
other mortgages have payment due dates on the first of each month, an agreement by the mortgage servicer to advance to the REMIC on the fifteenth of each month the payments not yet received on the two mortgages together with the amounts received on the other mortgages is a credit enhancement contract.
(4)
Deferred payment under a guarantee arrangement.
A guarantee arrangement does not fail to qualify as a credit enhancement contract solely because the guarantor, in the event of a default on a qualified mortgage, has the option of immediately paying to the REMIC the full amount of mortgage principal due on acceleration of the defaulted mortgage, or paying principal and interest to the REMIC according to the original payment schedule for the defaulted mortgage, or according to some other deferred payment schedule. Any deferred payments are payments pursuant to a credit enhancement contract even if the mortgage is foreclosed upon and the guarantor, pursuant to subrogation rights set out in the guarantee arrangement, is entitled to receive immediately the proceeds of foreclosure.
(d)
Treatment of certain purchase agreements with respect to convertible mortgages
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of sections 860D(a)(4) and 860G(a)(3), a purchase agreement (as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section) with respect to a convertible mortgage (as described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section) is treated as incidental to the convertible mortgage to which it relates. Consequently, the purchase agreement is part of the mortgage or pool of mortgages and is not a separate asset of the REMIC.
(2)
Treatment of amounts received under purchase agreements.
For purposes of sections 860A through 860G and for purposes of determining the accrual of original issue discount and market discount under sections 1272(a)(6) and 1276, respectively, a payment under a purchase agreement described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section is treated as a prepayment in full of the mortgage to which it relates. Thus, for example, a payment under a purchase agreement with respect to a qualified mortgage is considered a payment received under a qualified mortgage within the meaning of section 860G(a)(6) and the transfer of the mortgage is not a disposition of the mortgage within the meaning of section 860F(a)(2)(A).
(3)
Purchase agreement.
A purchase agreement is a contract between the holder of a convertible mortgage and a third party under which the holder agrees to sell and the third party agrees to buy the mortgage for an amount equal to its current principal balance plus accrued but unpaid interest if and when the mortgagor elects to convert the terms of the mortgage.
(4)
Default by the person obligated to purchase a convertible mortgage.
If the person required to purchase a convertible mortgage defaults on its obligation to purchase the mortgage upon conversion, the REMIC may sell the mortgage in a market transaction and the proceeds of the sale will be treated as amounts paid pursuant to a purchase agreement.
(5)
Convertible mortgage.
A convertible mortgage is a mortgage that gives the obligor the right at one or more times during the term of the mortgage to elect to convert from one interest rate to another. The new rate of interest must be determined pursuant to the terms of the instrument and must be intended to approximate a market rate of interest for newly originated mortgages at the time of the conversion.
(e)
Prepayment interest shortfalls.
An agreement by a mortgage servicer or other third party to make payments to the REMIC to make up prepayment interest shortfalls is not treated as a separate asset of the REMIC and payments made pursuant to such an agreement are treated as payments on the qualified mortgages. With respect to any mortgage that prepays, the prepayment interest shortfall for the accrual period in which the mortgage prepays is an amount equal to the excess of the interest that would have accrued on the mortgage during that accrual period had it not prepaid, over the interest that accrued from the beginning of that accrual period up to the date of the prepayment.
(f)
Defective obligations
—(1)
Defective obligation defined.
For purposes of sections 860G(a)(4)(B)(ii) and 860F(a)(2), a
defective obligation is a mortgage subject to any of the following defects.
(i) The mortgage is in default, or a default with respect to the mortgage is reasonably foreseeable.
(ii) The mortgage was fraudulently procured by the mortgagor.
(iii) The mortgage was not in fact principally secured by an interest in real property within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(iv) The mortgage does not conform to a customary representation or warranty given by the sponsor or prior owner of the mortgage regarding the characteristics of the mortgage, or the characteristics of the pool of mortgages of which the mortgage is a part. A representation that payments on a qualified mortgage will be received at a rate no less than a specified minimum or no greater than a specified maximum is not customary for this purpose.
(2)
Effect of discovery of defect.
If a REMIC discovers that an obligation is a defective obligation, and if the defect is one that, had it been discovered before the startup day, would have prevented the obligation from being a qualified mortgage, then, unless the REMIC either causes the defect to be cured or disposes of the defective obligation within 90 days of discovering the defect, the obligation ceases to be a qualified mortgage at the end of that 90 day period. Even if the defect is not cured, the defective obligation is, nevertheless, a qualified mortgage from the startup day through the end of the 90 day period. Moreover, even if the REMIC holds the defective obligation beyond the 90 day period, the REMIC may, nevertheless, exchange the defective obligation for a qualified replacement mortgage so long as the requirements of section 860G(a)(4)(B) are satisfied. If the defect is one that does not affect the status of an obligation as a qualified mortgage, then the obligation is always a qualified mortgage regardless of whether the defect is or can be cured. For example, if a sponsor represented that all mortgages transferred to a REMIC had a 10 percent interest rate, but it was later discovered that one mortgage had a 9 percent interest rate, the 9 percent mortgage is defective, but the defect does not affect the status of that obligation as a qualified mortgage.
(g)
Permitted investments
—(1)
Cash flow investment
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of section 860G(a)(6) and this section, a cash flow investment is an investment of payments received on qualified mortgages for a temporary period between receipt of those payments and the regularly scheduled date for distribution of those payments to REMIC interest holders. Cash flow investments must be passive investments earning a return in the nature of interest.
(ii)
Payments received on qualified mortgages.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the term “payments received on qualified mortgages” includes—
(A) Payments of interest and principal on qualified mortgages, including prepayments of principal and payments under credit enhancement contracts described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section;
(B) Proceeds from the disposition of qualified mortgages;
(C) Cash flows from foreclosure property and proceeds from the disposition of such property;
(D) A payment by a sponsor or prior owner in lieu of the sponsor's or prior owner's repurchase of a defective obligation, as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, that was transferred to the REMIC in breach of a customary warranty; and
(E) Prepayment penalties required to be paid under the terms of a qualified mortgage when the mortgagor prepays the obligation.
(iii)
Temporary period.
For purposes of section 860G(a)(6) and this paragraph (g)(1), a temporary period generally is that period from the time a REMIC receives payments on qualified mortgages and permitted investments to the time the REMIC distributes the payments to interest holders. A temporary period may not exceed 13 months. Thus, an investment held by a REMIC for more than 13 months is not a cash flow investment. In determining the length of time that a REMIC has held an investment that is part of a commingled fund or account, the REMIC may employ any reasonable method of accounting. For example, if
a REMIC holds mortgage cash flows in a commingled account pending distribution, the first-in, first-out method of accounting is a reasonable method for determining whether all or part of the account satisfies the 13 month limitation.
(2)
Qualified reserve funds.
The term qualified reserve fund means any reasonably required reserve to provide for full payment of expenses of the REMIC or amounts due on regular or residual interests in the event of defaults on qualified mortgages, prepayment interest shortfalls (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section), lower than expected returns on cash flow investments, or any other contingency that could be provided for under a credit enhancement contract (as defined in paragraph (c) (2) and (3) of this section).
(3)
Qualified reserve asset
—(i)
In general.
The term “qualified reserve asset” means any intangible property (other than a REMIC residual interest) that is held both for investment and as part of a qualified reserve fund. An asset need not generate any income to be a qualified reserve asset.
(ii)
Reasonably required reserve
—(A)
In general.
In determining whether the amount of a reserve is reasonable, it is appropriate to consider the credit quality of the qualified mortgages, the extent and nature of any guarantees relating to either the qualified mortgages or the regular and residual interests, the expected amount of expenses of the REMIC, and the expected availability of proceeds from qualified mortgages to pay the expenses. To the extent that a reserve exceeds a reasonably required amount, the amount of the reserve must be promptly and appropriately reduced. If at any time, however, the amount of the reserve fund is less than is reasonably required, the amount of the reserve fund may be increased by the addition of payments received on qualified mortgages or by contributions from holders of residual interests.
(B)
Presumption that a reserve is reasonably required.
The amount of a reserve fund is presumed to be reasonable (and an excessive reserve is presumed to have been promptly and appropriately reduced) if it does not exceed the amount required by a third party insurer or guarantor, who does not own directly or indirectly (within the meaning of section 267(c)) an interest in the REMIC (as defined in § 1.860D-1(b)(1)), as a condition of providing credit enhancement.
(C)
Presumption may be rebutted.
The presumption in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section may be rebutted if the amounts required by the third party insurer are not commercially reasonable considering the factors described in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
(D)
Applicability date.
Paragraphs (g)(3)(ii)(B) and (g)(3)(ii)(C) of this section apply on and after July 6, 2011.
(h)
Outside reserve funds.
A reserve fund that is maintained to pay expenses of the REMIC, or to make payments to REMIC interest holders is an outside reserve fund and not an asset of the REMIC only if the REMIC's organizational documents clearly and expressly—
(1) Provide that the reserve fund is an outside reserve fund and not an asset of the REMIC;
(2) Identify the owner(s) of the reserve fund, either by name, or by description of the class (
e.g.,
subordinated regular interest holders) whose membership comprises the owners of the fund; and
(3) Provide that, for all Federal tax purposes, amounts transferred by the REMIC to the fund are treated as amounts distributed by the REMIC to the designated owner(s) or transferees of the designated owner(s).
(i)
Contractual rights coupled with regular interests in tiered arrangements
—(1)
In general.
If a REMIC issues a regular interest to a trustee of an investment trust for the benefit of the trust certificate holders and the trustee also holds for the benefit of those certificate holders certain other contractual rights, those other rights are not treated as assets of the REMIC even if the investment trust and the REMIC were created contemporaneously pursuant to a single set of organizational documents. The organizational documents must, however, require that the trustee account for the contractual rights as property that the trustee holds separate and apart from the regular interest.
(2)
Example.
The following example, which describes a tiered arrangement involving a pass-thru trust that is intended to qualify as a REMIC and a pass-thru trust that is intended to be classified as a trust under § 301.7701-4(c) of this chapter, illustrates the provisions of paragraph (i)(1) of this section.

# Example.
(i) A sponsor transferred a pool of mortgages to a trustee in exchange for two classes of certificates. The pool of mortgages has an aggregate principal balance of $100
x.
Each mortgage in the pool provides for interest payments based on the eleventh district cost of funds index (hereinafter COFI) plus a margin. The trust (hereinafter REMIC trust) issued a Class N bond, which the sponsor designates as a regular interest, that has a principal amount of $100
x
and that provides for interest payments at a rate equal to One-Year LIBOR plus 100 basis points, subject to a cap equal to the weighted average pool rate. The Class R interest, which the sponsor designated as the residual interest, entitles its holder to all funds left in the trust after the Class N bond has been retired. The Class R interest holder is not entitled to current distributions.
(ii) On the same day, and under the same set of documents, the sponsor also created an investment trust. The sponsor contributed to the investment trust the Class N bond together with an interest rate cap contract. Under the interest rate cap contract, the issuer of the cap contract agrees to pay to the trustee for the benefit of the investment trust certificate holders the excess of One-Year LIBOR plus 100 basis points over the weighted average pool rate (COFI plus a margin) times the outstanding principal balance of the Class N bond in the event One-Year LIBOR plus 100 basis points ever exceeds the weighted average pool rate. The trustee (the same institution that serves as REMIC trust trustee), in exchange for the contributed assets, gave the sponsor certificates representing undivided beneficial ownership interests in the Class N bond and the interest rate cap contract. The organizational documents require the trustee to account for the regular interest and the cap contract as discrete property rights.
(iii) The separate existence of the REMIC trust and the investment trust are respected for all Federal income tax purposes. Thus, the interest rate cap contract is an asset beneficially owned by the several certificate holders and is not an asset of the REMIC trust. Consequently, each certificate holder must allocate its purchase price for the certificate between its undivided interest in the Class N bond and its undivided interest in the interest rate cap contract in accordance with the relative fair market values of those two property rights.
(j)
Clean-up call
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 860F(a)(5)(B), a clean-up call is the redemption of a class of regular interests when, by reason of prior payments with respect to those interests, the administrative costs associated with servicing that class outweigh the benefits of maintaining the class. Factors to consider in making this determination include—
(i) The number of holders of that class of regular interests;
(ii) The frequency of payments to holders of that class;
(iii) The effect the redemption will have on the yield of that class of regular interests;
(iv) The outstanding principal balance of that class; and
(v) The percentage of the original principal balance of that class still outstanding.
(2)
Interest rate changes.
The redemption of a class of regular interests undertaken to profit from a change in interest rates is not a clean-up call.
(3)
Safe harbor.
Although the outstanding principal balance is only one factor to consider, the redemption of a class of regular interests with an outstanding principal balance of no more than 10 percent of its original principal balance is always a clean-up call.
(k)
Startup day.
The term “startup day” means the day on which the REMIC issues all of its regular and residual interests. A sponsor may, however, contribute property to a REMIC in exchange for regular and residual interests over any period of 10 consecutive days and the REMIC may designate any one of those 10 days as its startup day. The day so designated is then the startup day, and all interests are treated as issued on that day.
[T.D. 8458, 57 FR 61309, Dec. 24, 1992; 58 FR 8098, Feb. 11, 1993; T.D. 9463, 74 FR 47438, Sept. 16, 2009; T.D. 9533, 76 FR 39282, July 6, 2011; T.D. 9637, 78 FR 54760, Sept. 6, 2013]
§ 1.860G-3
Treatment of foreign persons.
(a)
Transfer of a residual interest with tax avoidance potential
—(1)
In general.
A transfer of a residual interest that has tax avoidance potential is disregarded for all Federal tax purposes if the transferee is a foreign person. Thus, if a residual interest with tax avoidance
potential is transferred to a foreign holder at formation of the REMIC, the sponsor is liable for the tax on any excess inclusion that accrues with respect to that residual interest.
(2)
Tax avoidance potential
—(i)
Defined.
A residual interest has tax avoidance potential for purposes of this section unless, at the time of the transfer, the transferor reasonably expects that, for each excess inclusion, the REMIC will distribute to the transferee residual interest holder an amount that will equal at least 30 percent of the excess inclusion, and that each such amount will be distributed at or after the time at which the excess inclusion accrues and not later than the close of the calendar year following the calendar year of accrual.
(ii)
Safe harbor.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, a transferor has a reasonable expectation if the 30-percent test would be satisfied were the REMIC's qualified mortgages to prepay at each rate within a range of rates from 50 percent to 200 percent of the rate assumed under section 1272(a)(6) with respect to the qualified mortgages (or the rate that would have been assumed had the mortgages been issued with original issue discount).
(3)
Effectively connected income.
Paragraph (a)(1) of this section will not apply if the transferee's income from the residual interest is subject to tax under section 871(b) or section 882.
(4)
Transfer by a foreign holder.
If a foreign person transfers a residual interest to a United States person or a foreign holder in whose hands the income from a residual interest would be effectively connected income, and if the transfer has the effect of allowing the transferor to avoid tax on accrued excess inclusions, then the transfer is disregarded and the transferor continues to be treated as the owner of the residual interest for purposes of section 871(a), 881, 1441, or 1442.
(b)
Accounting for REMIC net income
—(1)
Allocation of partnership income to a foreign partner.
A domestic partnership shall separately state its allocable share of REMIC taxable income or net loss in accordance with § 1.702-1(a)(8). If a domestic partnership allocates all or some portion of its allocable share of REMIC taxable income to a partner that is a foreign person, the amount allocated to the foreign partner shall be taken into account by the foreign partner for purposes of sections 871(a), 881, 1441, and 1442 as if that amount was received on the last day of the partnership's taxable year, except to the extent that some or all of the amount is required to be taken into account by the foreign partner at an earlier time under section 860G(b) as a result of a distribution by the partnership to the foreign partner or a disposition of the foreign partner's indirect interest in the REMIC residual interest. A disposition in whole or in part of the foreign partner's indirect interest in the REMIC residual interest may occur as a result of a termination of the REMIC, a disposition of the partnership's residual interest in the REMIC, a disposition of the foreign partner's interest in the partnership, or any other reduction in the foreign partner's allocable share of the portion of the REMIC net income or deduction allocated to the partnership. See § 1.871-14(d)(2) for the treatment of interest received on a regular or residual interest in a REMIC. For a partnership's withholding obligations with respect to excess inclusion amounts described in this paragraph (b)(1), see §§ 1.1441-2(b)(5), 1.1441-2(d)(4), 1.1441-5(b)(2)(i)(A), and §§ 1.1446-1 through 1.1446-7.
(2)
Excess inclusion income allocated by certain pass-through entities to a foreign person.
If an amount is allocated under section 860E(d)(1) to a foreign person that is a shareholder of a real estate investment trust or a regulated investment company, a participant in a common trust fund, or a patron of an organization to which part I of subchapter T applies and if the amount so allocated is governed by section 860E(d)(2) (treating it “as an excess inclusion with respect to a residual interest held by” the taxpayer), the amount shall be taken into account for purposes of sections 871(a), 881, 1441, and 1442 at the same time as the time prescribed for other income of the shareholder, participant, or patron from the trust, company, fund, or organization.

# TAX BASED ON INCOME FROM SOURCES WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES

# Determination of Sources of Income
§ 1.861-1
Income from sources within the United States.
(a)
Categories of income.
Part I (section 861 and following), subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder determine the sources of income for purposes of the income tax. These sections explicitly allocate certain important sources of income to the United States or to areas outside the United States, as the case may be; and, with respect to the remaining income (particularly that derived partly from sources within and partly from sources without the United States), authorize the Secretary or his delegate to determine the income derived from sources within the United States, either by rules of separate allocation or by processes or formulas of general apportionment. The statute provides for the following three categories of income:
(1)
Within the United States.
The gross income from sources within the United States, consisting of the items of gross income specified in section 861(a) plus the items of gross income allocated or apportioned to such sources in accordance with section 863(a). See §§ 1.861-2 to 1.861-7, inclusive, and § 1.863-1. The taxable income from sources within the United States, in the case of such income, shall be determined by deducting therefrom, in accordance with sections 861(b) and 863(a), the expenses, losses, and other deductions properly apportioned or allocated thereto and a ratable part of any other expenses, losses, or deductions which cannot definitely be allocated to some item or class of gross income. See §§ 1.861-8 and 1.863-1.
(2)
Without the United States.
The gross income from sources without the United States, consisting of the items of gross income specified in section 862(a) plus the items of gross income allocated or apportioned to such sources in accordance with section 863(a). See §§ 1.862-1 and 1.863-1. The taxable income from sources without the United States, in the case of such income, shall be determined by deducting therefrom, in accordance with sections 862(b) and 863(a), the expenses, losses, and other deductions properly apportioned or allocated thereto and a ratable part of any other expenses, losses, or deductions which cannot definitely be allocated to some item or class of gross income. See §§ 1.862-1 and 1.863-1.
(3)
Partly within and partly without the United States.
The gross income derived from sources partly within and partly without the United States, consisting of the items specified in section 863(b)(1), (2), and (3). The taxable income allocated or apportioned to sources within the United States, in the case of such income, shall be determined in accordance with section 863 (a) or (b). See §§ 1.863-2 to 1.863-5, inclusive.
(4)
Exceptions.
An owner of certain aircraft or vessels first leased on or before December 28, 1980, may elect to treat income in respect of these aircraft or vessels as income from sources within the United States for purposes of sections 861(a) and 862(a). See § 1.861-9. An owner of certain aircraft, vessels, or spacecraft first leased after December 28, 1980, must treat income in respect of these craft as income from sources within the United States for purposes of sections 861(a) and 862(a). See § 1.861-9A.
(b)
Taxable income from sources within the United States.
The taxable income from sources within the United States shall consist of the taxable income described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section plus the taxable income allocated or apportioned to such sources, as indicated in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(c)
Computation of income.
If a taxpayer has gross income from sources within or without the United States, together with gross income derived partly from sources within and partly from sources without the United States, the amounts thereof, together with the expenses and investment applicable thereto, shall be segregated; and the taxable income from sources within the United States shall be separately computed therefrom.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7928, 48 FR 55845, Dec. 16, 1983]
§ 1.861-2
Interest.
(a)
In general.
(1) Gross income consisting of interest from the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof (other than a possession of the United States or an agency or instrumentality of a possession), a State or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, and interest from a resident of the United States on a bond, note, or other interest-bearing obligation issued, assumed or incurred by such person shall be treated as income from sources within the United States. Thus, for example, income from sources within the United States includes interest received on any refund of income tax imposed by the United States, a State or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia. Interest other than that described in this paragraph is not to be treated as income from sources within the United States. See paragraph (a)(7) of this section for special rules concerning substitute interest paid or accrued pursuant to a securities lending transaction.
(2) The term “resident of the United States”, as used in this paragraph, includes (i) an individual who at the time of payment of the interest is a resident of the United States, (ii) a domestic corporation, (iii) a domestic partnership which at any time during its taxable year is engaged in trade or business in the United States, or (iv) a foreign corporation or a foreign partnership, which at any time during its taxable year is engaged in trade or business in the United States.
(3) The method by which, or the place where, payment of the interest is made is immaterial in determining whether interest is derived from sources within the United States.
(4) For purposes of this section, the term “interest” includes all amounts treated as interest under section 483, and the regulations thereunder. It also includes original issue discount, as defined in section 1232(b)(1), whether or not the underlying bond, debenture, note, certificate, or other evidence of indebtedness is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer within the meaning of section 1221.
(5) If interest is paid on an obligation of a resident of the United States by a nonresident of the United States acting in the nonresident's capacity as a guarantor of the obligation of the resident, the interest will be treated as income from sources within the United States.
(6) In the case of interest received by a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation this paragraph (a) applies whether or not the interest is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by such individual or corporation.
(7) A substitute interest payment is a payment, made to the transferor of a security in a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction, of an amount equivalent to an interest payment which the owner of the transferred security is entitled to receive during the term of the transaction. A securities lending transaction is a transfer of one or more securities that is described in section 1058(a) or a substantially similar transaction. A sale-repurchase transaction is an agreement under which a person transfers a security in exchange for cash and simultaneously agrees to receive a substantially identical securities from the transferee in the future in exchange for cash. A substitute interest payment shall be sourced in the same manner as the interest accruing on the transferred security for purposes of this section and § 1.862-1. See also §§ 1.864-5(b)(2)(iii), 1.871-7(b)(2), 1.881-2(b)(2) and for the character of such payments and § 1.894-1(c) for the application tax treaties to these transactions.
(b)
Interest not derived from U.S. sources.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, interest shall be treated as income from sources without the United States to the extent provided by subparagraphs (A) through (H), of section 861(a)(1) and by the following subparagraphs of this paragraph.
(1)
Interest on bank deposits and on similar amounts.
(i) Interest paid or credited before January 1, 1977, to a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation on—
(
a
) Deposits with persons, including citizens of the United States or alien individuals and foreign or domestic partnerships or corporations, carrying
on the banking business in the United States,
(
b
) Deposits or withdrawable accounts with savings institutions chartered and supervised as savings and loan or similar associations under Federal or State law, or
(
c
) Amounts held by an insurance company under an agreement to pay interest thereon, shall be treated as income from sources without the United States if such interest is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by such nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation. If such interest is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by such nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation, it shall be treated as income from sources within the United States under paragraph (a) of this section unless it is treated as income from sources without the United States under another subparagraph of this paragraph. For a special rule for determining whether such interest is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, see paragraph (c)(1)(ii) or § 1.864-4.
(ii) Paragraph (b)(1)(i)(
b
) of this section applies to interest on deposits or withdrawable accounts described therein only to the extent that the interest paid or credited by the savings institution described therein is deductible under section 591 in determining the taxable income of such institution; and, for this purpose, whether an amount is deductible under section 591 shall be determined without regard to section 265, relating to deductions allocable to tax-exempt income. Thus, for example, such subdivision does not apply to amounts paid by a savings and loan or similar association on or with respect to its nonwithdrawable capital stock or on or with respect to funds held in restricted accounts which represent a proprietary interest in such association. Paragraph (b)(1)(i)(
b
) of this section also applies to so-called dividends paid or credited on deposits or withdrawable accounts if such dividends are deductible under section 591 without reference to section 265.
(iii) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(
c
) of this section, amounts held by an insurance company under an agreement to pay interest thereon include policyholder dividends left with the company to accumulate, prepaid insurance premiums, proceeds of policies left on deposit with the company, and overcharges of premiums. Such subdivision does not apply to (
a
) the so-called “interest element” in the case of annuity or installment payments under life insurance or endowment contracts or (
b
) interest paid by an insurance company to its creditors on notes, bonds, or similar evidences of indebtedness, if the debtor-creditor relationship does not arise by virtue of a contract of insurance with the insurance company.
(iv) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, interest received by a partnership shall be treated as received by each partner of such partnership to the extent of his distributive share of such item.
(2)
Interest from a resident alien individual or domestic corporation deriving substantial income from sources without the United States.
Interest received from a resident alien individual or a domestic corporation shall be treated as income from sources without the United States when it is shown to the satisfaction of the district director (or, if applicable, the Director of International Operations) that less than 20 percent of the gross income from all sources of such individual or corporation has been derived from sources within the United States, as determined under the provisions of sections 861 to 863, inclusive, and the regulations thereunder, for the 3-year period ending with the close of the taxable year of such individual or corporation preceding its taxable year in which such interest is paid or credited, or for such part of such period as may be applicable. If 20 percent or more of the gross income from all sources of such individual or corporation has been derived from sources within the United States, as so determined, for such 3-year period (or part thereof), the entire amount of the interest from such individual or corporation shall be treated as income from sources within the United States.
(3)
Interest from a foreign corporation not deriving major portion of its income from a U.S. business.
(i) Interest from a foreign corporation which, at any time during the taxable year, is engaged in trade or business in the United States shall be treated as income from sources without the United States when it is shown to the satisfaction of the district director (or, if applicable, the Director of International Operations) that (
a
) less than 50 percent of the gross income from all sources of such foreign corporation for the 3-year period ending with the close of its taxable year preceding its taxable year in which such interest is paid or credited (or for such part of such period as the corporation has been in existence) was effectively connected with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business in the United States, as determined under section 864(c) and § 1.864-3, or (
b
) such foreign corporation had gross income for such 3-year period (or part thereof) but none was effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
(ii) If 50 percent or more of the gross income from all sources of such foreign corporation for such 3-year period (or part thereof) was effectively connected with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business in the United States, see section 861(a)(1)(D) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section for determining the portion of interest from such corporation which is treated as income from sources within the United States.
(iii) For purposes of this paragraph the gross income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States includes the gross income which, pursuant to section 882 (d) or (e) and the regulations thereunder, is treated as income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
(iv) This paragraph does not apply to interest paid or credited after December 31, 1969, by a branch in the United States of a foreign corporation if, at the time of payment or crediting, such branch is engaged in the commercial banking business in the United States; furthermore, such interest is treated under paragraph (a) of this section as income from sources within the United States unless it is treated as income from sources without the United States under paragraph (b)(1) or (4) of this section.
(4)
Bankers' acceptances.
Interest derived by a foreign central bank of issue from bankers' acceptances shall be treated as income from sources without the United States. For this purpose, a foreign central bank of issue is a bank which is by law or government sanction the principal authority, other than the government itself, issuing instruments intended to circulate as currency. Such a bank is generally the custodian of the banking reserves of the country under whose laws it is organized.
(5)
Foreign banking branch of a domestic corporation or partnership.
Interest paid or credited on deposits with a branch outside the United States (as defined in section 7701(a)(9)) of a domestic corporation or of a domestic partnership shall be treated as income from sources without the United States, if, at the time of payment or crediting, such branch is engaged in the commercial banking business. For purposes of applying this paragraph, it is immaterial (i) whether the domestic corporation or domestic partnership is carrying on a banking business in the United States, (ii) whether the recipient of the interest is a citizen or resident of the United States, a foreign corporation, or a foreign partnership, (iii) whether the interest is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by the recipient, or (iv) whether the deposits with the branch located outside the United States are payable in the currency of a foreign country. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 1.863-6, interest to which this paragraph applies shall be treated as income from sources within the foreign country, possession of the United States, or other territory in which the branch is located.
(6)
Section 4912(c) debt obligations
— (i)
In general.
Under section 861(a)(1)(G), interest on a debt obligation shall not be treated as income from sources within the United States if—
(
a
) The debt obligation was part of an issue of debt obligations with respect to which an election has been made
under section 4912(c) (relating to the treatment of such debt obligations as debt obligations of a foreign obligor for purposes of the interest equalization tax),
(
b
) The debt obligation had a maturity not exceeding 15 years (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section) on the date it is originally issued or on the date it is treated under section 4912(c)(2) as issued by reason of being assumed by a certain domestic corporation,
(
c
) The debt obligation, when originally issued, was purchased by one or more underwriters (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section) with a view to distribution through resale (within the meaning of paragraph (b)(6)(iv) of this section), and
(
d
) The interest on the debt obligation is attributable to periods after the effective date of an election under section 4912(c) to treat such debt obligations as debt obligations of a foreign obligor for purposes of the interest equalization tax.
(ii)
Maturity not exceeding 15 years.
The date the debt obligation is issued or treated as issued is not included in the 15 year computation, but the date of maturity of the debt, obligation is included in such computation.
(iii)
Purchased by one or more underwriters.
For purposes of this paragraph, the debt obligation when originally issued will not be treated as purchased by one or more underwriters unless the underwriter purchases the debt obligation for his own account and bears the risk of gain or loss on resale. Thus, for example, a debt obligation, when originally issued, will not be treated as purchased by one or more underwriters if the underwriter acts only in the capacity of an agent of the issuer. Neither will a debt obligation, when originally issued, be treated as purchased by one or more underwriters if the agreement between the underwriter and issuer is merely for a “best efforts” underwriting, for the purchase by the underwriter of all or a portion of the debt obligations remaining unsold at the expiration of a fixed period of time, or for any other arrangement under the terms of which the debt obligations are not purchased by the underwriter with a view to distribution through resale. The fact that an underwriter is related to the issuer will not prevent the underwriter from meeting the requirements of this paragraph. In determining whether a related underwriter meets the requirements of this paragraph consideration shall be given to whether the purchase by the underwriter of the debt obligation from the issuer for resale was effected by a transaction subject to conditions similar to those which would have been imposed between independent persons.
(iv)
With a view to distribution through resale.
(
a
) An underwriter who purchased a debt obligation shall be deemed to have purchased it with a view to distribution through resale if the requirements of paragraph (b)(6)(iv) (
b
) or (
c
) of this section are met.
(
b
) The requirements of this paragraph (
b
) is that—
(
1
) The debt obligation is registered, approved, or listed for trading on one or more foreign securities exchanges or foreign established securities markets within 4 months after the date on which the underwriter purchases the debt obligation, or by the date of the first interest payment on the debt obligation, whichever is later, or
(
2
) The debt obligation, or any substantial portion of the issue of which the debt obligation is a part, is actually traded on one or more foreign securities markets on or within 15 calendar days after the date on which the underwriter purchases the debt obligation.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(6)(iv), a foreign established securities market includes any foreign over-the-counter market as reflected by the existence of an inter-dealer quotation system for regularly disseminating to brokers and dealers quotations of obligations by identified brokers or dealers, other than quotations prepared and distributed by a broker or dealer in the regular course of his business and containing only quotations of such broker or dealer.
(
c
) The requirements of this paragraph (
c
) are that, except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(
d
) of this section, the underwriter is under no written or implied restriction imposed by the issuer with respect to whom he
may resell the debt obligation and either—
(
1
) Within 30 calendar days after he purchased the debt obligation the underwriter or underwriters either (
i
) sold it or (
ii
) sold at least 95 percent of the face amount of the issue of which the debt obligation is a part, or
(
2
)(
i
) The debt obligation is evidenced by an instrument which, under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is issued, is either negotiable or transferable by assignment (whether or not it is registered for trading), and (
ii
) it appears from all the relevant facts and circumstances, including any written statements or assurances made by the purchasing underwriter or underwriters, that such debt obligation was purchased with a view to distribution through resale.
(
d
) The requirements of paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(
c
) of this paragraph may be met whether or not the underwriter is restricted from reselling the debt obligations—
(
1
) To a United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)) or
(
2
) To any particular person or persons pursuant to a restriction imposed by, or required to be met in order to comply with, United States or foreign securities or other law.
(v)
Statement with return.
Any taxpayer who is required to file a tax return and who excludes from gross income interest of the type specified in this subparagraph must comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.
(vi)
Effect of termination of IET.
If the interest equalization tax expires, the provisions of section 861(a)(1)(G) and this subparagraph shall apply to interest paid on debt obligations only with respect to which a section 4912(c) election was made.
(vii)
Definition of term underwriter.
For purposes of section 861(a)(1)(G) and this paragraph, the term “underwriter” shall mean any underwriter as defined in section 4919(c)(1).
(c)
Special rules
—(1)
Proration of interest from a foreign corporation deriving major portion of its income from a U.S. business.
If, after applying the first sentence of paragraph (b)(3) of this section to interest to which that paragraph applies, it is determined that the interest may not be treated as income from sources without the United States, the amount of the interest from the foreign corporation which at some time during the taxable year is engaged in trade or business in the United States which is to be treated as income from sources within the United States shall be the amount that bears the same ratio to such interest as the gross income of such foreign corporation for the 3-year period ending with the close of its taxable year preceding its taxable year in which such interest is paid or credited (or for such part of such period as the corporation has been in existence) which was effectively connected with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business in the United States bears to its gross income from all sources for such period.
(2)
Payors having no gross income for period preceding taxable year of payment.
If the resident alien individual, domestic corporation, or foreign corporation, as the case may be, paying interest has no gross income from any source for the 3-year period (or part thereof) specified in paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, or paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the 20-percent test or the 50-percent test, or the apportionment formula, as the case may be, described in such paragraph shall be applied solely with respect to the taxable year of the payor in which the interest is paid or credited. This paragraph applies whether the lack of gross income for the 3-year period (or part thereof) stems from the business inactivity of the payor, from the fact that the payor is a corporation which is newly created or organized, or from any other cause.
(3)
Transitional rule.
For purposes of applying paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the gross income of the foreign corporation for any period before the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966, which is from sources within the United States (determined as provided by sections 861 through 863, and the regulations thereunder, as in effect immediately before amendment by section 102 of the Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89-809, 80 Stat. 1541)) shall be treated as gross income for such period which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade
or business in the United States by such foreign corporation.
(4)
Gross income determinations.
In making determinations under paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, or paragraph (c) (1) or (3) of this section—
(i) The gross income of a domestic corporation or a resident alien individual is to be determined by excluding any items specifically excluded from gross income under chapter 1 of the Code, and
(ii) The gross income of a foreign corporation which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States is to be determined under section 882(b)(2) and by excluding any items specifically excluded from gross income under chapter 1 of the Code, and
(iii) The gross income from all sources of a foreign corporation is to be determined without regard to section 882(b) and without excluding any items otherwise specifically excluded from gross income under chapter 1 of the Code.
(d)
Statement with return.
Any taxpayer who is required to file a return and applies any provision of this section to exclude an amount of interest from his gross income must file with his return a statement setting forth the amount so excluded, the date of its receipt, the name and address of the obligor of the interest, and, if known, the location of the records which substantiate the amount of the exclusion. A statement from the obligor setting forth such information and indicating the amount of interest to be treated as income from sources without the United States may be used for this purpose. See §§ 1.6012-1(b)(1)(i) and 1.6012-2(g)(1)(i).
(e)
Effective dates.
Except as otherwise provided, this section applies with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966. For corresponding rules applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, (see 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1971). Paragraph (a)(7) of this section is applicable to payments made after November 13, 1997.
[T.D. 7378, 40 FR 45429, Oct. 2, 1975; 40 FR 48508, Oct. 16, 1975, as amended by T.D. 8257, 54 FR 31819, Aug. 2, 1989; T.D. 8735, 62 FR 53500, Oct. 14, 1997]
§ 1.861-3
Dividends and income inclusions under sections 951, 951A, and 1293 and associated section 78 dividends.
(a)
General
—(1)
Dividends included in gross income.
Gross income from sources within the United States includes a dividend described in subparagraph (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this paragraph. For purposes of subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph, the term “dividend” shall have the same meaning as set forth in section 316 and the regulations thereunder. See subparagraph (5) of this paragraph for special rules with respect to certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC. See also paragraph (a)(6) of this section for special rules concerning substitute dividend payments received pursuant to a securities lending transaction.
(2)
Dividend from a domestic corporation.
A dividend described in this paragraph (a)(2) is a dividend from a domestic corporation other than a corporation that has an election in effect under section 936. See paragraph (a)(5) of this section for the treatment of certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC.
(3)
Dividend from a foreign corporation
—(i)
In general.
(
a
) A dividend described in this subparagraph is a dividend from a foreign corporation (other than a dividend to which subparagraph (4) of this paragraph applies) unless less than 50 percent of the gross income from all sources of such foreign corporation for the 3-year period ending with the close of its taxable year preceding the taxable year in which occurs the declaration of such dividend (or for such part of such period as the corporation has been in existence) was effectively connected with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business in the United States, as determined under section 864(c) and § 1.864-3. Thus, no portion of a dividend from a foreign corporation shall be treated as income from sources within the United States under section 861(a)(2)(B) if less than 50 percent of the gross income of such foreign corporation from all sources for such 3-year period (or part thereof) was effectively connected with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business in the United States or if such foreign corporation had gross income for
such 3-year period (or part thereof) but none was effectively connected with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business in the United States.
(
b
) If 50 percent or more of the gross income from all sources of such foreign corporation for such 3-year period (or part thereof) was effectively connected with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business in the United States, the amount of the dividend which is to be treated as income from sources within the United States under section 861(a)(2)(B) shall be the amount that bears the same ratio to such dividend as the gross income of such foreign corporation for such 3-year period (or part thereof) which was effectively connected with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business in the United States bears to its gross income from all sources for such period.
(
c
) For purposes of this subdivision (i), the gross income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States includes the gross income which, pursuant to section 882 (d) or (e), is treated as income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
(ii)
Rule applicable in applying limitation on amount of foreign tax credit.
For purposes of determining under section 904 the limitation upon the amount of the foreign tax credit—
(
a
) So much of a dividend from a foreign corporation as exceeds (and only to the extent it so exceeds) the amount which is 100/85ths of the amount of the deduction allowable under section 245(a) in respect of such dividend, plus
(
b
) An amount which bears the same proportion to any section 78 dividend to which the dividend from the foreign corporation gives rise as the amount of the excess determined under (
a
) of this subdivision bears to the total amount of the dividend from the foreign corporation, shall, notwithstanding subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, be treated as income from sources without the United States. This subdivision applies to a dividend for which no dividends-received deduction is allowed under section 245 or for which the 85 percent dividends-received deduction is allowed under section 245(a) but does not apply to a dividend for which a deduction is allowable under section 245(b). All of a dividend for which the 100 percent dividends-received deduction is allowed under section 245(b) shall be treated as income from sources within the United States for purposes of determining under section 904 the limitation upon the amount of the foreign tax credit. If the amount of a distribution of property other than money (constituting a dividend under section 316) is determined by applying section 301(b)(1)(C), such amount must be used as the dividend for purposes of applying (
a
) of this subdivision even though the amount used for purposes of section 245(a) is determined by applying section 301(b)(1)(D). In making determinations under this subdivision, a dividend (other than a section 78 dividend referred to in (
b
) of this subdivision) shall be determined without regard to section 78.
(iii)
Illustrations.
The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
D, a domestic corporation, owns 80 percent of the outstanding stock of M, a foreign manufacturing corporation. M, which makes its returns on the basis of the calendar year, has earnings and profits of $200,000 for 1971 and 60 percent of its gross income for that year is effectively connected for 1971 with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. For an uninterrupted period of 36 months ending on December 31, 1970, M has been engaged in trade or business in the United States and has received gross income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States amounting to 60 percent of its gross income from all sources for such period. The only distribution by M to D for 1971 is a cash dividend of $100,000; of this amount, $60,000 ($100,000 × 60%) is treated under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph as income from sources within the United States, and $40,000 ($100,000−$60,000) is treated under § 1.862-1(a)(2) as income from sources without the United States. Accordingly, under section 245(a), D is entitled to a dividends-received deduction of $51,000 ($60,000 × 85%), and under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph $40,000 ($100,000−[$51,000 × 100/85]) is treated as income from sources without the United States for purposes of determining under section 904(a) (1) or (2) the limitation upon the amount of the foreign tax credit.

# Example 2.
(a) The facts are the same as in example (1) except that the distribution for 1971 consists of property which has a fair market value of $100,000 and an adjusted
basis of $30,000 in M's hands immediately before the distribution. The amount of the dividend under section 316 is $58,000, determined by applying section 301(b)(1)(C) as follows:
Portion of adjusted basis of property attributable to gross income of M effectively connected for 1971 with conduct of trade or business in United States ($30,000 × 60%)
$18,000
Portion of fair market value of property attributable to gross income of M not effectively connected for 1971 with conduct of trade or business in United States ($100,000 × 40%)
40,000
Total dividend
58,000
(b) Of the total dividend, $34,800 ($58,000 × 60% (percentage applicable to 3-year period)) is treated under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph as income from sources within the United States, and $23,200 ($58,000 × 40%) is treated under § 1.862-1(a)(2) as income from sources without the United States. However, by reason of section 245(c) the adjusted basis of the property ($30,000) is used under section 245(a) in determining the dividends-received deduction. Thus, under section 245(a), D is entitled to a dividends-received deduction of $15,300 ($30,000 × 60% × 85%).
(c) Under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the amount of the dividend for purposes of applying (
a
) of that subdivision is the amount ($58,000) determined by applying section 301(b)(1)(C) rather than the amount ($30,000) determined by applying section 301(b)(1)(B). Accordingly, under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph $40,000 ($58,000−[$15,300 × 100/85]) is treated as income from sources without the United States for purposes of determining under section 904(a) (1) or (2) the limitation upon the amount of the foreign tax credit.

# Example 3.
(a) D, a domestic corporation which makes its returns on the basis of the calendar year, owns 100 percent of the outstanding stock of N, a foreign corporation which is not a less developed country corporation under section 902(d). N, which makes its returns on the basis of the calendar year, has total gross income for 1971 of $100,000, of which $80,000 (including $60,000 from sources within foreign country X) is effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. For 1971 N is assumed to have paid $27,000 of income taxes to country X and to have accumulated profits of $81,000 for purposes of section 902(c)(1)(A). N's accumulated profits in excess of foreign income taxes amount to $54,000. For 1971 D receives a cash dividend of $42,000 from N, which is D's only income for that year.
(b) For 1971 D chooses the benefits of the foreign tax credit under section 901, and as a result is required under section 78 to include in gross income an amount equal to the foreign income taxes of $21,000 ($27,000 × $42,000/$54,000) it is deemed to have paid under section 902(a)(1). Thus, assuming no other deductions for the taxable year, D has gross income of $63,000 ($42,000 + $21,000) for 1971 less a dividends-received deduction under section 245(a) of $28,560 ([$42,000 × $80,000/$100,000] × 85%), or taxable income for 1971 of $34,440.
(c) Under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, for purposes of determining under section 904(a) (1) or (2) the limitation upon the amount of the foreign tax credit, $12,600 is treated as income from sources without the United States, determined as follows:
Excess of dividend from N over amount which is 100/85ths of amount of sec. 245(a) deduction ($42,000−[$28,560 × 100/85])
$8,400
Proportionate part of sec. 78 dividend ($21,000 × $8,400/$42,000)
4,200
Taxable income from sources without the United States
12,600

# Example 4.
A, an individual citizen of the United States who makes his return on the basis of the calendar year, receives in 1971 a cash dividend of $10,000 from M, a foreign corporation, which makes its return on the basis of the calendar year. For the 3-year period ending with 1970 M has been engaged in trade or business in the United States and has received gross income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States amounting to 80 percent of its gross income from all sources for such period. Of the total dividend, $8,000 ($10,000 × 80%) is treated under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph as income from sources within the United States and $2,000 ($10,000−$8,000) is treated under § 1.862-1(a)(2) as income from sources without the United States. Since under section 245 no dividends received-deduction is allowable to an individual, A is entitled under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph to treat the entire dividend of $10,000 ($10,000−[$0 × 100/85]) as income from sources without the United States for purposes of determining under section 904(a) (1) or (2) the limitation upon the amount of the foreign tax credit.
(4)
Dividend from a foreign corporation succeeding to earnings of a domestic corporation.
A dividend described in this subparagraph is a dividend from a foreign corporation, if such dividend is received by a corporation after December 31, 1959, but only to the extent that such dividend is treated by such recipient corporation under the provisions of § 1.243-3 as a dividend from a domestic corporation subject to taxation under chapter 1 of the Code. To the extent that this subparagraph applies to a dividend received from a foreign corporation, subparagraph (3) of this paragraph shall not apply to such dividend.
(5)
Certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC
—(i)
General rule.
A dividend described in this subparagraph is a dividend from a corporation that is a DISC or former DISC (as defined in section 992(a)) other than a dividend that—
(
a
) Is deemed paid by a DISC, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, under section 995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, under section 995(b)(1) (D), (E), and (F) to the extent provided in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph or
(
b
) Reduces under § 1.996-3(b)(3) accumulated DISC income (as defined in subdivision (ii)(
b
) of this subparagraph) to the extend provided in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph.
Thus, a dividend deemed paid under section 995(b)(1) (A), (B), or (C) (relating to certain deemed distributions in qualified years) will be treated in full as gross income from sources within the United States. To the extent that a dividend from a DISC or former DISC is paid out of other earnings and profits (as defined in § 1.996-3(d)), subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall apply. To the extent that a dividend from a DISC or former DISC is paid out of previously taxed income (as defined in § 1.996-3(c)), see section 996(a)(3) (relating to the exclusion from gross income of amounts distributed out of previously taxed income). In determining the source of income of certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC, the source of income from any transaction which gives rise to gross receipts (as defined in § 1.993-6), in the hands of the DISC or former DISC, is immaterial.
(ii)
Definitions.
For purposes of this subparagraph, the term—
(
a
) “Dividend from” means any amount actually distributed which is a dividend within the meaning of section 316 (including distributions to meet qualification requirements under section 992(c)) and any amount treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend pursuant to section 995(b) (relating to deemed distributions in qualified years or upon disqualification) or included in gross income as a dividend pursuant to section 995(c) (relating to gain on certain dispositions of stock in a DISC or former DISC), and
(
b
) “Accumulated DISC income” means the amount of accumulated DISC income as of the close of the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which the dividend was made increased by the amount of DISC income for the taxable year in which the dividend was made (as determined under § 1.996-3(b)(2)).
(
c
) “Nonqualified export taxable income” means the taxable income of a DISC from any transaction which gives rise to gross receipts (as defined in § 1.993-6) which are not qualified export receipts (as defined in § 1.993-1) other than a transaction giving rise to gain described in section 995(b)(1) (B) or (C).
For purposes of subdivisions (i)(
b
) and (iv) of this subparagraph, if by reason of section 995(c), gain is included in the shareholder's gross income as a dividend, accumulated DISC income shall be treated as if it were reduced under § 1.996-3(b)(3).
(iii)
Determination of source of income for deemed distributions, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, under section 995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, under section 995(b)(1) (D), (E), and (F). (a
) If for its taxable year a DISC does not have any nonqualified export taxable income, then for such year the entire amount treated, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, under section 995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, under section 995(b)(1) (D), (E), and (F) as a deemed distribution taxable as a dividend will be treated as gross income from sources without the United States.
(
b
) If for its taxable year a DISC has any nonqualified export taxable income, then for such year the portion of the amount treated, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, under section 995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, under section 995(b)(1) (D), (E), and (F) as a deemed distribution taxable as a dividend that will be treated as income from sources
within the United States shall be equal to the amount of such nonqualified export taxable income multiplied by the following fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the sum of the amounts treated, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, under section 995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, under section 995(b)(1) (D), (E), and (F) as deemed distributions taxable as dividends. The denominator of the fraction is the taxable income of the DISC for the taxable year, reduced by the amounts treated under section 995(b)(1) (A), (B), and (C) as deemed distributions taxable as dividends. However, in no event shall the numerator exceed the denominator. The remainder of such dividend will be treated as gross income from sources without the United States.
(iv)
Determination of source of income for dividends that reduce accumulated DISC income.
(
a
) If no portion of the accumulated DISC income of a DISC or former DISC is attributable to nonqualified export taxable income from any transaction during a year for which it is (or is treated as) a DISC, then the entire amount of any dividend that reduces under § 1.996-3(b)(3) accumulated DISC income will be treated as income from sources without the United States.
(
b
) If any portion of the accumulated DISC income of a DISC or former DISC is attributable to nonqualified export taxable income from any transaction during a year for which it is (or is treated as) a DISC, then the portion of any dividend during its taxable year that reduces under § 1.996-3(b)(3) accumulated DISC income that will be treated as income from sources within the United States shall be equal to the amount of such dividend multiplied by a fraction (determined as of the close of such year) the numerator of which is the amount of accumulated DISC income attributable to nonqualified export taxable income, and the denominator of which is the total amount of accumulated DISC income. The remainder of such dividend will be treated as gross income from sources without the United States.
(v)
Special rules.
For purposes of subdivisions (iii) and (iv) of this subparagraph—
(
a
) Taxable income shall be determined under § 1.992-3(b)(2)(i) (relating to the computation of deficiency distribution), and
(
b
) The portion of any deemed distribution taxable as a dividend, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, under section 995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, under section 995(b)(1)(D), (E), and (F) or amount under § 1.996-3(b)(3) (i) through (iv) that is treated as gross income from sources within the United States during the taxable year shall be considered to reduce the amount of nonqualified export taxable income as of the close of such year.
(vi)
Illustrations.
This subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(a) Y is a corporation which uses the calendar year as its taxable year and which elects to be treated as a DISC beginning with 1972. X is its sole shareholder. In 1973, Y has $18,000 of taxable income from qualified export receipts (none of which are interest and gains described in section 995(b)(1)(A), (B), and (C)) and $1,000 of nonqualified export taxable income. Under these facts, X is deemed to have received a distribution under section 995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, of $9,500,
i.e.,
$19,000 X
1/2
. X is treated under subdivision (iii)(
b
) of this subparagraph as having $500,
i.e.,
$1,000 X $9,500/$19,000, from sources within the United States and $9,000 from sources without the United States.
(b) For 1972, assume that Y did not have any nonqualified export taxable income. Pursuant to subdivision (v)(
b
) of this subparagraph, at the beginning of 1974, $500 of Y's accumulated DISC income is attributable to nonqualified export taxable income (iii)(
a
) of this subparagraph), i.e., $1,000—$500.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that in 1973, in addition to the taxable income described in such example, Y has $450 of taxable income from gross interest from producer's loans described in section 995(b)(1)(A). Under these facts, the deemed distribution of $450 under section 995(b)(1)(A) is treated in full under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph as gross income from sources within the United States. The deemed distribution under section
995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, of $9,500 will be treated in the same manner as in example (1),
i.e.,
$1,000 × $9,500 / ($19,450 − $450).

# Example 3.
(a) The facts are the same as in example (1) except that in 1973, in addition to the distribution described in such example, Y makes a deemed distribution taxable as a dividend of $100 under section 995(b)(1)(G) (relating to foreign investment attributable to producer's loans) and actual distributions of all of its previously taxed income and of $2,000 taxable as a dividend which reduces accumulated DISC income (as defined in subdivision (ii)(
b
) of this subparagraph). Under § 1.996-3(b)(3), accumulated DISC income is first reduced by the deemed distribution of $100 and then by the actual distribution taxable as a dividend of $2,000. As indicated in example (1), for 1972 Y did not have any nonqualified export taxable income. Assume that Y had accumulated DISC income of $12,000 at the end of 1973, $500 of which under example (1) is attributable to nonqualified export taxable income.
(b) The distribution from previously taxed income is excluded from gross income pursuant to section 996(a)(3).
(c) Of the deemed distribution of $100, X is treated under subdivision (iv)(
b
) as having $4.17, i.e., $100 × 500/12,000, from sources within the United States and $95.83, i.e., $100—$4.17, from sources without the United States.
(d) Of the actual distribution taxable as a dividend of $2,000, X is treated under subdivision (iv)(
b
) as having $83.33, i.e., $2,000 × 500/12,000, from sources within the United States and $1,916.67, i.e., $2,000—$83.33, from sources without the United States.
(e) The sum of the amounts deemed and actually distributed as dividends for 1973 that are treated as gross income from sources within the United States is as follows:
Total dividend
Amount of dividend from sources within the United States
Deemed distribution under sec. 995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976
$9,500
$500.00
Deemed distribution under section 995(b)(1)(G)
100
4.17
Actual distribution that reduces accumulated DISC income

83.33
Totals
$11,600
$587.50
Thus, pursuant to subdivision (v)(
b
) of this subparagraph, at the beginning of 1974 Y has $412.50,
i.e.,
$1,000—$587.50, of nonqualified export taxable income.
(f) The result would be the same if Y made an actual distribution taxable as a dividend of $1,500 on March 30, 1973, and another distribution of $500 on December 31, 1973.

# Example 4.
(a) Z is a corporation which uses the calendar year as its taxable year and which elects to be treated as a DISC beginning with 1972. W is its sole shareholder. At the end of the 1976 Z has previously taxed income of $12,000 and accumulated DISC income of $4,000, $900 of which is attributable to nonqualified export taxable income. In 1977, Z has $20,050 of taxable income from qualified export receipts, of which $550 is from gross income from producer's loans described in section 995(b)(1)(A); Z has $950 of taxable income giving rise to gross receipts which are not qualified export receipts, of which $450 is gain described in section 995(b)(1)(B). Of its total taxable income of $21,000 (which is equal to its earnings and profits for 1977), $1,000 is attributable to sales of military property. Z has an international boycott factor (determined under section 999) of .10, and made an illegal bribe (within the meaning of section 162(c)) of $1,265. The proportion which the amount of Z's adjusted base period export receipts bears to Z's export gross receipts for 1977 is .40 (see section 995(e)(1)). Z makes a deemed distribution taxable as a dividend of $1,000 under section 995(b)(1)(G) (relating to foreign investment attributable to producer's loans) and actual distributions of $32,000.
(b) The deemed distributions of $550 under section 995(b)(1)(A) and $450 under section 995(b)(1)(B) are treated in full under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph as gross income from sources within the United States.
(c) Under these facts, Z has also made the following deemed distributions taxable as dividends to W under the following subdivisions of section 995(b)(1):
(D)
$500,
i.e.,
1/2
× $1,000.
(E)
7,800,
i.e.,.
40 × [$21,000 − $(550 + 450 + 500)].
(F)(i)
5,850,
i.e.,
1/2
× [$21,000 − $550 + 450 + 500 + 7,800)].
(ii)
585,
i.e.,
$5,850 × .10
(iii)
1,265
Total
16,000
(d) The portion of the total amount of these deemed distributions ($16,000 that is treated under the subdivision (iii)(
b
) as gross income from sources within the United States is computed as follows:
(1) The amount of nonqualified export taxable income is $500, i.e., taxable income giving rise to gross receipts which are not qualified export receipts ($950) minus gain described in section 995(b)(1) (B) or (C) ($450).
(2) $500 × ($16,000/$[21,000−(550 + 450)]) = $400.
The remainder of these distributions, $15,600 ($16,000 minus $400), is treated under subdivision (iii)(
b
) of this subparagraph as gross income from sources without the United States.
(e) The earnings and profits accounts of Z at the end of 1977 are computed as follows:

Substitute dividend payments.
A substitute dividend payment is a payment, made to the transferor of a security in a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction, of an amount equivalent to a dividend distribution which the owner of the transferred security is entitled to receive during the term of the transaction. A securities lending transaction is a transfer of one or more securities that is described in section 1058(a) or a substantially similar transaction. A sale-repurchase transaction is an agreement under which a person transfers a security in exchange for cash and simultaneously agrees to receive substantially identical securities from the transferee in the future in exchange for cash. A substitute dividend payment shall be sourced in the same manner as the distributions with respect to the transferred security for purposes of this section and § 1.862-1. See also §§ 1.864-5(b)(2)(iii), 1.871-7(b)(2) and 1.881-2(b)(2) for the character of such payments and § 1.894-1(c) for the application of tax treaties to these transactions.
(b)
Special rules
—(1)
Foreign corporation having no gross income for period preceding declaration of dividend.
If the foreign corporation has no gross income from any source for the 3-year period (or part thereof) specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the 50-percent test, or the apportionment formula, as the case may be, described in such paragraph shall be applied solely with respect to the taxable year of such corporation in which the declaration of the dividend occurs. This subparagraph applies whether the lack of gross income for the 3-year period (or part thereof) stems from the business inactivity of the foreign corporation, from the fact that such corporation is newly created or organized, or from any other cause.
(2)
Transitional rule.
For purposes of applying paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the gross income of the foreign corporation for any period before the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1966, which is from sources within the United States (determined as provided by sections 861 through 863, and the regulations thereunder, as in effect immediately before amendment by section 102 of the Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89-809, 80 Stat. 1541)) shall be treated as gross income for such period which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by such foreign corporation.
(3)
Gross income determinations.
In making determinations under subparagraph (2) or (3) of paragraph (a) of this
section, or subparagraph (2) of this paragraph—
(i) The gross income of a domestic corporation is to be determined by excluding any items specifically excluded from gross income under chapter 1 of the Code.
(ii) The gross income of a foreign corporation which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States is to be determined under section 882(b)(2) and by excluding any items specifically excluded from gross income under chapter 1 of the Code, and
(iii) The gross income from all sources of a foreign corporation is to be determined without regard to section 882(b) and without excluding any items otherwise specifically excluded from gross income under chapter 1 of the Code.
(c)
Statement with return.
Any taxpayer who is required to file a return and applies any provision of this section to exclude any dividend from his gross income must file with his return a statement setting forth the amount so excluded, the date of its receipt, the name and address of the corporation paying the dividend, and, if known, the location of the records which substantiate the amount of the exclusion. A statement from the paying corporation setting forth such information and indicating the amount of the dividend to be treated as income from sources within the United States may be used for this purpose. See §§ 1.6012-1(b)(1)(i) and 1.6012-2 (g)(1)(i).
(d)
Source of income inclusions under sections 951, 951A, and 1293 and associated section 78 dividends.
For purposes of sections 861 and 862 and §§ 1.861-1 and 1.862-1, and for purposes of applying this section, the amount included in gross income of a United States person under sections 951, 951A, and 1293 and the associated section 78 dividend for the taxable year with respect to a foreign corporation are treated as dividends received directly by the United States person from the foreign corporation that generated the inclusion. See section 904(h) and § 1.904-5(m) for rules concerning the resourcing of inclusions under sections 951, 951A, and 1293.

§ 1.861-4
Compensation for labor or personal services.
(a)
Compensation for labor or personal services performed wholly within the United States.
(1) Generally, compensation for labor or personal services, including fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and similar items, performed wholly within the United States is gross income from sources within the United States.
(i) The labor or services are performed by a nonresident alien individual temporarily present in the United States for a period or periods not exceeding a total of 90 days during his taxable year,
(ii) The compensation for such labor or services does not exceed in the aggregate a gross amount of $3,000, and
(iii) The compensation is for labor or services performed as an employee of, or under any form of contract with—
(
a
) A nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation, not engaged in trade or business within the United States, or
(
b
) An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, a domestic partnership, or a domestic corporation, if such labor or services are performed for an office or place of business maintained in a foreign country or in a possession of the United States by such individual, partnership, or corporation.
(2) As a general rule, the term “day”, as used in subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, means a calendar day during any portion of which the nonresident alien individual is physically present in the United States.
(3) Solely for purposes of applying this paragraph, the nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation for which the nonresident alien individual is performing personal services in the United States shall not be considered to be engaged in trade or business in the United States by reason of the performance of such services by such individual.
(4) In determining for purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph whether compensation received by the nonresident alien individual exceeds in the aggregate a gross amount of $3,000, any amounts received by the individual from an employer as advances or reimbursements for travel expenses incurred on behalf of the employer shall be omitted from the compensation received by the individual, to the extent of expenses incurred, where he was required to account and did account to his employer for such expenses and has met the tests for such accounting provided in § 1.162-17 and paragraph (e)(4) of § 1.274-5. If advances or reimbursements exceed such expenses, the amount of the excess shall be included as compensation for personal services for purposes of such subparagraph. Pensions and retirement pay attributable to labor or personal services performed in the United States are not to be taken into account for purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph. (5) For definition of the term “United States”, when used in a geographical sense, see sections 638 and 7701(a)(9).
(b)
Compensation for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States
—(1)
Compensation for labor or personal services performed by persons other than individuals
—(i)
In general.
In the case of compensation for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States by a person other than an individual, the part of that compensation that is attributable to the labor or personal services performed within the United States, and that is therefore included in gross income as income from sources within the United States, is determined on the basis that most correctly reflects the proper source of the income under the facts and circumstances of the particular case. In many cases, the facts and circumstances will be such that an apportionment on the time basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, will be acceptable.
(ii)
Example.
The application of paragraph (b)(1)(i) is illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
Corp X, a domestic corporation, receives compensation of $150,000 under a contract for services to be performed concurrently in the United States and in several foreign countries by numerous Corp X employees. Each Corp X employee performing services under this contract performs his or her services exclusively in one jurisdiction. Although the number of employees (and hours spent by employees) performing services under the contract within the United States equals the number of employees (and hours spent by employees) performing services under the contract without the United States, the compensation paid to employees performing services under the contract within the United States is higher because of the more sophisticated nature of the services performed by the employees within the United States. Accordingly, the payroll cost for employees performing services under the contract within the United States is $20,000 out of a total contract payroll cost of $30,000. Under these facts and circumstances, a determination based upon relative payroll costs would be the basis that most correctly reflects the proper source of the income received under the contract. Thus, of the $150,000 of compensation included in Corp X's gross income, $100,000 ($150,000 × $20,000/$30,000) is attributable to the labor or personal services performed within the United States and $50,000 ($150,000 × $10,000/$30,000) is attributable to the labor or personal services performed without the United States.
(2)
Compensation for labor or personal services performed by an individual
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, in the case of compensation for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States by an individual, the part of such compensation that is attributable to the labor or personal services performed within the United States, and that is therefore included in gross income as income from sources within the United States, is determined on the basis that most correctly reflects the proper source of that income under the facts and circumstances of the particular case. In many cases, the facts and circumstances will be such that an apportionment on a time basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, will be acceptable.
(ii)
Employee compensation
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section, in the case of compensation for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States by an individual as an employee, the part of such compensation that is attributable to the labor or personal services performed within the United States, and that is therefore included in gross income as income from sources within the United States, is determined on a time basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section.
(B)
Certain fringe benefits sourced on a geographical basis.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, items of compensation of an individual as an employee for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States that are described in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
1
) through (

) of this section are sourced on a geographical basis in accordance with those paragraphs.

Alternative basis
—(
i
)
Individual as an employee generally.
An individual may determine the source of his or her compensation as an employee for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States under an alternative basis if the individual establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that, under the facts and circumstances of the particular case, the alternative basis more properly determines the source of the compensation than a basis described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (B), whichever is applicable, of this section. An individual that uses an alternative basis must retain in his or her records documentation setting forth why the alternative basis more properly determines the source of the compensation. In addition, the individual must provide the information related to the alternative basis required by applicable Federal tax forms and accompanying instructions.
(
ii
)
Determination by Commissioner.
The Commissioner may, under the facts and circumstances of the particular case, determine the source of compensation that is received by an individual as an employee for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States under an alternative basis other than a basis described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section if such compensation either is not for a specific time period or constitutes in substance a fringe benefit described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section notwithstanding a failure to meet any requirement of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. The Commissioner may make this determination only if such alternative basis determines the source of compensation in a more reasonable manner than the basis used by the individual pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.
(
2
)
Ruling or other administrative pronouncement with respect to groups of taxpayers.
The Commissioner may, by ruling or other administrative pronouncement applying to similarly situated taxpayers generally, permit individuals to determine the source of their compensation as an employee for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States under an alternative basis. Any such individual shall be treated as having met the requirement to establish such alternative basis to the satisfaction of the Commissioner under the facts and circumstances of the particular case, provided that the individual meets the other requirements of
paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
)(
i
) of this section. The Commissioner also may, by ruling or other administrative pronouncement, indicate the circumstances in which he will require individuals to determine the source of certain compensation as an employee for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States under an alternative basis pursuant to the authority under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)(

(D)
Fringe benefits sourced on a geographical basis.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, compensation of an individual as an employee for labor or personal services performed partly within and partly without the United States in the form of the following fringe benefits is sourced on a geographical basis as indicated in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D). The amount of the compensation in the form of the fringe benefit must be reasonable, and the individual must substantiate such amounts by adequate records or by sufficient evidence under rules similar to those set forth in § 1.274-5T(c) or (h) or § 1.132-5. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D), the term
principal place of work
has the same meaning that it has for purposes of section 217 and § 1.217-2(c)(3).
(
1
)
Housing fringe benefit.
The source of compensation in the form of a housing fringe benefit is determined based on the location of the individual's principal place of work. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
1
), a housing fringe benefit includes payments to or on behalf of an individual (and the individual's family if the family resides with the individual) only for rent, utilities (other than telephone charges), real and personal property insurance, occupancy taxes not deductible under section 164 or 216(a), nonrefundable fees paid for securing a leasehold, rental of furniture and accessories, household repairs, residential parking, and the fair rental value of housing provided in kind by the individual's employer. A housing fringe benefit does not include payments for expenses or items set forth in § 1.911-4(b)(2).
(
2
)
Education fringe benefit.
The source of compensation in the form of an education fringe benefit for the education expenses of the individual's dependents is determined based on the location of the individual's principal place of work. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
2
), an education fringe benefit includes payments only for qualified tuition and expenses of the type described in section 530(b)(4)(A)(i) (regardless of whether incurred in connection with enrollment or attendance at a school) and expenditures for room and board and uniforms as described in section 530(b)(4)(A)(ii) with respect to education at an elementary or secondary educational institution.
(
3
)
Local transportation fringe benefit.
The source of compensation in the form of a local transportation fringe benefit is determined based on the location of the individual's principal place of work. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
3
), an individual's local transportation fringe benefit is the amount that the individual receives as compensation for local transportation of the individual or the individual's spouse or dependents at the location of the individual's principal place of work. The amount treated as a local transportation fringe benefit is limited to the actual expenses incurred for local transportation and the fair rental value of any vehicle provided by the employer and used predominantly by the individual or the individual's spouse or dependents for local transportation. For this purpose, actual expenses incurred for local transportation do not include the cost (including interest) of the purchase by the individual, or on behalf of the individual, of an automobile or other vehicle.
(
4
)
Tax reimbursement fringe benefit.
The source of compensation in the form of a foreign tax reimbursement fringe benefit is determined based on the location of the jurisdiction that imposed the tax for which the individual is reimbursed.
(
5
)
Hazardous or hardship duty pay fringe benefit.
The source of compensation in the form of a hazardous or hardship duty pay fringe benefit is determined based on the location of the hazardous or hardship duty zone for which the hazardous or hardship duty pay
fringe benefit is paid. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
5
), a hazardous or hardship duty zone is any place in a foreign country which is either designated by the Secretary of State as a place where living conditions are extraordinarily difficult, notably unhealthy, or where excessive physical hardships exist, and for which a post differential of 15 percent or more would be provided under section 5925(b) of title 5 of the U.S. Code to any officer or employee of the U.S. Government present at that place, or where a civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism, or wartime conditions threatens physical harm or imminent danger to the health and well-being of the individual. Compensation provided an employee during the period that the employee performs labor or personal services in a hazardous or hardship duty zone may be treated as a hazardous or hardship duty pay fringe benefit only if the employer provides the hazardous or hardship duty pay fringe benefit only to employees performing labor or personal services in a hazardous or hardship duty zone. The amount of compensation treated as a hazardous or hardship duty pay fringe benefit may not exceed the maximum amount that the U.S. government would allow its officers or employees present at that location.
(
6
)
Moving expense reimbursement fringe benefit.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
6
), the source of compensation in the form of a moving expense reimbursement is determined based on the location of the employee's new principal place of work. The source of such compensation is determined based on the location of the employee's former principal place of work, however, if the individual provides sufficient evidence that such determination of source is more appropriate under the facts and circumstances of the particular case. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
6
), sufficient evidence generally requires an agreement, between the employer and the employee, or a written statement of company policy, which is reduced to writing before the move and which is entered into or established to induce the employee or employees to move to another country. Such written statement or agreement must state that the employer will reimburse the employee for moving expenses that the employee incurs to return to the employee's former principal place of work regardless of whether he or she continues to work for the employer after returning to that location. The writing may contain certain conditions upon which the right to reimbursement is determined as long as those conditions set forth standards that are definitely ascertainable and can only be fulfilled prior to, or through completion of, the employee's return move to the employee's former principal place of work.
(E)
Time basis.
The amount of compensation for labor or personal services performed within the United States determined on a time basis is the amount that bears the same relation to the individual's total compensation as the number of days of performance of the labor or personal services by the individual within the United States bears to his or her total number of days of performance of labor or personal services. A unit of time less than a day may be appropriate for purposes of this calculation. The time period for which the compensation for labor or personal services is made is presumed to be the calendar year in which the labor or personal services are performed, unless the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, or the Commissioner determines, that another distinct, separate, and continuous period of time is more appropriate. For example, a transfer during a year from a position in the United States to a foreign posting that lasted through the end of that year would generally establish two separate time periods within that taxable year. The first of these time periods would be the portion of the year preceding the start of the foreign posting, and the second of these time periods would be the portion of the year following the start of the foreign posting. However, in the case of a foreign posting that requires short-term returns to the United States to perform services for the employer, such short-term returns would not be sufficient to establish distinct, separate, and continuous time periods within the foreign posting time period but would be relevant to the allocation
of compensation relating to the overall time period. In each case, the source of the compensation on a time basis is based upon the number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) in that separate time period.
(F)
Multi-year compensation arrangements.
The source of multi-year compensation is determined generally on a time basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, over the period to which such compensation is attributable. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(F),
multi-year compensation
means compensation that is included in the income of an individual in one taxable year but that is attributable to a period that includes two or more taxable years. The determination of the period to which such compensation is attributable, for purposes of determining its source, is based upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case. For example, an amount of compensation that specifically relates to a period of time that includes several calendar years is attributable to the entirety of that multi-year period. The amount of such compensation that is treated as from sources within the United States is the amount that bears the same relationship to the total multi-year compensation as the number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that labor or personal services were performed within the United States in connection with the project bears to the total number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if appropriate) that labor or personal services were performed in connection with the project. In the case of stock options, the facts and circumstances generally will be such that the applicable period to which the compensation is attributable is the period between the grant of an option and the date on which all employment-related conditions for its exercise have been satisfied (the vesting of the option).
(G)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii):

# Example 1.
B, a nonresident alien individual, was employed by Corp M, a domestic corporation, from March 1 to December 25 of the taxable year, a total of 300 days, for which B received compensation in the amount of $80,000. Under B's employment contract with Corp M, B was subject to call at all times by Corp M and was in a payment status on a 7-day week basis. Pursuant to that contract, B performed services (or was available to perform services) within the United States for 180 days and performed services (or was available to perform services) without the United States for 120 days. None of B's $80,000 compensation was for fringe benefits as identified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. B determined the amount of compensation that is attributable to his labor or personal services performed within the United States on a time basis under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (E) of this section. B did not assert, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
)(
i
) of this section, that, under the particular facts and circumstances, an alternative basis more properly determines the source of that compensation than the time basis. Therefore, B must include in income from sources within the United States $48,000 ($80,000 × 180/300) of his compensation from Corporation M.

# Example 2.
(i) Same facts as in
Example 1
except that Corp M had a company-wide arrangement with its employees, including B, that they would receive an education fringe benefit, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
2
) of this section, while working in the United States. During the taxable year, B incurred education expenses for his dependent daughter that qualified for the education fringe benefit in the amount of $10,000, for which B received a reimbursement from Corp M. B did not maintain adequate records or sufficient evidence of this fringe benefit as required by paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. When B filed his Federal income tax return for the taxable year, B did not apply paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(
2
) of this section to treat the compensation in the form of the education fringe benefit as income from sources within the United States, the location of his principal place of work during the 300-day period. Rather, B combined the $10,000 reimbursement with his base compensation of $80,000 and applied the time basis of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section to determine the source of his gross income.
(ii) On audit, B argues that because he failed to substantiate the education fringe benefit in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, his entire employment compensation from Corp M is sourced on a time basis pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. The Commissioner, after reviewing Corp M's fringe benefit arrangement, determines, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section, that the $10,000 educational expense reimbursement constitutes in substance a fringe benefit described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
2
) of this section, notwithstanding a failure to meet all of the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section, and that an alternative geographic source basis, under the
facts and circumstances of this particular case, is a more reasonable manner to determine the source of the compensation than the time basis used by B.

# Example 3.
(i) A, a United States citizen, is employed by Corp N, a domestic corporation. A's principal place of work is in the United States. A earns an annual salary of $100,000. During the first quarter of the calendar year (which is also A's taxable year), A performed services entirely within the United States. At the beginning of the second quarter of the calendar year, A was transferred to Country X for the remainder of the year and received, in addition to her annual salary, $30,000 in fringe benefits that are attributable to her new principal place of work in Country X. Corp N paid these fringe benefits separately from A's annual salary. Corp N supplied A with a statement detailing that $25,000 of the fringe benefit was paid for housing, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
1
) of this section, and $5,000 of the fringe benefit was paid for local transportation, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
3
) of this section. None of the local transportation fringe benefit is excluded from the employee's gross income as a qualified transportation fringe benefit under section 132(a)(5). Under A's employment contract, A was required to work on a 5-day week basis, Monday through Friday. During the last three quarters of the year, A performed services 30 days in the United States and 150 days in Country X and other foreign countries.
(ii) A determined the source of all of her compensation from Corp N pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A), (B), and (D)(
1
) and (
3
) of this section. A did not assert, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
)(i) of this section, that, under the particular facts and circumstances, an alternative basis more properly determines the source of that compensation than the bases set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A), (B), and (D)(
1
) and (
3
) of this section. However, in applying the time basis set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, A establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the first quarter of the calendar year and the last three quarters of the calendar year are two separate, distinct, and continuous periods of time. Accordingly, $25,000 of A's annual salary is attributable to the first quarter of the year (25 percent of $100,000). This amount is entirely compensation that was attributable to the labor or personal services performed within the United States and is, therefore, included in gross income as income from sources within the United States. The balance of A's compensation as an employee of Corp N, $105,000 (which includes the $30,000 in fringe benefits that are attributable to the location of A's principal place of work in Country X), is compensation attributable to the final three quarters of her taxable year. During those three quarters, A's periodic performance of services in the United States does not result in distinct, separate, and continuous periods of time. Of the $75,000 paid for annual salary, $12,500 (30/180 × $75,000) is compensation that was attributable to the labor or personal services performed within the United States and $62,500 (150/180 × $75,000) is compensation that was attributable to the labor or personal services performed outside the United States. Pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(
1
) and (
3
) of this section, A sourced the $25,000 received for the housing fringe benefit and the $5,000 received for the local transportation fringe benefit based on the location of her principal place of work, Country X. Accordingly, A included the $30,000 in fringe benefits in her gross income as income from sources without the United States.

# Example 4.
Same facts as in
Example 3.
Of the 150 days during which A performed services in Country X and in other foreign countries (during the final three quarters of A's taxable year), she performed 30 days of those services in Country Y. Country Y is a country designated by the Secretary of State as a place where living conditions are extremely difficult, notably unhealthy, or where excessive physical hardships exist and for which a post differential of 15 percent or more would be provided under section 5925(b) of title 5 of the U.S. Code to any officer or employee of the U.S. government present at that place. Corp N has a policy of paying its employees a $65 premium per day for each day worked in countries so designated. The $65 premium per day does not exceed the maximum amount that the U. S. government would pay its officers or employees stationed in Country Y. Because A performed services in Country Y for 30 days, she earned additional compensation of $1,950. The $1,950 is considered a hazardous duty or hardship pay fringe benefit and is sourced under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(
5
) of this section based on the location of the hazardous or hardship duty zone, Country Y. Accordingly, A included the amount of the hazardous duty or hardship pay fringe benefit ($1,950) in her gross income as income from sources without the United States.

# Example 5.
(i) During 2006 and 2007, Corp P, a domestic corporation, employed four United States citizens, E, F, G, and H to work in its manufacturing plant in Country V. As part of his or her compensation package, each employee arranged for local transportation unrelated to Corp P's business needs. None of the local transportation fringe benefit is excluded from the employee's gross income as a qualified transportation fringe benefit under section 132(a)(5) and (f).
(ii) Under the terms of the compensation package that E negotiated with Corp P, Corp P permitted E to use an automobile owned by Corp P. In addition, Corp P agreed to reimburse E for all expenses incurred by E in
maintaining and operating the automobile, including gas and parking. Provided that the local transportation fringe benefit meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
3
) of this section, E's compensation with respect to the fair rental value of the automobile and reimbursement for the expenses E incurred is sourced under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(
3
) of this section based on E's principal place of work in Country V. Thus, the local transportation fringe benefit will be included in E's gross income as income from sources without the United States.
(iii) Under the terms of the compensation package that F negotiated with Corp P, Corp P let F use an automobile owned by Corp P. However, Corp P did not agree to reimburse F for any expenses incurred by F in maintaining and operating the automobile. Provided that the local transportation fringe benefit meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
3
) of this section, F's compensation with respect to the fair rental value of the automobile is sourced under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(
3
) of this section based on F's principal place of work in Country V. Thus, the local transportation fringe benefit will be included in F's gross income as income from sources without the United States.
(iv) Under the terms of the compensation package that G negotiated with Corp P, Corp P agreed to reimburse G for the purchase price of an automobile that G purchased in Country V. Corp P did not agree to reimburse G for any expenses incurred by G in maintaining and operating the automobile. Because the cost to purchase an automobile is not a local transportation fringe benefit as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
3
) of this section, the source of the compensation to G will be determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (C) of this section.
(v) Under the terms of the compensation package that H negotiated with Corp P, Corp P agreed to reimburse H for the expenses that H incurred in maintaining and operating an automobile, including gas and parking, which H purchased in Country V. Provided that the local transportation fringe benefit meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(
3
) of this section, H's compensation with respect to the reimbursement for the expenses H incurred is sourced under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(
3
) of this section based on H's principal place of work in Country V. Thus, the local transportation fringe benefit will be included in H's gross income as income from sources without the United States.

# Example 6.
(i) On January 1, 2006, Company Q compensates employee J with a grant of options to which section 421 does not apply that do not have a readily ascertainable fair market value when granted. The stock options permit J to purchase 100 shares of Company Q stock for $5 per share. The stock options do not become exercisable unless and until J performs services for Company Q (or a related company) for 5 years. J works for Company Q for the 5 years required by the stock option grant. In years 2006-08, J performs all of his services for Company Q within the United States. In 2009, J performs
1/2
of his services for Company Q within the United States and
1/2
of his services for Company Q without the United States. In year 2010, J performs his services entirely without the United States. On December 31, 2012, J exercises the options when the stock is worth $10 per share. J recognizes $500 in taxable compensation (($10−$5) × 100) in 2012.
(ii) Under the facts and circumstances, the applicable period is the 5-year period between the date of grant (January 1, 2006) and the date the stock options become exercisable (December 31, 2010). On the date the stock options become exercisable, J performs all services necessary to obtain the compensation from Company Q. Accordingly, the services performed after the date the stock options become exercisable are not taken into account in sourcing the compensation from the stock options. Therefore, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A), since J performs 3
1/2
years of services for Company Q within the United States and 1
1/2
years of services for Company Q without the United States during the 5-year period,
7/10
of the $500 of compensation (or $350) recognized in 2012 is income from sources within the United States and the remaining
3/10
of the compensation (or $150) is income from sources without the United States.
(c)
Coastwise travel.
Except as to income excluded by paragraph (a) of this section, wages received for services rendered inside the territorial limits of the United States and wages of an alien seaman earned on a coastwise vessel are to be regarded as from sources within the United States.
(d)
Effective date.
This section applies with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966. For corresponding rules applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, see 26 CFR 1.861-4 (Revised as of January 1, 1972). Paragraph (b) and the first sentence of paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply to taxable years beginning on or after July 14, 2005.

§ 1.861-5
Rentals and royalties.
Gross income from sources within the United States includes rentals or royalties from property located in the United States or from any interest in such property, including rentals or royalties for the use of, or for the privilege of using, in the United States, patents, copyrights, secret processes and formulas, good will, trademarks, trade brands, franchises, and other like property. The income arising from the rental of property, whether tangible or intangible, located within the United States, or from the use of property, whether tangible or intangible, within the United States, is from sources within the United States. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, gains described in section 871(a)(1)(D) and section 881(a)(4) from the sale or exchange after October 4, 1966, of patents, copyrights, and other like property shall be treated, as provided in section 871(e)(2), as rentals or royalties for the use of, or privilege of using, property or an interest in property. See paragraph (e) of § 1.871-11.
[T.D. 7378, 40 FR 45434, Oct. 2, 1975]
§ 1.861-6
Sale of real property.
Gross income from sources within the United States includes gain, computed under the provisions of section 1001 and the regulations thereunder, derived from the sale or other disposition of real property located in the United States. For the treatment of capital gains and losses, see subchapter P (section 1201 and following), chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder.
§ 1.861-7
Sale of personal property.
(a)
General.
Gains, profits, and income derived from the purchase and sale of personal property shall be treated as derived entirely from the country in which the property is sold. Thus, gross income from sources within the United States includes gains, profits, and income derived from the purchase of personal property without the United States and its sale within the United States.
(b)
Purchase within a possession.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, income derived from the purchase of personal property within a possession of the United States and its sale within the United States shall be treated as derived partly from sources within and partly from sources without the United States. See section 863(b)(3) and § 1.863-2.
(c)
Country in which sold.
For purposes of part I (section 861 and following), subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder, a sale of personal property is consummated at the time when, and the place where, the rights, title, and interest of the seller in the property are transferred to the buyer. Where bare legal title is retained by the seller, the sale shall be deemed to have occurred at the time and place of passage to the buyer of beneficial ownership and the risk of loss. However, in any case in which the sales transaction is arranged in a particular manner for the primary purpose of tax avoidance, the foregoing rules will not be applied. In such cases, all factors of the transaction, such as negotiations, the execution of the agreement, the location of the property, and the place of payment, will be considered, and the sale will be treated as having been consummated at the place where the substance of the sale occurred. For determining the place of sale of copyrighted articles transferred through an electronic medium, see § 1.861-18(f)(2)(ii).
(d)
Production and sale.
For provisions respecting the source of income derived from the sale of personal property produced by the taxpayer, see section 863(b)(2) and paragraphs (b) of §§ 1.863-1 and 1.863-2.
(e)
Section 306 stock.
For determining the source of gain on the disposition of section 306 stock, see section 306(f) and the regulations thereunder.

§ 1.861-8
Computation of taxable income from sources within the United States and from other sources and activities.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Scope.
Sections 861(b) and 863(a) state in general terms how to determine taxable income of a taxpayer from sources within the United States after gross income from
sources within the United States has been determined. Sections 862(b) and 863(a) state in general terms how to determine taxable income of a taxpayer from sources without the United States after gross income from sources without the United States has been determined. This section provides specific guidance for applying the cited Code sections by prescribing rules for the allocation and apportionment of expenses, losses, and other deductions (referred to collectively in this section as “deductions”) of the taxpayer. The rules contained in this section apply in determining taxable income of the taxpayer from specific sources and activities under other sections of the Code, referred to in this section as operative sections. See paragraph (f)(1) of this section for a list and description of operative sections. The term
section 861 regulations
means this section and §§ 1.861-8T, 1.861-9, 1.861-9T, 1.861-10, 1.861-10T, 1.861-11, 1.861-11T, 1.861-12, 1.861-12T, 1.861-13, 1.861-14, 1.861-14T, 1.861-17, and 1.861-20.
(2)
Allocation and apportionment of deductions in general.
A taxpayer to which this section applies is required to allocate deductions to a class of gross income and, then, if necessary to make the determination required by the operative section of the Code, to apportion deductions within the class of gross income between the statutory grouping of gross income (or among the statutory groupings) and the residual grouping of gross income. Except for deductions, if any, which are not definitely related to gross income (see paragraphs (c)(3) and (e)(9) of this section) and which, therefore, are ratably apportioned to all gross income, all deductions of the taxpayer (except the deductions for personal exemptions enumerated in paragraph (e)(11) of this section) must be so allocated and apportioned. As further detailed below, allocations and apportionments are made on the basis of the factual relationship of deductions to gross income.
(3)
Class of gross income.
For purposes of this section, the gross income to which a specific deduction is definitely related is referred to as a “class of gross income” and may consist of one or more items (or subdivisions of these items) of gross income enumerated in section 61, namely:
(i) Compensation for services, including fees, commissions, and similar items;
(ii) Gross income derived from business;
(iii) Gains derived from dealings in property;
(iv) Interest;
(v) Rents;
(vi) Royalties;
(vii) Dividends;
(viii) Alimony and separate maintenance payments;
(ix) Annuities;
(x) Income from life insurance and endowment contracts;
(xi) Pensions;
(xii) Income from discharge of indebtedness;
(xiii) Distributive share of partnership gross income;
(xiv) Income in respect of a decedent;
(xv) Income from an interest in an estate or trust.
(4)
Statutory grouping of gross income and residual grouping of gross income.
For purposes of this section, the term “statutory grouping of gross income” or “statutory grouping” means the gross income from a specific source or activity which must first be determined in order to arrive at “taxable income” from which specific source or activity under an operative section. (See paragraph (f)(1) of this section.) Gross income from other sources or activities is referred to as the “residual grouping of gross income” or “residual grouping.” In some instances, where the operative section so requires, the statutory grouping or the residual grouping may include, or consist entirely of, excluded income. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section with respect to the allocation and apportionment of deductions to excluded income.
(b)
Allocation
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the gross income to which a specific deduction is definitely related is referred to as a “class of gross income” and may consist of one or more items of gross income. The rules emphasize the factual relationship between the deduction and a class of gross income. See paragraph (d)(1) of this section which provides that in a taxable year there may be no item of
gross income in a class or less gross income than deductions allocated to the class, and paragraph (d)(2) of this section which provides that a class of gross income may include excluded income. Allocation is accomplished by determining, with respect to each deduction, the class of gross income to which the deduction is definitely related and then allocating the deduction to such class of gross income (without regard to the taxpayable year in which such gross income is received or accrued or is expected to be received or accrued). The classes of gross income are not predetermined but must be determined on the basis of the deductions to be allocated. Although most deductions will be definitely related to some class of a taxpayer's total gross income, some deductions are related to all gross income. In addition, some deductions are treated as not definitely related to any gross income and are ratably apportioned to all gross income. (See paragraph (e)(9) of this section.) In allocating deductions it is not necessary to differentiate between deductions related to one item of gross income and deductions related to another item of gross income where both items of gross income are exclusively within the same statutory grouping or exclusively within the residual grouping.
(2)
Relationship to activity or property.
A deduction shall be considered definitely related to a class of gross income and therefore allocable to such class if it is incurred as a result of, or incident to, an activity or in connection with property from which such class of gross income is derived. Where a deduction is incurred as a result of, or incident to, an activity or in connection with property, which activity or property generates, has generated, or could reasonably have been expected to generate gross income, such deduction shall be considered definitely related to such gross income as a class whether or not there is any item of gross income in such class which is received or accrued during the taxable year and whether or not the amount of deductions exceeds the amount of the gross income in such class. See paragraph (d)(1) of this section with respect to cases in which there is an excess of deductions. In some cases, it will be found that this subparagraph can most readily be applied by determining, with respect to a deduction, the categories of gross income to which it is not related and concluding that it is definitely related to a class consisting of all other gross income.
(3)
Supportive functions.
Deductions which are supportive in nature (such as overhead, general and administrative, and supervisory expenses) may relate to other deductions which can more readily be allocated to gross income. In such instance, such supportive deductions may be allocated and apportioned along with the deductions to which they relate. On the other hand, it would be equally acceptable to attribute supportive deductions on some reasonable basis directly to activities or property which generate, have generated or could reasonably be expected to generate gross income. This would ordinarily be accomplished by allocating the supportive expenses to all gross income or to another broad class of gross income and apportioning the expenses in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For this purpose, reasonable departmental overhead rates may be utilized. For examples of the application of the principles of this paragraph (b)(3) to expenses other than expenses attributable to stewardship activities,
see Examples 19
through
21
of paragraph (g) of this section.
See
paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section for the allocation and apportionment of deductions attributable to stewardship expenses. However, supportive deductions that are described in § 1.861-14T(e)(3) shall be allocated and apportioned in accordance with the rules of § 1.861-14T and shall not be allocated and apportioned by reference only to the gross income of a single member of an affiliated group of corporations as defined in § 1.861-14T(d).
(4)
Deductions related to a class of gross income.
See paragraph (e) of this section for rules relating to the allocation and apportionment of certain specific deductions definitely related to a class of gross income. See paragraph (c)(1) of this section for rules relating to the apportionment of deductions.
(5)
Deductions related to all gross income.
If a deduction does not bear a
definite relationship to a class of gross income constituting less than all of gross income, it shall ordinarily be treated as definitely related and allocable to all of the taxpayer's gross income except where provided to the contrary under paragraph (e) of this section. Paragraph (e)(9) of this section lists various deductions which generally are not definitely related to any gross income and are ratably apportioned to all gross income.
(c)
Apportionment of deductions
—(1)
Deductions definitely related to a class of gross income.
[Reserved]. For guidance, see § 1.861-8T(c)(1).
(2)
Apportionment based on assets.
Certain taxpayers are required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section and § 1.861-9T to apportion interest expense on the basis of assets. A taxpayer may apportion other deductions based on the comparative value of assets that generate income within each grouping, provided that this method reflects the factual relationship between the deduction and the groupings of income and is applied in accordance with the rules of § 1.861-9T(g). In general, such apportionments must be made either on the basis of the tax book value of those assets or, except in the case of interest expense, on the basis of their fair market value.
See
§ 1.861-9(h). Taxpayers using the fair market value method for their last taxable year beginning before January 1, 2018, must change to the tax book value method (or the alternative tax book value method) for purposes of apportioning interest expense for their first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017. The Commissioner's approval is not required for this change. In the case of any corporate taxpayer that both uses tax book value or alternative tax book value, and owns directly or indirectly (within the meaning of § 1.861-12T(c)(2)(ii)(B)) 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in any other corporation (domestic or foreign) that is not a member of the affiliated group (as defined in section 864(e)(5)), the taxpayer must adjust its basis in that stock in the manner described in § 1.861-12(c)(2). For the definition of related persons formerly contained in § 1.861-8T(c)(2), see paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(3)
Deductions not definitely related to any gross income.
If a deduction is not definitely related to any gross income (see paragraph (e)(9) of this section), the deduction must be apportioned ratably between the statutory grouping (or among the statutory groupings) of gross income and the residual grouping. Thus, the amount apportioned to each statutory grouping shall be equal to the same proportion of the deduction which the amount of gross income in the statutory grouping bears to the total amount of gross income. The amount apportioned to the residual grouping shall be equal to the same proportion of the deduction which the amount of the gross income in the residual grouping bears to the total amount of gross income.
(4)
Cross-referenced definition of related persons.
The term related persons means two or more persons in a relationship described in section 267(b). In determining whether two or more corporations are members of the same controlled group under section 267(b)(3), a person is considered to own stock owned directly by such person, stock owned by application of section 1563(e)(1), and stock owned by application of section 267(c). In determining whether a corporation is related to a partnership under section 267(b)(10), a person is considered to own the partnership interest owned directly by such person and the partnership interest owned by application of section 267(e)(3).
(d)
Excess of deductions and excluded and eliminated income
—(1)
Excess of deductions.
Each deduction which bears a definite relationship to a class of gross income shall be allocated to that class in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section even though, for the taxable year, no gross income in such class is received or accrued or the amount of the deduction exceeds the amount of such class of gross income. In apportioning deductions, it may be that, for the taxable year, there is no gross income in the statutory grouping (or residual grouping), or that deductions exceed the amount of gross income in the statutory grouping (or residual grouping). If there is no gross income in a statutory grouping or the
amount of deductions allocated and apportioned to a statutory grouping exceeds the amount of gross income in the statutory grouping, the effects are determined under the operative section. If the taxpayer is a member of a group filing a consolidated return, such excess of deductions allocated or apportioned to a statutory grouping of income of such member is taken into account in determining the consolidated taxable income from such statutory grouping, and such excess of deductions allocated or apportioned to the residual grouping of income is taken into account in determining the consolidated taxable income from the residual grouping. See § 1.1502-12.
(2)
Allocation and apportionment to exempt, excluded, or eliminated income
—(i)
In general.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-8T(d)(2)(i).
(ii)
Exempt income and exempt asset defined
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the term
exempt income
means any gross income to the extent that it is exempt, excluded, or eliminated for Federal income tax purposes. The term
exempt asset
means any asset to the extent income from the asset is (or is treated as under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section) exempt, excluded, or eliminated for Federal income tax purposes.
(B)
Certain stock and dividends.
The term
exempt income
includes the portion of the dividends that are deductible under section 243(a)(1) or (2) (relating to the dividends received deduction) or section 245(a) (relating to the dividends received deduction for dividends from certain foreign corporations). Thus, for purposes of apportioning deductions using a gross income method, gross income does not include a dividend to the extent that it gives rise to a dividends-received deduction under either section 243(a)(1), section 243(a)(2), or section 245(a). In addition, for purposes of apportioning deductions using an asset method, assets do not include that portion of the value of the stock (determined in accordance with § 1.861-9(g), and, as relevant, §§ 1.861-12 and 1.861-13) equal to the portion of dividends that would be offset by a deduction under either section 243(a)(1), section 243(a)(2), or section 245(a), to the extent the stock generates, has generated, or can reasonably be expected to generate such dividends. For example, in the case of stock for which all dividends would be allowed a deduction of 50 percent under section 243(a)(1), 50 percent of the value of the stock is treated as an exempt asset. In the case of stock which generates, has generated, or can reasonably be expected to generate qualifying dividends deductible under section 243(a)(3), such stock does not constitute an exempt asset. However, such stock and the qualifying dividends thereon are eliminated from consideration in the apportionment of interest expense under the affiliated group rule set forth in § 1.861-11T(c), and in the apportionment of other expenses under the affiliated group rules set forth in § 1.861-14T.
(C)
Foreign-derived intangible income and inclusions under section 951A(a)
—(
1
)
Exempt income.
The term “exempt income” includes an amount of a domestic corporation's gross income included in gross foreign-derived deduction eligible income (or gross FDDEI), and also includes an amount of a domestic corporation's gross income from an inclusion under section 951A(a) and the gross up under section 78 attributable to such an inclusion, in each case equal to the amount of the deduction allowed under section 250(a) for such gross income (taking into account the reduction under section 250(a)(2)(B), if any). Therefore, for purposes of apportioning deductions using a gross income method, gross income does not include gross income included in gross FDDEI, an inclusion under section 951A(a), or the gross up under section 78 attributable to an inclusion under section 951A(a), in an amount equal to the amount of the deduction allowed under section 250(a)(1)(A), (B)(i), or (B)(ii), respectively (taking into account the reduction under section 250(a)(2)(B), if any). The term
gross foreign-derived deduction eligible income,
or
gross FDDEI,
has the meaning provided in § 1.250(b)-1(c)(16).
(

)
Exempt assets
—(
i
)
Assets that produce foreign-derived intangible income.
The term “exempt asset” includes the portion of a domestic corporation's assets that produce gross FDDEI equal to the amount of such assets multiplied by the fraction that
equals the amount of the domestic corporation's deduction allowed under section 250(a)(1)(A) (taking into account the reduction under section 250(a)(2)(B)(i), if any) divided by its gross FDDEI. No portion of the value of stock in a foreign corporation is treated as an exempt asset by reason of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
)(
i
), including by reason of a transfer of intangible property to a foreign corporation subject to section 367(d) that gives rise to gross FDDEI.
(
ii
)
Controlled foreign corporation stock that gives rise to inclusions under section 951A(a).
The term “exempt asset” includes a portion of the value of a United States shareholder's stock in a controlled foreign corporation if the United States shareholder is a domestic corporation that is eligible for a deduction under section 250(a) with respect to income described in section 250(a)(1)(B)(i) and all or a portion of the domestic corporation's stock in the controlled foreign corporation is characterized as GILTI inclusion stock. The portion of foreign corporation stock that is treated as an exempt asset for a taxable year equals the portion of the value of such foreign corporation stock (determined in accordance with §§ 1.861-9(g), 1.861-12, and 1.861-13) that is characterized as GILTI inclusion stock multiplied by a fraction that equals the amount of the domestic corporation's deduction allowed under section 250(a)(1)(B)(i) (taking into account the reduction under section 250(a)(2)(B)(ii), if any) divided by its GILTI inclusion amount (as defined in § 1.951A-1(c)(1) or, in the case of a member of a consolidated group, § 1.1502-51(b)) for such taxable year. The portion of controlled foreign corporation stock treated as an exempt asset under this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
)(
ii
) is treated as attributable to the relevant categories of GILTI inclusion stock described in each of paragraphs (d)(2)(ii)(C)(

)(
i
) through (

) of this section based on the relative value of the portion of the stock in each such category.
(

)
GILTI inclusion stock.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section, the term
GILTI inclusion stock
means the aggregate of the portions of the value of controlled foreign corporation stock that are—
(
i
) Assigned to the section 951A category under § 1.861-13(a)(2);
(
ii
) Assigned to a particular treaty category under § 1.861-13(a)(3)(i) (relating to resourced gross tested income stock);
(
iii
) Assigned under § 1.861-13(a)(1) to the gross tested income statutory grouping within the foreign source passive category less the amount described in § 1.861-13(a)(5)(iii)(A);
(

) Assigned under § 1.861-13(a)(1) to the gross tested income statutory grouping within the U.S. source general category less the amount described in § 1.861-13(a)(5)(iv)(A); and
(
v
) Assigned under § 1.861-13(a)(1) to the gross tested income statutory grouping within the U.S. source passive category less the amount described in § 1.861-13(a)(5)(iv)(B).

Example.
The following example illustrates the application of the rules in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C).
(
i
)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, directly owns all of the stock of CFC1 and CFC2, both of which are controlled foreign corporations. The tax book value of CFC1 and CFC2's stock is $10,000x and $9,000x, respectively. Pursuant to § 1.861-13(a), $6,100x of the stock of CFC1 is assigned to the section 951A category under § 1.861-13(a)(2) (“section 951A category stock”) and the remaining $3,900x of the stock of CFC1 is assigned to the general category (“general category stock”). Additionally, $4,880x of the stock of CFC2 is section 951A category stock and the remaining $4,120x of the stock of CFC2 is general category stock. Under section 951A and the section 951A regulations (as defined in § 1.951A-1(a)(1)), USP's GILTI inclusion amount is $610x. The portion of USP's deduction under section 250 described in section 250(a)(1)(B)(i) is $305x. No portion of USP's deduction is reduced by reason of section 250(a)(2)(B)(ii).
(
ii
)
Analysis.
For purposes of apportioning deductions where section 904 is
the operative section, under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, $305x of USP's gross income attributable to its GILTI inclusion amount is exempt income. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section, the GILTI inclusion stock of CFC1 is the $6,100x of stock that is section 951A category stock and the GILTI inclusion stock of CFC2 is the $4,880x of stock that is section 951A category stock. Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section, the portion of the value of the stock of CFC1 and CFC2 that is treated as an exempt asset equals the portion of the value of the stock of CFC1 and CFC2 that is GILTI inclusion stock multiplied by 50% ($305x/$610x). Accordingly, the exempt portion of the stock of CFC1 is $3,050x (50% × $6,100x) and the exempt portion of CFC2's stock is $2,440x (50% × $4,880x). Therefore, the stock of CFC1 taken into account for purposes of apportioning deductions is $3,050x of non-exempt section 951A category stock and $3,900x of general category stock. The stock of CFC2 taken into account for purposes of apportioning deductions is $2,440x of non-exempt section 951A category stock and $4,120x of general category stock.

Value of stock attributable to previously taxed earnings and profits.
No portion of the value of stock in a controlled foreign corporation is treated as an exempt asset by reason of the controlled foreign corporation having previously taxed earnings and profits. For example, no portion of the value of stock in a controlled foreign corporation is treated as an exempt asset by reason of the adjustment under § 1.861-12(c)(2) in respect of previously taxed earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(1) or (c)(2) (including earnings and profits described in section 959(c)(2) by reason of section 951A(f)(1) and § 1.951A-6(b)(1)).

Dividends-received deduction and tax-exempt interest of insurance companies
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of characterizing gross income or assets as exempt or not exempt under this section, the following rules apply on a company wide basis pursuant to the rules in paragraphs (d)(2)(v)(A)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section.
(
1
) In the case of an insurance company taxable under section 801, the term
exempt income
includes the portion of dividends received that satisfy the requirements of deductibility under sections 243(a)(1) and (2) and 245(a) but without regard to any disallowance under section 805(a)(4)(A)(ii) of the policyholder's share of the dividends or any similar disallowance under section 805(a)(4)(D), and also includes tax-exempt interest but without reduction for the policyholder's share of tax-exempt interest that reduces the closing balance of items described in section 807(c), as provided under section 807(a)(2)(B) and 807(b)(1)(B). The term
exempt assets
includes the corresponding portion of assets that generates, has generated, or can reasonably be expected to generate exempt income described in the preceding sentence. See § 1.861-8(e)(16) for a special rule concerning the allocation of reserve expenses to dividends received by a life insurance company.
(
2
) In the case of an insurance company taxable under section 831, the term
exempt income
includes the portion of interest and dividends deductible under sections 832(c)(7) and (12) or sections 834(c)(1) and (7). Exempt income also includes the amounts reducing the losses incurred under section 832(b)(5) to the extent such amounts are not already taken into account in the preceding sentence. The term
exempt assets
includes the corresponding portion of assets that give rise to exempt income described in the preceding two sentences.

Facts.
U.S.C. is a domestic life insurance company that has $300x; of gross income, consisting of $100x of foreign source general category income and $200x of U.S. source passive category interest income, $100x; of the latter of which is tax-exempt interest income from municipal bonds under section 103. U.S.C.'s opening balance of its section 807(c) reserves is $50,000x; and USP's closing balance of its section 807(c) reserves is $50,130x. Under section 807(b)(1)(B), USP's closing balance of its section 807(c) reserves, $50,130x, is reduced by the amount of the policyholder's share of tax-exempt interest. The policyholder's share of tax-exempt interest under section 812(b) is equal to 30 percent of the $100x of tax-exempt interest ($30x). Therefore, under sections 803(a)(2) and 807(b), USP's reserve deduction is $100x ($50,130x of reserve deduction minus $30x (30 percent of $100x of tax-exempt interest), minus $50,000x). U.S.C. has no other income or deductions.

)
Analysis—allocation.
Under section 818(f)(1), U.S.C.'s reserve deduction is treated as an item that cannot be definitely allocated to an item or class of gross income. Accordingly, under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, U.S.C.'s reserve deduction is allocable to all of U.S.C.'s gross income as a class.
(
iii
)
Analysis—apportionment.
Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the reserve deduction is ratably apportioned between the statutory grouping (foreign source general category income) and the residual grouping (U.S. source income) on the basis of the relative amounts of gross income in each grouping. For purposes of apportioning deductions under § 1.861-8T(d)(2)(i)(B), exempt income is not taken into account. Under paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A)(
1
) of this section, in the case of an insurance company taxable under section 801, exempt income includes tax-exempt interest without regard to any reduction for the policyholder's share. U.S.C. has U.S. source income of $200x of which $100x is tax-exempt without regard to the reduction for the policyholder's share of tax-exempt interest that reduces the closing balance of items described in section 807(c). Thus, the gross income taken into account in apportioning U.S.C.'s reserve deduction is $100x of foreign source general category gross income and $100x of U.S. source gross income. Of U.S.C.'s $100x reserve deduction, $50x ($100 × $100x;/$200x) is apportioned to foreign source general category gross income and $50x ($100x × $100x/$200x) is apportioned to U.S. source gross income.

Facts.
U.S.C. is a domestic life insurance company that has $300x of gross income consisting of $10x of foreign source general category income and $200x of U.S. source general category dividend income eligible for the 50% dividends received deduction (DRD) under section 243(a)(1). Under section 805(a)(4)(A)(ii), U.S.C. is allowed a 50% DRD on the company's share of the dividend received. Under section 812(a), the company's share of the dividend is equal to 70% of the dividend income eligible for the DRD under section 243(a)(1), which results in a DRD of $70x (50% × 70% × $200), and under section 812(b), the policyholder's share of the dividend is equal to 30% of the dividend income eligible for the DRD under section 243(a)(1), which would result in a DRD of $30x (50% × 30% × $200x). U.S.C. is entitled to a $130x deduction for an increase in its life insurance reserves under sections 803(a)(2) and 807(b). Unlike for tax-exempt interest income, there is no adjustment under section 807(b)(1)(B) to the reserve deduction for the policyholder's share of dividends that would be offset by the DRD under section 243(a)(1). U.S.C. has no other income or deductions.
(
ii
)
Analysis—allocation.
Under section 818(f)(1), U.S.C.'s reserve deduction is treated as an item that cannot be definitely allocated to an item or class of gross income except that, under § 1.861-8(e)(16), an amount of reserve expenses of a life insurance company equal to the DRD that is disallowed because it is attributable to the policyholder's share of dividends is treated as definitely related to such dividends. Thus, U.S.C. has a life insurance reserve deduction of $130x, of which $30 (equal to the policyholder's share of the DRD that would have been allowed under section 243(a)(1)) is directly allocated
and apportioned to U.S. source dividend income. Under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the remaining portion of U.S.C.'s reserve deduction ($100x) is allocable to all of U.S.C.'s gross income as a class.
(
iii
)
Analysis—apportionment.
Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the deduction is ratably apportioned between the statutory grouping (foreign source general category income) and the residual grouping (U.S. source income) on the basis of the relative amounts of gross income in each grouping. For purposes of apportioning deductions under § 1.861-8T(d)(2)(i)(B), exempt income is not taken into account. Under paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A)(
1
) of this section, in the case of an insurance company taxable under section 801, exempt income includes dividends deductible under section 805(a)(4) without regard to any reduction to the DRD for the policyholder's share in section 804(a)(4)(A)(ii). Thus, the gross income taken into account in apportioning $100x of U.S.C.'s remaining reserve deduction is $100x of foreign source general category gross income and $100x of U.S. source gross income. Of U.S.C.'s $100x remaining reserve deduction, $50x ($100x × $100x /$200x) is apportioned to foreign source general category gross income and $50x ($100x × $100x/$200x) is apportioned to U.S. source gross income.

Stewardship and controlled services
—(i)
Expenses attributable to controlled services.
If a taxpayer performs a controlled services transaction (as defined in § 1.482-9(l)(1)), which includes any activity by one member of a group of controlled taxpayers (the renderer) that results in a benefit to a controlled taxpayer (the recipient), and the renderer charges the recipient for such services, section 482 and § 1.482-1 provide for an allocation where the charge is not consistent with an arm's length result. The deductions for expenses incurred by the renderer in performing such services are considered definitely related to the amounts so charged and are to be allocated to such amounts.
(ii)
Stewardship expenses
—(A)
In general.
Stewardship expenses are those expenses resulting from “duplicative activities” (as defined in § 1.482-9(l)(3)(iii)) or “shareholder activities” (as defined in § 1.482-9(l)(3)(iv)) that are undertaken for a person's own benefit as an investor in a related entity, which for purposes of this paragraph (e)(4)(ii) includes a business entity as described in § 301.7701-2(a) of this chapter that is classified for Federal income tax purposes as either a corporation or a partnership, or is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner (“disregarded entity”). Thus, for example, stewardship expenses include expenses of an activity the sole effect of which is to protect the investor's capital investment in the entity or to facilitate compliance by the investor with reporting, legal, or regulatory requirements applicable specifically to
the investor. If an investor has a foreign or international department which exercises oversight functions with respect to related entities and, in addition, the department performs other functions that generate other foreign-source income (such as fees for services rendered outside of the United States for the benefit of foreign related corporations or foreign-source royalties), some part of the deductions with respect to that department are considered definitely related to the other foreign-source income. In some instances, the operations of a foreign or international department will also generate U.S. source income (such as fees for services performed in the United States). Stewardship expenses are allocated and apportioned on a separate entity basis without regard to the affiliated group rules in § 1.861-14. See § 1.861-14(e)(1)(i).
(B)
Allocation.
In the case of stewardship expenses incurred to oversee a corporation, the expenses are considered definitely related and allocable to dividends received or amounts included, or to be received or included, under sections 78, 301, 951, 951A, 1291, 1293, and 1296, from the corporation. In the case of stewardship expenses incurred to oversee a partnership, the expenses are considered definitely related and allocable to a partner's distributive share of partnership income. In the case of stewardship expenses incurred to oversee a disregarded entity, the expenses are considered definitely related and allocable to all gross income attributable to the disregarded entity. Stewardship expenses are allocated to income from a particular entity (or entities) related to the taxpayer if the expense is definitely related to the oversight of that entity or entities as provided in § 1.861-8(b)(1) under all the facts and circumstances.
(C)
Apportionment.
Stewardship expenses must be apportioned between the statutory and residual groupings based on the relative values of the entity or entities in each grouping that are owned by the investor taxpayer, and without regard to the relative amounts of gross income in the statutory and residual groupings to which the stewardship expense is allocated. In the case of stewardship expenses incurred to oversee a lower-tier entity owned indirectly by the taxpayer, the stewardship expenses must be apportioned based on the relative values of the owner or owners of the lower-tier entity that are owned directly by the taxpayer. In the case of stewardship expenses incurred to oversee a corporation, the corporation's value is the value of its stock as determined and characterized under the asset method in § 1.861-9 (and, as relevant, §§ 1.861-12 and 1.861-13) for purposes of allocating and apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the corporation is a member of the same affiliated group as the investor, the value of the corporation's stock is determined under the asset method in § 1.861-9 and is characterized by the investor in proportion to how the corporation's assets are characterized for purposes of apportioning the group's interest expense. In the case of stewardship expenses incurred to oversee a partnership, the partnership's value is determined and characterized under the asset method in § 1.861-9 (taking into account any adjustments under sections 734(b) and 743(b)). In the case of stewardship expenses incurred to oversee a disregarded entity, the disregarded entity's character and value is determined using the principles of the asset method in § 1.861-9 as if the disregarded entity were treated as a corporation for Federal income tax purposes. For purposes of determining the tax book value of assets under this paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(C), section 864(e)(3) and § 1.861-8(d)(2) do not apply.
(5)
Legal and accounting fees and expenses; damages awards, prejudgment interest, and settlement payments
—(i)
Legal and accounting fees and expenses.
Fees and other expenses for legal and accounting services are ordinarily definitely related and allocable to specific classes of gross income or to all the taxpayer's gross income, depending on the nature of the services rendered (and are apportioned as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section). For example, accounting fees for the preparation of a study of the costs involved in manufacturing a specific product will ordinarily be definitely related to the class of gross income derived from
(or which could reasonably have been expected to be derived from) that specific product. The taxpayer is not relieved from his responsibility to make a proper allocation and apportionment of fees on the grounds that the statement of services rendered does not identify the services performed beyond a generalized designation such as “professional,” or does not provide any type of allocation, or does not properly allocate the fees involved.
(ii)
Product liability and other claims for damages.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(5), awards for litigation or arbitral damages, prejudgment interest, and payments in settlement of or in anticipation of claims for damages, including punitive damages, arising from claims relating to sales, licenses, or leases of products or the provision of services, are definitely related and allocable to the class of gross income of the type produced by the specific sales or leases of the products or provision of services that gave rise to the claims for damage or injury. Such damages and payments may include, but are not limited to, product liability or patent infringement claims. The deductions are apportioned among the statutory and residual groupings on the basis of the relative amounts of gross income in the relevant class in each grouping in the year in which the deductions are allowed. If the claims arise from an event incident to the production or sale of products or provision of services (such as an industrial accident), the payments are definitely related and allocable to the class of gross income ordinarily produced by the assets that are involved in the event. The deductions are apportioned among the statutory and residual groupings on the basis of the relative values (as determined under the asset method in § 1.861-9 for purposes of allocating and apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense) of the assets that were involved in the event or (if the taxpayer no longer owns the assets involved in the event) the assets that are used to produce or sell products or services in the relevant class in each grouping; such values are determined in the year the deductions are allowed.
(iii)
Investor lawsuits.
If the claims are made by investors in a corporation and arise from negligence, fraud, or other malfeasance of the corporation (or its representatives), then the damages, prejudgment interest, and settlement payments paid by the corporation are definitely related and allocable to all income of the corporation and are apportioned among the statutory and residual groupings based on the relative value of the corporation's assets in each grouping (as determined under the asset method in § 1.861-9 for purposes of allocating and apportioning the taxpayer's interest expense) in the year the deductions are allowed.
(6)
Income taxes
—(i)
In general.
The deduction for foreign income, war profits, and excess profits taxes allowed by section 164 is allocated and apportioned among the applicable statutory and residual groupings under § 1.861-20. The deduction for state and local taxes (
state income taxes
) allowed by section 164 is considered definitely related and allocable to the gross income with respect to which such state income taxes are imposed. For example, if a domestic corporation is subject to state income taxation and the state income tax is imposed in part on an amount of foreign source income, then that part of the taxpayer's deduction for state income tax that is attributable to foreign source income is definitely related and allocable to foreign source income. In allocating and apportioning the deduction for state income tax for purposes including (but not limited to) the computation of the foreign tax credit limitation under section 904 of the Code and the consolidated foreign tax credit under § 1.1502-4 of the regulations, the income upon which the state income tax is imposed is determined by reference to the law of the jurisdiction imposing the tax. Thus, if a state attributes taxable income to a corporate taxpayer by applying an apportionment formula that takes into consideration the income and factors of one or more corporations related by ownership to the corporate taxpayer and engaging in activities related to the business of the corporate taxpayer, then the income so attributed is the income upon which the state income tax is imposed. If the income so attributed to
the corporate taxpayer includes foreign source income, then, in computing the taxpayer's foreign tax credit limitation under section 904, for example, the taxpayer's deduction for state income tax will be considered definitely related and allocable to a class of gross income that includes the statutory grouping of foreign source income. When the law of the state includes dividends that are treated under section 862(a)(2) as income from sources without the United States in taxable income apportionable to the state, but does not include factors of the corporation paying such dividends in the apportionment formula used to determine state taxable income, an appropriate portion of the deduction for state income tax will be considered definitely related and allocable to a class of gross income consisting solely of foreign source dividend income. A deduction for state income tax will not be considered definitely related to a hypothetical amount of income calculated under federal tax principles when the jurisdiction imposing the tax computes taxable income under different principles. A corporate taxpayer's deduction for a state franchise tax that is computed on the basis of income attributable to business activities conducted within the state must be allocated and apportioned in the same manner as the deduction for state income taxes. In determining, for example, both the foreign tax credit under section 904 of the Code and the consolidated foreign tax credit limitation under § 1.1502-4 of the regulations, the deduction for state income tax may be allocable and apportionable to foreign source income in a statutory grouping described in section 904(d) in a taxable year in which the taxpayer has no foreign source income in such statutory grouping. Alternatively, such an allocation or apportionment may be appropriate if a taxpayer corporation has no foreign source income in a statutory grouping, but its deduction is attributable to foreign source income in such grouping that is attributed to the taxpayer corporation under the law of a state which attributes taxable income to a corporation by applying an apportionment formula that takes into consideration the income and factors of one or more corporations related by ownership to the taxpayer corporation and engaging in activities related to the business of the taxpayer corporation. Example 30 of paragraph (g) of this section illustrates the application of this last rule.
(ii)
Methods of allocation and apportionment
—(A)
In general.
A taxpayer's deduction for a state income tax is to be allocated (and then apportioned, if necessary, subject to the rules of § 1.861-8(d)) by reference to the taxable income that the law of the taxing jurisdiction attributes to the taxpayer (“state taxable income”).

Illustrations
—(
1
)
In general.
Examples 25 through 32 of paragraph (g) of § 1.861-8 illustrate, in the given factual situations, the application of this paragraph (e)(6) and the general rule of paragraph (b)(1) of this section that a deduction must be allocated to the class of gross income to which the deduction is factually related. In general, these examples employ a presumption that state income taxes are allocable to a class of gross income that includes the statutory grouping of income from sources without the United States when the total amount of taxable income determined under state law exceeds the amount of taxable income determined under the Code (without taking into account the deduction for state income taxes) in the residual grouping of income from sources within the United States. A taxpayer that allocates and apportions the deduction for state income tax in accordance with the methodology of Example 25 of paragraph (g) of this section must also apply the modifications illustrated in Examples 26 and 27 of paragraph (g) of this section, when applicable. The modification illustrated in
Example 26
is applicable when the deduction for state income tax is attributable in part to taxes imposed by a state which factually excludes foreign source income (as determined for federal income tax purposes) from state taxable income. The modification illustrated in
Example 27
is applicable when the taxpayer has income-producing activities in a
state which does not impose a corporate income tax. The specific allocation of state income tax illustrated in Example 28 follows the rule in paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section, and must be applied whenever a taxpayer's state taxable income includes dividends apportioned to the state under a formula that does not take into account the factors of the corporations paying those dividends, regardless of whether the taxpayer uses the methodology of Example 25 with respect to the remainder of the deduction for state income taxes.
(
2
)
Modifications.
Before applying a method of allocation and apportionment illustrated in the examples, the computation of state taxable income under state law may be modified, subject to the approval of the District Director, to reflect more accurately the income with respect to which the state income tax is imposed. Any modification to the state law computation of state taxable income must yield an allocation and apportionment of the deduction for state income taxes that is consistent with the rules contained in this paragraph (e)(6), and that accurately reflects the factual relationship between the state income tax and the income on which that tax is imposed. For example, a modification to the computation of taxable income under state law might be appropriate to compensate for differences between the state law definition of taxable income and the federal definition of taxable income, due to a difference in the rate of allowable depreciation or the amount of another deduction that is allowable under both systems. This rule is illustrated in Example 31 of paragraph (g) of this section. However, a modification to the computation of taxable income under state law will not be appropriate, and will not more accurately reflect the factual relationship between the state tax and the income on which the tax is imposed, to the extent such modification reflects the fact that the state does not follow federal tax principles in attributing income to the taxpayer's activities in the state. This rule is illustrated in Example 32 of paragraph (g) of this section. A taxpayer may not modify the methods illustrated in the examples, or use an alternative method of allocation and apportionment of the deduction for state income taxes, if the modification or alternative method would be inconsistent with the rules of paragraph (e)(6)(i) of this section. A taxpayer that uses a method of allocation and apportionment other than one illustrated in Example 25 (as modified by Examples 26 and 27), or 29 with respect to a factual situation similar to those of the examples, must describe the alternative method on an attachment to its federal income tax return and establish to the satisfaction of the District Director, upon examination, that the result of the alternative method more accurately reflects the factual relationship between the state income tax and the income on which the tax is imposed.

Elective safe harbor methods
—(
1
)
In general.
In lieu of applying the rules set forth in paragraphs (e)(6)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section, a taxpayer may elect to allocate and apportion the deduction for state income tax in accordance with one of the two safe harbor methods described in paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(D)(
2
) and (
3
) of this section. A taxpayer shall make this election for a taxable year by filing a timely tax return for that year that reflects an allocation and apportionment of the deduction for state income tax under one of the safe harbor methods and attaching to such return a statement that the taxpayer has elected to use the safe harbor method provided in either paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(D)(
2
) or (
3
) of this section, as appropriate. Once made, this election is effective for the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years, and may be revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner. Example 33 of paragraph (g) of this section illustrates the application of these safe harbor methods.
(
2
)
Method One
—(
i
)
Step One—Specific allocation to foreign source portfolio dividends and other income.
If any portion of the deduction for state income tax is attributable to tax imposed by a state which includes in a corporate taxpayer's taxable income apportionable to the state, portfolio dividends (as defined in paragraph (i) of Example 28 of paragraph (g) of this section) that are
treated under section 862(a)(2) as income from sources without the United States, but does not include factors of the corporations paying the portfolio dividends in the apportionment formula used to determine state taxable income, the taxpayer shall allocate an appropriate portion of the deduction to a class of gross income consisting solely of foreign source portfolio dividends. The portion of the deduction so allocated, and the amount of foreign source portfolio dividends included in such class, shall be determined in accordance with the methodology illustrated in paragraph (ii) of Example 28 of paragraph (g). If a state income tax is determined based upon formulary apportionment of the total taxable income attributable to the taxpayer's unitary business, the taxpayer must also apply the methodology illustrated in paragraph (ii)(C) through (G) of Example 29 of paragraph (g) of this section to make specific allocations of appropriate portions of the deduction for state income tax on the basis of income that, under separate accounting, would have been attributed to other members of the unitary group. The taxpayer shall reduce its aggregate state taxable income by the amount of foreign source portfolio dividends and other income to which a specific allocation is made (the reduced amount being referred to hereinafter as “adjusted state taxable income”).
(
ii
)
Step Two—Adjustment of U.S. source federal taxable income.
If the taxpayer has significant income-producing activities in a state which does not impose a corporate income tax or other state tax measured by income derived from business activities in the state, the taxpayer shall reduce its U.S. source federal taxable income (solely for purposes of this safe harbor method) by the amount of federal taxable income attributable to its activities in such state. This amount shall be determined in accordance with the methodology illustrated in paragraph (ii) of Example 27 of paragraph (g) of this section, provided that the taxpayer shall be required to use the rules of the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act to attribute income to the relevant state. The taxpayer's U.S. source federal taxable income, as so reduced, is referred to hereinafter as “adjusted U.S. source federal taxable income.”
(
iii
)
Step Three—Allocation.
The taxpayer shall allocate the remainder of the deduction for state income tax (after reduction by the portion allocated to foreign source portfolio dividends and other income under Step One) in accordance with the methodology illustrated in paragraph (ii) of Example 25 of paragraph (g) of this section. However, the taxpayer shall substitute for the comparison of aggregate state taxable income to U.S. source federal taxable income, illustrated in paragraph (ii) of Example 25 of paragraph (g) of this section, a comparison of its adjusted state taxable income to an amount equal to 110% of its adjusted U.S. source federal taxable income.
(
iv
)
Step Four—Apportionment.
In the event that apportionment of the remainder of the deduction for state income tax is required, the taxpayer shall apportion that remaining deduction to U.S. source income in accordance with the methodology illustrated in paragraph (iii) of Example 25 of paragraph (g) of this section, substituting for domestic source income in that paragraph an amount equal to 110% of the taxpayer's adjusted U.S. source federal taxable income. The remaining portion of the deduction shall be apportioned to the statutory groupings of foreign source income described in section 904(d) of the Code in accordance with the proportion of the income in each statutory grouping of foreign source income described in section 904(d) to the taxpayer's total foreign source federal taxable income (after reduction by the amount of foreign source portfolio dividends to which tax has been specifically allocated under Step One, above).

The taxpayer shall allocate the remainder of the deduction for state income tax (after reduction by the portion allocated to foreign source portfolio dividends and other income under Step One) in accordance with the methodology illustrated in paragraph (ii) of Example 25 of paragraph (g) of this section. However, the taxpayer shall substitute for the comparison of aggregate state taxable income to U.S. source federal taxable income, illustrated in paragraph (ii) of Example 25 of paragraph (g) of this section, a comparison of its adjusted state taxable income to its adjusted U.S. source federal taxable income.

Step Four—Apportionment.
In the event that apportionment of the deduction is required, the taxpayer shall apportion to U.S. source income that portion of the deduction that is attributable to state income taxes imposed upon an amount of state taxable income equal to adjusted U.S. source federal taxable income. The taxpayer shall apportion the remaining amount of the deduction to U.S. and foreign source income in the same proportions that the taxpayer's adjusted U.S. source federal taxable income and foreign source federal taxable income (after reduction by the amount of foreign source portfolio dividends to which tax has been specifically allocated under Step One, above) bear to its total federal taxable income (taking into account the adjustment of U.S. source federal taxable income under Step Two and after reduction by the amount of foreign source portfolio dividends to which tax has been specifically allocated under Step One). The portion of the deduction apportioned to foreign source income shall be apportioned among the statutory groupings described in section 904(d) of the Code in accordance with the proportions of the taxpayer's total foreign source federal taxable income (after reduction by the amount of foreign source portfolio dividends to which tax has been specifically allocated under Step One, above) in each grouping.
(7)
Losses on the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property.
See §§ 1.865-1 and 1.865-2 for rules regarding the allocation and apportionment of certain losses.
(8)
Net operating loss deduction
—(i)
Components of net operating loss.
A net operating loss is separated into components that are assigned to statutory or residual groupings by reference to the losses in each such statutory or residual grouping that are not allocated to reduce income in other groupings in the taxable year of the loss. For example, for purposes of applying this paragraph (e)(8)(i) with respect to section 904 as the operative section, the source and separate category components of a net operating loss are determined by reference to the amounts of separate limitation loss and U.S. source loss (determined without regard to adjustments required under section 904(b)) that are not allocated to reduce U.S. source income or income in other separate categories under the rules of sections 904(f) and 904(g) for the taxable year in which the net operating loss arose. See § 1.904(g)-3(d)(2). See § 1.1502-4 for rules applicable in computing the foreign tax credit limitation and determining the source and separate category of a net operating loss of a consolidated group. Similarly, for purposes of applying this paragraph (e)(8)(i) with respect to another operative section (as described in § 1.861-8(f)(1)), a net operating loss is divided into component parts based on the amounts of the deductions that are assigned to the relevant statutory and residual groupings and that are not absorbed in the taxable year in which the loss is incurred under the rules of that operative section. Deductions that are considered absorbed for purposes of an operative section may differ from the deductions that are considered absorbed for purposes of another provision of the Code that requires determining the components of a net operating loss.
(ii)
Allocation and apportionment of section 172 deduction.
A net operating loss taken as a deduction in computing taxable income for a particular taxable year as allowed under section 172 is allocated and apportioned to statutory and residual groupings by reference to the statutory and residual groupings of the components of the net operating loss (as determined under paragraph
(e)(8)(i) of this section) that is deducted in the taxable year. Except as provided under the rules for an operative section, if the full net operating loss carryover is not taken as a deduction in a taxable year, the partial net operating loss deduction is treated as ratably comprising the components of a net operating loss. See, for example, § 1.904(g)-3, which is an exception to the general rule described in the previous sentence and provides rules for determining the source and separate category of a partial net operating loss deduction for purposes of section 904 as the operative section.
(9)
Deductions which are not definitely related.
Deductions which shall generally be considered as not definitely related to any gross income, and therefore are ratably apportioned as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, are—
(i) The deduction allowed by section 163 for interest described in subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph (e);
(ii) The deduction allowed by section 164 for real estate taxes on a personal residence or for sales tax on the purchase of items for personal use;
(iii) The deduction for medical expenses allowed by section 213; and
(iv) The deduction for alimony payments allowed by section 215.
(10) [Reserved]
(11)
Personal exemptions.
The deductions for the personal exemptions allowed by section 151, 642(b), or 873(b)(3) shall not be taken into account for purpose of allocation and apportionment under this section.
(12)
Deductions for certain charitable contributions
—(i)
In general.
The deduction for charitable contributions that is allowed under sections 170, 873(b)(2), and 882(c)(1)(B) is definitely related and allocable to all of the taxpayer's gross income. The deduction allocated under this paragraph (e)(12)(i) shall be apportioned between the statutory grouping (or among the statutory groupings) of gross income and the residual grouping on the basis of the relative amounts of gross income from sources in the United States in each grouping.
(ii)
Treaty provisions.
If a deduction for charitable contributions not otherwise permitted by sections 170, 873(b)(2), and 882(c)(1)(B) is allowed under a U.S. income tax treaty, and such treaty limits the amount of the deduction based on a percentage of income arising from sources within the treaty partner, the deduction is definitely related and allocable to all of the taxpayer's gross income. The deduction allocated under this paragraph (e)(12)(ii) shall be apportioned between the statutory grouping (or among the statutory groupings) of gross income and the residual grouping on the basis of the relative amounts of gross income from sources within the treaty partner within each grouping.
(iii)
Coordination with §§ 1.861-14 and 1.861-14T.
A deduction for a charitable contribution by a member of an affiliated group shall be allocated and apportioned under the rules of this section, § 1.861-14(e)(6), and § 1.861-14T(c)(1).
(13)
Foreign-derived intangible income.
The portion of the deduction that is allowed for foreign-derived intangible income under section 250(a)(1)(A) (taking into account the reduction under section 250(a)(2)(B)(i), if any) is considered definitely related and allocable to the class of gross income included in the taxpayer's foreign-derived deduction eligible income (as defined in section 250(b)(4)). If necessary, the portion of the deduction is apportioned within the class ratably between the statutory grouping (or among the statutory groupings) of gross income and the residual grouping of gross income based on the relative amounts of foreign-derived deduction eligible income in each grouping.
(14)
Global intangible low-taxed income and related section 78 gross up.
The portion of the deduction (taking into account the reduction under section 250(a)(2)(B)(ii), if any) that is allowed for the global intangible low-taxed income amount described in section 250(a)(1)(B)(i), and that is allowed for the section 78 gross up under section 250(a)(1)(B)(ii), is considered definitely related and allocable to the class of gross income included under section 951A(a) and section 78, respectively. If necessary (for example, because a portion of the inclusion under section 951A(a) is passive category income or U.S. source income), the portion of the deduction is apportioned within the
class ratably between the statutory grouping (or among the statutory groupings) of gross income and the residual grouping of gross income based on the relative amounts of gross income in each grouping.
(15)
Distributive share of partnership deductions.
In general, if deductions are incurred by a partnership in which the taxpayer is a partner, the taxpayer's deductions that are allocated and apportioned include the taxpayer's distributive share of the partnership's deductions. See §§ 1.861-9(e), 1.861-17(f), and 1.904-4(n)(1)(ii) for special rules for apportioning a partner's distributive share of deductions of a partnership.
(16)
Special rule for the allocation and apportionment of reserve expenses of a life insurance company.
An amount of reserve expenses of a life insurance company equal to the dividends received deduction that is disallowed because it is attributable to the policyholders' share of dividends received is treated as definitely related to such dividends. See paragraph (d)(2)(v)(B)(
2
) of this section (
Example 2
).
(f)
Miscellaneous matters
—(1)
Operative sections.
The operative sections of the Code which require the determination of taxable income of the taxpayer from specific sources or activities and which give rise to statutory groupings to which this section is applicable include the sections described below.
(i) [Reserved]
(ii)
Separate foreign tax credit limitations.
Section 904(d)(1) and other sections described in § 1.904-4(m) require that a separate foreign tax credit limitation be determined with respect to each separate category of income specified in those sections. Accordingly, the foreign source income within each separate category described in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(v) constitutes a separate statutory grouping of income. U.S. source income is treated as income in the residual grouping for purposes of determining the limitation on the foreign tax credit.
(iii)
DISC and FSC taxable income.
Sections 925 and 994 provide rules for determining the taxable income of a FSC and DISC, respectively, with respect to qualified sales and leases of export property and qualified services. The combined taxable income method available for determining a DISC's taxable income provides, without consideration of export promotion expenses, that the taxable income of the DISC shall be 50 percent of the combined taxable income of the DISC and the related supplier derived from sales and leases of export property and from services. In the FSC context, the taxable income of the FSC equals 23 percent of the combined taxable income of the FSC and the related supplier. Pursuant to regulations under section 925 and 994, this section provides rules for determining the deductions to be taken into account in determining combined taxable income, except to the extent modified by the marginal costing rules set forth in the regulations under sections 925(b)(2) and 994(b)(2) if used by the taxpayer. See
Examples
(22) and (23) of paragraph (g) of this section. In addition, the computation of combined taxable income is necessary to determine the applicability of the section 925(d) limitation and the “no loss” rules of the regulations under sections 925 and 994.
(iv)
Effectively connected taxable income.
Nonresident alien individuals and foreign corporations engaged in trade or business within the United States, under sections 871(b)(1) and 882(a)(1), on taxable income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Such taxable income is determined in most instances by initially determining, under section 864(c), the amount of gross income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States. Pursuant to sections 873 and 882(c), this section is applicable for purposes of determining the deductions from such gross income (other than the deduction for interest expense allowed to foreign corporations (see § 1.882-5)) which are to be taken into account in determining taxable income. See example 21 of paragraph (g) of this section.
(v)
Foreign base company income.
Section 954 defines the term “foreign base company income” with respect to controlled foreign corporations. Section 954(b)(5) provides that in determining foreign base company income the gross
income shall be reduced by the deductions of the controlled foreign corporation “properly allocable to such income”. This section provides rules for identifying which deductions are properly allocable to foreign base company income.
(vi)
Other operative sections.
The rules provided in this section also apply in determining—
(A) The amount of foreign source items of tax preference under section 58(g) determined for purposes of the minimum tax;
(B) The amount of foreign mineral income under section 901(e);
(C) [Reserved]
(D) The amount of foreign oil and gas extraction income and the amount of foreign oil related income under section 907;
(E) The tax base for individuals entitled to the benefits of section 931 and the section 936 tax credit of a domestic corporation that has an election in effect under section 936;
(F) The exclusion for income from Puerto Rico for bona fide residents of Puerto Rico under section 933;
(G) The limitation under section 934 on the maximum reduction in income tax liability incurred to the Virgin Islands;
(H) The income derived from the U.S. Virgin Islands or from a section 935 possession (as defined in § 1.935-1(a)(3)(i)).
(I) The special deduction granted to China Trade Act corporations under section 941;
(J) The amount of certain U.S. source income excluded from the subpart F income of a controlled foreign corporation under section 952(b);
(K) The amount of income from the insurance of U.S. risks under section 953(b)(5);
(L) The international boycott factor and the specifically attributable taxes and income under section 999; and
(M) The taxable income attributable to the operation of an agreement vessel under section 607 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended, and the Capital Construction Fund Regulations thereunder (26 CFR, part 3). See 26 CFR 3.2(b)(3).
(N) Deduction eligible income and foreign-derived deduction eligible income under section 250(b).
(2)
Application to more than one operative section.
(i) Where more than one operative section applies, it may be necessary for the taxpayer to apply this section separately for each applicable operative section. In such a case, the taxpayer is required to use the same method of allocation and the same principles of apportionment for all operative sections.
(ii) When expenses, losses, and other deductions that have been properly allocated and apportioned between combined gross income of a related supplier and a DISC or former DISC and residual gross income, regardless of which of the administrative pricing methods of section 994 has been applied, such deductions are not also allocated and apportioned to gross income consisting of distributions from the DISC or former DISC attributable to income of the DISC or former DISC as determined under the administrative pricing methods with respect to DISC or former DISC taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. Accordingly,
Example
(22) of paragraph (g) of this section does not apply to distributions from a DISC or former DISC with respect to DISC or former DISC taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. This rule does not apply to the extent that the taxable income of the DISC or former DISC is determined under the section 994(a)(3) transfer pricing method. In addition, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, in the case of expenses, losses, and other deductions that have been properly allocated and apportioned between combined gross income of a related supplier and a FSC and residual gross income, regardless of which of the administrative pricing methods of section 925 has been applied, such deductions are not also allocated and apportioned to gross income consisting of distributions from the FSC or former FSC which are attributable to the foreign trade income of the FSC or former FSC as determined under the administrative pricing methods. This rule does not apply to the extent that the foreign trade income of the FSC or former FSC is determined under the section
925(a)(3) transfer pricing method. See
Example
(23) of paragraph (g) of this section.
(3)
Special rules of section 863(b)
—(i)
In general.
Special rules under section 863(b) provide for the application of rules of general apportionment provided in §§ 1.863-3 to 1.863-5, to worldwide taxable income in order to attribute part of such worldwide taxable income to U.S. sources and the remainder of such worldwide taxable income to foreign sources. The activities specified in section 863(b) are—
(A) Transportation or other services rendered partly within and partly without the United States,
(B) Sales of personal property produced by the taxpayer within and sold without the United States, or produced by the taxpayer without and sold within the United States, and
(C) Sales within the United States of personal property purchased within a possession of the United States.
In the instances provided in §§ 1.863-3 and 1.863-4 with respect to the activities described in (A), (B), and (C) of this subdivision, this section is applicable only in determining worldwide taxable income attributable to these activities.
(ii)
Relationship of sections 861, 862, 863(a), and 863(b).
Sections 861, 862, 863(a), and 863(b) are the four provisions applicable in determining taxable income from specific sources. Each of these four provisions applies independently. Where a deduction has been allocated and apportioned to income under one of these four provisions, the deduction shall not again be allocated and apportioned to gross income under any of the other three provisions. However, two or more of these provisions may have to be applied at the same time to determine the proper allocation and apportionment of a deduction. The special rules under section 863(b) take precedence over the general rules of Code sections 861, 862 and 863(a). For example, where a deduction is allocable in whole or in part to gross income to which section 863(b) applies, such deduction or part thereof shall not otherwise be allocated under section 861, 862, or 863(a). However, where the gross income to which the deduction is allocable includes both gross income to which section 863(b) applies and gross income to which section 861, 862, or 863(a) applies, more than one section must be applied at the same time in order to determine the proper allocation and apportionment of the deduction.
(4)
Adjustments made under other provisions of the Code
—(i)
In general.
If an adjustment which affects the taxpayer is made under section 482 or any other provision of the Code, it may be necessary to recompute the allocations and apportionments required by this section in order to reflect changes resulting from the adjustment. The recomputation made by the Commissioner shall be made using the same method of allocation and apportionment as was originally used by the taxpayer, provided such method as originally used conformed with paragraph (a)(2) of this section and, in light of the adjustment, such method does not result in a material distortion. In addition to adjustments which would be made aside from this section, adjustments to the taxpayer's income and deductions which would not otherwise be made may be required before applying this section in order to prevent a distortion in determining taxable income from a particular source of activity. For example, if an item included as a part of the cost of goods sold has been improperly attributed to specific sales, and, as a result, gross income under one of the operative sections referred to in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is improperly determined, it may be necessary for the Commissioner to make an adjustment to the cost of goods sold, consistent with the principles of this section, before applying this section. Similarly, if a domestic corporation transfers the stock in its foreign subsidiaries to a domestic subsidiary and the parent corporation continues to incur expenses in connection with protecting its capital investment in the foreign subsidiaries (
see
paragraph (e)(4) of this section), it may be necessary for the Commissioner to make an allocation under section 482 with respect to such expenses before making allocations and apportionments required by this section, even though the section 482 allocation might not otherwise be made.
(ii)
Example
—(A)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, purchases and sells consumer items in the United States and foreign markets. Its sales in foreign markets are made to related foreign subsidiaries. USP reported $1,500,000x as sales during the taxable year of which $1,000,000x was domestic sales and $500,000x was foreign sales. USP took a deduction for expenses incurred by its marketing department during the taxable year in the amount of $150,000x. These expenses were determined to be allocable to both domestic and foreign sales and are apportionable between such sales. On audit of USP's return for the taxable year, the IRS adjusted, under section 482, USP's sales to related foreign subsidiaries by increasing the sales price by a total of $100,000x, thereby increasing USP's foreign sales and total sales by the same amount. Before the audit, USP allocated and apportioned the marketing department deduction as follows:
Table 1 to Paragraph
(f)(4)(ii)(A)
To gross income from domestic sales: $150,000x × ($1,000,000x/$1,500,000x)
$100,000x
To gross income from foreign sales: $150,000x × ($500,000x/$1,500,000x)
50,000x
Total
150,000x
(B)
Analysis.
As a result of the section 482 adjustment, the apportionment of the deduction for the marketing department expenses is redetermined as follows:
Table 2 to Paragraph
(f)(4)(ii)(B)
To gross income from domestic sales: $150,000x × ($1,000,000x/$1,600,000x)
$93,750x
To gross income from foreign sales:
$150,000x × ($600,000x/$1,600,000x)
56,250x
Total
150,000x
(5)
Verification of allocations and apportionments.
Since, under this section, allocations and apportionments are made on the basis of the factual relationship between deductions and gross income, the taxpayer is required to furnish, at the request of the District Director, information from which such factual relationships can be determined. In reviewing the overall limitation to the foreign tax credit of a domestic corporation, for example, the District Director should consider information which would enable him to determine the extent to which deductions attributable to functions performed in the United States are related to earning foreign source income, United States source income, or income from both sources. In addition to functions with a specific international purpose, consideration should be given to the functions of management, the direction and results of an acquisition program, the functions of operating units and personnel located at the head office, the functions of support units (including but not limited to engineering, legal, budget, accounting, and industrial relations), the functions of selling and advertising units and personnel, the direction and uses of research and development and the direction and uses of services furnished by independent contractors. Thus, for example when requested by the District Director, the taxpayer shall make available any of its organization charts, manuals, and other writings which relate to the manner in which its gross income arises and to the functions of organizational units, employees, and assets of the taxpayer and arrange for the interview of such of its employees as the District Director deems desirable in order to determine the gross income to
which deductions relate. See section 7602 and the regulations thereunder which generally provide for the examination of books and witnesses. See also section 905(b) and the regulations thereunder which require proof of foreign tax credits to the satisfaction of the Secretary or his delegate.
(g)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of the rules in this section. In each example, unless otherwise specified, section 904 is the operative section. In addition, in each example, where a method of allocation or apportionment is illustrated as an acceptable method, it is assumed that such method is used by the taxpayers on a consistent basis from year to year. Further, it is assumed that each party named in each example operates on a calendar year accounting basis and, where the party is a U.S. taxpayer, files returns on a calendar year basis.

Example 15: Payment in settlement of claim for damages allocated to specific class of gross income
—(i)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, sells Product A in the United States. USP also owns and operates a disregarded entity (FDE) in Country X. FDE, which constitutes a foreign branch of USP within the meaning of § 1.904-4(f)(3)(vii), sells Product A inventory in Country X. FDE's functional currency is the U.S. dollar. In each of its taxable years from 2018 through 2020, USP earns $2,000x of U.S. source gross income from sales of Product A to customers in the United States. USP also sells Product A to FDE for an arm's length price and FDE sells Product A to customers in Country X. After the application of section 862(a)(6), § 1.861-7(c), and the disregarded payment rules of § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi), the sales of Product A in Country X result in $1,500x of general category foreign source gross income and $500x of foreign branch category foreign source gross income in each of 2018 and 2019 and $2,500x of general category foreign source gross income and $500x of foreign branch category foreign source gross income in 2020. FDE is sued for damages in 2019 after Product A harms a customer in Country X in 2018. In 2020, FDE makes a deductible payment of $60x to the Country X customer in settlement of the legal claims for damages.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, the deductible settlement payment is definitely related and allocable to the class of gross income of the type produced by the specific sales of property that gave rise to the damages claims, that is USP's gross income from sales of Product A in Country X. Claims that might arise from damages caused by Product A to customers in the United States are irrelevant in allocating the deduction for the settlement payments made to the customer in Country X. For purposes of determining USP's foreign tax credit limitation under section 904(d), because in 2020 that class of gross income consists of both foreign source foreign branch category income and foreign source general category income, the settlement payment of $60x is apportioned between gross income in the two categories in proportion to the relative amounts of gross income in each category in 2020, the year the deduction is allowed. Therefore, $10x ($60x × $500x/$3,000x) is apportioned to foreign source foreign branch category income, and the remaining $50x ($60x × $2,500x/$3,000x) is apportioned to foreign source general category income.
(16)
Example 16: Legal damages payment arising from event incident to production and sale
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(15) of this section (the facts in
Example 15
) except that instead of a product liability lawsuit relating to a 2018 event, in 2019 there is a disaster at a warehouse owned by USP in the United States arising from the negligence of an employee. The warehouse is used to store Product A inventory intended for sale both by USP in the United States and by FDE in Country X. In 2020, the warehouse asset is characterized under § 1.861-9T(g)(3)(ii) as a multiple category asset that is assigned 10% to the foreign source foreign branch category, 50% to the foreign source general category, and 40% to the residual grouping of U.S. source income. The inventory of Product A in the warehouse is destroyed and USP employees as well as residents in the vicinity of the warehouse are injured. USP's reputation in the United States suffers such that
USP expects to subsequently lose market share in the United States. In 2020, USP makes deductible damages payments totaling $50x to injured employees and the nearby residents, all of whom are in the United States.
(ii)
Analysis.
USP's warehouse in the United States is used in connection with sales of Product A to customers in both the United States and Country X. Thus, under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, the $50x damages payment arises from an event incident to the sales of Product A and is therefore definitely related and allocable to the class of gross income ordinarily produced by the asset (the warehouse) that is involved in the event—that is, the gross income from sales of Product A by USP in the United States and by FDE in Country X. Under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, the $50x deduction for the damages payment is apportioned for purposes of applying section 904(d) on the basis of the relative value in each grouping (as determined under § 1.861-9(g) for purposes of allocating and apportioning USP's interest expense) of USP's warehouse, the asset involved in the event, in 2020, the year the deduction is allowed. USP's warehouse is a multiple category asset as described in § 1.861-9T(g)(3)(ii) and 10% of the value of USP's warehouse is properly characterized as an asset generating foreign source foreign branch category in 2020. Accordingly, $5x (10% × $50x) of the deduction is apportioned to foreign source foreign branch category income. Additionally, 50% of the value of USP's warehouse is properly characterized as an asset generating foreign source general category income in 2020 and, accordingly, $25x (50% × $50x) is apportioned to such grouping. The remaining $20x (40% × $50x) is apportioned to U.S. source income.
(17)
Example 17: Payment following a change in law
—(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (g)(16) of this section (the facts in
Example 16
), except that the disaster at USP's warehouse occurred not in 2019 but in 2016 and thus before the enactment of the section 904(d) separate category for foreign branch category income. The deductible damages payments are made in 2020.
(ii)
Analysis.
USP's U.S. warehouse was used in connection with making sales of Product A in both the United States and Country X. Under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, the 2020 damages payment arises from an event incident to the sales of Product A and is therefore definitely related and allocable to the class of gross income ordinarily produced by the asset (the warehouse) that is involved in the event, that is the gross income from sales of Product A by USP in the United States and by FDE in Country X. Under the law in effect in 2016, the income earned from the Product A sales in Country X was solely general category income. Under paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, the damages payment is definitely related and allocable to the class of gross income consisting of sales of Product A by USP in the United States and by FDE in Country X, and apportioned to the statutory and residual groupings based on the relative value in each grouping (as determined under § 1.861-9(g) for purposes of allocating and apportioning USP's interest expense) of USP's warehouse, the asset involved in the event, in 2020, the year in which the deduction is allowed. Accordingly, for purposes of determining USP's foreign tax credit limitation under section 904(d), the 2020 deductible damages payment of $50x is allocated and apportioned in the same manner as in paragraph (g)(16)(ii) of this section (the analysis in
Example 16
).
(18)
Example 18: Stewardship and supportive expenses
—(i)
Facts
—(A)
Overview.
USP, a domestic corporation, manufactures and sells Product A in the United States. USP directly owns 100% of the stock of USSub, a domestic corporation, and each of CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3, which are all controlled foreign corporations. USP and USSub file separate returns for U.S. Federal income tax purposes but are members of the same affiliated group as defined in section 243(b)(2). USSub, CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3 perform similar functions in the United States and in the foreign countries T, U, and V, respectively. USP's tax book value in the stock of USSub is $15,000x. USP's tax book value in the stock of each of CFC1,
CFC2, and CFC3 is, respectively, $5,000x, $10,000x, and $15,000x.
(B)
USP Department expenses.
USP's supervision department (the Department) incurs expenses of $1,500x. The Department is responsible for the supervision of its four subsidiaries and for rendering certain services to the subsidiaries, and the Department provides all the supportive functions necessary for USP's foreign activities. The Department performs three types of activities. First, the Department performs services that cost $900x outside the United States for the direct benefit of CFC2 for which a marked-up fee is paid by CFC2 to USP. Second, the Department provides services at a cost of $60x related to license agreements that USP maintains with subsidiaries CFC1 and CFC2 and which give rise to foreign source general category income to USP. Third, the Department performs activities described in § 1.482-9(l)(3)(iii) that are in the nature of shareholder oversight, that duplicate functions performed by all four of the subsidiaries' own employees, and that do not provide an additional benefit to the subsidiaries. For example, a team of auditors from USP's accounting department periodically audits the subsidiaries' books and prepares internal reports for use by USP's management. Similarly, USP's treasurer periodically reviews the subsidiaries' financial policies for the board of directors of USP. These activities do not provide an additional benefit to the related corporations. The Department's oversight activities are related to all the subsidiaries. The cost of the duplicative activities is $540x.
(C)
USP's income.
USP earns the following items of income: First, under section 951(a), USP has $2,000x of subpart F income that is passive category income. Second, USP has a GILTI inclusion amount of $2,000x. Third, USP earns $1,000x of royalties, paid by CFC1 and CFC2, that are foreign source general category income. Finally, USP receives a fee of $1,000x from CFC2 that is foreign source general category income.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Character of USP Department services.
The first and second activities (the services rendered for the benefit of CFC2, and the provision of services related to license agreements with CFC1 and CFC2) are not properly characterized as stewardship expenses because they are not incurred solely to protect the corporation's capital investment in the related corporation or to facilitate compliance by the corporation with reporting, legal, or regulatory requirements applicable specifically to the corporation. The third activity described is in the nature of shareholder oversight and is characterized as stewardship as described in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section because the expense is related to duplicative activities.
(B)
Allocation.
First, the deduction of $900x for expenses related to services rendered for the benefit of CFC2 is definitely related (and therefore allocable) to the fees for services that USP receives from CFC2. Second, the $60x of deductions attributable to USP's license agreements with CFC1 and CFC2 are definitely related (and therefore allocable) solely to royalties received from CFC1 and CFC2. Third, based on the relevant facts and circumstances and the Department's oversight activities, the stewardship deduction of $540x is related to the oversight of all of USP's subsidiaries and therefore is definitely related (and therefore allocable) to dividends and inclusions received or included from all the subsidiaries.
(C)
Apportionment.
(
1
) No apportionment of USP's deduction of $900x for expenses related to the services performed for CFC2 is necessary because the class of gross income to which the deduction is allocated consists entirely of a single statutory grouping, foreign source general category income.
(
2
) No apportionment of USP's deduction of $60x attributable to the services related to license agreements is necessary because the class of gross income to which the deduction is allocated consists entirely of a single statutory grouping, foreign source general category income.
(
3
) For purposes of apportioning USP's $540x stewardship expenses in determining the foreign tax credit limitation, the statutory groupings are foreign source general category income, foreign source passive category income, and foreign source section 951A
category income. The residual grouping is U.S. source income.
(
4
) USP's deduction of $540x for the Department's stewardship expenses which are allocable to dividends and amounts included from the subsidiaries are apportioned using the same value of USP's stock in USSub, CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3 that is used for purposes of allocating and apportioning USP's interest expense. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section and § 1.861-14(e)(1)(i), the value of USP's stock in USSub is included for purposes of apportioning USP's stewardship expense. The value of USSub's stock is $15,000x, and USSub only owns assets that generate income in the residual grouping of gross income from U.S. sources. Therefore, for purposes of apportioning USP's stewardship expense, all of the $15,000x value of the USSub stock is characterized as an asset generating U.S. source income. Although USSub stock would be eliminated from consideration as an asset under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, for purposes of apportioning USP's stewardship expense section 864(e)(3) and paragraph (d)(2) of this section do not apply. USP uses the asset method described in § 1.861-12T(c)(3)(ii) to characterize the stock in its CFCs. After application of § 1.861-13(a), USP determines that with respect to its three CFCs in the aggregate it has $15,000x of section 951A category stock in the non-section 245A subgroup, $6,000x of general category stock in the section 245A subgroup, and $9,000x of passive category stock in the non-section 245A subgroup. Although under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section $7,500x of the stock that is section 951A category stock is an exempt asset, for purposes of apportioning USP's stewardship expense section 864(e)(3) and paragraph (d)(2) of this section do not apply. Finally, even though USP may be allowed a section 245A deduction with respect to dividends from the CFCs, no portion of the value of the stock of the CFCs is eliminated, because the section 245A deduction does not create exempt income or result in the stock being treated as an exempt asset. See section 864(e)(3) and paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(C) of this section.
(
5
) Taking into account the characterization of USP's stock in USSub, CFC1, CFC2, and CFC3 with a total value of $45,000x ($15,000x + $6,000x + $9,000x + $15,000x), the $540x of Department expenses is apportioned as follows: $180x ($540x × $15,000x/$45,000x) to section 951A category income, $72x ($540x × $6,000x/$45,000x) to general category income, $108x ($540x × $9,000x/$45,000x) to passive category income, and $180x ($540x × $15,000x/$45,000x) to the residual grouping of U.S. source income. Section 904(b)(4)(B)(i) and § 1.904(b)-3 apply to $72x of the stewardship expense apportioned to the CFCs' stock that is characterized as being in the section 245A subgroup in the general category.

Facts
—(A) USP, a domestic corporation, purchases and sells products both in the United States and in foreign countries. USP has no foreign subsidiary and no international department. During the taxable year, USP incurs the following expenses with respect to its worldwide activities:

(B) USP has domestic gross receipts from sales of $750,000x and foreign gross receipts from sales of $500,000x and has gross income from such sales in the
same ratio, namely $300,000x from domestic sources and $200,000x from foreign sources that is general category income.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Allocation.
The above expenses are definitely related and allocable to all of USP's gross income derived from both domestic and foreign markets.
(B)
Apportionment.
For purposes of applying the foreign tax credit limitation, the statutory grouping is gross income from sources outside the United States in general category income and the residual grouping is gross income from sources within the United States. USP's deductions for its worldwide sales activities must be apportioned between these groupings. USP does not have a separate international division which performs essentially all of the functions required to manage and oversee its foreign activities. The president and sales manager do not maintain time records. The division of their time between domestic and foreign activities varies from day to day and cannot be estimated on an annual basis with any reasonable degree of accuracy. Similarly, there are no facts which would justify a method of apportionment of their salaries or of one of the other listed deductions based on more specific factors than gross receipts or gross income. An acceptable method of apportionment would be on the basis of gross receipts. The apportionment of the $200,000x deduction is as follows:
Table 4 to Paragraph
(g)(19)(ii)(B)
Apportionment of the $200,000x expense to the statutory grouping of gross income: $200,000x × [$500,000x/($500,000x + $750,000x)]

(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Allocation.
The expenses incurred by USP with respect to its worldwide activities are definitely related, and therefore allocable to USP's gross income from both its foreign and domestic markets.
(B)
Apportionment.
On the basis of the additional facts it is not acceptable to apportion the salaries of the president and the sales manager on the basis of gross receipts. It is acceptable to apportion such salaries between the statutory grouping (gross income from sources without the United States) and residual grouping (gross income from sources within the United States) on the basis of time devoted to each sales activity. Remaining expenses may still be apportioned on the basis of gross receipts. The apportionment is as follows:
Table 5 to Paragraph

—(i)
Facts.
FC, a foreign corporation doing business in the United States, is a manufacturer of metal stamping machines. FC has no U.S. subsidiaries and no separate division to manage and oversee its business in the United States. FC manufactures and sells these machines in the United States and in foreign countries A and B and has a separate manufacturing facility in each country. Sales of these machines are FC's only source of income. In Year 1, FC incurs general and administrative expenses related to both its U.S. and foreign operations of $100,000x. It has machine sales of $500,000x, $1,000,000x, and $1,000,000x on which it earns gross income of $200,000x, $400,000x, and $400,000x in the United States, Country A, and Country B, respectively. The income from the manufacture and sale of the machines in countries A and B is not effectively connected with FC's business in the United States.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Allocation.
The $100,000x of general and administrative expense is definitely related to the income to which it gives rise, namely a part of the gross income from sales of machines in the United States, in Country A, and in Country B. The expenses are allocable to this class of income, even though FC's gross income from sources outside the United States is excluded income since it is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.
(B)
Apportionment.
Since FC is a foreign corporation, the statutory grouping is gross income effectively connected with FC's trade of business in the United States, namely gross income from sources within the United States, and the residual grouping is gross income not effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States, namely gross income from countries A and B. Since there are no facts that would require a method of apportionment other than on the basis of sales or gross income, the amount may be apportioned between the two groupings on the basis of amounts of gross income as follows:
Table 6 to Paragraph
(g)(21)(ii)(B)
Apportionment of general and administrative expense to the statutory grouping, gross income from sources within the United States: $100,000x × [$200,000x/($200,000x + $400,000x + $400,000x)]

Example 25: Income taxes
—(i)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, is a manufacturer and distributor of electronic equipment with operations in states A, B, and C. USP also has a foreign branch, as defined in section 904(d)(1)(B) and § 1.904-4(f), in Country
Y which manufactures and distributes the same type of electronic equipment. In Year 1, USP has taxable income from these activities, as described under the Code (without taking into account the deduction for state income taxes), of $1,000,000x, of which $200,000x is foreign source foreign branch category income and $800,000x is domestic source income. States A, B, and C each determine USP's income subject to tax within their state by making adjustments to USP's taxable income as determined under the Code, and then apportioning the adjusted taxable income on the basis of the relative amounts of USP's payroll, property, and sales within each state as compared to USP's worldwide payroll, property, and sales. The adjustments made by states A, B, and C all involve adding and subtracting enumerated items from taxable income as determined under the Code. However, in making these adjustments to taxable income, none of the states specifically exempts foreign source income as determined under the Code. On this basis, it is determined that USP has taxable income of $550,000x, $200,000x, and $200,000x in states A, B, and C, respectively. The corporate tax rates in states A, B, and C are 10%, 5%, and 2%, respectively, and USP has total state income tax liabilities of $69,000x ($55,000x + $10,000x + $4,000x), which it deducts as an expense for Federal income tax purposes.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Allocation.
USP's deduction of $69,000x for state income taxes is definitely related and thus allocable to the gross income with respect to which the taxes are imposed. Since the statutes of states A, B, and C do not specifically exempt foreign source income (as determined under the Code) from taxation and since, in the aggregate, states A, B, and C tax $950,000x of USP's income while only $800,000x is domestic source income under the Code, it is presumed that state income taxes are imposed on $150,000x of foreign source income. The deduction for state income taxes is therefore related and allocable to both USP's foreign source and domestic source income.
(B)
Apportionment.
For purposes of computing the foreign tax credit limitation, USP's income is comprised of one statutory grouping, foreign source foreign branch category gross income, and one residual grouping, gross income from sources within the United States. The state income tax deduction of $69,000x must be apportioned between these two groupings. Corporation USP calculates the apportionment on the basis of the relative amounts of foreign source foreign branch category taxable income and U.S. source taxable income subject to state taxation. In this case, state income taxes are presumed to be imposed on $800,000x of domestic source income and $150,000x of foreign source general category income.

Assume the same facts as in paragraph (g)(25)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 25
), except that the language of state A's statute and the statute's operation exempt from taxation all foreign source income, as determined under the Code, so that foreign source income is not included in adjusted taxable income subject to apportionment in state A (and factors relating to USP's Country Y branch are not taken into account in computing the state A apportionment fraction).
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Allocation.
USP's deduction of $69,000x for state income
taxes is definitely related and thus allocable to the gross income with respect to which the taxes are imposed. Since state A exempts all foreign source income by statute, state A is presumed to impose tax on $550,000x of USP's $800,000x of domestic source income. USP's state A tax of $55,000x is allocable, therefore, solely to domestic source income. Since the statutes of states B and C do not specifically exclude all foreign source income as determined under the Code, and since states B and C impose tax on $400,000x ($200,000x + $200,000x) of USP's income of which only $250,000x ($800,000x−$550,000x) is presumed to be domestic source, the deduction for the $14,000x of income taxes imposed by states B and C is related and allocable to both foreign source and domestic source income.
(B)

(

) For purposes of computing the foreign tax credit limitation, USP's income is comprised of one statutory grouping, foreign source foreign branch category gross income, and one residual grouping, gross income from sources within the United States.

(27)
Example 27: Income tax
—(i)
Facts.
Assume the same facts as in paragraph (g)(25)(i) of this section (the facts in
Example 25
), except that state A, in which USP has significant income-producing activities, does not impose a corporate income tax or other state tax computed on the basis of income derived from business activities conducted in state A. USP therefore has a total state income tax liability in Year 1 of $14,000x ($10,000x paid to state B plus $4,000x paid to state C), all of which is subject to allocation and apportionment under paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii)
Analysis
—(A)
Allocation.
(
1
) USP's deduction of $14,000x for state income taxes is definitely related and allocable to the gross income with respect to which the taxes are imposed. However, in these facts, an adjustment is necessary before the aggregate state taxable incomes can be compared with U.S. source income on the Federal income tax return in the manner described in paragraphs (g)(25)(ii) and (g)(26)(ii) of this section (the analysis in
Examples 25
and
26
). Unlike the facts in paragraphs (g)(25)(i) and (g)(26)(i) of this section (the facts in
Examples 25
and
26
), state A imposes no income tax and does not define taxable income attributable to activities in state A. The total amount of USP's income subject to state taxation is, therefore, $400,000x ($200,000x in state B and $200,000x in state C). This total presumptively does not include any income attributable to activities performed in state A and therefore cannot properly be compared to total U.S. source taxable income reported by USP for Federal income tax
purposes, which does include income attributable to state A activities.
(
2
)(
i
) Accordingly, before applying the method used in paragraphs (g)(25)(ii) and (g)(26)(ii) of this section (the analysis in
Examples 25
and
26
) to the facts of the example in this paragraph (g)(27), it is necessary first to estimate the amount of taxable income that state A could reasonably attribute to USP's activities in state A, and then to reduce federal taxable income by that amount.
(
ii
) Any reasonable method may be used to attribute taxable income to USP's activities in state A. For example, the rules of the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (“UDITPA”) attribute income to a state on the basis of the average of three ratios that are based upon the taxpayer's facts—property within the state over total property, payroll within the state over total payroll, and sales within the state over total sales—and, with adjustments, provide a reasonable method for this purpose. When applying the rules of UDITPA to estimate U.S. source income derived from state A activities, the taxpayer's UDITPA factors must be adjusted to eliminate both taxable income and factors attributable to a foreign branch. Therefore, in the example in this paragraph (g)(27) all taxable income as well as UDITPA apportionment factors (property, payroll, and sales) attributable to USP's Country Y branch must be eliminated.
(
3
)(
i
) Since it is presumed that, if state A had had an income tax, state A would not attempt to tax the income derived by USP's Country Y branch, any reasonable estimate of the income that would be taxed by state A must exclude any foreign source income.
(
ii
) When using the rules of UDITPA to estimate the income that would have been taxable by state A in these facts, foreign source income is excluded by starting with federally defined taxable income (before deduction for state income taxes) and subtracting any income derived by USP's Country Y branch. The hypothetical state A taxable income is then determined by multiplying the resulting difference by the average of USP's state A property, payroll, and sales ratios, determined using the principles of UDITPA (after adjustment by eliminating the Country Y branch factors). The resulting product is presumed to be exclusively U.S. source income, and the allocation and apportionment method described in paragraph (g)(26) of this section (
Example 26
) must then be applied.
(
iii
) If, for example, state A taxable income were determined to equal $550,000x, then $550,000x of U.S. source income for Federal income tax purposes would be presumed to constitute state A taxable income. Under paragraph (g)(26) of this section (
Example 26
), the remaining $250,000x ($800,000x−$550,000x) of U.S. source income for Federal income tax purposes would be presumed to be subject to tax in states B and C. Since states B and C impose tax on $400,000x, the application of Example 25 would result in a presumption that $150,000x is foreign source income and $250,000x is domestic source income. The deduction for the $14,000x of income taxes of states B and C would therefore be related and allocable to both foreign source and domestic source income and would be subject to apportionment.
(B)
Apportionment.
The deduction of $14,000x for income taxes of states B and C is apportioned in the same manner as in paragraph (g)(26) of this section (
Example 26
). As a result, $5,250x of the $14,000x of state B and state C income taxes is apportioned to foreign source foreign branch category income ($14,000x × $150,000x/$400,000x), and $8,750x ($14,000x × $250,000x/$400,000x) of the $14,000x of state B and state C income taxes is apportioned to U.S. source income.

Apportionment of deductions
—(1)
Deductions definitely related to a class of gross income.
Where a deduction has been allocated in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section to a class of gross income which is included in one statutory grouping and the residual grouping, the deduction must be apportioned between the statutory grouping and the residual grouping. Where a deduction has been allocated to a class of gross income which is included in more than one statutory grouping, such deduction must be apportioned among the statutory groupings and, where necessary, the residual grouping. Thus, in determining the separate limitations on the foreign tax credit imposed by section 904(d)(1) or by section 907, the income within a separate limitation category constitutes a statutory grouping of income and all other income not within that separate limitation category (whether domestic or within a different separate limitation category) constitutes the residual grouping. In this regard, the same method of apportionment must be used in apportioning a deduction to each separate limitation category. Also, see paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section with respect to the apportionment of deductions among the statutory groupings designated in section 904(d)(1). If the class of gross income to which a deduction has been allocated consists entirely of a single statutory grouping or the residual grouping, there is no need to apportion that deduction. If a deduction is not definitely related to any gross income, it must be apportioned ratably as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. A deduction is apportioned by attributing the deduction to gross income (within the class to which the deduction has been allocated) which is in one or more statutory groupings and to gross income (within the class) which is in the residual grouping. Such attribution must be accomplished in a manner which reflects to a reasonably close extent the factual relationship between the deduction and the grouping of gross income. In apportioning deductions, it may be that for the taxable year there is no gross income in the statutory grouping or that deductions will exceed the amount of gross income in the statutory grouping. See paragraph (d)(1) of this section with respect to cases in which deductions exceed gross income. In determining the method of apportionment for a specific deduction, examples of bases and factors which should be considered include, but are not limited to—
(i) Comparison of units sold,
(ii) Comparison of the amount of gross sales or receipts,
(iii) Comparison of costs of goods sold,
(iv) Comparison of profit contribution,
(v) Comparison of expenses incurred, assets used, salaries paid, space utilized, and time spent which are attributable to the activities or properties giving rise to the class of gross income, and
(iv) Comparison of the amount of gross income.
Paragraph (e) (2) through (8) of this section provides the applicable rules for allocation and apportionment of deductions for interest, research and development expenses, and certain other deductions. The effects on tax liability of the apportionment of deductions and the burden of maintaining records not otherwise maintained and making computations not otherwise made shall be taken into consideration in determining whether a method of apportionment and its application are sufficiently precise. A method of apportionment described in this paragraph (c)(1) may not be used when it does not reflect, to a reasonably close extent, the factual relationship between the deduction and the groupings of income. Furthermore, certain methods of apportionment described in this paragraph (c)(1) may not be used in connection with any deduction for which another method is prescribed. The principles set forth above are applicable in apportioning both deductions definitely related to a class which constitutes less than all of the taxpayer's gross income and to deductions related to all of the taxpayer's gross income. If a deduction is not related to any class of gross income, it must be apportioned ratably as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

If a taxpayer is subject to section 163(j), the taxpayer's deduction for business interest expense is limited to the sum of the taxpayer's business interest income, 30 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted taxable income for the taxable year, and the taxpayer's floor plan financing interest expense. In the taxable year that any deduction is permitted for business interest expense with respect to a disallowed business interest carryforward, that business interest expense is apportioned for purposes of this section under rules set forth in paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section (as applicable) as though it were incurred in the taxable year in which the expense is deducted.

—(1)
In general—aggregate rule.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-9T(e)(1).
(2)
Corporate partners whose interest in the partnership is 10 percent or more.
A corporate partner shall apportion its interest expense, including the partner's distributive share of partnership interest expense, by reference to the partner's assets, including the partner's pro rata share of partnership assets, under the rules of paragraph (f) of this section if the corporate partner's direct and indirect interest in the partnership (as determined under the attribution rules of section 318) is 10 percent or more. A corporation using the tax book value method or alternative tax
book value method of apportionment shall use the partnership's inside basis in its assets, including adjustments under sections 734(b) and 743(b), if any, and adjusted to the extent required under § 1.861-10T(d)(2).
(3)
Individual partners who are general partners or who are limited partners with an interest in the partnership of 10 percent or more.
An individual partner is subject to the rules of this paragraph (e)(3) if either the individual is a general partner or the individual's direct and indirect interest (as determined under the attribution rules of section 318) in the partnership is 10 percent or more. The individual shall first classify his or her distributive share of partnership interest expense as interest incurred in the active conduct of a trade or business, as passive activity interest, or as investment interest under regulations issued under sections 163 and 469. The individual must then apportion his or her interest expense, including the partner's distributive share of partnership interest expense, under the rules of paragraph (d) of this section. Each such individual partner shall take into account his or her distributive share of the partnership gross income or pro rata share of the partnership assets in applying such rules. An individual using the tax book value or alternative tax book value method of apportionment shall use the partnership's inside basis in its assets, including adjustments under sections 734(b) and 743(b), if any, and adjusted to the extent required under § 1.861-10T(d)(2).
(4)
Entity rule for less than 10 percent limited partners
—(i)
Partnership interest expense.
A limited partner (whether individual or corporate), whose ownership, together with ownership by persons that bear a relationship to the partner described in section 267(b) or section 707, of the capital and profits interests of the partnership is less than 10 percent directly allocates its distributive share of partnership interest expense to its distributive share of partnership gross income. Under § 1.904-4(n)(1)(ii), such a partner's distributive share of foreign source income of the partnership is treated as passive income (subject to the high-taxed income exception of section 904(d)(2)(B)(iii)(II)), except in the case of income from a partnership interest held in the ordinary course of the partner's active trade or business, as defined in § 1.904-4(n)(1)(ii)(B). A partner's distributive share of partnership interest expense (other than partnership interest expense that is directly allocated to identified property under § 1.861-10T) is apportioned in accordance with the partner's relative distributive share of gross foreign source income in each separate category and of gross domestic source income from the partnership. To the extent that partnership interest expense is directly allocated under § 1.861-10T, a comparable portion of the income to which such interest expense is allocated is disregarded in determining the partner's relative distributive share of gross foreign source income in each separate category and domestic source income. The partner's distributive share of the interest expense of the partnership that is directly allocable under § 1.861-10T is allocated according to the treatment, after application of § 1.904-4(n)(1), of the partner's distributive share of the income to which the expense is allocated.
(ii)
Other interest expense of the partner.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-9T(e)(4)(ii).

Special rule for downstream partnership loans
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of apportioning interest expense that is not directly allocable under paragraph (e)(4) of this section or § 1.861-10T, the disregarded portion of a downstream partnership loan is not considered an asset of a downstream partnership loan lender (DPL lender). The disregarded portion of a downstream partnership loan is the portion of the value of the loan (as determined under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section) that bears the same proportion to the total value of the loan as the matching income amount that is included by the DPL lender for a taxable year with respect to the loan bears to the total amount of downstream partnership loan interest income (DPL interest income) that is included directly or indirectly in gross income by the DPL lender with
respect to the loan during that taxable year.
(ii)
Treatment of interest expense and interest income attributable to a downstream partnership loan.
If a DPL lender (or any other person in the same affiliated group as the DPL lender) takes into account a distributive share of downstream partnership loan interest expense (DPL interest expense), the DPL lender must assign an amount of DPL interest income corresponding to the matching income amount for the taxable year that is attributable to the same loan to the same statutory and residual groupings as the statutory and residual groupings of gross income from which the DPL interest expense is deducted (or would be deducted, without regard to any limitations on the deductibility of interest, such as section 163(j)) by the DPL lender (or any other person in the same affiliated group as the DPL lender).
(iii)
Anti-avoidance rule for third party back-to-back loans.
If, with a principal purpose of avoiding the rules in this paragraph (e)(8), a person makes a loan to a person that is not related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707) to the lender, the unrelated person makes a loan to a partnership, and the first loan would constitute a downstream partnership loan if made directly to the partnership, then the rules of this paragraph (e)(8) apply as if the first loan was made directly to the partnership and the interest expense paid by the partnership is treated as made with respect to the first loan. Such a series of loans will be subject to this recharacterization rule without regard to whether there was a principal purpose of avoiding the rules in this paragraph (e)(8) if the loan to the unrelated person would not have been made or maintained on substantially the same terms but for the loan of funds by the unrelated person to the partnership. The principles of this paragraph (e)(8)(iii) also apply to similar transactions that involve more than two loans and regardless of the order in which the loans are made.
(iv)
Anti-avoidance rule for loans held by CFCs.
A loan receivable held by a controlled foreign corporation with respect to a loan to a partnership in which a United States shareholder (as defined in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(vi)) of the controlled foreign corporation owns an interest, directly or indirectly through one or more other partnerships or other pass-through entities (as defined in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(iv)), is recharacterized as a loan receivable held directly by the United States shareholder with respect to the loan to such partnership for purposes of this paragraph (e)(8) if the loan was made or transferred with a principal purpose of avoiding the rules in this paragraph (e)(8). An appropriate amount of income derived by the United States shareholder (or any other person in the same affiliated group as the United States shareholder) from the controlled foreign corporation is treated as DPL interest income. Appropriate adjustments must be made to the value and characterization of the stock of the controlled foreign corporation under §§ 1.861-9 and 1.861-12 in order to reflect the portion of the downstream partnership loan held by the controlled foreign corporation that is disregarded under paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section.
(v)
Interest equivalents.
The principles of this paragraph (e)(8) apply in the case of a partner, or any person in the same affiliated group as the partner, that takes into account a distributive share of an expense or loss (to the extent deductible) that is allocated and apportioned in the same manner as interest expense under §§ 1.861-9(b) and 1.861-9T(b) and has a matching income amount (treating such interest equivalent as interest income or expense for purposes of paragraph (e)(8)(vi)(B) of this section) with respect to the transaction that gives rise to that expense or loss.
(vi)
Definitions.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(8), the following definitions apply.
(A)
Affiliated group.
The term
affiliated group
has the meaning provided in § 1.861-11(d)(1).
(B)
Matching income amount.
The term
matching income amount
means the lesser of the total amount of the DPL interest income included directly or indirectly in gross income by the DPL lender for the taxable year with respect to a downstream partnership
loan or the total amount of the distributive shares of the DPL interest expense of the DPL lender (or any other person in the same affiliated group as the DPL lender) with respect to the loan.
(C)
Downstream partnership loan.
The term
downstream partnership loan
means a loan to a partnership for which the loan receivable is held, directly or indirectly through one or more other partnerships or other pass-through entities (as defined in § 1.904-5(a)(4)), by a person (or any person in the same affiliated group as such person) that owns an interest, directly or indirectly through one or more other partnerships or other pass-through entities, in the partnership.
(D)
Downstream partnership loan interest expense (DPL interest expense).
The term
downstream partnership loan interest expense,
or
DPL interest expense,
means an item of interest expense paid or accrued with respect to a downstream partnership loan, without regard to whether the expense was currently deductible (for example, by reason of section 163(j) or the election to waive deductions pursuant to § 1.59A-3(c)(6)).
(E)
Downstream partnership loan interest income (DPL interest income).
The term
downstream partnership loan interest income,
or
DPL interest income,
means an item of gross interest income received or accrued with respect to a downstream partnership loan.
(F)

Facts.
US1, a domestic corporation, directly owns 60% of PRS, a foreign partnership that is not engaged in a U.S. trade or business. The remaining 40% of PRS is directly owned by US2, a domestic corporation that is unrelated to US1. US1, US2, and PRS all use the calendar year as their taxable year. In Year 1, US1 loans $1,000x to PRS. For Year 1, US1 has $100x of interest income with respect to the loan and PRS has $100x of interest expense with respect to the loan. US1's distributive share of the interest expense is $60x. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, $45x of US1's distributive share of the interest expense is apportioned to U.S. source income and $15x is apportioned to foreign source foreign branch category income. Under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, the total value of the loan between US1 and PRS is $1,000x.

Analysis.
The loan by US1 to PRS is a downstream partnership loan and US1 is a DPL lender. Under paragraph (e)(8)(vi)(B) of this section, the matching income amount is $60x, the lesser of the DPL interest income included by US1 with respect to the loan for the taxable year ($100x) and US1's distributive share of the DPL interest expense ($60x). Under paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section, US1 assigns $45x of the DPL interest income to U.S. source income and $15x of the DPL interest income to foreign source foreign branch category income. The source and separate category of the remaining $40x of US1's DPL interest income is determined under the generally applicable rules. Under paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section, the disregarded portion of the downstream partnership loan is $600x ($1,000x × $60x/$100x).

Analysis.
The loan by US1 to PRS is a downstream partnership loan and US1 is a DPL lender. Under paragraph (e)(8)(vi)(B) of this section, the matching income amount is $100x, the lesser of the DPL interest income included by US1 with respect to the loan for the taxable year ($100x) and the total amount of US1 and US2's distributive
shares of the DPL interest expense ($100x). Under paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section, US1 assigns $75x of the DPL interest income to U.S. source income and $25x of the DPL interest income to foreign source foreign branch category income. Under paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section, the disregarded portion of the downstream partnership loan is $1,000x ($1,000x × $100x/$100x).

Facts.
US1, a domestic corporation, owns 80% of PRS, a foreign partnership that is not engaged in a U.S. trade or business. The remaining 20% of PRS is owned by US2, a domestic corporation that is unrelated to US1. US1, US2, and PRS all use the calendar year as their taxable year. In Year 1, US1 loans $3,000x to Bank and Bank loans $3,000x to PRS. US1 makes the loan to Bank with a principal purpose of avoiding the rules in this paragraph (e)(8). For Year 1, US1 has $150x of interest income with respect to the loan to Bank and PRS has $175x of interest expense with respect to the loan from Bank. US1's distributive share of the interest expense is $140x. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, $126x of US1's distributive share of the interest expense is apportioned to U.S. source income and $14x is apportioned to foreign source foreign branch category income. Under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, the total value of the loan between US1 and PRS is $3,000x.
(

)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (e)(8)(iii) of this section, because the loan from US1 to Bank is made with a principal purpose of avoiding the rules of this paragraph (e)(8), the rules of this paragraph (e)(8) apply as if the loan by US1 to Bank was made directly to PRS. Accordingly, the loan by US1 to Bank is a downstream partnership loan and US1 is a DPL lender. Under paragraph (e)(8)(vi)(B) of this section, the matching income amount is $140x, the lesser of the DPL interest income included by US1 with respect to the loan for the taxable year ($150x) and US1's distributive share of the DPL interest expense ($140x). Under paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section, US1 assigns $126x of the DPL interest income to U.S. source income and $14x of the DPL interest income to foreign source foreign branch category income. The source and separate category of the remaining $10x of US1's DPL interest income is determined under the generally applicable rules. Under paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section, the disregarded portion of the downstream partnership loan is $2,800x ($3,000x × $140x/$150x).

Facts.
US1, a domestic corporation, directly owns all of the outstanding stock of CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, and 90% of PRS, a foreign partnership that is not engaged in a U.S. trade or business. The remaining 10% of PRS is owned by US2, a domestic corporation that is unrelated to US1 and CFC. US1, US2, and PRS all use the calendar year as their taxable year. In Year 1, US1 loans $900x to CFC and CFC loans $900x to PRS. CFC makes the loan with a principal purpose of avoiding the rules in this paragraph (e)(8). For Year 1, CFC has $90x of interest income and $90x of interest expense with respect to the loan to PRS, and US1 has $90x of interest income with respect to the loan to CFC. PRS has $90x of interest expense with respect to the loan, and US1's distributive share of the interest expense is $81x. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, $54x of US1's distributive share of the interest expense is apportioned to U.S. source income and $27x is apportioned to foreign source foreign branch category income. Under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, the total value of the loan between CFC and PRS is $900x.
(
2
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (e)(8)(iv) of this section, because the loan from CFC to PRS is made with a principal purpose of avoiding the rules of this paragraph (e)(8), the loan from CFC to PRS is recharacterized as a loan receivable held directly by US1, and an appropriate amount of income derived by US1, in this case, the $90x of interest income from the loan to CFC, is treated as DPL interest income. Accordingly, the loan from CFC to PRS is a downstream partnership loan and US1 is a DPL lender. Under paragraph (e)(8)(vi)(B) of this section, the matching income amount is $81x, the lesser of the DPL interest income included by US1 ($90x) and US1's distributive share of the DPL interest expense ($81x).
Under paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section, US1 assigns $54x of the DPL interest income to U.S. source income and $27x of the DPL interest income to foreign source foreign branch category income. The source and separate category of the remaining $9x of US1's interest income is determined under the generally applicable rules. Under paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section, the disregarded portion of the downstream partnership loan is $810x ($900x x $81x/$90x). Appropriate adjustments are made to the value and characterization of the stock of CFC under §§ 1.861-9 and 1.861-12 in order to reflect the $810x disregarded portion of the downstream partnership loan.
(9)
Special rule for upstream partnership loans
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of apportioning interest expense that is not directly allocable under paragraph (e)(4) of this section or § 1.861-10T, an upstream partnership loan debtor's (UPL debtor) pro rata share of the value of the upstream partnership loan (as determined under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section) is not considered an asset of the UPL debtor taken into account as described in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section.
(ii)
Treatment of interest expense and interest income attributable to an upstream partnership loan.
If a UPL debtor (or any other person in the same affiliated group as the UPL debtor) takes into account a distributive share of upstream partnership loan interest income (UPL interest income), the UPL debtor (or any other person in the same affiliated group as the UPL debtor) assigns an amount of its distributive share of the UPL interest income equal to the matching expense amount for the taxable year that is attributable to the same loan to the same statutory and residual groupings using the same ratios as the statutory and residual groupings of gross income from which the upstream partnership loan interest expense (UPL interest expense) is deducted by the UPL debtor (or any other person in the same affiliated group as the UPL debtor). Therefore, the amount of the distributive share of UPL interest income that is assigned to each statutory and residual grouping is the amount that bears the same proportion to the matching expense amount as the UPL interest expense in that statutory or residual grouping bears to the total UPL interest expense of the UPL debtor (or any other person in the same affiliated group as the UPL debtor).
(iii)
Anti-avoidance rule for third party back-to-back loans.
If, with a principal purpose of avoiding the rules in this paragraph (e)(9), a partnership makes a loan to a person that is not related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707) to the lender, the unrelated person makes a loan to a direct or indirect partner in the partnership (or any person in the same affiliated group as a direct or indirect partner), and the first loan would constitute an upstream partnership loan if made directly to the direct or indirect partner (or person in the same affiliated group as a direct or indirect partner), then the rules of this paragraph (e)(9) apply as if the first loan was made directly by the partnership to the partner (or affiliate of the partner), and the interest expense paid by the partner is treated as made with respect to the first loan. Such a series of loans will be subject to the recharacterization rule in this paragraph (e)(9)(iii) without regard to whether there was a principal purpose of avoiding the rules in this paragraph (e)(9) if the loan to the unrelated person would not have been made or maintained on substantially the same terms but for the loan of funds by the unrelated person to the direct or indirect partner (or affiliate of the partner). The principles of this paragraph (e)(9)(iii) also apply to similar transactions that involve more than two loans and regardless of the order in which the loans are made.
(iv)
Interest equivalents.
The principles of this paragraph (e)(9) apply in the case of a partner, or any person in the same affiliated group as the partner, that takes into account a distributive share of income and has a matching expense amount (treating any interest equivalent described in paragraph (b) of this section and § 1.861-9T(b) as interest income or expense for purposes of paragraph (e)(9)(v)(B) of this section) that is allocated and apportioned in the same manner as interest expense under paragraph (b) of this section and § 1.861-9T(b).

(D)
Upstream partnership loan debtor (UPL debtor).
The term
upstream partnership loan debtor,
or
UPL debtor,
means the person that has the payable with respect to an upstream partnership loan. If a partnership has the payable, then any partner in the partnership (other than a partner described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section) is also considered a UPL debtor.
(E)
Upstream partnership loan interest expense (UPL interest expense).
The term
upstream partnership loan interest expense,
or
UPL interest expense,

Facts.
US1, a domestic corporation, directly owns 60% of PRS, a foreign partnership that is not engaged in a U.S. trade or business. The remaining 40% of PRS is directly owned by US2, a domestic corporation that is unrelated to US1. US1, US2, and PRS all use the calendar year as their taxable year. In Year 1, PRS loans $1,000x to US1. For Year 1, US1 has $100x of interest expense with respect to the loan and PRS has $100x of interest income with respect to the loan. US1's distributive share of the interest income is $60x. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, $75x of US1's interest expense with respect to the loan is allocated and apportioned to U.S. source income and $25x is allocated and apportioned to foreign source foreign branch category income. Under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, US1's share of the total value of the loan between US1 and PRS is $600x.
(

)
Analysis.
The loan by PRS to US1 is an upstream partnership loan and US1 is an UPL debtor. Under paragraph (e)(9)(iv)(B) of this section, the matching expense amount is $60x, the lesser of the UPL interest expense taken into account by US1 with respect to the loan for the taxable year ($100x) and US1's distributive share of the UPL interest income ($60x). Under paragraph (e)(9)(ii) of this section, US1 assigns $45x of the UPL interest income to U.S. source income ($60x × $75x/$100x) and $15x of the UPL interest income to foreign source foreign branch category income ($60x × $25x/$100x). Under paragraph (e)(9)(i) of this section, the disregarded portion of the upstream partnership loan is $600x, and is not taken into account as described in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section.

Analysis.
The loan by PRS to US1 is an upstream partnership loan and
US1 is an UPL debtor. Under paragraph (e)(9)(iv)(B) of this section, the matching expense amount is $100x, the lesser of the UPL interest expense taken into account by US1 with respect to the loan for the taxable year ($100x) and the total amount of US1 and US2's distributive shares of the UPL interest income ($100x). Under paragraph (e)(9)(ii) of this section, US1 and US2 assign $75x of their total UPL interest income to U.S. source income ($100x × $75x/$100x) and $25x of their total UPL interest income to foreign source foreign branch category income ($100x × $25x/$100x). Under paragraph (e)(9)(i) of this section, the disregarded portion of the upstream partnership loan is $1,000x, the total amount of US1 and US2's share of the loan between US1 and PRS, and is not taken into account as described in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section.

Section 987 QBUs of domestic corporations
—(i)
In general.
In the application of the asset method described in paragraph (g) of this section, a domestic corporation—
(A) Takes into account the assets of any section 987 QBU (as defined in § 1.987-1(b)(2)), translated according to the rules set forth in paragraph (g) of this section; and
(B) Combines with its own interest expense any deductible interest expense incurred by a section 987 QBU, translated according to the rules under section 987.
(ii)
Coordination with section 987(3).
For purposes of computing foreign currency gain or loss under section 987(3) (including section 987 gain or loss recognized under § 1.987-5), the rules of this paragraph (f)(2) do not apply.
See
§ 1.987-4.
(iii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of the rules in this paragraph (f)(2).
(A)
Facts.
X is a domestic corporation that operates B, a branch doing business in a foreign country. B is a section 987 QBU (as defined in § 1.987-1(b)(2)) as well as a foreign branch (as defined in § 1.904-4(f)(3)(iii)). In 2020, without regard to B, X has gross domestic source income of $1,000x and gross foreign source general category income of $500x and incurs $200 of interest expense. Using the tax book value method of apportionment, X, without regard to B, determines the value of its assets that generate domestic source income to be $6,000x and the value of its assets that generate foreign source general category income to be $1,000x. Applying the translation rules of section 987, X (through B) earned $500 of gross foreign source foreign branch category income and incurred $100x of interest expense. B incurred no other expenses. For 2020, the average functional currency book value of B's assets that generate foreign source foreign branch category income translated at the year-end rate for 2020 is $3,000x.
(B)
Analysis.
The combined assets of X and B for 2020 (averaged under § 1.861-9T(g)(3)) consist 60% ($6,000x/$10,000x) of assets generating domestic source income, 30% ($3,000x/$10,000x) of assets generating foreign source foreign branch category income, and 10% ($1,000x/$10,000x) of assets generating foreign source general category income. The combined interest expense of X and B is $300x. Thus, $180x ($300x x 60%) of the combined interest expense is apportioned to domestic source income, $90x ($300x × 30%) is apportioned to foreign source foreign branch category income, and $30x ($300x × 10%) is apportioned to foreign source general category income, yielding net U.S. source income of $820 ($1,000x−$180x), net foreign source foreign branch category income of $410 ($500x−$90x), and net foreign source general category income of $470x ($500x−$30x).

Noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations.
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of computing earnings and profits of a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations (as defined in section 904(d)(2)(E)) for Federal tax purposes, the interest expense of a noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations may be apportioned using either the asset method described in § 1.861-9T(g) or the modified gross income method described in § 1.861-9T(j). A noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations that is not a controlled foreign corporation may elect to use a different method of apportionment than that elected by one or more of its shareholders. A noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations must use the same method of apportionment with respect to all its domestic corporate shareholders.
(ii)
Manner of election.
The election to use the asset method described in § 1.861-9T(g) or the modified gross income method described in § 1.861-9T(j) may be made either by the noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations or by the majority domestic corporate shareholders (as defined in § 1.964-1(c)(5)(ii)) on behalf of the noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations.

Asset values
—(i)
General rule
—(A)
Average of values.
For purposes of determining the value of assets under this section, an average of values (book or market) within each statutory grouping and the residual grouping is computed for the year on the basis of values of assets at the beginning and end of the year. For the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 (
post-2017 year
), a taxpayer that determined the value of its assets on the basis of the fair market value method for purposes of apportioning interest expense in its prior taxable year may choose to determine asset values under the tax book value method (or the alternative tax book value method) by treating the value of its assets as of the beginning of the post-2017 year as equal to the value of its assets at the end of the first quarter of the post-2017 year, provided that each member of the affiliated group (as defined in § 1.861-11T(d)) determines its asset values on the same basis. Where a substantial distortion of asset values would result from averaging beginning-of-year and end-of-year values, as might be the case in the
event of a major corporate acquisition or disposition, the taxpayer must use a different method of asset valuation that more clearly reflects the average value of assets weighted to reflect the time such assets are held by the taxpayer during the taxable year.
(B)
Tax book value method.
Under the tax book value method, the value of an asset is determined based on the adjusted basis of the asset. For purposes of determining the value of stock in a 10 percent owned corporation at the beginning and end of the year under the tax book value method, the tax book value is determined without regard to any adjustments under section 961(a) or 1293(d), see § 1.861-12(c)(2)(i)(B)(
1
), and before the adjustment required by § 1.861-12(c)(2)(i)(A) to the basis of stock in the 10 percent owned corporation. The average of the tax book value of the stock at the beginning and end of the year is then adjusted with respect to earnings and profits as described in § 1.861-12(c)(2)(i).
(ii)
Special rule for qualified business units of domestic corporations with functional currency other than the U.S. dollar
—(A)
Tax book value method.
In the case of taxpayers using the tax book value method of apportionment, the following rules apply to determine the value of the assets of a qualified business unit (QBU) (as defined in section 989(a)) of a domestic corporation with a functional currency other than the dollar.
(
1
)
Section 987 QBU.
In the case of a section 987 QBU (as defined in § 1.987-1(b)(3)), the tax book value is determined by applying the rules of paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section and § 1.861-9T(g)(3) to the beginning-of-year and end-of-year owner functional currency amount of assets. The beginning-of-year owner functional currency amount of assets is determined by reference to the owner functional currency amount of assets computed under § 1.987-4(d)(1)(i)(B) and (e) on the last day of the preceding taxable year. The end-of-year owner functional currency amount of assets is determined by reference to the owner functional currency amount of assets computed under § 1.987-4(d)(1)(i)(A) and (e) on the last day of the current taxable year. The beginning-of-year and end-of-year owner functional currency amount of assets, as so determined within each grouping, are then averaged as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.
(
2
)
U.S. dollar approximate separate transactions method.
In the case of a branch to which the U.S. dollar approximate separate transactions method of accounting described in § 1.985-3 applies, the beginning-of-year dollar amount of the assets is determined by reference to the end-of-year balance sheet of the branch for the immediately preceding taxable year, adjusted for U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and Federal income tax accounting principles, and translated into U.S. dollars as provided in § 1.985-3(c). The end-of-year dollar amount of the assets of the branch is determined in the same manner by reference to the end-of-year balance sheet for the current taxable year. The beginning-of-year and end-of-year dollar tax book value of assets, as so determined, within each grouping is then averaged as provided in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.
(B)
Fair market value method.
In the case of taxpayers using the fair market value method of apportionment, the beginning-of-year and end-of-year fair market values of branch assets within each grouping are computed in dollars and averaged as provided in this paragraph (g)(2) and § 1.861-9T(g)(2).
(iii)
Adjustment for directly allocated interest.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-9T(g)(2)(iii).
(iv)
Assets in intercompany transactions.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-9T(g)(2)(iv).
(v)
Applicability date.
Generally, paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. However, if pursuant to § 1.987-15(b), a taxpayer chooses to apply §§ 1.987-1 through 1.987-15 to a taxable year before the first taxable year described in § 1.987-15(a)(1), then paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section applies to that taxable year and subsequent years.
(3)
Characterization of assets.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-9T(g)(3). In applying § 1.861-9T(g)(3), for purposes of applying section 904 as the operative section, the statutory or residual
grouping of income that assets generate, have generated, or may reasonably be expected to generate is determined after taking into account any reallocation of income required under § 1.904-4(f)(2)(vi).
(4)
Characterization of lower tier entities at the level of a CFC.
In the case of a controlled foreign corporation that is applying the asset method, see for example § 1.861-12T(c)(3)(ii) (requiring the application of § 1.861-9T(g) at the level of the controlled foreign corporation) or paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the controlled foreign corporation (and any lower-tier controlled foreign corporations) must characterize stock of a lower-tier 10 percent owned corporation by applying § 1.861-12 and treating the controlled foreign corporation as the relevant taxpayer for such purposes. In the case of a controlled foreign corporation that owns stock in one or more lower-tier corporations, in applying the asset method, the first-tier controlled foreign corporation must take into account the stock in the lower-tier corporations. Therefore, the controlled foreign corporation (and any lower-tier controlled foreign corporations) must make basis adjustments in lower-tier 10 percent owned corporations under § 1.861-12(c)(2) for purposes of valuing and characterizing the assets of such controlled foreign corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(4), the stock of each such lower-tier corporation is characterized by reference to the assets owned during the lower-tier corporation's taxable year that ends during the first-tier controlled foreign corporation's taxable year. The analysis of assets under this paragraph (g)(4) and § 1.861-12 of a controlled foreign corporation that is in a chain of 10 percent owned corporations must begin at the lowest-tier 10 percent owned corporation and proceed up the chain to the first-tier controlled foreign corporation.
See also
§ 1.861-12T(c)(3)(ii).
(h)
Fair market value method.
An affiliated group (as defined in § 1.861-11T(d)) or other taxpayer (the
taxpayer
) that elects to use the fair market value method of apportionment values its assets according to the methodology described in this paragraph (h). Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the fair market value method is not allowed for purposes of apportioning interest expense.
See
section 864(e)(2). However, a taxpayer may continue to apportion deductions other than interest expense that are properly apportioned based on fair market value according to the methodology described in this paragraph (h).
See
§ 1.861-8(c)(2).

Valuing related party debt and stock in related persons
—(i)
Related party debt.
For purposes of this section, the value of a debt obligation of a related person held by the taxpayer or another person related to the taxpayer equals the amount of the liability of the obligor related person.
(ii)
Stock in related persons.
The value of stock in a related person held by the taxpayer or by another person related to the taxpayer equals the sum of the following amounts reduced by the taxpayer's pro rata share of liabilities of such related person:
(A) The portion of the value of intangible assets of the taxpayer and related persons that is apportioned to such related person under § 1.861-9T(h)(2);
(B) The taxpayer's pro rata share of tangible assets held by the related person (as determined under § 1.861-9T(h)(1)(ii));
(C) The taxpayer's pro rata share of debt obligations of any related person held by the related person (as valued under paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section); and
(D) The total value of stock in all related persons held by the related person as determined under this paragraph (h)(4).
(iii)
Example
—(A)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, wholly owns CFC1 and owns 80% of CFC2, both foreign corporations. The aggregate trading value of USP's stock traded on established securities markets at the end of Year 1 is $700 and the amount of USP's liabilities to unrelated persons at the end of Year 1 is $400. Neither CFC1 nor CFC2 has liabilities to unrelated persons at the end of Year 1. USP owns plant and equipment valued at $500, CFC1 owns plant and equipment valued
at $400, and CFC2 owns plant and equipment valued at $250. The value of these assets has been determined using generally accepted valuation techniques, as required by § 1.861-9T(h)(1)(ii). There is an outstanding loan from CFC2 to CFC1 in an amount of $100. There is also an outstanding loan from USP to CFC1 in an amount of $200.
(B)
Valuation of group assets.
Pursuant to § 1.861-9T(h)(1)(i), the aggregate value of USP's assets is $1100 (the $700 trading value of USP's stock increased by $400 of USP's liabilities to unrelated persons).
(C)
Valuation of tangible assets.
Pursuant to § 1.861-9T(h)(1)(ii), the value of USP's tangible assets and pro rata share of assets held by CFC1 and CFC2 is $1100 (the plant and equipment held directly by USP, valued at $500, plus USP's 100% pro rata share of the plant and equipment held by CFC1 valued at $400 and USP's 80% pro rata share of the plant and equipment held by CFC 2 valued at $200 (80% of $250)).
(D)
Computation of intangible asset value.
Pursuant to § 1.861-9T(h)(1)(iii), the value of the intangible assets of USP, CFC1, and CFC2 is $0 (total aggregate group asset value ($1100) determined in paragraph (B) less total tangible asset value ($1100) determined in paragraph (C)). Because the intangible asset value is zero, the provisions of § 1.861-9T(h)(2) and (3) relating to the apportionment and characterization of intangible assets do not apply.
(E)
Valuing related party debt obligations.
Pursuant to § 1.861-9(h)(4)(i), the value of the debt obligation of CFC1 held by CFC2 is equal to the amount of the liability, $100. The value of the debt obligation of CFC1 held by USP is equal to the amount of the liability, $200.
(F)
Valuing the stock of CFC1 and CFC2.
Pursuant to § 1.861-9(h)(4)(ii), the value of the stock of CFC2 held by USP is $280 (USP's 80% pro rata share of tangible assets of CFC2 included in paragraph (C) ($200) plus USP's 80% pro rata share of the debt obligation of CFC1 held by CFC2 valued in paragraph (E) ($80). The value of the stock of CFC1 held by USP is $100 (USP's 100% pro rata share of tangible assets of CFC1 included in paragraph (C) ($400) less USP's 100% pro rata share of the liabilities of CFC1 to USP and CFC2 ($300)).
(5)
Characterizing stock in related persons.
Stock in a related person held by the taxpayer or by another related person shall be characterized on the basis of the fair market value of the taxpayer's pro rata share of assets held by the related person attributed to each statutory grouping and the residual grouping under the stock characterization rules of § 1.861-12T(c)(3)(ii), except that the portion of the value of intangible assets of the taxpayer and related persons that is apportioned to the related person under § 1.861-9T(h)(2) shall be characterized on the basis of the net income before interest expense of the related person within each statutory grouping or residual grouping (excluding income that is passive under § 1.904-4(b)).
(6) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.861-9T(h)(6).
(i)
Alternative tax book value method
—(1)
Alternative value for certain tangible property.
A taxpayer may elect to determine the tax book value of its tangible property that is depreciated under section 168 (section 168 property) using the rules provided in this paragraph (i)(1) (the alternative tax book value method). The alternative tax book value method applies solely for purposes of apportioning expenses (including the calculation of the alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit pursuant to section 59(a)) under the asset method described in paragraph (g) of this section.
(i) The tax book value of section 168 property placed in service during or after the first taxable year to which the election to use the alternative tax book value method applies shall be determined as though such property were subject to the alternative depreciation system set forth in section 168(g) (or a successor provision) for the entire period that such property has been in service.
(ii) In the case of section 168 property placed in service prior to the first taxable year to which the election to use the alternative tax book value method applies, the tax book value of such property shall be determined under the depreciation method, convention, and
recovery period provided for under section 168(g) for the first taxable year to which the election applies.
(iii) If a taxpayer revokes an election to use the alternative tax book value method (the prior election) and later makes another election to use the alternative tax book value method (the subsequent election) that is effective for a taxable year that begins within 3 years of the end of the last taxable year to which the prior election applied, the taxpayer shall determine the tax book value of its section 168 property as though the prior election has remained in effect.
(iv) The tax book value of section 168 property shall be determined without regard to the election to expense certain depreciable assets under section 179.
(v)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (i)(1) are illustrated in the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 2000, a taxpayer purchases and places in service section 168 property used solely in the United States. In 2005, the taxpayer elects to use the alternative tax book value method, effective for the current taxable year. For purposes of determining the tax book value of its section 168 property, the taxpayer's depreciation deduction is determined by applying the method, convention, and recovery period rules of the alternative depreciation system under section 168(g)(2) as in effect in 2005 to the taxpayer's original cost basis in such property. In 2006, the taxpayer acquires and places in service in the United States new section 168 property. The tax book value of this section 168 property is determined under the rules of section 168(g)(2) applicable to property placed in service in 2006.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
, except that the taxpayer revokes the alternative tax book value method election effective for taxable year 2010. Additionally, in 2011, the taxpayer acquires new section 168 property and places it in service in the United States. If the taxpayer elects to use the alternative tax book value method effective for taxable year 2012, the taxpayer must determine the tax book value of its section 168 property as though the prior election still applied. Thus, the tax book value of property placed in service prior to 2005 would be determined by applying the method, convention, and recovery period rules of the alternative depreciation system under section 168(g)(2) applicable to property placed in service in 2005. The tax book value of section 168 property placed in service during any taxable year after 2004 would be determined by applying the method, convention, and recovery period rules of the alternative depreciation system under section 168(g)(2) applicable to property placed in service in such taxable year.
(2)
Timing and scope of election.
(i) Except as provided in this paragraph (i)(2)(i), a taxpayer may elect to use the alternative tax book value method. For the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, the Commissioner's approval is not required to switch from the fair market value method to the alternative tax book value method for purposes of apportioning interest expense. Any election made pursuant to this paragraph (i)(2)(i) shall apply to all members of an affiliated group of corporations as defined in §§ 1.861-11(d) and 1.861-11T(d). Any election made pursuant to this paragraph (i)(2)(i) shall apply to all subsequent taxable years of the taxpayer unless revoked by the taxpayer. Revocation of such an election, other than in conjunction with an election to use the fair market value method, for a taxable year prior to the sixth taxable year for which the election applies requires the consent of the Commissioner.
(ii)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph (i)(2) are illustrated in the following example:

# Example.
Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, elects on its original, timely filed tax return for the taxable year ending December 31, 2007, to use the alternative tax book value method for its 2007 year. The alternative tax book value method applies to Corporation X's 2007 year and all subsequent taxable years. Corporation X may not, without the consent of the Commissioner, revoke its election and determine tax book value using a method other than the alternative tax book value method with respect to any taxable year beginning before January 1, 2012. However, Corporation X may automatically elect to change from the alternative tax book value method to the fair market value method for any open year.

§ 1.861-9T
Allocation and apportionment of interest expense (temporary).
(a)
In general.
Any expense that is deductible under section 163 (including original issue discount) constitutes interest expense for purposes of this section, as well as for purposes of §§ 1.861-10T, 1.861-11T, 1.861-12T, and 1.861-13T. The term interest refers to the gross amount of interest expense incurred by a taxpayer in a given tax year. The method of allocation and apportionment for interest set forth in this section is based on the approach that, in general, money is fungible and that interest expense is attributable to all activities and property regardless of any specific purpose for incurring an obligation on which interest is paid. Exceptions to the fungibility rule are set forth in § 1.861-10T. The fungibility approach recognizes that all activities and property require funds and that management has a great deal of flexibility as to the source and use of funds. When borrowing will generally free other funds for other purposes, and it is reasonable under this approach to attribute part of the cost of borrowing to such other purposes. Consistent with the principles of fungibility, except as otherwise provided, the aggregate of deductions for interest in all cases shall be considered related to all income producing activities and assets of the taxpayer and, thus, allocable to all the gross income which the assets of the taxpayer generate, have generated, or could reasonably have been expected to generate. In the case of the interest expense of members of an affiliated group, interest expense shall be considered to be allocable to all gross income of the members of the group under § 1.861-11T. That section requires the
members of an affiliated group to allocate and apportion the interest expense of each member of the group as if all members of such group were a single corporation. For the method of determining the interest deduction allowed to foreign corporations under section 882(c), see § 1.882-5.
(b)
Interest equivalents—
(1)
Certain expenses and losses—
(i)
General rule.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-9(b)(1)(i).
(ii)
Examples.
The rule of this paragraph (b)(1) may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
W, a domestic corporation, borrows from X two ounces of gold at a time when the spot price for gold is $500 per ounce. W agrees to return the two ounces of gold in six months. W sells the two ounces of gold to Y for $1000. W then enters into a contract with Z to purchase two ounces of gold six months in the future for $1,050. In exchange for the use of $1,000 in cash, W has sustained a loss of $50 on related transactions. This loss is subject to allocation and apportionment under the rules of this section in the same manner as interest expense.

# Example 2.
X, a domestic corporation with a dollar functional currency, borrows 100 pounds on January 1, 1987 for a three-year term at an interest rate greater than the applicable federal rate for dollar loans. At this time, the interest rate on the pound was approximately equal to the interest rate on dollar borrowings and the forward price on the pound, vis-a-vis the dollar, was approximately equal to the spot price. On January 1, 1987, X converted 100 pounds into dollars and entered into a currency swap that substantially hedged X's foreign currency exposure on the pound borrowing, both with respect to interest and principal. The borrowing, coupled with the swap, represents a series of related transactions in which the taxpayer secures the use of funds in its functional currency. Any net foreign currency loss on this series of transactions constitutes a loss incurred substantially in consideration of the time value of money and shall be apportioned in the same manner as interest expense. Thus, if the pound depreciates against the dollar, such that when the first payment on the pound borrowing is due the taxpayer has a currency loss on the swap payment hedging its first interest payment, such loss shall, even if the transaction is not integrated under section 988(d), be allocated and apportioned in the same manner as interest expense under the authority of this paragraph (b)(1).

# Example 3.
On January 1, 1987, X, a domestic corporation with a dollar functional currency, enters into a dollar interest rate swap contract with Y, a domestic counterparty. Under the terms of this agreement, X agrees to pay Y floating rate interest with respect to a notional principal amount of $100 for five years. In return, Y agrees to pay X fixed rate interest at 10 percent with respect to a notional principal amount of $100 for five years. On the same day, Y prepays the fixed leg of the swap by making a lump sum payment of $37 to X. This lump sum payment represents the present value of five $10 swap payments. Because X secures the use of $37 in this transaction, any net swap expense arising from the transaction represents an expense incurred substantially in consideration of the time value of money. Assuming this lump sum payment is not otherwise characterized as a loan from Y to X, and that X must amortize the $37 lump sum payment under the principles of Notice 89-21, any net swap expense incurred by X with respect to this transaction (
i.e.,
the excess, if any, of X's annual swap payment to Y over the annual amortization of the $37 lump sum payment that is taken into income by X) represents an expense equivalent to interest expense. The result would be the same if X sold the fixed leg to a third party for $37. While this example presents the case of a lump sum payment, the rules of paragraph (b)(1) would also apply to any transaction in which the swap payments are not substantially contemporaneous if the pricing of the transaction is materially affected by the time value of money. Thus, expenses and losses will be subject to apportionment under the rules of this section to the extent that such expenses or losses were incurred in consideration of the time value of money.
(2)
Certain foreign currency borrowings
—(i)
Rule.
If a taxpayer borrows in a nonfunctional currency at a rate of interest that is less than the applicable federal rate (or its equivalent in functional currency if the functional currency is not the dollar), any swap, forward, future, option, or similar financial arrangement (or any combination thereof) entered into by the taxpayer or by a related person (as defined in § 1.861-8T(c)(2)) that exists during the term of the borrowing and that substantially diminishes currency risk with respect to the borrowing or interest expense thereon will be presumed to constitute a hedge of such borrowing, unless the taxpayer can demonstrate on the basis of facts and circumstances that the two transactions are in fact unrelated. Under this presumption, the currency loss incurred on the borrowing during taxable years beginning after December 31, 1988, in connection with hedged nonfunctional
currency borrowings, reduced or increased by the gain or loss on the hedge, will be apportioned in the same manner as interest expense. This presumption can be rebutted by a showing that the financial arrangement was entered into in connection with hedging currency exposure arising in the ordinary course of a trade or business (other than with respect to the borrowing).
(ii)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (b)(2) may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
Taxpayer has a dollar functional currency and does not have any qualified business units with a functional currency other than the dollar. On January 1, 1989, when the unit of foreign currency is worth $1, taxpayer borrows 100 units of foreign currency for a three-year period bearing interest at the annual rate of 3 percent and immediately converts the proceeds of the borrowing into dollars for use in its business. In the ordinary course of its business, taxpayer has no foreign currency exposure in this currency. In March 1989, taxpayer enters into a three-year swap agreement that covers most, but not all, of the payment of interest and principal. Because the swap substantially diminishes currency risk with respect to the borrowing, it is presumed to hedge the loan. Since taxpayer cannot demonstrate that it was hedging currency exposure arising in the ordinary course of its business (other than currency exposure with respect to the borrowing), the net currency loss on the borrowing adjusted for any gain or loss on the swap must be apportioned in the same manner as interest expense.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the taxpayer borrows in two separate foreign currencies on terms described in Example 1 and enters into a swap agreement in a single currency that substantially diminishes the taxpayer's aggregate foreign currency risk. The net currency loss on the borrowings adjusted for any gain or loss on the swap must be apportioned in the same manner as interest expense.
(3)
Losses on sale of certain receivables
—(1)
General rule.
Any loss on the sale of a trade receivable (as defined in § 1.954-2(h)) shall be allocated and apportioned, solely for purposes of this section and §§ 1.861-10T, 1.861-11T, 1.861-12T, and 1.861-13T, in the same manner as interest expense, unless at the time of sale of the receivable, it bears interest at a rate which is at least 120 percent of the short term applicable federal rate (as determined under section 1274(d) of the Code), or its equivalent in foreign currency in the case of receivables denominated in foreign currency, determined at the time the receivable arises. This treatment shall not affect the characterization of such expense as interest for other purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.
(ii)(A)
Exceptions.
To the extent that a loss on the sale of a trade receivable exceeds the discount on the receivable that would be computed applying to the amount received on the sale of the receivable 120 percent of the applicable federal rate (or its equivalent in foreign currency in the case of receivables denominated in foreign currency) for the period commencing with the date on which the receivable is sold and ending with the earlier of the date on which the receivable begins to bear interest at such rate or the anticipated payment date of the receivable, such excess shall not be allocated and apportioned in the same manner as interest expense but rather shall be allocated and apportioned to the gross income generated by the receivable. In cases of transfers of receivables to a domestic international sales corporation described § 1.994-1(c)(6)(v), the rule of this paragraph (b)(3) shall not apply for purposes of computing combined taxable income.
(B)
Example.
On October 1, X sells a widget to Y for $100 payable in 30 days, after which the receivable will bear stated interest at 13 percent. On October 4, X sells Y's obligation to Z for $98. Assume that the applicable federal rate for the month of October is 10 percent. Applying 120 percent of the applicable federal rate to the $98 received on the sale of the receivable, the obligation is discounted at a 12 percent rate for a period of 27 days. At this discount rate, the obligation would have sold for $99.22. Thus, 88 cents of the $2 loss on the sale is apportioned in the same manner as interest expense, and $1.22 of the $2 loss on the sale is directly allocated to the income generated on the widget sale.
(4)
Rent in certain leasing transactions.
[Reserved]
(5)
Treatment of bond premium
—(i)
Treatment by the issuer.
If a bond or other debt obligation is issued at a premium, an amount of interest expense
incurred by the issuer on that bond or other debt obligation equal to the amortized portion of that premium that is included in gross income for the year shall be allocated and apportioned solely to the amortized portion of premium derived by the issuer for the year.
(ii)
Treatment by the holder.
If a bond or debt obligation is purchased at a premium, the portion of that premium amortized during the year by the holder under section 171 and the regulations thereunder shall be allocated and apportioned solely to interest income derived from the bond by the holder for the year.
(6)
Financial products that alter effective cost of borrowing
—(i)
In general.
Various derivative financial products can be part of transactions or series of transactions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Such derivative financial products, including interest rate swaps, options, forwards, caps, and collars, potentially alter a taxpayer's effective cost of borrowing with respect to an actual liability of the taxpayer. For example, a taxpayer that is obligated to pay interest at a fixed rate may, in effect, pay interest at a floating rate by entering into an interest rate swap. Similarly, a taxpayer that is obligated to pay interest at a floating rate may, in effect, limit its exposure to rising interest rates by purchasing a cap. Such a taxpayer may have gains or losses associated with such derivative financial products. This paragraph (b)(6) provides rules for the treatment of gains and losses from such derivative financial products (“financial products”) that are part of transactions described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that are used by the taxpayer to alter its effective cost of borrowing with respect to an actual liability. This paragraph (b)(6) shall only apply where the hedge and the borrowing are in the same currency and shall not apply to the extent otherwise provided in section 988 and the regulations thereunder. The allocation and apportionment of a loss under this paragraph (b) shall not affect the characterization of such loss as capital or ordinary for other purposes of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
(ii)
Definition of gain and loss.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(6), the term “gain” refers to the excess of the amounts properly taken into income under a financial product that alters the effective cost of borrowing over the amounts properly allowed as a deduction thereunder within a given taxable year. See.
e.g.,
Notice 89-21. The term “loss” refers to the excess of the amounts properly allowed as a deduction under such a financial product over the amounts properly taken into income thereunder within a given taxable year.
(iii)
Treatment of gain or loss on the disposition of a financial product.
[Reserved]
(iv)
Entities that are not financial services entities.
An entity that does not constitute a financial services entity within the meaning of § 1.904-4(e)(3) shall treat gains and losses on financial products described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section as follows.
(A)
Losses.
Losses on any financial product described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section shall be apportioned in the same manner as interest expense whether or not such financial product is identified by the taxpayer under paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(C) of this section as a liability hedge.
(B)
Gains.
Gains on any financial product described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section shall reduce the taxpayer's total interest expense that is subject to apportionment, but only if such financial product is identified by the taxpayer under paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(C) of this section as a liability hedge. Such reduction is accomplished by directly allocating interest expense to the income derived from such a financial product.
(C)
Identification of financial products.
A taxpayer can identify a financial product described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section as hedging a particular interest-bearing liability (or any group of such liabilities) by clearly identifying on its books and records on the same day that it becomes a party to such arrangement that such arrangement hedges a given liability (or group of liabilities). In the case of a partial hedge, such identification shall apply to only that part of the liability that is hedged. If the taxpayer clearly identifies on its books and records a financial
product as a hedge of an interest-bearing asset (or any group of such assets), it will create a rebuttable presumption that such financial product is not described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section. A taxpayer may identify a hedge as relating to an anticipated liability, provided that such liability is in fact incurred within 120 days following the date of such identification. Gains and losses on such an anticipatory arrangement accruing prior to the time at which the liability is incurred shall constitute an adjustment to interest expense.
(v)
Financial services entities.
[Reserved]
(vi)
Dealers.
The rule of paragraph (b)(6)(iv) of this section shall not apply to a person acting in its capacity as a regular dealer in the financial products described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section. Instead, losses sustained by a regular dealer in connection with such financial products shall be allocated to the class of gross income from such arrangements. Gains of a regular dealer in notional principal contracts are governed by the rules of § 1.863-7T(b). Amounts received or accrued by any person from any financial product that is integrated as specified in Notice 89-90 with an asset shall not be treated as amounts received or accrued by a person acting in its capacity as a regular dealer in financial products.
(vii)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (b)(6) may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
X is not a financial services entity or regular dealer in the financial products described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section and has a dollar functional currency. In 1990, X incurred a total of $200 of interest expense. On January 1, 1990, X entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Y, in order to hedge its interest rate exposure with respect to a pre-existing floating rate liability. On the same day, X properly identified the agreement as a hedge of such liability. Under the agreement, X is required to pay Y an amount equal to a fixed rate of 10 percent on a notional principal amount of $1,000. Y is required to pay X an amount equal to a floating rate of interest on the same notional principal amount. Under the agreement, X received from Y during 1990 a net payment of $25. Because X identified the swap agreement as a liability hedge under the rules of paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(C), X may effectively reduce its total allocable interest expense for 1990 to $175 by directly allocating $25 of interest expense to the swap income. Had X not properly identified the swap as a liability hedge, this swap payment would have been treated as domestic source income in accordance with the rule of § 1.863-7T(b).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as Example (1), except that X did not properly identify the agreement as a liability hedge on January 1, 1990. In 1990, X made a net payment of $25 to Y under the swap agreement. This swap payment is allocated and apportioned in the same manner as interest expense under the rules of paragraph (b)(6)(iv)(A).
(7)
Foreign currency gain or loss.
In addition to the rules of paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(6) of this section, any foreign currency loss that is treated as an adjustment to interest expense under regulations issued under section 988 shall be allocated and apportioned in the same manner as interest expense. Any foreign currency gain that is treated as an adjustment to interest expense under regulations issued under section 988 shall offset apportionable interest expense.
(8)
Guaranteed payments.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-9(b)(8).
(c)
Allowable deductions.
In order for an interest expense to be allocated and apportioned, it must first be determined that the interest expense is currently deductible. A number of provisions in the Code disallow or suspend deductions of interest expense or require the capitalization thereof.
(1)
Disallowed deductions.
A taxpayer does not allocate and apportion interest expense under this section that is permanently disallowed as a deduction by operation of section 163(h), section 265, or any other provision or rule that permanently disallows the deduction of interest expense.
(2)
Section 263A.
Section 263A requires the capitalization of interest expense that is allocable to designated types of property. Any interest expense that is capitalized under section 263A does not constitute deductible interest expense for purposes of this section. Furthermore, interest expense capitalized in inventory or depreciable property is not separately allocated and apportioned when the inventory is sold or depreciation is allowed. Capitalized interest expense is effectively allocated and apportioned as part of, and in the
same manner as, the cost of goods sold, amortization, or depreciation deduction.
(3)
Section 163(d).
Section 163(d) suspends the deduction for interest expense to the extent that it exceeds net investment income. In the year that suspended investment interest expense becomes allowable under the rules of section 163(d), that interest expense is apportioned under rules set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section as though it were incurred in the taxable year in which the expense is deducted.
(4)
Section 469
—(i)
General rule.
Section 469 suspends the deduction of passive activity losses to the extent that they exceed passive activity income for the year. Passive activity losses may consist in part of interest expense properly allocable to passive activity. In the year that suspended interest expense becomes allowable as a deduction under the rules of section 469, that interest expense is apportioned under rules set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section as though it were incurred in the taxable year in which the expense is deducted.
(ii)
Identification of the interest component of a suspended passive loss.
A suspended passive loss may consist of a variety of items of expense other than interest expense. Suspended interest expense for any taxable year is computed by multiplying the total suspended passive loss for the year by a fraction, the numerator of which is passive interest expense for the year (determined under regulations issued under section 163) and the denominator of which is total passive expenses for the year. The amount of the suspended interest expense that is considered to be deductible in a subsequent taxable year is computed by multiplying the amount of any cumulative suspended interest expense (reduced by suspended interest expense allowed as a deduction in prior taxable years) times a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of cumulative suspended passive losses that become deductible in the taxable year and the denominator of which is the cumulative suspended passive losses for prior taxable years (reduced by suspended passive losses allowed as deductions in prior taxable years).
(iii)
Example.
The rules of this paragraph (c)(4) may be illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
On January 1, 1987, A, a United States citizen, invested in a passive activity. In 1987, the passive activity generated no passive income and $100 in passive losses, all of which were suspended by operation of section 469. The suspended loss included $10 of suspended interest expense. In 1988, the passive activity generated $50 in passive income and $150 in passive expenses which included $30 of interest expense. The entire $100 passive loss was suspended in 1988 and included $20 of interest expense ($100 suspended passive loss × $30 passive interest expense/$150 total passive expenses). Thus, at the end of 1988, A had total suspended passive losses of $200, including $30 of suspended interest expense. In 1989, the passive activity generated $100 in passive income and no passive expenses. Thus, $100 of A's cumulative suspended passive loss was therefore allowed in 1989. The $100 of deductible passive loss includes $15 of suspended interest expense ($30 cumulative suspended interest expense × $100 of cumulative suspended passive losses allowable in 1989/$200 of total cumulative suspended passive losses). The $15 of interest expense is apportioned under the rules of paragraph (d) of this section as though it were incurred in 1989.
(5)
Section 163(j).
For further guidance, see § 1.861-9(c)(5).
(d)
Apportionment rules for individuals, estates, and certain trusts
—(1)
United States individuals.
In the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, individuals generally shall apportion interest expense under different rules according to the type of interest expense incurred. The interest expense of individuals shall be characterized under the regulations issued under section 163. However, in the case of an individual whose foreign source income (including income that is excluded under section 911) does not exceed a gross amount of $5,000, the apportionment of interest expense under this section is not required. Such an individual's interest expense may be allocated entirely to domestic source income.
(i)
Interest incurred in the conduct of a trade or business.
An individual who incurs business interest described in section 163(h)(2)(A) shall apportion such interest expense using an asset method by reference to the individual's business assets.
(ii)
Investment interest.
An individual who incurs investment interest described in section 163(h)(2)(B) shall apportion that interest expense on the basis of the individual's investment assets.
(iii)
Interest incurred in a passive activity.
An individual who incurs passive activity interest described in section 163(h)(2)(C) shall apportion that interest expense on the basis of the individual's passive activity assets. Individuals who receive a distributive share of interest expense incurred in a partnership are subject to special rules set forth in paragraph (e) of this section.
(iv)
Qualified residence and deductible personal interest.
Individuals who incur qualified residence interest described in section 163(h)(2)(D) shall apportion that interest expense under a gross income method, taking into account all income (including business, passive activity, and investment income) but excluding income that is exempt under section 911. For purposes of this section, any qualified residence that is rented shall be considered to be a business asset for the period in which it is rented, with the result that the interest on such a residence is not apportioned under this subdivision (iv) but instead under subdivisions (i) or (iii) of this paragraph (d)(1). To the extent that personal interest described in section 163(h)(2) remains deductible under transitional rules, individuals shall apportion such interest expense in the same manner as qualified residence interest.
(v)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of this section.

# Example.
(i)
Facts.
A is a resident individual taxpayer engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business, which A operates as a sole proprietor. A's business generates only domestic source income. A's investment portfolio consists of several less than 10 percent stock investments. Certain stocks in which A's adjusted basis is $40,000 generate domestic source income and other stocks in which A's adjusted basis is $60,000 generate foreign source passive income. In addition, A owns his personal residence, which is subject to a mortgage in the amount of $100,000. All interest expense incurred with respect to A's mortgage is qualified residence interest for purposes of section 163(h)(2)(D). A's other indebtedness consists of a bank loan in the amount of $40,000. Under the regulations issued under section 163(h), it is determined that the proceeds of the $40,000 loan were divided equally between A's business and his investment portfolio. In 1987, the gross income of A's business, before the apportionment of interest expense, was $50,000. A's investment portfolio generated $4,000 in domestic source income and $6,000 in foreign source passive income. All of A's debt obligations bear interest at the annual rate of 10 percent.
(ii)
Analysis of business interest.
Under section 163(h) of the Code, $2,000 of A's interest expense is attributable to his business. Under the rules of paragraph (d)(1)(i), such interest must be apportioned on the basis of the business assets. Applying the asset method described in paragraph (g) of this section, it is determined that all of A's business assets generate domestic income and, therefore, constitute domestic assets. Thus, the $2,000 in interest expense on the business loan is allocable to domestic source income.
(iii)
Analysis of investment interest.
Under section 163(h) of the Code, $2,000 of A's interest expense is investment interest. Under the rules of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, such interest must be apportioned on the basis of investment assets. Applying the asset method, A's investment assets consist of stock generating domestic source income with an adjusted basis of $40,000 and stock generating foreign source passive income with an adjusted basis of $60,000. Thus, 40 percent ($800) of A's investment interest is apportioned to domestic source income and 60 percent ($1,200) of A's investment interest is apportioned to foreign source passive income for purposes of section 904.
(iv)
Analysis of qualified residence interest.
The $10,000 of qualified residence interest expense is apportioned under the rules of paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section on the basis of all of A's gross income. A's gross income consists of $60,000, $54,000 of which is domestic source and $6,000 of which is foreign source passive income. Thus, $9,000 of A's qualified residence interest is apportioned to domestic source income and $1,000 of A's qualified residence interest is apportioned to foreign source passive income.

For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1988, interest expense incurred by a nonresident alien shall be considered to be connected with income effectively connected with a United States trade or business only to the extent that interest expense is incurred with respect to liabilities that—
(A) Are entered on the books and records of the United States trade or business when incurred, or
(B) Are secured by assets that generate such effectively connected income.
(ii)
Limitations
—(A)
Maximum debt capitalization.
Interest expense incurred by a nonresident alien is not considered to be connected with effectively connected income to the extent that it is incurred with respect to liabilities that exceed 80 percent of the gross assets of the United States trade or business.
(B)
Collateralization by other assets.
Interest expense on indebtedness that is secured by specific assets (not including the general credit of the nonresident alien) other than the assets of the United States trade or business shall not be considered to be connected with effectively connected income.
(3)
Estates and trusts.
Estates shall be treated in the same manner as individuals. In the case of a trust that is beneficially owned by individuals and is a complex trust, the trust shall be treated in the same manner as individuals under the rules of paragraph (d) of this section, except that no de minimis amount shall apply. In the case of a trust that is beneficially owned by one or more corporations, the trust shall be treated either as a partnership or as a corporation depending on how the trust is characterized under the rules of section 7701 and the regulations thereunder.
(e)
Partnerships
—(1)
In general—aggregate rule.
A partner's distributive share of the interest expense of a partnership that is directly allocable under § 1.861-10T to income from specific partnership property shall be treated as directly allocable to the income generated by such partnership property. Subject to the exceptions set forth in paragraph (e)(4), a partner's distributive share of the interest expense of a partnership that is not directly allocable under § 1.861-10T generally is considered related to all income producing activities and assets of the partner and shall be subject to apportionment under the rules described in this paragraph. For purposes of this section, a partner's percentage interest in a partnership shall be determined by reference to the partner's interest in partnership income for the year. Similarly, a partner's pro rata share of partnership assets shall be determined by reference to the partner's interest in partnership income for the year.

Less than 10 percent limited partners and less than 10 percent corporate general partners—entity rule
—(i)
Partnership interest expense.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-9(e)(4)(i).
(ii)
Other interest expense of the partner.
For purposes of apportioning other interest expense of the partner on an asset basis, the partner's interest in the partnership, and not the partner's pro rata share of partnership assets, is considered to be the relevant asset. The value of this asset for apportionment purposes is either the tax book value or fair market value of the partner's partnership interest, depending on the method of apportionment used by the taxpayer. This amount of a partner's interest in the partnership is allocated among various limitation categories in the same manner as partnership interest expense (that is not directly allocable under § 1.861-10T) is apportioned in subdivision (i) of this paragraph (e)(4). If the partner uses the tax book value method of apportionment, the partner's interest in the partnership must be reduced, for this purpose, to the extent that the partner's basis consists of liabilities that are taken into account under section 752. Under either the tax book value or fair market value method of apportionment, for purposes of this section only, the value of the partner's interest in the partnership must be reduced by the principal amount of any indebtedness of the partner the interest on which is directly allocated to its partnership interest under § 1.861-10T.
(5)
Tiered partnerships.
If a partnership is a partner in another partnership, the distributive share of interest expense of a lower-tier partnership that is subject to the rules of paragraph (e)(4) shall not be reapportioned in the hands of any higher-tier partner. However, the distributive share of interest expense of lower-tier partnership that is subject to the rules of paragraph (e) (2) or (3) shall be apportioned by the partner of the higher-tier partnership or by any higher-tier partnership to which the rules of paragraph
(e)(4) apply, taking into account the partner's indirect pro rata share of the lower-tier partnership's income or assets.
(6)
Example
—(i)
Facts.
A, B, and C are partners in a limited partnership. A is a corporate general partner, owns a 5 percent interest in the partnership, and has an adjusted basis in its partnership interest, determined without regard to section 752 of the Code, of $5. A's investment in the partnership is not held in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's active trade or business, as defined in § 1.904-7(i)(2). B, a corporate limited partner, owns a 70 percent interest in the partnership, and has an adjusted basis in its partnership interest, determined without regard to section 752 of the Code, of $70. C is an individual limited partner, owns a 25 percent interest in the partnership, and has an adjusted basis in the partnership interest, determined without regard to section 752 of the Code, of $25. The partners' interests in the profits and losses of the partnership conform to their respective interests. None of the interest expense incurred directly by any of the partners is directly allocable to their partnership interest under § 1.861-10T. The ABC partnership's sole assets are two apartment buildings, one domestic and the other foreign. The domestic building has an adjusted inside basis of $600 and the foreign building has an adjusted inside basis of $500. Each of the buildings is subject to a nonrecourse liability in the amount of $500. The ABC partnership's total interest expense for the taxable year is $120, both nonrecourse liabilities bearing interest at the rate of 12 percent. The indebtedness on the domestic building qualifies for direct allocation under the rules of § 1.861-10T. The indebtedness on the foreign building does not so qualify. The partnership incurred no foreign taxes. The partnership's gross income for the taxable year is $360, consisting of $100 in foreign source income and $260 in domestic source income. Under § 1.752-1(e), the nonrecourse liabilities of the partnership are allocated among the partners according to their share of the partnership profits. Accordingly, the adjusted basis of A, B, and C in their respective partnership interests (for other than apportionment purposes) is, respectively, $55, $770, and $275.
(ii)
Determination of the amount of partnership interest expense that is subject to allocation and apportionment.
Interest on the nonrecourse loan on the domestic building is, under § 1.861-10T, directly allocable to income from that investment. The interest expense is therefore directly allocable to domestic income. Interest on the nonrecourse loan on the foreign building is not directly allocable. The interest expense is therefore subject to allocation and apportionment. Thus, $60 of interest expense is directly allocable to domestic income and $60 of interest expense is subject to allocation and apportionment.
(iii)
Analysis for Partner A.
A's distributive share of the partnership's gross income is $18, which consists of $5 in foreign source income and $13 in domestic source income. A's distributive share of the ABC interest expense is $6, $3 of which is directly allocable to domestic income and $3 of which is subject to apportionment. After direct allocation of qualifying interest expense, A's distributive share of the partnership's gross income consists of $5 in foreign source income and $10 in domestic source income. Because A is a less than 10 percent corporate partner, A's distributive share of any foreign source partnership income is considered to be passive income. Accordingly, in apportioning the $3 of partnership interest expense that is subject to apportionment on a gross income method, one-third ($1) is apportioned to foreign source passive income and two-thirds ($2) is apportioned to domestic source income. In apportioning its other interest expense, A uses the tax book value method. A's adjusted basis in A's partnership interest ($55) includes A's share of the partnership's liabilities ($50), which are included in basis under section 752. For purposes of apportioning other interest expense, A's adjusted basis in the partnership must be reduced to the extent of such liabilities. Thus, A's adjusted basis in the partnership, for purposes of apportionment, is $5. For the purpose of apportioning A's other interest expense, this $5 in basis is characterized one-third as a foreign passive asset and
two-thirds as a domestic asset, which is the ratio determined in paragraph (e)(4)(i).
(iv)
Analysis for Partner B.
B's distributive share of the ABC interest expense is $84, $42 of which is directly allocable to domestic income and $42 of which is subject to apportionment. As a corporate limited partner whose interest in the partnership is 10 percent or more, B is subject to the rules of paragraph (e)(2) and paragraph (f) of this section. These rules require that a corporate partner apportion its distributive share of partnership interest expense at the partner level on the asset method described in paragraph (g) of this section by reference to its corporate assets, which include, for this purpose, 70 percent of the partnership's assets, adjusted in the manner described in § 1.861-10T(e) to reflect directly allocable interest expense.
(v)
Analysis for Partner C.
C's distributive share of the ABC interest expense is $30, $15 of which is directly allocable to domestic income and $15 of which is subject to apportionment. As an individual limited partner whose interest in the partnership is 10 percent or more, C is subject to the rules of paragraph (e)(3) of this section. These rules require that an individual's share of partnership interest expense be classified under regulations issued under section 163(h) and then apportioned under the rules applicable to individuals, which are set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.
(7)
Foreign partners.
The distributive share of partnership interest expense of a nonresident alien who is a partner in a partnership shall be considered to be connected with effectively connected income based on the percentage of the assets of the partnership that generate effectively connected income. No interest expense directly incurred by the partner may be allocated and apportioned to effectively connected income derived by the partnership.

(ii)
Manner of election.
The election to use the asset method described in paragraph (g) of this section or the modified gross income method described in paragraph (j) of this section may be made either by the controlled foreign corporation or by the controlling United States shareholders on behalf of the controlled foreign corporation. The term “controlling United States shareholders” means those United States shareholders (as defined in section 951(b)) who, in aggregate, own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) greater than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the foreign corporation entitled to vote. In the case of a controlled foreign corporation in which the United States shareholders own stock representing more than 50 percent of the value of the stock in such corporation, but less than 50 percent of the combined voting power of all classes of stock in such corporation, the term “controlling United States shareholders” means all the United States shareholders (as defined in section 951(b)) who own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) stock of the controlled foreign corporation. All United States shareholders are bound by the election of either the controlled foreign corporation or the controlling United States shareholders. For guidance relating to the time and manner of this election,
see
§ 1.861-9(f)(3)(ii).
(iii)
Consistency requirement.
The same method of apportionment must be employed by all controlled foreign corporations in which a United States taxpayer and the members of its affiliated group (as defined in § 1.861-11T(d)) constitute controlling United States shareholders. A controlled foreign corporation that is required by this paragraph (f)(3)(iii) to utilize a particular method of apportionment must do so with respect to all United States shareholders.
(iv)
Stock characterization.
Pursuant to § 1.861-12T(c)(2), the stock of a controlled foreign corporation shall be characterized in the hands of any
United States shareholder using the same method that the controlled foreign corporation uses to apportion its interest expense.
(4)
Noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-9(f)(4).
(5)
Other relevant provisions.
Affiliated groups of corporations are subject to special rules set forth in § 1.861-11T. Section 1.861-12T sets forth rules relating to basis adjustments for stock in nonaffiliated 10 percent owned corporations, special rules relating to the consideration and characterization of certain assets in the apportionment of interest expense, and to other special rules pertaining to the apportionment of interest expense. Section 1.861-13T contains transition rules limiting the application of the rules of §§ 1.861-8T through 1.861-12T, which are otherwise applicable to taxable years beginning after 1986. In the case of an affiliated group of corporations as defined in § 1.861-11T(d), any reference in §§ 1.861-8T through 1.861-13T to the “taxpayer” with respect to the allocation and apportionment of interest expense generally denotes the entire affiliated group of corporations and not the separate members thereof, unless the context otherwise requires.
(g)
Asset method
—(1)
In general.
(i) Under the asset method, the taxpayer apportions interest expense to the various statutory groupings based on the average total value of assets within each such grouping for the taxable year, as determined under the asset valuation rules of this paragraph (g)(1) and paragraph (g)(2) of this section and the asset characterization rules of paragraph (g)(3) of this section and § 1.861-12T. Except to the extent otherwise provided (
see, e.g.,
paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section), taxpayers must apportion interest expense only on the basis of asset values and may not apportion any interest deduction on the basis of gross income.
(ii) For further guidance, see § 1.861-9(g)(1)(ii) through (g)(2)(i).
(iii)-(v) [Reserved]
(2)(i)-(ii) [Reserved]
(iii)
Adjustment for directly allocated interest.
Prior to averaging, the year-end value of any asset to which interest expense is directly allocated during the current taxable year under the rules of § 1.861-10T (b) or (c) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the percentage of the principal amount of indebtedness outstanding at year-end equal to the percentage of all interest on the debt for the taxable year that is directly allocated.
(iv)
Assets in intercompany transactions.
In the application of the asset method described in this paragraph (g), the tax book value of assets transferred between affiliated corporations in intercompany transactions shall be determined without regard to the gain or loss that is deferred under the regulations issued under section 1502.
(v) [Reserved]
(3)
Characterization of assets.
Assets are characterized for purposes of this section according to the source and type of the income that they generate, have generated, or may reasonably be expected to generate. The physical location of assets is not relevant to this determination. Subject to the special rules of paragraph (h) concerning the application of the fair market value method of apportionment, the value of assets within each statutory grouping and the residual grouping at the beginning and end of each year shall be determined by dividing the taxpayer's assets into three types—
(i)
Single category assets.
Assets that generate income that is exclusively within a single statutory grouping or the residual grouping;
(ii)
Multiple category assets.
Assets that generate income within more than one grouping of income (statutory or residual); and
(iii)
Assets without directly identifiable yield.
Assets that produce no directly identifiable income yield or that contribute equally to the generation of all the income of the taxpayer (such as assets used in general and administrative functions).
Single category assets are directly attributable to the relevant statutory or residual grouping of income. In order to attribute multiple category assets to the relevant groupings of income, the income yield of each such asset for the taxable year must be analyzed to determine the proportion of gross income generated by it within each relevant grouping. The value of each asset
is then prorated among the relevant groupings of income according to their respective proportions of gross income. The value of each asset without directly identifiable income yield must be identified. However, because prorating the value of such assets cannot alter the ratio of assets within the various groupings of income (as determined by reference to the single and multiple category assets), they are not taken into account in determining that ratio. Special asset characterization rules that are set forth in § 1.861-12T. An example demonstrating the application of the asset method is set forth in § 1.861-12T(d).
(h)
Fair market value method.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-9(h).
(1)
Determination of values
—(i)
Valuation of group assets.
The taxpayer shall first determine the aggregate value of the assets of the taxpayer on the last day of its taxable year without excluding the value of stock in foreign subsidiaries or any other asset. In the case of a publicly traded corporation, this determination shall be equal to the aggregate trading value of the taxpayer's stock traded on established securities markets at year-end increased by the taxpayer's year-end liabilities to unrelated persons and its pro rata share of year-end liabilities of all related persons owed to unrelated persons. In determining whether persons are related, § 1.861-8T(c)(2) shall apply. In the case of a corporation that is not publicly traded, this determination shall be made by reference to the capitalization of corporate earnings, in accordance with the rules of Rev. Rul. 68-609. In either case, control premium shall not be taken into account.
(ii)
Valuation of tangible assets.
The taxpayer shall determine the value of all assets held by the taxpayer and its pro rata share of assets held by other related persons on the last day of its taxable year, excluding stock or indebtedness in such persons, any intangible property as defined in section 936(h)(3)(B), or goodwill or going concern value intangibles. Such valuations shall be made using generally accepted valuation techniques. For this purpose, assets may be combined into reasonable groupings. Statistical methods of valuation may only be used in connection with fungible property, such as commodities. The value of stock in any corporation that is not a related person shall be determined under the rules of paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, except that no liabilities shall be taken into account.
(iii)
Computation of intangible asset value.
The value of the intangible assets of the taxpayer and of intangible assets of all related persons attributable to the taxpayer's ownership in related persons is equal to the amount obtained by subtracting the amount determined under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section from the amount determined under paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section.
(2)
Apportionment of intangible asset value.
The value of the intangible assets determined under paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section is apportioned among the taxpayer and all related persons in proportion to the net income before interest expense of the taxpayer and the taxpayer's pro rata share of the net income before interest expense of each related person held by the taxpayer, excluding income that is passive under § 1.904-4(b). For this purpose, net income is determined before reduction for income taxes. Net income of the taxpayer and of related persons shall be computed without regard to dividends or interest received from any person that is related to the taxpayer.
(3)
Characterization of affiliated group's portion of intangible asset value.
The portion of the value of intangible assets of the taxpayer and related persons that is apportioned to the taxpayer under paragraph (h)(2) of this section is characterized on the basis of net income before interest expense, as determined under paragraph (h)(2) of this section, of the taxpayer within each statutory or residual grouping of income.

(5) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.861-9(h)(5).
(6)
Adjustments for apportioning related person expenses.
For purposes of apportioning expenses of a related person, the value of stock in a second related person as otherwise determined under paragraph (h)(4) of this section (which
is determined on the basis of the taxpayer's percentage ownership interest in the second related person) shall be increased to reflect the first related person's percentage ownership interest in the second related person to the extent it is larger.

# Example.
Assume that a taxpayer owns 80 percent of CFC1, which owns 100 percent of CFC2. The value of CFC1 is determined generally under paragraph (h)(4) on the basis of the taxpayer's 80 percent indirect interest in CFC2. For purposes of apportioning expenses of CFC1, 100 percent of the stock of CFC1 must be taken into account. Therefore, the value of CFC2 stock in the hands of CFC1 shall equal the value of CFC2 stock in the hands of CFC1 as determined under paragraph (h)(4) of this section, increased by 25 percent of such amount to reflect the fact that CFC1 owns 100 percent and not 80 percent of CFC2.
(i) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.861-9(i).
(j)
Modified gross income method.
Subject to rules set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, the interest expense of a controlled foreign corporation may be allocated according to the following rules.
(1)
Single-tier controlled foreign corporation.
In the case of a controlled foreign corporation that does not hold stock in any lower-tier controlled foreign corporation, the interest expense of the controlled foreign corporation shall be apportioned based on its gross income.
(2)
Multiple vertically owned controlled foreign corporations.
In the case of a controlled foreign corporation that holds stock in any lower-tier controlled foreign corporation, the interest expense of that controlled foreign corporation and such upper-tier controlled foreign corporation shall be apportioned based on the following methodology:
(i)
Step 1.
Commencing with the lowest-tier controlled foreign corporation in the chain, allocate and apportion its interest expense based on its gross income as provided in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, yielding gross income in each grouping net of interest expense.
(ii)
Step 2.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-9(j)(2)(ii).
(k)
Effective/applicability dates.
In general, the rules of this section apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. Paragraphs (b)(2) (concerning the treatment of certain foreign currency) and (d)(2) (concerning the treatment of interest incurred by nonresident aliens) of this section are applicable for taxable years commencing after December 31, 1988. Taxpayers may also apply paragraph (b)(6) of this section to any gain that was realized on any transaction described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section that was entered into after September 14, 1988, and on or before August 11, 1989, if the taxpayer can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that substantially all of the arrangements described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section to which the taxpayer became a party during that interim period were identified on the taxpayer's books and records with the liabilities of the taxpayer in a substantially contemporaneous manner and that all losses and expenses that are subject to the rules of paragraph (b)(6) of this section were treated in the same manner as interest expense. For this purpose, arrangements that were identified in a substantially contemporaneous manner with the taxpayer's assets shall be ignored. For further guidance,
see
§ 1.861-9(k).

§ 1.861-10
Special allocations of interest expense.
(a)
In general.
This section applies to all taxpayers and provides exceptions to the rules of § 1.861-9 that require the allocation and apportionment of interest expense based on all assets of all members of the affiliated group. Section 1.861-10T(b) provides rules for the direct allocation of interest expense to the income generated by certain assets that are subject to qualified nonrecourse indebtedness. Section 1.861-10T(c) provides rules for the direct allocation of interest expense to income generated by certain assets that are acquired in an integrated financial transaction. Section 1.861-10T(d) provides special rules that apply to all transactions described in § 1.861-10T(b) and
(c). Paragraph (e) of this section requires the direct allocation of third-party interest expense of an affiliated group to such group's investments in related controlled foreign corporations in cases involving excess related person indebtedness (as defined therein). See also § 1.861-9T(b)(5), which requires the direct allocation of amortizable bond premium. Paragraph (f) of this section provides a special rule for certain regulated utility companies. Paragraph (g) of this section is reserved. Paragraph (h) of this section sets forth applicability dates.
(b)-(d) [Reserved]
(e)
Treatment of certain related group indebtedness
—(1)
In general.
If, for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1991, a U.S. shareholder (as defined in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section) has both—
(i) Excess related group indebtedness (as determined under Step One in paragraph (e)(2) of this section) and
(ii) Excess U.S. shareholder indebtedness (as determined under Step Two in paragraph (e)(3) of this section), the U.S. shareholder shall allocate, to its gross income in the various separate limitation categories described in section 904(d)(1), a portion of its interest expense paid or accrued to any obligee who is not a member of the affiliated group (as defined in § 1.861-11T(d)) of the U.S. shareholder (“third party interest expense”), excluding amounts allocated under paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 1.861-10T. The amount of third party interest expense so allocated shall equal the total amount of interest income derived by the U.S. shareholder during the year from related group indebtedness, multiplied by the ratio of the lesser of the foregoing two amounts of excess indebtedness for the year to related group indebtedness for the year. This amount of third party interest expense is allocated as described in Step Three in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
(2)
Step One: Excess related group indebtedness.
(i) The excess related group indebtedness of a U.S. shareholder for the year equals the amount by which its related group indebtedness for the year exceeds its allowable related group indebtedness for the year.
(ii) The “related group indebtedness” of the U.S. shareholder is the average of the aggregate amounts at the beginning and end of the year of indebtedness owed to the U.S. shareholder by each controlled foreign corporation which is a related person (as defined in paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section) with respect to the U.S. shareholder.
(iii) The “allowable related group indebtedness” of a U.S. shareholder for the year equals—
(A) The average of the aggregate values at the beginning and end of the year of the assets (including stock holdings in and obligations of related persons, other than related controlled foreign corporations) of each related controlled foreign corporation, multiplied by
(B) The foreign base period ratio of the U.S. shareholder for the year.
(iv) The “foreign base period ratio” of the U.S. shareholder for the year is the average of the related group debt-to-asset ratios of the U.S. shareholder for each taxable year comprising the foreign base period for the current year (each a “base year”). For this purpose, however, the related group debt-to-asset ratio of the U.S. shareholder for any base year may not exceed 110 percent of the foreign base period ratio for that base year. This limitation shall not apply with respect to any of the five taxable years chosen as initial base years by the U.S. shareholder under paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section or with respect to any base year for which the related group debt-to-asset ratio does not exceed 0.10.
(v)(A) The foreign base period for any current taxable year (except as described in paragraphs (e)(2)(v) (B) and (C) of this section) shall consist of the five taxable years immediately preceding the current year.
(B) The U.S. shareholder may choose as foreign base periods for all of its first five taxable years for which this paragraph (e) is effective the following alternative base periods:
(
1
) For the first effective taxable year, the 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986 taxable years;
(
2
) For the second effective taxable year, the 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986 taxable years and the first effective taxable year;
(
3
) For the third effective taxable year, the 1984, 1985 and 1986 taxable years and the first and second effective taxable years;
(
4
) For the fourth effective taxable year, the 1985 and 1986 taxable years and the first, second and third effective taxable years; and
(
5
) For the fifth effective taxable year, the 1986 taxable year and the first, second, third and fourth effective taxable years.
(C) If, however, the U.S. shareholder does not choose, under paragraph (e)(10)(ii) of this section, to apply this paragraph (e) to one or more taxable years beginning before January 1, 1992, the U.S. shareholder may not include within any foreign base period the taxable year immediately preceding the first effective taxable year. Thus, for example, a U.S. shareholder for which the first effective taxable year is the taxable year beginning on October 1, 1992, may not include the taxable year beginning on October 1, 1991, in any foreign base period. Assuming that the U.S. shareholder does not elect the alternative base periods described in paragraph (e)(2)(v)(B) of this section, the initial foreign base period for the U.S. shareholder will consist of the taxable years beginning on October 1 of 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1990. The foreign base period for the U.S. shareholder for the following taxable year, beginning on October 1, 1993, will consist of the taxable years beginning on October 1 of 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1992.
(D) If the U.S. shareholder chooses the base periods described in paragraph (e)(2)(v)(B) of this section as foreign base periods, it must make a similar election under paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) of this section with respect to its U.S. base periods.
(vi) The “related group debt-to-asset ratio” of a U.S. shareholder for a year is the ratio between—
(A) The related group indebtedness of the U.S. shareholder for the year (as determined under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section); and
(B) The average of the aggregate values at the beginning and end of the year of the assets (including stock holdings in and obligations of related persons, other than related controlled foreign corporations) of each related controlled foreign corporation.
(vii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, a U.S. shareholder is considered to have no excess related group indebtedness for the year if—
(A) Its related group indebtedness for the year does not exceed its allowable related group indebtedness for the immediately preceding year (as determined under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section); or
(B) Its related group debt-to-asset ratio (as determined under paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of this section) for the year does not exceed 0.10.
(3)
Step Two: Excess U.S. shareholder indebtedness.
(i) The excess indebtedness of a U.S. shareholder for the year equals the amount by which its unaffiliated indebtedness for the year exceeds its allowable indebtedness for the year.
(ii) The “unaffiliated indebtedness” of the U.S. shareholder is the average of the aggregate amounts at the beginning and end of the year of indebtedness owed by the U.S. shareholder to any obligee, other than a member of the affiliated group (as defined in § 1.861-11T(d)) of the U.S shareholder.
(iii) The “allowable indebtedness” of a U.S. shareholder for the year equals—
(A) The average of the aggregate values at the beginning and end of the year of the assets of the U.S. shareholder (including stock holdings in and obligations of related controlled foreign corporations, but excluding stock holdings in and obligations of members of the affiliated group (as defined in § 1.861-11T(d)) of the U.S. shareholder), reduced by the amount of the excess related group indebtedness of the U.S. shareholder for the year (as determined under Step One in paragraph (e)(2) of this section), multiplied by
(B) The U.S. base period ratio of the U.S. shareholder for the year.
(iv) The “U.S. base period ratio” of the U.S. shareholder for the year is the average of the debt-to-asset ratios of the U.S. shareholder for each taxable year comprising the U.S. base period for the current year (each a “base year”). For this purpose, however, the
debt-to-asset ratio of the U.S. shareholder for any base year may not exceed 110 percent of the U.S. base period ratio for that base year. This limitation shall not apply with respect to any of the five taxable years chosen as initial base years by the U.S. shareholder under paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section or with respect to any base year for which of the debt-to-asset ratio does not exceed 0.10.
(v)(A) The U.S. base period for any current taxable year (except as described in paragraphs (e)(3)(v) (B) and (C) of this section) shall consist of the five taxable years immediately preceding the current year.
(B) The U.S. shareholder may choose as U.S. base periods for all of its first five taxable years for which this paragraph (e) is effective the following alternative base periods:
(
1
) For the first effective taxable year, the 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986 taxable years;
(
2
) For the second effective taxable year, the 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986 taxable years and the first effective taxable year;
(
3
) For the third effective taxable year, the 1984, 1985 and 1986 taxable years and the first and second effective taxable years;
(
4
) For the fourth effective taxable year, the 1985 and 1986 taxable years and the first, second and third effective taxable years; and
(
5
) For the fifth effective taxable year, the 1986 taxable year and the first, second, third and fourth effective taxable years.
(C) If, however, the U.S. shareholder does not choose, under paragraph (e)(10)(ii) of this section, to apply this paragraph (e) to one or more taxable years beginning before January 1, 1992, the U.S. shareholder may not include within any U.S. base period the taxable year immediately preceding the first effective taxable year. Thus, for example, a U.S. shareholder for which the first effective taxable year is the taxable year beginning on October 1, 1992, may not include the taxable year beginning on October 1, 1991, in any U.S. base period. Assuming that the U.S. shareholder does not elect the alternative base periods described in paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) of this section, the initial U.S. base period for the U.S. shareholder will consist of the taxable years beginning on October 1, of 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1990. The U.S. base period for the U.S. shareholder for the following taxable year, beginning on October 1, 1993, will consist of the taxable years beginning on October 1, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1992.
(D) If the U.S. shareholder chooses the base periods described in paragraph (e)(3)(v)(B) of this section as U.S. base periods, it must make a similar election under paragraph (e)(2)(v)(B) of this section with respect to its foreign base periods.
(vi) The “debt-to-asset ratio” of a U.S. shareholder for a year is the ratio between—
(A) The unaffiliated indebtedness of the U.S. shareholder for the year (as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section); and
(B) The average of the aggregate values at the beginning and end of the year of the assets of the U.S. shareholder. For this purpose, the assets of the U.S. shareholder include stock holdings in and obligations of related controlled foreign corporations but do not include stock holdings in and obligations of members of the affiliated group (as defined in § 1.861-11T(d)).
(vii) A U.S. shareholder is considered to have no excess indebtedness for the year if its debt-to-asset ratio (as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this section) for the year does not exceed 0.10.
(4)
Step Three: Allocation of third party interest expense.
(i) A U.S. shareholder shall allocate to its gross income in the various separate limitation categories described in section 904(d)(1) a portion of its third party interest expense incurred during the year equal in amount to the interest income derived by the U.S. shareholder during the year from allocable related group indebtedness.
(ii) The “allocable related group indebtedness” of a U.S. shareholder for any year is an amount of related group indebtedness equal to the lesser of—
(A) The excess related group indebtedness of the U.S. shareholder for the year (determined under Step One in paragraph (e)(2) of this section); or
(B) The excess U.S. shareholder indebtedness for the year (determined
under Step Two in paragraph (e)(3) of this section).
(iii) The amount of interest income derived by a U.S. shareholder from allocable related group indebtedness during the year equals the total amount of interest income derived by the U.S. shareholder during the year with respect to related group indebtedness, multiplied by the ratio of allocable related group indebtedness for the year to the aggregate amount of related group indebtedness for the year.
(iv) The portion of third party interest expense described in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section shall be allocated in proportion to the relative average amounts of related group indebtedness held by the U.S. shareholder in each separate limitation category during the year. The remaining portion of third party interest expense of the U.S. shareholder for the year shall be apportioned as provided in §§ 1.861-8T through 1.861-13T, excluding paragraph (e) of § 1.861-10T and this paragraph (e).
(v) The average amount of related group indebtedness held by the U.S. shareholder in each separate limitation category during the year equals the average of the aggregate amounts of such indebtedness in each separate limitation category at the beginning and end of the year. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), each debt obligation of a related controlled foreign corporation held by the U.S. shareholder at the beginning or end of the year is attributed to separate limitation categories in the same manner as the stock of the obligor would be attributed under the rules of § 1.861-12T(c)(3), whether or not such stock is held directly by the U.S. shareholder.
(vi) The amount of third party interest expense of a U.S. shareholder allocated pursuant to this paragraph (e)(4) shall not exceed the total amount of the third party interest expense of the U.S. shareholder for the year (excluding any third party interest expense allocated under paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 1.861-10T).
(5)
Definitions.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the following terms shall have the following meanings.
(i)
U.S. shareholder.
The term “U.S. shareholder” has the same meaning as the term “United States shareholder” when used in section 957, except that, in the case of a United States shareholder that is a member of an affiliated group (as defined in § 1.861-11T(d)), the entire affiliated group is considered to constitute a single U.S. shareholder.
(ii)
Related person.
For the definition of the term “related person”, see § 1.861-8T(c)(2). A controlled foreign corporation is considered “related” to a U.S. shareholder if it is a related person with respect to the U.S. shareholder.
(6)
Determination of asset values.
A U.S. shareholder shall determine the values of the assets of each related controlled foreign corporation (for purposes of Step One in paragraph (e)(2) of this section) and the assets of the U.S. shareholder (for purposes of Step Two in paragraph (e)(3) of this section) for any year in accordance with the valuation method (tax book value or fair market value) elected for that year pursuant to § 1.861-9T(g). However, solely for purposes of this paragraph (e), a U.S. shareholder may instead choose to determine the values of the assets of all related controlled foreign corporations by reference to their values as reflected on Forms 5471 (the annual information return with respect to each related controlled foreign corporation), subject to the translation rules of paragraph (e)(8)(i) of this section. This method of valuation may be used only if the taxable years of each of the related controlled foreign corporations begin with, or no more than one month earlier than, the taxable year of the U.S. shareholder. Once chosen for a taxable year, this method of valuation must be used in each subsequent taxable year and may be changed only with the consent of the Commissioner.
(7)
Adjustments to asset value.
For purposes of apportioning remaining interest expense under § 1.861-9T, a U.S. shareholder shall reduce (but not below zero) the value of its assets for the year (as determined under § 1.861-9T (g) (3) or (h)) by an amount equal to the allocable related group indebtedness of the U.S. shareholder for the year (as determined under Step Three in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section). This reduction is allocated among assets in each separate limitation category in proportion to the average amount of related group
indebtedness held by the U.S. shareholder in each separate limitation category during the year (as determined under Step Three in paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this section).
(8)
Special rules
—(i)
Exchange rates.
All indebtedness amounts and asset values (including current year and base year amounts and values) denominated in a foreign currency shall be translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate for the current year. The exchange rate for the current year may be determined under any reasonable method (
e.g.,
average of month-end exchange rates for each month in the current year) if it is consistently applied to the current year and all base years. Once chosen for a taxable year, a method for determining an exchange rate must be used in each subsequent taxable year and will be treated as a method of accounting for purposes of section 446. A taxpayer may apply a different translation rule only with the prior consent of the Commissioner. In this regard, the Commissioner will be guided by the extent to which a different rule would reduce the comparability of dollar amounts of indebtedness and dollar asset values for the base years and the current year.
(ii)
Exempt assets.
Solely for purposes of this paragraph (e), any exempt assets otherwise excluded under section 864(e)(3) and § 1.861-8T(d) shall be included as assets of the U.S. shareholder or related controlled foreign corporation.
(iii)
Exclusion of certain directly allocated indebtedness and assets.
Qualified nonrecourse indebtedness (as defined in § 1.861-10T(b)(2)) and indebtedness incurred in connection with an integrated financial transaction (as defined in § 1.861-10T(c)(2)) shall be excluded from U.S. shareholder indebtedness and related group indebtedness. In addition, assets which are the subject of qualified nonrecourse indebtedness or integrated financial transactions shall be excluded from the assets of the U.S. shareholder and each related controlled foreign corporation.
(iv)
Exclusion of certain receivables.
Receivables between related controlled foreign corporations (or between members of the affiliated group constituting the U.S. shareholder) shall be excluded from the assets of the related controlled foreign corporation (or affiliated group member) holding such receivables. See also § 1.861-11T(e)(1).
(v)
Classification of loans between controlled foreign corporations.
In determining the amount of related group indebtedness for any taxable year, loans outstanding from one controlled foreign corporation to a related controlled foreign corporation are not treated as related group indebtedness. For purposes of determining the foreign base period ratio under paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section for a taxable year that ends on or after November 2, 2020, the rules of this paragraph (e)(8)(v) apply to determine the related group debt-to-asset ratio in each taxable year included in the foreign base period, including in taxable years that end before November 2, 2020.
(vi)
Classification of hybrid stock.
In determining the amount of its related group indebtedness for any taxable year, a U.S. shareholder must not treat stock in a related controlled foreign corporation as related group indebtedness, regardless of whether the related controlled foreign corporation claims a deduction for interest under foreign law for distributions on such stock. For purposes of determining the foreign base period ratio under paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section for a taxable year that ends on or after December 4, 2018, the rules of this paragraph (e)(8)(vi) apply to determine the related group debt-to-asset ratio in each taxable year included in the foreign base period, including in taxable years that end before December 4, 2018.
(9)
Corporate events
—(i)
Initial acquisition of a controlled foreign corporation.
If the foreign base period of the U.S. shareholder for any year includes a base year in which the U.S. shareholder did not hold stock in any related controlled foreign corporation, then, in computing the foreign base period ratio, the related group debt-to-asset ratio of the U.S. shareholder for any such base year shall be deemed to be 0.10.
(ii)
Incorporation of U.S. shareholder
—(A)
Nonapplication.
This paragraph (e) does not apply to the first taxable year of the U.S. shareholder. However, this
paragraph (e) does apply to all following years, including years in which later members of the affiliated group may be incorporated.
(B)
Foreign and U.S. base period ratios.
In computing the foreign and U.S. base period ratios, the foreign and U.S. base periods of the U.S. shareholder shall be considered to be only the period prior to the current year that the U.S. shareholder was in existence if this prior period is less than five taxable years.
(iii)
Acquisition of additional corporations.
(A) If a U.S. shareholder acquires (directly or indirectly) stock of a foreign or domestic corporation which, by reason of the acquisition, then becomes a related controlled foreign corporation or a member of the affiliated group, then in determining excess related group indebtedness or excess U.S. shareholder indebtedness, the indebtedness and assets of the acquired corporation shall be taken into account only at the end of the acquisition year and in following years. Thus, amounts of indebtedness and assets and the various debt-to-asset ratios of the U.S. shareholder existing at the beginning of the acquisition year or relating to preceding years are not recalculated to take account of indebtedness and assets of the acquired corporation existing as of dates before the end of the year. If, however, a major acquisition is made within the last three months of the year and a substantial distortion of values for the year would otherwise result, the taxpaper must take into account the average values of the acquired indebtedness and assets weighted to reflect the time such indebtedness is owed and such assets are held by the taxpayer during the year.
(B) In the case of a reverse acquisition subject to this paragraph (e)(9), the rules of § 1.1502-75(d)(3) apply in determining which corporations are the acquiring and acquired corporations. For this purpose, whether corporations are affiliated is determined under § 1.861-11T(d).
(C) If the stock of a U.S. shareholder is acquired by (and, by reason of such acquisition, the U.S. shareholder becomes affiliated with) a corporation described below, then such U.S. shareholder shall be considered to have acquired such corporation for purposes of the application of the rules of this paragraph (e). A corporation to which this paragraph (e)(9)(iii)(C) applies is—
(
1
) A corporation which is not affiliated with any other corporation (other than other similarly described corporation); and
(
2
) Substantially all of the assets of which consist of cash, securities and stock.
(iv)
Election to compute base period ratios by including acquired corporations.
A U.S. shareholder may choose, solely for purposes of paragraph (e)(9) (i) and (iii) of this section, to compute its foreign and U.S. base period ratios for the acquisition year and all subsequent years by taking into account the indebtedness and asset values of the acquired corporation or corporations (including related group indebtedness owed to a former U.S. shareholder) at the beginning of the acquisition year and in each of the five base years preceding the acquisition year. This election, if made for an acquisition, must be made for all other acquisitions occurring during the same taxable year or initiated in that year and concluded in the following year.
(v)
Dispositions.
If a U.S. shareholder disposes of stock of a foreign or domestic corporation which, by reason of the disposition, then ceases to be a related controlled foreign corporation or a member of the affiliated group (unless liquidated or merged into a related corporation), in determining excess related group indebtedness or excess U.S. shareholder indebtedness, the indebtedness and assets of the divested corporation shall be taken into account only at the beginning of the disposition year and for the relevant preceding years. Thus, amounts of indebtedness and assets and the various debt-to-asset ratios of the U.S. shareholder existing at the end of the year or relating to following years are not affected by indebtedness and assets of the divested corporation existing as of dates after the beginning of the year. If, however, a major disposition is made within the first three months of the year and a substantial distortion of values for the year would otherwise result, the taxpayer must take into account the average values of the divested indebtedness and assets weighted to reflect the time
such indebtedness is owed and such assets are held by the taxpayer during the year.
(vi)
Election to compute base period ratios by excluding divested corporations.
A U.S. shareholder may choose, solely for purposes of paragraph (e) (9) (v) and (vii) of this section, to compute its foreign and U.S. base period ratios for the disposition year and all subsequent years without taking into account the indebtedness and asset values of the divested corporation or corporations at the beginning of the disposition year and in each of the five base years preceding the disposition year. This election, if made for a disposition, must be made for all other dispositions occurring during the same taxable year or initiated in that year and concluded in the following year.
(vii)
Section 355 transactions.
A U.S. corporation which becomes a separate U.S. shareholder as a result of a distribution of its stock to which section 355 applies shall be considered—
(A) As disposed of by the U.S. shareholder of the affiliated group of which the distributing corporation is a member, with this disposition subject to the rules of paragraphs (e) (9) (v) and (vi) of this section; and
(B) As having the same related group debt-to-asset ratio and debt-to-asset ratio as the distributing U.S. shareholder in each year preceding the year of distribution for purposes of applying this paragraph (e) to the year of distribution and subsequent years of the distributed corporation.
(10) [Reserved]
(11) The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (e):

# Example.
(i)
Facts.
X, a domestic corporation, elects to apply this paragraph (e) to its 1990 tax year. X has a calendar taxable year and apportions its interest expense on the basis of the tax book value of its assets. In 1990, X incurred deductible third-party interest expense of $24,960 on an average amount of indebtedness (determined on the basis of beginning-of-year and end-of-year amounts) of $249,600. X manufactures widgets, all of which are sold in the United States. X owns all of the stock of Y, a controlled foreign corporation that also has a calendar taxable year and is also engaged in the manufacture and sale of widgets. Y has no earnings and profits or deficit of earnings and profits attributable to taxable years prior to 1987. X's total assets and their average tax book values (determined on the basis of beginning-of-year and end-of-year tax book values) for 1990 are:
Asset
Average tax book value
Plant and equipment
$315,000
Corporate headquarters
60,000
Y stock
75,000
Y note
50,000
Total
500,000
Y had $25,000 of income before the deduction of any interest expense. Of this total, $5,000 is high withholding tax interest income. The remaining $20,000 is derived from widget sales, and constitutes foreign source general limitation income. Assume that Y has no deductions from gross income other than interest expense. During 1990, Y paid $5,000 of interest expense to X on the Y note and $10,000 of interest expense to third parties, giving Y total interest expense of $15,000. X elects pursuant to § 1.861-9T to apportion Y's interest expense under the gross income method prescribed in section 1.861-9T (j).
(ii)
Step 1:
Using a beginning and end of year average, X (the U.S. shareholder) held the following average amounts of indebtedness of Y and Y had the following average asset values:
1985
1986-88
1989
1990

(C) Related Group Debt-to-Asset Ratio

.13
.20
(
1
) X's “foreign base period ratio” for 1990, an average of its ratios of related group indebtedness to related group assets for 1985 through 1989, is:
(.11 + .12 + .12 + .12 + .13) / 5 = .12
(
2
) X's “allowable related group indebtedness” for 1990 is:
$250,000 × .12 = $30,000.
(
3
) X's “excess related group indebtedness” for 1990 is:
$50,000 − $30,000 = $20,000
X's related group indebtedness of $50,000 for 1990 is greater than its allowable related
group indebtedness of $24,000 for 1989 (assuming a foreign base period ratio in 1989 of .12), and X's related group debt-to-asset ratio for 1990 is .20, which is greater than the ratio of .10 described in paragraph (e)(2)(vii)(B) of this section. Therefore, X's excess related group indebtedness for 1990 remains at $20,000.
(iii)
Step 2:
Using a beginning and end of year average, X has the following average amounts of U.S. and foreign indebtedness and average asset values:
1985
1986

(2) Average value of assets of U.S. shareholder
(3) Debt-to-Asset ratio of U.S. shareholder
(a) [500,000-20,000 (excess related group indebtedness determined in Step 1)]
X's “U.S. base period ratio” for 1990 is:
(.52 + .50 + .50 + .50 + .48) / 5 = .50
X's “allowable indebtedness” for 1990 is:
$480,000 × .50 = $240,000
X's “excess U.S. shareholder indebtedness” for 1990 is:
$249,000 − $240,000 = $9,600
X's debt-to-asset ratio for 1990 is .52, which is greater than the ratio of .10 described in paragraph (e)(3)(vii) of this section. Therefore, X's excess U.S. shareholder indebtedness for 1990 remains at $9,600.
(iv)
Step 3:
(a) Since X's excess U.S. shareholder indebtedness of $9,600 is less than its excess related group indebtedness of $20,000, X's allocable related group indebtedness for 1990 is $9,600. The amount of interest received by X during 1990 on allocable related group indebtedness is:
$5,000 × $9,600 / $50,000 = $960
(b) Therefore, $960 of X's third party interest expense ($24,960) shall be allocated among various separate limitation categories in proportion to the relative average amounts of Y obligations held by X in each such category. The amount of Y obligations in each limitation category is determined in the same manner as the stock of Y would be attributed under the rules of § 1.861-12T(c)(3). Since Y's interest expense is apportioned under the gross income method prescribed in § 1.861-9T (j), the Y stock must be characterized under the gross income method described in § 1.861-12T(c)(3)(iii). Y's gross income net of interest expense is determined as follows:
Foreign source high withholding tax interest income
= $5,000 − [($15,000) multiplied by ($5,000)/($5,000 + $20,000)]
= $2,000
and
Foreign source general limitation income
= $20,000 − [($15,000) multiplied by ($20,000)/($5,000 + $20,000)]
= $8,000.
(c) Therefore, $192 [($960 × $2,000/($2,000 + $8,000)] of X's third party interest expense is allocated to foreign source high withholding tax interest income and $768 [$960 × $8,000/($2,000 + $8,000)] is allocated to foreign source general limitation income.
(v) As a result of these direct allocations, for purposes of apportioning X's remaining interest expense under § 1.861-9T, the value of X's assets generating foreign source general limitation income is reduced by the principal amount of indebtedness the interest on which is directly allocated to foreign source general limitation income ($7,680), and the value of X's assets generating foreign source high withholding tax interest income is reduced by the principal amount of indebtedness the interest on which is directly allocated to foreign source high withholding tax interest income ($1,920), determined as follows:
Reduction of X's assets generating foreign source general limitation income:
EC07OC91.002
Reduction of X's assets generating foreign source high withholding tax interest income:
EC07OC91.003
(f)
Indebtedness of certain regulated utilities.
If an automatically excepted regulated utility trade or business (as defined in § 1.163(j)-1(b)(15)(i)(A)) has qualified nonrecourse indebtedness within the meaning of the second sentence in § 1.163(j)-10(d)(2), interest expense from the indebtedness is directly allocated to the taxpayer's assets in the manner and to the extent provided in § 1.861-10T(b).
(g) [Reserved]
(h)
Applicability dates.
Except as provided in this paragraph (h), this section applies to taxable years ending on or after December 4, 2018. Paragraph (e)(8)(v) of this section applies to taxable years ending on or after November 2, 2020, and paragraph (f) of this section applies to taxable years beginning on or after December 28, 2021.
[T.D. 8410, 57 FR 13022, Apr. 15, 1992; 57 FR 28012, June 23, 1992, as amended by T.D. 9882, 84 FR 69068, Dec. 17, 2019; T.D. 9959, 87 FR 326, Jan. 4, 2022]
§ 1.861-10T
Special allocations of interest expense (temporary).
(a)
In general.
This section applies to all taxpayers and provides three exceptions to the rules of § 1.861-9T that require the allocation and apportionment of interest expense on the basis of all assets of all members of the affiliated group. Paragraph (b) of this section describes the direct allocation of interest expense to the income generated by certain assets that are subject to qualified nonrecourse indebtedness. Paragraph (c) of this section describes the direct allocation of interest expense to income generated by certain assets that are acquired in integrated financial transaction. Paragraph (d) of this section provides special rules that are applicable to all transactions described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Paragraph (e) of this section requires the direct allocation of third party interest of an affiliated group to such group's investment in related controlled foreign corporations in cases involving excess related person indebtedness (as defined therein). See also § 1.861-9T(b)(5), which requires direct allocation of amortizable bond premium.
(b)
Qualified nonrecourse indebtedness
—(1)
In general.
In the case of qualified nonrecourse indebtedness (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), the deduction for interest shall be considered directly allocable solely to the gross income which the property acquired, constructed, or improved with the proceeds of the indebtedness generates, has generated, or could reasonably be expected to generate.
(2)
Qualified nonrecourse indebtedness defined.
The term “qualified nonrecourse indebtedness” means any borrowing that is not excluded by paragraph (b)(4) of this section if:
(i) The borrowing is specifically incurred for the purpose of purchasing, constructing, or improving identified property that is either depreciable tangible personal property or real property with a useful life of more than one year or for the purpose of purchasing amortizable intangible personal property with a useful life of more than one year;
(ii) The proceeds are actually applied to purchase, construct, or improve the identified property;
(iii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) (relating to certain third party guarantees in leveraged lease transactions), the creditor can look only to the identified property (or any
lease or other interest therein) as security for payment of the principal and interest on the loan and, thus, cannot look to any other property, the borrower, or any third party with respect to repayment of principal or interest on the loan;
(iv) The cash flow from the property, as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, is reasonably expected to be sufficient in the first year of ownership as well as in each subsequent year of ownership to fulfill the terms and conditions of the loan agreement with respect to the amount and timing of payments of interest and original issue discount and periodic payments of principal in each such year; and
(v) There are restrictions in the loan agreement on the disposal or use of the property consistent with the assumptions described in subdivisions (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph (b)(2).
(3)
Cash flow defined
—(i)
In general.
The term “cash flow from the property” as used in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section means a stream of revenue (as computed under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section) substantially all of which derives directly from the property. The phrase “cash flow from the property” does not include revenue if a significant portion thereof is derived from activities such as sales, labor, services, or the use of other property. Thus, revenue derived from the sale or lease of inventory or of similar property does not constitute cash flow from the property, including plant or equipment used in the manufacture and sale or lease, or purchase and sale or lease, of such inventory or similar property. In addition, revenue derived in part from the performance of services that are not ancillary and subsidiary to the use of property does not constitute cash flow from the property.
(ii)
Self-constructed assets.
The activities associated with self-construction of assets shall be considered to constitute labor or services for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i) only if the self-constructed asset—
(A) Is constructed for the purpose of resale, or
(B) Without regard to purpose, is sold to an unrelated person within one year from the date that the property is placed in service for purposes of section 167.
(iii)
Computation of cash flow.
Cash flow is computed by subtracting cash disbursements excluding debt service from cash receipts.
(iv)
Analysis of operating costs.
[Reserved]
(v)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph may be demonstrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
In 1987, X borrows $100,000 in order to purchase an apartment building, which X then purchases. The loan is secured only by the building and the leases thereon. Annual debt service on the loan is $12,000. Annual gross rents from the building are $20,000. Annual taxes on the building are $2,000. Other expenses deductible under section 162 are $2,000. Rents are reasonably expected to remain stable or increase in subsequent years, and taxes and expenses are reasonably expected to remain proportional to gross rents in subsequent years. X provides security, maintenance, and utilities to the tenants of the building. Based on facts and circumstances, it is determined that, although services are provided to tenants, these services are ancillary and subsidiary to the occupancy of the apartments. Accordingly, the case flow of $16,000 is considered to constitute a return from the property. Furthermore, such cash flow is sufficient to fulfill the terms and conditions of the loan agreement as required by paragraph (b)(2)(iii).

# Example 2.
In 1987, X borrows funds in order to purchase a hotel, which X then purchases and operates. The loan is secured only by the hotel. Based on facts and circumstances, it is determined that the operation of the hotel involves services the value of which is significant in relation to amounts paid to occupy the rooms. Thus, a significant portion of the cash flow is derived from the performance of services incidental to the occupancy of hotel rooms. Accordingly, the cash flow from the hotel is considered not to constitute a return on or from the property.

# Example 3.
In 1987, X borrows funds in order to build a factory, which X then builds and operates. The loan is secured only by the factory and the equipment therein. Based on the facts and circumstances, it is determined that the operation of the factory involves significant expenditures for labor and raw materials. Thus, a significant portion of the cash flow is derived from labor and the processing of raw materials. Accordingly, the cash flow from the factory is considered not to constitute a return on or from the property.
(4)
Exclusions.
The term “qualified nonrecourse indebtedness” shall not include any transaction that—
(i) Lacks economic significance within the meaning of paragraph (b)(5) of this section;
(ii) Involves cross collateralization within the meaning of paragraph (b)(6) of this section;
(iii) Except in the case of a leveraged lease described in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section, involves credit enhancement within the meaning of paragraph (b)(7) of this section or, with respect to loans made on or after October 14, 1988, does not under the terms of the loan documents, prohibit the acquisition by the holder of bond insurance or similar forms of credit enhancement;
(iv) Involves the purchase of inventory;
(v) Involves the purchase of any financial asset, including stock in a corporation, an interest in a partnership or a trust, or the debt obligation of any obligor (although interest incurred in order to purchase certain financial instruments may qualify for direct allocation under paragraph (c) of this section);
(vi) Involves interest expense that constitutes qualified residence interest as defined in section 163(h)(3); or
(vii) [Reserved]
(5)
Economic significance.
Indebtedness that otherwise qualifies under paragraph (b)(2) shall nonetheless be subject to apportionment under § 1.861-9T if, taking into account all the facts and circumstances, the transaction (including the security arrangement) lacks economic significance.
(6)
Cross collateralization.
The term “cross collateralization” refers to the pledge as security for a loan of—
(i) Any asset of the borrower other than the identified property described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or
(ii) Any asset belonging to any related person, as defined in § 1.861-8T(c)(2).
(7)
Credit enhancement
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section, the term “credit enhancement” refers to any device, including a contract, letter of credit, or guaranty, that expands the creditor's rights, directly or indirectly, beyond the identified property purchased, constructed, or improved with the funds advanced and, thus effectively provides as security for a loan the assets of any person other than the borrower. The acquisition of bond insurance or any other contract of suretyship by an initial or subsequent holder of an obligation shall constitute credit enhancement.
(ii)
Special rule for leveraged leases.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term “credit enhancement” shall not include any device under which any person that is not a related person within the meaning of § 1.861-8T(c)(2) agrees to guarantee, without recourse to the lessor or any person related to the lessor, a lessor's payment of principal and interest on indebtedness that was incurred in order to purchase or improve an asset that is depreciable tangible personal property or depreciable tangible real property (and the land on which such real property is situated) that is leased to a lessee that is not a related person in a transaction that constitutes a lease for federal income tax purposes.
(iii)
Syndication of credit risk and sale of loan participations.
The term “syndication of credit risk” refers to an arrangement in which one primary lender secures the promise of a secondary lender to bear a portion of the primary lender's credit risk on a loan. The term “sale of loan participations” refers to an arrangement in which one primary lender divides a loan into several portions, sells and assigns all rights with respect to one or more portions to participating secondary lenders, and does not remain at risk in any manner with respect to the portion assigned. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the syndication of credit risk shall constitute credit enhancement because the primary lender can look to secondary lenders for payment of the loan, notwithstanding limitations on the amount of the secondary lender's liability. Conversely, the sale of loan participations does not constitute credit enhancement, because the holder of each portion of the loan can look solely to the asset securing the loan and not to the credit or other assets of any person.
(8)
Other arrangements that do not constitute cross collateralization or credit enhancement.
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(6) and (7) of this section, the following arrangements do not constitute cross collateralization or credit enhancement:
(i)
Integrated projects.
A taxpayer's pledge of multiple assets of an integrated project, provided that the integrated project. An integrated project consists of functionally related and geographically contiguous assets that, as to the taxpayer, are used in the same trade or business.
(ii) Insurance. A taxpayer's purchase of third-party casualty and liability insurance on the collateral or, by contract, bearing the risk of loss associated with destruction of the collateral or with respect to the attachment of third party liability claims.
(iii)
After-acquired property.
Extension of a creditor's security interest to improvements made to the collateral, provided that the extension does not constitute excess collateralization under paragraph (b)(6), determined by taking into account the value of improvements at the time the improvements are made and the value of the original property at the time the loan was made.
(iv)
Warranties of completion and maintenance.
A taxpayer's warranty to a creditor that it will complete construction or manufacture of the collateral or that it will maintain the collateral in good condition.
(v)
Substitution of collateral.
A taxpayer's right to substitute collateral under any loan contract. However, after the right is exercised, the loan shall no longer constitute qualified nonrecourse indebtedness.
(9)
Refinancings.
If a taxpayer refinances qualified nonrecourse indebtedness (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) with new indebtedness, such new indebtedness shall continue to qualify only if—
(i) The principal amount of the new indebtedness does not exceed by more than five percent the remaining principal amount of the original indebtedness,
(ii) The term of the new indebtedness does not exceed by more than six months the remaining term of the original indebtedness, and
(iii) The requirements of this paragraph (other than those of paragraph (b)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section) are satisfied at the time of the refinancing, and the exclusions contained in this paragraph (b)(4) do not apply.
(10)
Post-construction permanent financing.
Financing that is obtained after the completion of constructed property will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section if—
(i) The financing is obtained within one year after the constructed property or substantially all of a constructed integrated project (as defined in paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section) is placed in service for purposes of section 167; and
(ii) The financing does not exceed the cost of construction (including construction period interest).
(11)
Assumptions of pre-existing qualified nonrecourse indebtedness.
If a transferee of property that is subject to qualified nonrecourse indebtedness assumes such indebtedness, the indebtedness shall continue to constitute qualified nonrecourse indebtedness, provided that the assumption in no way alters the qualified status of the debt.
(12)
Excess collateralization.
[Reserved]
(c)
Direct allocations in the case of certain integrated financial transactions
—(1)
General rule.
Interest expense incurred on funds borrowed in connection with an integrated financial transaction (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) shall be directly allocated to the income generated by the investment funded with the borrowed amounts.
(2)
Definition.
The term “integrated financial transaction” refers to any transaction in which—
(i) The taxpayer—
(A) Incurs indebtedness for the purpose of making an identified term investment,
(B) Identifies the indebtedness as incurred for such purpose at the time the indebtedness is incurred, and
(C) Makes the identified term investment within ten business days after incurring the indebtedness;
(ii) The return on the investment is reasonably expected to be sufficient throughout the term of the investment
to fulfill the terms and conditions of the loan agreement with respect to the amount and timing of payments of principal and interest or original issue discount;
(iii) The income constitutes interest or original issue discount or would constitute income equivalent to interest if earned by a controlled foreign corporation (as described in § 1.954-2T(h));
(iv) The debt incurred and the investment mature within ten business days of each other;
(v) The investment does not relate in any way to the operation of, and is not made in the normal course of, the trade or business of the taxpayer or any related person, including the financing of the sale of goods or the performance of services by the taxpayer or any related person, or the compensation of the taxpayer's employees (including any contribution or loan to an employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 4975(e)(7)) or other plan that is qualified under section 401(a)); and
(vi) The borrower does not constitute a financial services entity (as defined in section 904 and the regulations thereunder).
(3)
Rollovers.
In the event that a taxpayer sells of otherwise liquidates an investment described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the interest expense incurred on the borrowing shall, subsequent to that liquidation, no longer qualify for direct allocation under this paragraph (c).
(4)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph (c) may be demonstrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
X is a manufacturer and does not constitute a financial services entity as defined in the regulations under section 904. On January 1, 1988, X borrows $100 for 6 months at an annual interest rate of 10 percent. X identifies on its books and records by the close of that day that the indebtedness is being incurred for the purpose of making an investment that is intended to qualify as an integrated financial transaction. On January 5, 1988, X uses the proceeds to purchase a portfolio of stock that approximates the composition of the Standard
Poor's 500 Index. On that day, X also enters into a forward sale contract that requires X to sell the stock on June 1, 1988 for $110. X identifies on its books and records by the close of January 5, 1988, that the portfolio stock purchases and the forward sale contract constitute part of the integrated financial transaction with respect to which the identified borrowing was incurred. Under § 1.954-2T(h), the income derived from the transaction would constitute income equivalent to interest. Assuming that the return on the investment to be derived on June 1, 1988, will be sufficient to pay the interest due on June 1, 1988, the interest on the borrowing is directly allocated to the gain from the investment.

# Example 2.
X does not constitute a financial services entity as defined in the regulations under section 904. X is in the business of, among other things, issuing credit cards to consumers and purchasing from merchants who accept the X card the receivables of consumers who make purchases with the X card. X borrows from Y in order to purchase X credit card receivables from Z, a merchant. Assuming that the Y borrowing satisfies the other requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the transaction nonetheless cannot constitute an integrated financial transaction because the purchase relates to the operation of X's trade or business.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except that X borrows in order to purchase the receivables of A, a merchant who does not accept the X card and is not otherwise engaged directly or indirectly in any business transaction with X. Because the borrowing is not related to the operation of X's trade or business, the borrowing may qualify as an integrated financial transaction if the other requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section are satisfied.
(d)
Special rules.
In applying paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the following special rules shall apply.
(1)
Related person transactions.
The rules of this section shall not apply to the extent that any transaction—
(i) Involves either indebtedness between related persons (as defined in section § 1.861-8T(c)(2)) or indebtedness incurred from unrelated persons for the purpose of purchasing property from a related person; or
(ii) Involves the purchase of property that is leased to a related person (as defined in § 1.861-8T(c)(2)) in a transaction described in paragraph (b) of this section. If a taxpayer purchases property and leases such property in whole or in part to a related person, a portion of the interest incurred in connection with such an acquisition, based on the ratio that the value of the property leased to the related person bears to the total value of the property, shall not qualify for direct allocation under this section.
(2)
Consideration of assets or income to which interest is directly allocated in apportioning other interest expense.
In apportioning interest expense under § 1.861-9T, the year-end value of any asset to which interest expense is directly allocated under this section during the current taxable year shall be reduced to the extent provided in § 1.861-9T(g)(2)(iii) to reflect the portion of the principal amount of the indebtedness outstanding at year-end relating to the interest which is directly allocated. A similar adjustment shall be made to the end-of-year value of assets for the prior year for purposes of determining the beginning-of-year value of assets for the current year. These adjustments shall be made prior to averaging beginning-of-year and end-of-year values pursuant to § 1.861-9T(g)(2). In apportioning interest expense under the modified gross income method, gross income shall be reduced by the amount of income to which interest expense is directly allocated under this section.
(e)
Treatment of certain related group indebtedness.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-10(e).
(f)
Effective/applicability date.
(1) In general, the rules of this section apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.
(2) Paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) (providing an operating costs test for purposes of the nonrecourse indebtedness exception) and (b)(6) (concerning excess collaterization of nonrecourse borrowings) of this section are applicable for taxable years commencing after December 31, 1988.
(3) Paragraph (e) (concerning the treatment of related controlled foreign corporation indebtedness) of this section is applicable for taxable years commencing after December 31, 1987. For rules for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, and for later years to the extent permitted by § 1.861-13T,

(b)
Scope of application
—(1)
Application of section 864(e)(1) and (5) (concerning the definition and treatment of affiliated groups).
Section 864(e)(1) and (5) and the portions of this section implementing section 864(e)(1) and (5) apply to the computation of foreign source taxable income for purposes of section 904 (relating to various limitations on the foreign tax credit). Section 864(e)(1) and (5) and the portions of this section implementing section 864(e)(1) and (5) also apply in connection with section 907 to determine reductions in the amount allowed as a foreign tax credit under section 901. Section 864(e)(1) and (5) and the portions of this section implementing section 864(e)(1) and (5) also apply to the computation of the combined taxable income of the related supplier and a foreign sales corporation (FSC) (under sections 921 through 927) as well as the combined taxable income of the related supplier and a domestic international sales corporation (DISC) (under sections 991 through 997).

(c)
General rule for affiliated corporations.
For further guidance, see § 1.861-11T(c).
(d)
Definition of affiliated group
—(1)
General rule.
For purposes of this section, in general, the term
affiliated group
has the same meaning as is given that term by section 1504. Section 1504(a) defines an affiliated group as one or more chains of includible corporations connected through 80-percent stock ownership with a common parent corporation which is an includible corporation (as defined in section 1504(b)). In the case of a corporation that either becomes or ceases to be a member of the group during the course of the corporation's taxable year, only the interest expense incurred by the group member during the period of membership shall be allocated and apportioned as if all members of the group were a
single corporation. In this regard, assets held during the period of membership shall be taken into account. Other interest expense incurred by the group member during its taxable year but not during the period of membership shall be allocated and apportioned without regard to the other members of the group.
(2) [Reserved]
(d)(3)-(6)(i) [Reserved]. For further guidance see § 1.861-11T(d)(3) through (6)(i).
(ii) Any foreign corporation if more than 50 percent of the gross income of such foreign corporation for the taxable year is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States and at least 80 percent of either the vote or value of all outstanding stock of such foreign corporation is owned directly or indirectly by members of the affiliated group (determined with regard to this sentence). This paragraph (d)(6)(ii) applies to taxable years beginning on or after
July 16, 2014.
See 26 CFR 1.861-11T(d)(6)(ii) (revised as of April 1, 2014) for rules applicable to taxable years beginning after August 10, 2010, and before
July 16, 2014.
See 26 CFR 1.861-11T(d)(6)(ii) (revised as of April 1, 2010) for rules applicable to taxable years beginning on or before August 10, 2010.
(7)
Special rules for the application of § 1.861-11T(d)(6).
The attribution rules of section 1563(e) and the regulations under that section shall apply in determining indirect ownership under § 1.861-11T(d)(6). The Commissioner shall have the authority to disregard trusts, partnerships, and pass-through entities that break affiliated status. Corporations described in § 1.861-11T(d)(6) shall be considered to constitute members of an affiliated group that does not file a consolidated return and shall therefore be subject to the limitations imposed under § 1.861-11T(g). The affiliated group filing a consolidated return shall be considered to constitute a single corporation for purposes of applying the rules of § 1.861-11T(g). For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1989, § 1.861-11T(d)(6)(i) shall not apply in determining foreign source alternative minimum taxable income within each separate category and the alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit pursuant to section 59(a) to the extent that such application would result in the inclusion of a section 936 corporation within the affiliated group. This paragraph (d)(7) applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.
(e)-(g) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.861-11T(e) through (g).
(h)
Applicability dates.
This section applies to taxable years that both begin after December 31, 2017, and end on or after December 4, 2018.

§ 1.861-11T
Special rules for allocating and apportioning interest expense of an affiliated group of corporations (temporary).
(a)
In general.
Sections 1.861-9T, 1.861-10T, 1.861-12T, and 1.861-13T provide rules that are generally applicable in apportioning interest expense. The rules of this section relate to affiliated groups of corporations and implement section 864(e) (1) and (5), which requires affiliated group allocation and apportionment of interest expense. The rules of this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, except as otherwise provided in § 1.861-13T. Paragraph (b) of this section describes the scope of the application of the rule for the allocation and apportionment of interest expense of affiliated groups of corporations, which is contained in paragraph (c) of this section. Paragraph (d) of this section sets forth the definition of the term “affiliated group” for purposes of this section. Paragraph (e) describes the treatment of loans between members of an affiliated group. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules concerning the affiliated group allocation and apportionment of interest expense in computing the combined taxable income of a FSC or DISC and its related supplier. Paragraph (g) of this section describes the treatment of losses caused by apportionment of interest expense in the case of an affiliated group that does not file a consolidated return.
(b)
Scope of application
—(1)
Application of section 864(e)(1) and (5) (concerning the definition and treatment of
affiliated groups).
For further guidance, see § 1.861-11(b)(1).
(2)
Nonapplication of section 864(e) (1) and (5) (concerning the definition and treatment of affiliated groups).
Section 864(e) (1) and (5) and the portions of this section implementing section 864(e) (1) and (5) do not apply to the computation of subpart F income of controlled foreign corporations (under sections 951 through 964), the computation of combined taxable income of a possessions corporation and its affiliates (under section 936), or the computation of effectively connected taxable income of foreign corporations. For the rules with respect to the allocation and apportionment of interest expenses of foreign corporations other than controlled foreign corporations, see §§ 1.882-4 and 1.882-5.
(c)
General rule for affiliated corporations.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the taxable income of each member of an affiliated group within each statutory grouping shall be determined by allocating and apportioning the interest expense of each member according to apportionment fractions which are computed as if all members of such group were a single corporation. For purposes of determining these apportionment fractions, stock in corporations within the affiliated group (as defined in section 864(e)(5) and the rules of this section) shall not be taken into account. In the case of an affiliated group of corporations that files a consolidated return, consolidated foreign tax credit limitations are computed for the group in accordance with the rules of § 1.1502-4. Except as otherwise provided, all the interest expense of all members of the group will be treated as definitely related and therefore allocable to all the gross income of the members of the group and all the assets of all the members of the group shall be taken into account in apportioning this interest expense. For purposes of this section, the term “taxpayer” refers to the affiliated group (regardless of whether the group files a consolidated return), rather than to the separate members thereof.
(d)(1)-(2) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.861-11(d)(1) and (2).
(3)
Treatment of life insurance companies subject to taxation under section 801
—(i)
General rule.
A life insurance company that is subject to taxation under section 801 shall be considered to constitute a member of the affiliated group composed of companies not taxable under section 801 only if a parent corporation so elects under section 1504(c)(2)(A) of the Code. If a parent does not so elect, no adjustments shall be required with respect to such an insurance company under paragraph (g) of this section.
(ii)
Treatment of stock.
Stock of a life insurance company that is subject to taxation under section 801 that is not included in an affiliated group shall be disregarded in the allocation and apportionment of the interest expense of such affiliated group.
(4)
Treatment of certain financial corporations
—(i)
In general.
In the case of an affiliated group (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section), any member that constitutes financial corporations as defined in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section shall be treated as a separate affiliated group consisting of financial corporations (the “financial group”). The members of the group that do not constitute financial corporations shall be treated as members of a separate affiliated group consisting of nonfinancial corporations (“the nonfinancial group”).
(ii)
Financial corporation defined.
The term “financial corporation” means any corporation which meets all of the following conditions:
(A) It is described in section 581 (relating to the definition of a bank) or section 591 (relating to the deduction for dividends paid on deposits by mutual savings banks, cooperative banks, domestic building and loan associations, and other savings institutions chartered and supervised as savings and loan or similar associations);
(B) Its business is predominantly with persons other than related persons (within the meaning of section 864(d)(4) and the regulations thereunder) or their customers; and
(C) It is required by state or Federal law to be operated separately from any other entity which is not such an institution.
(iii)
Treatment of bank holding companies.
The total aggregate interest expense of any member of an affiliated group that constitutes a bank holding company subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 shall be prorated between the financial group and the nonfinancial group on the basis of the assets in the financial and nonfinancial groups. For purposes of making this proration, the assets of each member of each group, and not the stock basis in each member, shall be taken into account. Any direct or indirect subsidiary of a bank holding company that is predominantly engaged in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business shall be considered to be a financial corporation for purposes of this paragraph (d)(4). The interest expense of the bank holding company must be further apportioned in accordance with § 1.861-9T(f) to the various section 904(d) categories of income contained in both the financial group and the nonfinancial group on the basis of the assets owned by each group. For purposes of computing the apportionment fractions for each group, the assets owned directly by a bank holding company within each limitation category described in section 904(d)(1) (other than stock in affiliates or assets described in § 1.861-9T(f)) shall be treated as owned pro rata by the nonfinancial group and the financial group based on the relative amounts of investments of the bank holding company in the nonfinancial group and financial group.
(iv)
Consideration of stock of the members of one group held by members of the other group.
In apportioning interest expense, the nonfinancial group shall not take into account the stock of any lower-tier corporation that is treated as a member of the financial group under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section. Conversely, in apportioning interest expense, the financial group shall not take into account the stock of any lower-tier corporation that is treated as a member of the nonfinancial group under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section. For the treatment of loans between members of the financial group and members of the nonfinancial group, see paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(5)
Example.
(i)
Facts.
X, a domestic corporation which is not a bank holding company, is the parent of domestic corporations Y and Z. Z owns 100 percent of the stock Z1, which is also a domestic corporation. X, Y, Z, and Z1 were organized after January 1, 1987, and constitute an affiliated group within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Y and Z are financial corporations described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. X also owns 25 percent of the stock of A, a domestic corporation. Y owns 25 percent of the voting stock of B, a foreign corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation. Z owns less than 10 percent of the voting stock of C, another foreign corporation. The foreign source income generated by Y's or Z's direct assets is exclusively financial services income. The foreign source income generated by X's or Z1's direct assets is exclusively general limitation income. X and Z1 are not financial corporations described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section. Y and Z, therefore, constitute a separate affiliated group apart from X and Z1 for purposes of section 864(e). The combined interest expense of Y and Z of $100,000 ($50,000 each) is apportioned separately on the basis of their assets. The combined interest expense of X and Z1 of $50,000 ($25,000 each) is allocated on the basis of the assets of the XZ1 group.

(ii)
Allocation.
No portion of the $50,000 deduction of the YZ group is definitely related solely to specific property within the meaning of § 1.861-10T. Thus, the YZ group's deduction for interest is related to all its activities and properties. Similarly, no portion of the $50,000 deduction of the XZ1 group is definitely related solely to specific property within the meaning of § 1.861-10T. Thus, the XZ1 group's deduction for interest is related to all its activities and properties.
(iii)
Apportionment.
The YZ group would apportion its interest expense as follows:
To gross financial services income from sources outside the United States:
EC07OC91.004
To gross income subject to a separate limitation for dividends from B:
EC07OC91.005
To gross income from sources inside the United States:
EC07OC91.006
The XZ1 group would apportion its interest expense as follows:
To gross general limitation income from sources outside the United States:
EC07OC91.007
To gross income from sources inside the United States:
EC07OC91.008

Certain unaffiliated corporations.
Certain corporations that are not described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section will nonetheless be considered to constitute affiliated corporations for purposes of §§ 1.861-9T through 1.861-13T. These corporations include:
(i) Any includible corporation (as defined in section 1504(b) without regard to section 1504(b)(4)) if 80 percent of either the vote or value of all outstanding stock of such corporation is owned directly or indirectly by an includible corporation or by members of an affiliated group, and
(ii) [Reserved]. For further guidance see § 1.861-11(d)(6)(ii).
(7)
Special rules for the application of § 1.861-11T(d)(6).
[Reserved]. For special rules for the application of § 1.861-11T(d)(6), see § 1.861-11(d)(7).
(e)
Loans between members of an affiliated group
—(1)
General rule.
In the case of loans (including any receivable) between members of an affiliated group, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, for purposes of apportioning interest expense, the indebtedness of the member borrower shall not be considered an asset of the member lender. However, in the case of members of separate financial and nonfinancial groups under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the indebtedness of the member borrower shall be considered an asset of the member lender and such asset shall be characterized by reference to the member lender's income from the asset as determined under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (e), the terms “related person interest income” and “related person interest payment” refer to interest paid and received by members of the same affiliated group as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Treatment of interest expense within the affiliated group
—(i)
General rule.
A member borrower shall deduct related person interest payments in the same manner as unrelated person interest expense using group apportionment fractions computed under § 1.861-9T(f). A member lender shall include related person interest income in the same class of gross income as the class of gross income from which the member borrower deducts the related person interest payment.
(ii)
Special rule for loans between financial and nonfinancial affiliated corporations.
In the case of a loan between
two affiliated corporations only one of which constitutes a financial corporation under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the member borrower shall allocate and apportion related person interest payments in the same manner as unrelated person interest expense using group apportionment fractions computed under § 1.861-9T(f). The source of the related person interest income to the member lender shall be determined under section 861(a)(1).
(iii)
Special rule for high withholding tax interest.
In the case of an affiliated corporation that pays interest that is high withholding tax interest under § 1.904-5(f)(1) to another affiliated corporation, the interest expense of the payor shall be allocated to high withholding tax interest.
(3)
Back-to-back loans.
If a member of the affiliated group makes a loan to a nonmember who makes a loan to a member borrower, the rule of paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section shall apply, in the Commissioner's discretion, as if the member lender made the loan directly to the member borrower, provided that the loans constitute a back-to-back loan transaction. Such loans will constitute a back-to-back loan for purposes of this paragraph (e) if the loan by the nonmember would not have been made or maintained on substantially the same terms irrespective of the loan of funds by the lending member to the nonmember or other intermediary party.
(4)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
X, a domestic corporation, is the parent of Y, a domestic corporation. X and Y were organized after January 1, 1987, and constitute an affiliated group within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Among X's assets is the note of Y for the amount of $100,000. Because X and Y are members of an affiliated group, Y's note does not constitute an asset for purposes of apportionment. The apportionment fractions for the relevant tax year of the XY group are 50 percent domestic, 40 percent foreign general, and 10 percent foreign passive. Y deducts its related person interest payment using those apportionment fractions. Of the $10,000 in related person interest income received by X, $5,000 consists of domestic source income, $4,000 consists of foreign general limitation income, and $1,000 consists of foreign passive income.

# Example 2.
X is a domestic corporation organized after January 1, 1987. X owns all the stock of Y, a domestic corporation. On June 1, 1987, X loans $100,000 to Z, an unrelated person. On June 2, 1987, Z makes a loan to Y with terms substantially similar to those of the loan from X to Z. Based on the facts and circumstances of the transaction, it is determined that Z would not have made the loan to Y on the same terms if X had not made the loan to Z. Because the transaction constitutes a back-to-back loan, as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the Commissioner may require, in his discretion, that neither the note of Y nor the note of Z may be considered an asset of X for purposes of this section.
(f)
Computations of combined taxable income.
In the computation of the combined taxable income of any FSC or DISC and its related supplier which is a member of an affiliated group under the pricing rules of sections 925 or 994, the combined taxable income of such FSC or DISC and its related supplier shall be reduced by the portion of the total interest expense of the affiliated group that is incurred in connection with those assets of the group used in connection with export sales involving that FSC or DISC. This amount shall be computed by multiplying the total interest expense of the affiliated group and interest expense of the FSC or DISC by a fraction the numerator of which is the assets of the affiliated group and of the FSC or DISC generating foreign trade income or gross income attributable to qualified export receipts, as the case may be, and the denominator of which is the total assets of the affiliated group and the FSC or DISC. Under this rule, interest of other group members may be attributed to the combined taxable income of a FSC or DISC and its related supplier without affecting the amount of interest otherwise deductible by the FSC or DISC, the related supplier or other member of the affiliated group. The FSC or DISC is entitled to only the statutory portion of the combined taxable income, net of any deemed interest expense, which determines the commission paid to the FSC or DISC or the transfer price of qualifying export property sold to the FSC or DISC.
(g)
Losses created through apportionment
—(1)
General rules.
In the case of an affiliated group that is eligible to file, but does not file, a consolidated return
and in the case of any corporation described in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the foreign tax credits in any separate limitation category are limited to the credits computed under the rules of this paragraph (g). As a consequence of the affiliated group allocation and apportionment of interest expense required by section 864(e)(1) and this section, interest expense of a group member may be apportioned for section 904 purposes to a limitation category in which that member has no gross income, resulting in a loss in that limitation category. The same is true in connection with any expense other than interest that is subject to apportionment under the rules of section 864(e)(6) of the Code. Any reference to “interest expense” in this paragraph (g) shall be treated as including such expenses. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “limitation category” includes domestic source income, as well as the types of income described in section 904(d)(1) (A) through (I). A loss of one affiliate in a limitation category will reduce the income of another member in the same limitation category if a consolidated return is filed. (See § 1.1502-4.) If a consolidated return is not filed, this netting does not occur. Accordingly, in such a case, the following adjustments among members are required in order to give effect to the group allocation of interest expense:
(i) Losses created through group apportionment of interest expense in one or more limitation categories within a given member must be eliminated; and
(ii) A corresponding amount of income of other members in the same limitation category must be recharacterized.
Such adjustments shall be accomplished, in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) of this section, without changing the total taxable income of any member and before the application of section 904(f). Section 904(f) (including section 904(f)(5)) does not apply to a loss created through the apportionment of interest expense to the extent that the loss is eliminated pursuant to paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section. For purposes of this section, the terms “limitation adjustment” and “recharacterization” mean the recharacterization of income in one limitation category as income in another limitation category.
(2)
Mechanics of computation
—(i)
Step 1: Computation of consolidated taxable income.
The members of an affiliated group must first allocate and apportion all other deductible expenses other than interest. The members must then deduct from their respective gross incomes within each limitation category interest expense apportioned under the rules of § 1.861-9T(f). The taxable income of the entire affiliated group within each limitation category is then totalled.
(ii)
Step 2: Loss offset adjustments.
If, after step 1, a member has losses in a given limitation category or limitation categories created through apportionment of interest expense, any such loss (
i.e.,
the portion of such loss equal to interest expense) shall be eliminated by offsetting that loss against taxable income in other limitation categories of that member to the extent of the taxable income of other members within the same limitation category as the loss. If the member has taxable income in more than one limitation category, then the loss shall offset taxable income in all such limitation categories on a pro rata basis. If there is insufficient domestic income of the member to offset the net losses in all foreign limitation categories caused by the apportionment of interest expense, the losses in each limitation category shall be recharacterized as domestic losses to the extent of the taxable income of other members in the same respective limitation categories. After these adjustments are made, the income of the entire affiliated group within each limitation category is totalled again.
(iii)
Step 3: Determination of amount subject to recharacterization.
In order to determine the amount of income to be recharacterized in step 4, the income totals computed under step 1 in each limitation category shall be subtracted from the income totals computed under step 2 in each limitation category.
(iv)
Step 4: Recharacterization.
Because any differences determined under step 3 represent deviations from the consolidated totals computed under Step 1, such differences (in any limitation category) must be eliminated.
(A)
Limitation categories to be reduced.
In the case of any limitation category in which there is a positive change, the income of group members with income in that limitation category must be reduced on a pro rata basis (by reference to net income figures as determined under Step 2) to the extent of such positive change (“limitation reductions”). Each member shall separately compute the sum of the limitation reductions.
(B)
Limitation categories to be increased.
In any case in which only one limitation category has a negative change in Step 3, the sum of the limitation reductions within each member is added to that limitation category. In the case in which multiple limitation categories have negative changes in Step 3, the sum of the limitation reductions within each member is prorated among the negative change limitation categories based on the ratio that the negative change for the entire group in each limitation category bears to the total of all negative changes for the entire group in all limitation categories.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph.

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
X, a domestic corporation, is the parent of domestic corporations Y and Z. X, Y, and Z were organized after January 1, 1987, constitute an affiliated group within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, but do not file a consolidated return. The XYZ group apportions its interest expense on the basis of the fair market value of its assets. X, Y, and Z have the following assets, interest expense, and taxable income before apportioning interest expense:

Each member of the XYZ group apportions its interest expense according to group apportionment ratios determined under the asset method described in § 1.861-9T(f), yielding the following results:

(iii)
Step 2: Loss offset adjustments.
Because X and Y have losses created through apportionment, these losses must be eliminated by reducing taxable income of the member in other limitation categories. Because X has a total of $12 in apportionment losses and because it has only one limitation category with income (
i.e.,
domestic), domestic income must be reduced by $12, thus eliminating its apportionment losses. Because Y has a total of $9 in apportionment losses and because it has two limitation categories with income (
i.e.,
foreign passive and foreign general limitation), the income in these two limitation categories must be reduced on a pro rata basis in order to eliminate its apportionment losses. In summary, the following adjustments are required:

(iv)
Step 3: Determination of amount subject to recharacterization.
The adjustments performed under Step 2 led to a change in the group's taxable income within each limitation category. The total loss offset adjustments column shown in paragraph (iii) above shows the net deviations between Step 1 and 2.
(v)
Step 4: Recharacterization.
The loss offset adjustments yield a positive change in the foreign passive and the foreign general limitation categories. Y and Z both have income in these limitation categories. Accordingly, the income of Y and Z in each of these limitation categories must be reduced on a pro rata basis (by reference to the adjusted taxable income figures) to the extent of the positive change in each limitation category. The total positive change in the foreign passive limitation category is $0.52. The adjusted taxable income of Y in the foreign passive limitation category is $4.02 and the adjusted taxable income of Z in the foreign passive limitation category is $3. Therefore, $0.30 is drawn from Y and $0.22 is drawn from Z. The total positive change in the foreign general limitation category is $2.48. The adjusted taxable income of Y in the foreign general limitation category is $48.98, and the adjusted taxable income of Z in the foreign general limitation category is $17. Therefore, $1.84 is drawn from Y and $.64 is drawn from Z.
The members must then separately compute the sum of the limitation reductions. Y has limitation reductions of $0.30 in the foreign passive limitation category and $1.84 in the foreign general limitation category, yielding total limitation reduction of $2.14. Under these facts, domestic income is the only limitation category requiring a positive adjustment. Accordingly, Y's domestic income is increased by $2.14. Z has limitation reductions of $0.22 in the foreign passive limitation category and $0.64 in the foreign general limitation category, yielding total limitation reductions of $0.86. Under these facts, domestic income is the only limitation category of Z requiring a positive adjustment. Accordingly, Z's domestic income is increased by $0.86.

X, Y, and Z were organized after January 1, 1987, constitute an affiliated group within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, but do not file a consolidated return. Moreover, X has served as the sole borrower in the group and, as a result, has sustained an overall loss. The XYZ group apportions its interest expense on the basis of the fair market value of its assets. X, Y, and Z have the following assets, interest expense, and taxable income before interest expense:

(iii)
Step 2: Loss offset adjustment.
Because X has insufficient domestic income to offset the sum of the losses in the foreign limitation categories caused by apportionment, the amount of apportionment losses in each limitation category shall be recharacterized as domestic losses to the extent of taxable income of other members in the same limitation category. This is accomplished by adding to each foreign limitation categories an amount equal to the loss therein and by subtracting the sum of such foreign losses from domestic income, as follows:

(iv)
Step 3: Determination of amount subject to recharacterization.
The adjustments performed under Step 2 led to a change in the group's taxable income within each limitation category. The total loss offset adjustment column shown in paragraph (iii) above shows the net deviations between Steps 1 and 2.
(v)
Step 4: Recharacterization.
The loss offset adjustments yield a positive change in the foreign passive and the foreign general limitation categories. Y and Z both have income in these limitation categories. Accordingly, the income of Y and Z in each of these limitation categories must be reduced on a pro rata basis (by reference to the adjusted taxable income figures) to the extent of the positive change in each limitation category. The total positive change in the foreign passive limitation category is $3.50. The adjusted taxable income of Y in the foreign passive limitation category is $5, and the adjusted taxable income of Z in the foreign passive limitation category is $5. Therefore, $1.75 is drawn from Y and $1.75 is drawn from Z. The total positive change in the foreign general limitation category is $31.50. The adjusted taxable income of Y in the foreign general limitation category is $70, and the adjusted taxable income of Z in the foreign general limitation category is $35. Therefore, $21 is drawn from Y and $10.50 is drawn from Z.
The members must then separately compute the sum of the limitation reductions. Y has limitation reductions of $1.75 in the foreign passive limitation category and $21 in the foreign general limitation category, yielding total limitation reductions of $22.75. Under these facts, domestic income is the only limitation category requiring a positive adjustment. Accordingly, Y's domestic income is increased by $22.75. Z has limitation reductions of $1.75 in the foreign passive limitation category and $10.50 in the foreign general limitation category, yielding total limitation reductions of $12.25. Under these facts, domestic income is the only limitation category requiring a positive adjustment. Accordingly, Z's domestic income is increased by $12.25.

§ 1.861-12
Characterization rules and adjustments for certain assets.
(a)
In general.
The rules in this section apply to taxpayers apportioning expenses under an asset method to income in the various separate categories described in § 1.904-5(a)(4)(v), and supplement other rules provided in §§ 1.861-9 through 1.861-11T. The principles of the rules in this section also apply in apportioning expenses among statutory and residual groupings for any other operative section. See also § 1.861-8(f)(2)(i) for a rule requiring conformity of allocation methods and apportionment principles for all operative sections. Paragraph (b) of this section describes the treatment of inventories. Paragraph (c)(1) of this section concerns the treatment of various stock assets. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section describes a basis adjustment for stock in 10 percent owned corporations. Paragraph (c)(3) of this section sets forth rules for characterizing the stock in controlled foreign corporations. Paragraph (c)(4) of this section describes the treatment of stock of noncontrolled 10-percent owned foreign corporations. Paragraph (d)(1) of this section concerns the treatment of notes. Paragraph (d)(2) of this section concerns the treatment of notes of controlled foreign corporations. Paragraph
(e) of this section describes the treatment of certain portfolio securities that constitute inventory or generate income primarily in the form of gains.

Taxpayers using the tax book value method
—(A)
General rule.
For purposes of apportioning expenses on the basis of the tax book value of assets, the adjusted basis of any stock in a 10 percent owned corporation owned by the taxpayer either directly or indirectly through a partnership or other pass-through entity (after taking into account the adjustments described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section) shall be—
(
1
) Increased by the amount of the earnings and profits of such corporation (and of lower-tier 10 percent owned corporations) attributable to such stock and accumulated during the period the taxpayer or other members of its affiliated group held 10 percent or more of such stock; or
(
2
) Reduced by any deficit in earnings and profits of such corporation (and of lower-tier 10 percent owned corporations) attributable to such stock for such period; or
(
3
) Zero, if after application of paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section, the adjusted basis of the stock is less than zero.

Application of section 961 or 1293(d).
For purposes of this section, a taxpayer's adjusted basis in the stock of a foreign corporation does not include any amount included in basis under section 961 or 1293(d) of the Code.
(
ii
)
Application of section 965(b).
For purposes of this section, if a taxpayer owned the stock of a specified foreign corporation (as defined in § 1.965-1(f)(45)) as of the close of the last taxable year of the specified foreign corporation that began before January 1, 2018, the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the stock of the specified foreign corporation for that taxable year and any subsequent taxable year is determined as if the taxpayer did not make the election described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(i) (regardless of whether the election was actually made) and is further adjusted as described in this paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B)(
1
)(
ii
). If § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(B) applied (or would have applied if the election had been made) with respect to the stock of a specified foreign corporation, the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the stock of the specified foreign corporation is reduced by the amount described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) (without regard to the rule for limited basis adjustments in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) and the limitation in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(C), and without regard to the rules regarding the netting of basis adjustments in § 1.965-2(h)(2)). The reduction in the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the stock may reduce the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the stock below zero prior to the application of paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section. No adjustment is made in the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the stock of a specified foreign corporation for an amount described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(A). To the extent that, in an exchange described in section 351, 354, or 356, a taxpayer receives stock of a foreign corporation in exchange for stock of a specified foreign corporation described in this paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B)(
1
)(
ii
), this paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B)(
1
)(
ii
) applies to such stock received.

Amount of earnings and profits.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), earnings and profits (or deficits) are computed under the rules of section 312 and, in the case of a foreign corporation, sections 964(a) and 986 for taxable years of the 10 percent owned corporation ending on or before the close of the taxable year of the taxpayer. Accordingly, the earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation include all earnings and profits described in
section 959(c). The amount of the earnings and profits with respect to stock of a foreign corporation held by the taxpayer is determined according to the attribution principles of section 1248 and the regulations under section 1248. The attribution principles of section 1248 apply without regard to the requirements of section 1248 that are not relevant to the determination of a shareholder's pro rata portion of earnings and profits, such as whether earnings and profits (or deficits) were derived (or incurred) during taxable years beginning before or after December 31, 1962.
(

)
Annual noncumulative adjustment.
The adjustment required by paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section is made annually and is noncumulative. Thus, the adjusted basis of the stock (determined without regard to prior years' adjustments under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section) is adjusted annually by the amount of accumulated earnings and profits (or deficits) attributable to the stock as of the end of each year.
(
4
)
Translation of non-dollar functional currency earnings and profits.
Earnings and profits (or deficits) of a qualified business unit that has a functional currency other than the dollar must be computed under this paragraph (c)(2) in functional currency and translated into dollars using the exchange rate at the end of the taxpayer's current taxable year (and not the exchange rates for the years in which the earnings and profits or deficits were derived or incurred).

The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.

)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of CFC1 and CFC2, both controlled foreign corporations. USP, CFC1, and CFC2 all use the calendar year as their U.S. taxable year. USP owned CFC1 and CFC2 as of December 31, 2017, and CFC1 and CFC2 were specified foreign corporations with respect to USP. USP's basis in each share of stock of each of CFC1 and CFC2 is identical. USP did not make the election described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(i), but if USP had made the election, § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(B) would have applied to the stock of CFC2 and the amount described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) (without regard to the rule for limited basis adjustments in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) and without regard to the rules regarding the netting of basis adjustments in § 1.965-2(h)(2)) with respect to the stock of CFC2, in aggregate, is $75x. For purposes of determining the value of the stock of CFC1 and CFC2 at the beginning of the 2019 taxable year, without regard to amounts included in basis under section 961 or 1293(d), USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC1 is $100x and its adjusted basis in the stock of CFC2 is $350x (before the application of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section).
(

)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section, USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC1 is determined as if USP did not make the election described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(i). USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC2 is then reduced by $75x, the amount described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
), without regard to the rule for limited basis adjustments in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) and without regard to the rules regarding the netting of basis adjustments in § 1.965-2(h)(2). No adjustment is made to USP's adjusted basis in the stock in CFC1. Accordingly, for purposes of determining the value of stock of CFC1 and CFC2 at the beginning of the 2019 taxable year, USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC1 is $100x and USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC2 is $275x ($350x−$75x).

Example 2: Election described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(i)
—(
i
)
Facts.
USP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the stock of CFC1, which owns all of the stock of CFC2, both controlled foreign corporations. USP, CFC1, and CFC2 all use the calendar year as their U.S. taxable year. USP owned CFC1, and CFC1 owned CFC2 as of December 31, 2017, and CFC1 and CFC2 were specified foreign corporations with respect to USP. USP's basis in each share of stock of CFC1 is identical. USP made the election described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(i). As a result of the election, USP was required to increase its basis in the stock of CFC1 by $90x under § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
), and to decrease its basis in the stock of CFC1 by $90x under
§ 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
). Pursuant to § 1.965-2(h)(2), USP netted the increase of $90x against the decrease of $90x and made no net adjustment to the basis in the stock of CFC1. For purposes of determining the value of the stock of CFC1 at the beginning of the 2019 taxable year, without regard to amounts included in basis under section 961 or 1293(d), USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC1 is $600x (before the application of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section).
(
ii
)
Analysis.
Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section, USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC1 is determined as if USP did not make the election described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(i). While USP made the election, no adjustment was made to the stock of CFC1 as a result of the election. However, USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC1 is then reduced by $90x, the amount described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
), without regard to the rules regarding the netting of basis described in § 1.965-2(h)(2). No adjustment is made to USP's basis in the stock of CFC1 for the amount described in § 1.965-2(f)(2)(ii)(A)(
1
). Accordingly, for purposes of determining the value of stock of CFC1 at the beginning of the 2019 taxable year, USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC1 is $510x ($600x−$90x).

Facts.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)(

)(
i
) of this section (the facts in
Example 1
), except that for purposes of determining the value of the stock of CFC2 at the beginning of the 2019 taxable year, without regard to amounts included in basis under section 961 or 1293(d), USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC2 is $0 (before the application of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section). Additionally, the adjusted basis of USP in the stock of CFC1 and CFC2 at the end of the 2019 taxable year is the same as at the beginning of that year, and as of the end of the 2019 taxable year, CFC1 has earnings and profits of $25x and CFC2 has earnings and profits of $50x that are attributable to the stock owned by USP and accumulated during the period that USP held the stock of CFC1 and CFC2.
(

)
Analysis.
The analysis is the same as in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section (the analysis in
Example 1
) except that for purposes of determining the value of stock of CFC1 and CFC2 at the beginning of the 2019 taxable year, USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC2 is −$75x ($0−$75x). Because USP's basis in the stock of CFC1 and CFC2 is the same at the end of the 2019 taxable year, prior to the application of the adjustments in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A)(
1
) and (
2
) of this section, USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC1 is $100x and USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC2 is −$75x. Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section, for purposes of apportioning expenses on the basis of the tax book value of assets, USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC1 is $125x ($100x + $25x). Under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A)(
3
) of this section, for purposes of apportioning expenses on the basis of the tax book value of assets, USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC2 is $0 because after applying paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A)(
1
) of this section, USP's adjusted basis in the stock of CFC2 is less than zero (−$75x + $50x).
