EPA is approving the maintenance plan, except for the following aspects, which EPA is disapproving: those contingency measures listed in section 6.d of the State's maintenance plan that are voluntary in nature, which consist of: “Alert Day Enhancements,” “Heavy Equipment Emission Control Program,” “Reduce Emissions of VOCs” (to the extent the State would adopt and implement the measure as a voluntary commitment rather than a regulatory measure), “Identification of High-Polluting Vehicles,” and “Other VOC or NO
X
emissions control measures as appropriate” (to the extent such measures would be voluntary); the contingency measure listed in section 6.d of the State's maintenance plan as “Establish an Offset Ratio for NO
X
;” the State's proposal in section 5.a.(3)(b)of the maintenance plan to remove from the SIP the VOC RACT approval orders for Hill Air Force Base; the State's proposal in section 5.b.(1) of the maintenance plan to remove from the SIP the NO
X
RACT limits for the PacifiCorp Gadsby Power Plant; and section 5.g of the maintenance plan, which indicates that the employer-based trip reduction program is included as part of the plan. EPA is approving the revisions to UAC R307-110-13, which incorporates the maintenance plan into Utah's rules, but only to the extent we are approving the 1997 8-hour ozone maintenance plan. EPA is disapproving UAC R307-320, the employer-based trip reduction program. EPA is approving the revisions to UAC R307-325, R307-326, R307-327, R307-328, R307-335, R307-340, R307-341, and R307-342, subject to our interpretation of these rules expressed in the preamble to our rulemaking action. EPA is not acting on the revisions to UAC R307-101-2 because the revisions have been superseded by later revisions to the rule, which EPA approved at § 52.2320(c)(67).

(75) On September 15, 2006, the Governor submitted revisions to the Utah State Implementation Plan (SIP) permitting rules. The September 15, 2006 submittal contains new, amended and renumbered rules in Utah Administrative Code (UAC) Title R-307 that pertain to the issuance of Utah air quality permits. EPA is approving the following rules or parts of rules from the September 15, 2006 submittal: R307-401-1 through 6; R307-401-8; R307-401-9 (except for paragraph (b) and the portions of paragraph (c) that reference paragraph (b)); R307-401-10 through 11; R307-401-13; R307-401-17 through 20; and R307-410-1 through 4. EPA is disapproving the following rules or parts of rules from the September 15, 2006 submittal: R307-401-7; R307-401-9(b) and the portions of 9(c) that reference (9)(b); R307-401-12; and R307-410-5. EPA is limitedly approving and limitedly disapproving R307-410-6 from the September 15, 2006 submittal—this means EPA is approving this rule because it will strengthen the SIP but is simultaneously disapproving it because it does not fully comply with applicable requirements. EPA is not acting on the revisions to UAC R307-101-2 because the revisions have been superseded by later revisions to the rule, which EPA approved at § 52.2320(c)(67) (see 73 FR 51222). EPA is not acting on R307-401-14 through 16 because EPA previously acted on such provisions (notice of final rulemaking signed October 19, 2012).

(a)
Determinations.
EPA is determining that, as of July 18, 1995, the Salt Lake and Davis Counties ozone nonattainment area has attained the ozone standard based on air quality monitoring data from 1992, 1993, and 1994, and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to the area for so long as the area does not monitor any violations of the ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Salt Lake and Davis Counties ozone nonattainment area, these determinations shall no longer apply.
(b)
Determination.
Effective November 7, 2022, EPA is determining that the Southern Wasatch Front, Utah Marginal nonattainment area attained the 2015 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date of August 3, 2021, based upon complete quality-assured and certified data for the calendar years 2018-2020.

(vi) Participate matter (PM) emissions, PM
2.5
emissions and PM
10
emissions shall include gaseous emissions from a source or activity which condense to form particulate matter at ambient temperatures. On or after January 1, 2011 (or any earlier date established in the upcoming rulemaking codifying test methods), such condensable particulate matter shall be accounted for in applicability determinations and in establishing emissions limitations for PM, PM
2.5
and PM
10
in PSD permits. Compliance with emissions limitations for PM, PM
2.5
and PM
10
issued prior to this date shall not be based on condensable particular matter unless required by the terms and conditions of the permit or the applicable implementation plan. Applicability determinations made prior to this date without accounting for condensable particular matter shall not be considered in violation of this section unless the applicable implementation plan required condensable particular matter to be included.

§ 52.2347
Stack height regulations.
The State of Utah has committed to revise its stack height regulations should EPA complete rulemaking to respond to the decision in
NRDC v. Thomas,
838 F. 2d 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1988). In a letter to Douglas M. Skie, EPA, dated May 27, 1988, F. Burnell Cordner, Director, Bureau of Air Quality, stated:
* * * We are submitting this letter to allow EPA to continue to process our current SIP submittal with the understanding that if the EPA's response to the NRDC remand modifies the July 8, 1985 regulations, the EPA will notify the State of the rules that must be changed to comply with the EPA's modified requirements. The State of Utah agrees to process appropriate changes.

§ 52.2348
National Highway Systems Designation Act Motor Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) Programs.
(a) On March 15, 1996 the Governor of Utah submitted a revised I/M program for Utah County which included a credit claim, a basis in fact for the credit claimed, a description of the County's program, draft County ordinances, and authorizing legislation for the program. Approval is granted on an interim basis for a period of 18 months, under the authority of section 348 of the National Highway Systems Designation Act of 1995. If Utah County fails to start its program by November 15, 1997 at the latest, this approval will convert to a disapproval after EPA sends a letter to the State. At the end of the eighteen month period, the approval will lapse. At that time, EPA must take final rulemaking action upon the State's SIP, under the authority of section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Final action on the State/County's plan will be taken following EPA's review of the State/County's credit evaluation and final regulations (State and County) as submitted to EPA.
(b) On May 20, 1999, the State of Utah submitted an evaluation of the Utah County inspection and maintenance program. On December 7, 2001, the Governor of Utah submitted Rule R307-110-34 and Section X, Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program, Part D, Utah County. These submittals satisfy the interim approval requirements specified under section 348 of the National Highway Systems Designation Act of 1995 (62 FR 31351, 63 FR 414). Under the authority of section 110 of the Clean Air Act, EPA is removing the interim status of Utah County's improved inspection and maintenance program and granting Utah County full final approval of their improved inspection and maintenance program.

§ 52.2350
Emission inventories.
(a) The Governor of the State of Utah submitted the 1990 base year emission inventory of ozone precursors, which are volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide, for the Salt Lake and Davis Counties ozone nonattainment area on January 13, 1995, as a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP). This inventory addresses emissions from point, area, non-road, on-road mobile, and biogenic sources. This Governor's submittal was followed by the submittal of corrections to the inventory, on April 20, 1995, from Russell Roberts, Director, Division of Air Quality, Utah Department of Environmental Quality. The ozone maintenance plan for Salt Lake and Davis Counties that the Governor submitted on February 19, 1997, incorporates by reference the corrected 1990 base year ozone emission inventory as background material. The 1990 ozone base year emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean
Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for the Salt Lake and Davis Counties area.
(b) On November 12, 1997, the Governor of Utah submitted the 1993 Carbon Monoxide Periodic Emission Inventories for Ogden City and Utah County as revisions to the Utah State Implementation Plan. These inventories address carbon monoxide emissions from stationary point, area, non-road, and on-road mobile sources.
(c) On June 14, 1999, the Governor of Utah submitted the 1996 Carbon Monoxide Periodic Emission Inventory for Utah County as a revision to the Utah State Implementation Plan. The inventory addresses carbon monoxide emissions from stationary point, area, non-road mobile, and on-road mobile sources.

§ 52.2351
Area-wide nitrogen oxides (NO
X
) exemption.
On May 2, 1997, Ursula Trueman, Director, Division of Air Quality, Utah Department of Environmental Quality, submitted, on behalf of the State of Utah and pursuant to section 182(f)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990, a section 182(f)(2) NO
X
Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) exemption request for major stationary sources of NO
X
in the Salt Lake and Davis Counties ozone nonattainment area other than the Pacificorp Gadsby and Kennecott Utah Copper Utah Power Plants. The exemption request was based on ambient air quality monitoring data which demonstrated that the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) had been attained in the Salt Lake and Davis Counties ozone nonattainment area for the years 1990 through 1996. EPA approved this NO
X
RACT exemption request on July 2, 1997.
[62 FR 38217, July 17, 1997]
§ 52.2352
Change to approved plan.
(a) Utah Air Conservation Regulation R307-18-1, New Source Performance Standards, is removed from the approved plan. On June 10, 2002, we issued a letter delegating responsibility for all sources located, or to be located, in the State of Utah subject to the NSPS in 40 CFR part 60. See the table in 40 CFR 60.4 for the status of NSPS delegated to the state of Utah.
(b) Utah Administrative Code (UAC) rule R307-1-8, Asbestos Work Practices, Contractor Certification, AHERA Accreditation and AHERA Implementation, is removed from Utah's approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). This rule language pertains to the regulation of asbestos and is generally not related to attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and therefore it is not appropriate to be in Utah's SIP.
(c) Utah Administrative Code (UAC) rule R307-1-4.12, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs), is removed from Utah's approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). Utah has delegation of authority for NESHAPs in 40 CFR part 61 (49 FR 36368), pursuant to 110(k)(6) of the Act.
(d) Utah Administrative Code (UAC) rule R307-1-6, Eligibility of Pollution Control Expenditures for Sales Tax Exemption, is removed from Utah's approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). This rule language pertains to State Sales Tax Exemptions for Pollution Control Expenditures and is not generally related to attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and is therefore not appropriate to be in Utah's SIP.
(e) Utah Administrative Code (UAC) rule R307-102-3, Administrative Procedures and Hearings, and R307-414-3, Request for Review, are removed from Utah's approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). These provisions are not required by the CAA and are, therefore, not required to be in Utah's SIP. These provisions were last approved in 40 CFR 52.2320(c)(59)(i)(A).
(f) Utah Administrative Code (UAC) rule R307-1-4.06, Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems Program (CEMSP), is removed from Utah's approved State Implementation Plan (SIP). This rule has been superseded and replaced by rule R307-170, Continuous Emission Monitoring Program.
[67 FR 59000, Sept. 19, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 7682, Feb. 14, 2006; 72 FR 4645, Feb. 1, 2007; 72 FR 19385, Apr. 18, 2007]
§ 52.2353
Control strategy: Carbon monoxide.
Determination. EPA has determined that the Provo carbon monoxide “moderate” nonattainment area attained the carbon monoxide national ambient air quality standard by December 31, 1995. This determination is based on air quality monitoring data from 1994 and 1995.

standards. Section XXIII, Interstate Transport, of the Utah SIP submitted by the Utah Governor on March 22, 2007, satisfies the requirements of the Clean Air Act Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) for the 8-hour ozone and PM
2.5
NAAQS promulgated by EPA in July 1997. Section XXIII, Interstate Transport, was adopted by the UAQB on February 9, 2007. The March 22, 2007 Governor's letter included as an attachment a set of replacement pages for the Interstate Transport text. The new pages reflect correctly that the Interstate Transport declaration is under Section XXIII of the Utah SIP and not under Section XXII as incorrectly indicated in the pages submitted with the Administrative Documentation for the adoption of this SIP section.
(b) Addition to the Utah State Implementation Plan regarding the 2008 Pb Standard for CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) prongs 1, 2 and 4, submitted to EPA on January 19, 2012, and addition to the Utah SIP regarding the 2010 SO

§ 52.2382
Rules and regulations.
(a)
Non-Part D—No Action.
EPA is neither approving or disapproving the following elements of the revisions:
(1) Stack height requirements.
(2) [Reserved]
(b)
Regulation for visibility monitoring and new source review.
The provisions of §§ 52.26 and 52.27 are hereby incorporated and made a part of the applicable plan for the State of Vermont.
[45 FR 10782, Feb. 19, 1980, as amended at 45 FR 59315, Sept. 9, 1980; 46 FR 66789, Oct. 8, 1980; 46 FR 16897, Mar. 16, 1981; 50 FR 28553, July 12, 1985; 82 FR 29009, June 27, 2017]
§ 52.2383
Visibility protection.
(a) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met because the plan does not include approvable procedures meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 51.305 and 51.307 for protection of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas.
(b) Regulations for visibility monitoring and new source review. The provisions of § 52.27 are hereby incorporated and made part of the applicable plan for the State of Vermont.
[51 FR 5505, Feb. 13, 1986, as amended at 82 FR 3129, Jan. 10, 2017]
§ 52.2384
Stack height review.
The State of Vermont has declared to the satisfaction of EPA that no existing emission limitations have been affected by stack height credits greater than good engineering practice or any other prohibited dispersion techniques as defined in EPA's stack height regulations, as revised on July 8, 1985. This declaration was submitted to EPA on March 21, 1986. The State has further declared in a letter from Harold T. Garabedian, dated March 21, 1986, that, “[T]he State concludes that our present rule 5-502(4)(d) is adequate to insure that new emission sources will not be able to use credits from modeling ambient impacts at greater than ‘good engineering practice’ stack height or from using ‘other dispersion techniques.’ ” Thus, Vermont has satisfactorily demonstrated that its regulations meet 40 CFR 51.118 and 51.164.

(1) The permit shall require that the site's actual emissions of criteria pollutants shall not exceed the total emissions cap established pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) The permit shall require that the site's actual emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and PM
10
shall not exceed the respective individual pollutant cap established pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
(3) Compliance with the total emissions cap and individual pollutant caps shall be determined by comparing the respective cap to the 12-month rolling total for that cap. Compliance with the total emissions cap and individual pollutant caps shall be determined within one month of the end of each month based on the prior 12 months. The permit shall set forth the emission calculation techniques which the site shall use to calculate site-wide actual criteria pollutant emissions.
(4)
Installation of controls for significant modifications and significant new installations.
(i) This paragraph applies to significant modifications and significant new installations. Significant modifications for the purposes of this section are defined as changes to an existing process unit that result in an increase of the potential emissions of the process unit, after consideration of existing controls, of more than the significance levels listed in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section. Significant new installations for the purposes of this section are defined as new process units with potential emissions before controls that exceed the significance levels listed in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section. For purposes of this section, potential emissions means process unit point source emissions that would be generated by the process unit operating at its maximum capacity.
(ii) The significance levels for determining significant modifications and significant new installations are: 100 tons per year of carbon monoxide; 40 tons per year of nitrogen oxides; 40 tons per year of sulfur dioxide; 40 tons per year of volatile organic compounds; and 15 tons per year of PM
10
.
(iii) For any significant modification or significant new installation, the permit shall require that the site install, at the process unit, emission controls, pollution prevention or other technology that represents good environmental engineering practice in the pharmaceutical or batch processing industry, based on the emission characteristics (such as flow, variability, pollutant properties) of the process unit.
(f)
Operation of control equipment.
The permit shall require that the site shall continue to operate the emissions control equipment that was previously subject to permit requirements at the time of issuance of a permit pursuant to this section. This equipment shall be operated in a manner which minimizes emissions, considering the technical and physical operational aspects of the equipment and associated processes. This operation shall include an operation and maintenance program based on manufacturers' specifications and good engineering practice.
(g)
Powerhouse conversion.
The permit shall require that the site convert the steam-generating powerhouse from burning coal as the primary fuel to burning natural gas as the primary fuel and either No. 2 fuel oil or propane as backup fuel.
(1) The new boilers shall be equipped with low nitrogen oxides technology.
(2) The site shall complete the powerhouse conversion (completion of the powerhouse conversion) no later than 30 months after the effective date of the permit.
(h)
Monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting.
(1) The permit shall set forth monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the site-wide emissions caps. The monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements shall be structured in a tiered system, such that the requirements become more stringent as the site's emissions approach the total emissions cap.
(2) At a minimum, the permit shall require that the site submit to the permitting authority semi-annual reports of the site-wide criteria pollutant emissions (expressed as a 12-month rolling total) for each month covered
by the report. These reports shall include a calculation of the total emissions cap, as well as, the emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and PM
10
.
(3) Any reports required by the permit to be submitted on an annual or semi-annual basis shall contain a certification by the site's responsible official that to his belief, based on reasonable inquiry, the information submitted in the report is true, accurate, and complete.
(4) Any records required by the permit shall be retained on site for at least five years.
(i)
Air quality analysis.
The permittee shall demonstrate, prior to permit issuance and on a periodic basis which shall be specified in the permit, that emissions from construction or operation of the site will not cause or contribute to air pollution in excess of any:
(1) Maximum allowable increase or maximum allowable concentration for any pollutant, pursuant to section 165 of the Act;
(2) National ambient air quality standard or;
(3) Other applicable emission standard or standard of performance under the Act.
(j)
Termination.
(1) The permit may be terminated as provided in this paragraph for reasons which shall include the following, as well as any other termination provisions specified in the permit:
(i) If the Administrator or the permitting authority determines that continuation of the permit is an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare, or the environment;
(ii) If the permittee knowingly falsifies emissions data;
(iii) If the permittee fails to implement the powerhouse conversion pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section;
(iv) If the permittee receives four consent orders or two judgments adverse to the site arising from non-compliance with this permit in a five year period that are deemed material by the Administrator or the permitting authority; or
(v) If the total emissions cap is exceeded.
(2) In the event of termination, the Administrator or the permitting authority shall provide the permittee with written notice of its intent to terminate the permit. Within 30 calendar days of the site's receipt of this notice, the site may take corrective action to remedy the cause of the termination. If this remedy, which may include a corrective action plan and schedule, is deemed acceptable by the Administrator or the permitting authority (whichever agency provided written notice of its intent to terminate the permit), the action to terminate the permit shall be withdrawn. Otherwise, the permit shall be terminated in accordance with procedures specified in the permit.
(3) Termination of the permit does not waive the site's obligation to complete any corrective actions relating to non-compliance under the permit.
(k)
Inspection and entry.
(1) Upon presentation of credentials and other documents as may be required by law, the site shall allow authorized representatives of the Administrator and the permitting authority to perform the following:
(i) Enter upon the site;
(ii) Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions of the permit;
(iii) Have access at reasonable times to batch and other plant records needed to verify emissions.
(iv) Inspect at reasonable times any facilities, equipment (including monitoring and control equipment), practices, or operations required under the permit;
(v) Sample or monitor any substances or parameters at any location, during operating hours, for the purpose of assuring permit compliance or as otherwise authorized by the Act.

§ 52.2496
[Reserved]
§ 52.2497
Significant deterioration of air quality.
(a) The requirements of sections 160 through 165 of the Clean Air Act are not fully met because the plan does not include approvable procedures for preventing the significant deterioration of air quality from:
(1) Facilities with carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions from the industrial combustion of biomass in the following circumstances:
(i) Where a new major stationary source or major modification would be subject to Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) requirements for greenhouse gases (GHGs) under 40 CFR 52.21 but would not be subject to PSD under the state implementation plan (SIP) because CO
2
emissions from the industrial combustion of biomass are excluded from consideration as GHGs as a matter of state law under RCW 70.235.020(3); or
(ii) Where a new major stationary source or major modification is subject to PSD for GHGs under both the Washington SIP and the FIP, but CO
2
emissions from the industrial combustion of
biomass are excluded from consideration in the Ecology PSD permitting process because of the exclusion in RCW 70.235.020(3);
(2) Indian reservations in Washington, except for non-trust land within the exterior boundaries of the Puyallup Indian Reservation (also known as the 1873 Survey Area) as provided in the Puyallup Tribe of Indians Settlement Act of 1989, 25 U.S.C. 1773, and any other area where the EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction.
(3) Sources subject to PSD permits issued by the EPA prior to August 7, 1977, but only with respect to the general administration of any such permits still in effect (
e.g.,
modifications, amendments, or revisions of any nature).
(b)
Regulations for preventing significant deterioration of air quality.
The provisions of § 52.21, except paragraph (a)(1), are hereby incorporated and made a part of the applicable plan for Washington for the facilities, emission sources, geographic areas, and permits listed in paragraph (a) of this section. For situations addressed in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the EPA will issue a Federal PSD permit under § 52.21 to the new major stationary source or major modification addressing PSD requirements applicable to GHGs for all subject emission units at the source, regardless of whether CO
2
emissions resulted from the industrial combustion of biomass or from other sources of GHGs at the facility. For situations addressed in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the EPA will issue a Federal PSD permit under § 52.21 addressing PSD requirements applicable to GHGs for each subject emissions unit that is permitted to emit CO
2
from the industrial combustion of biomass.
(c) In accordance with section 164 of the Clean Air Act and the provisions of 40 CFR 52.21(g), the Spokane Indian Reservation is designated as a Class I area for the purposes of preventing significant deterioration of air quality.
(d) The regulations at 40 CFR 49.10191 through 49.10220 contain the Federal Implementation Plan for the Kalispel Indian Community of the Kalispel Reservation, Washington. The regulation at 40 CFR 49.10198(b) designates the original Kalispel Reservation, as established by Executive Order No. 1904, signed by President Woodrow Wilson on March 23, 1914, as a Class I area for purposes of prevention of significant deterioration of air quality.

§ 52.2498
Visibility protection.
(a) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not fully met because the plan does not include approvable procedures for visibility new source review for:
(1) Sources subject to the jurisdiction of Olympic Region Clean Air Agency;
(2) Indian reservations in Washington except for non-trust land within the exterior boundaries of the Puyallup Indian Reservation (also known as the 1873 Survey Area) as provided in the Puyallup Tribe of Indians Settlement Act of 1989, 25 U.S.C. 1773, and any other area where the EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction.
(b)
Regulations for visibility new source review.
The provisions of § 52.28 are hereby incorporated and made a part of the applicable plan for Washington for the facilities, emission sources, and geographic areas listed in paragraph (a) of this section.

§ 52.2522
Identification of plan-conditional approval.
With the exceptions set forth below in this subpart, the Administrator approves West Virginia's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards.
(a)-(f) [Reserved]
(g) The Administrator approves West Virginia's November 22, 1995 SIP submittal for the Follansbee, West Virginia PM-10 nonattainment area as fulfilling the section 189(a)(1)(B) requirement for a demonstration that the plan is sufficient to attain the PM-10 NAAQS.
(h) [Reserved]
(i)(1) EPA is fully approving WVDEP's August 31, 2011 submittal, except for the narrow issue of the requirement to include condensable emissions of particulate matter in the definition of “regulated NSR pollutant” found at 45CSR14 section 2.66. Except for this narrow issue, EPA is approving all other portions of the submittal, including but not limited to, the remainder of section 2.66. In approving West Virginia State Rule 45CSR14 with regard to all other CAA and Federal regulatory SIP requirements for PSD applicable as of the August 31, 2011 SIP revision submission date, EPA is acknowledging that it is consistent with the “Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule” (Tailoring Rule), which was promulgated on June 3, 2010 (75 FR 31514). EPA is not finalizing its proposed approval of WVDEP's August 31, 2011 submittal with respect to the narrow issue of the requirement to include condensable emissions of particulate matter in the definition of “regulated NSR pollutant” found at 45CSR14 section 2.66. In light of a comment received on its July 31, 2012 proposed rule (77 FR 45302), EPA is reviewing West Virginia State Rule 45CSR14 to determine the extent to which its definition of “regulated NSR pollutant” satisfies the corresponding Federal definition, and will address this issue in a separate action.
(2) EPA is also approving those portions of West Virginia's SIP submissions dated December 3, 2007, December 11, 2007, April 3, 2008, October 1, 2009, October 26, 2011, and February 17, 2012 which address the PSD-related requirements set forth in CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(II) for the 1997 PM
2.5
NAAQS, 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS, 2006 PM
2.5
NAAQS, 2008 lead NAAQS, and 2008 ozone NAAQS, as well as CAA Section 110(a)(2)(C) and (J) for the 2008 lead NAAQS and 2008 ozone NAAQS, except for the narrow issue of the requirement to include condensable emissions of particulate matter in the definition of “regulated NSR pollutant” found at 45CSR14 section 2.66. EPA is not finalizing its July 31, 2012 proposed approval (77 FR 45302) of WVDEP's SIP submissions dated December 3, 2007, December 11, 2007, April 3, 2008, October 1, 2009, October 26, 2011, and February 17, 2012 submitted to meet the PSD-related infrastructure SIP obligations set forth at CAA sections 110(a)(2)(C), (D)(i)(II) and (J) with respect to the narrow issue of the requirement to include condensable emissions of particulate matter in the definition of “regulated NSR pollutant” found at 45CSR14 section 2.66. EPA will address this issue in a separate action.
(j)(1) EPA is disapproving a narrow portion of West Virginia's August 31, 2011 submittal because it does not satisfy the requirement that emissions of PM
2.5
and PM
10
shall include gaseous emissions which condense to form particulate matter at ambient temperatures. This disapproval extends only to the lack of condensable emissions within the definition of “regulated NSR pollutant,” found at 45CSR14 section 2.66, and does not alter EPA's October 17, 2012 (77 FR 63736) approval of the remaining portions of West Virginia's August 2011 SIP submittal.
(2) EPA is disapproving specific portions of West Virginia's infrastructure SIP submissions dated December 3, 2007, December 11, 2007, April 3, 2008, October 1, 2009, October 26, 2011, and February 17, 2012 which address certain obligations set forth at CAA sections 110(a)(2)(C), (D)(i)(II) and (J) relating to
the West Virginia PSD permit program. Because West Virginia's definition of “regulated NSR pollutant” in 45CSR14 does not address condensables for PM
2.5
and PM
10
emissions, EPA is determining that West Virginia's infrastructure SIP submissions do not meet certain statutory and regulatory obligations relating to a PSD permit program set forth at CAA sections 110(a)(2)(C), (D)(i)(II) and (J) for the narrow issue of condensables as set forth in the following table.

(k) EPA is conditionally approving two West Virginia State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions submitted on July 1, 2014 and June 6, 2012 relating to revisions to 45CSR14 (Permits for Construction and Major Modification of Major Stationary Sources of Air Pollution for the Prevention of Significant Deterioration) for failure to include a significant monitoring concentration value (SMC) of zero micrograms per cubic meter for fine particulate matter (PM
2.5
). The conditional approval is based upon a commitment from the State to submit an additional SIP revision with a revised regulation at 45CSR14-16.7.c which will incorporate a SMC value of zero micrograms per cubic meter for PM
2.5
to address this discrepancy and to be consistent with federal requirements. If the State fails to meet its commitment by June 24, 2016, the approval is treated as a disapproval.

Approval status.
(a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Wisconsin's plans for the attainment and maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds the plans satisfy all requirements of Part D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the Ozone portion of the State Implementation Plan depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements on:
(1) Group III Control Techniques Guideline sources within 1 year after January 1st following the issuance of each Group III control technique guideline; and
(2) Major (actual emissions equal or greater than 100 tons VOC per year) non-control technique guideline sources in accordance with the State's schedule contained in the 1982 Ozone SIP revision for Southeastern Wisconsin.

§ 52.2573
General requirements.
(a) The requirements of § 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met since the plan does not provide for public availability of emission data.
(b)
Regulation for public availability of emission data.
(1) Any person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for making emission data available to the public, as specified in the applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the applicable plan.
(2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are January 1-June 30 and July 1-December 31.
(3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which the pertinent report is submitted.
(4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

§ 52.2585
Control strategy: Ozone.
(a) Disapproval—On November 6, 1986, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted as a proposed revision to the State's ozone State Implementation Plan a site-specific reasonably available control technology determination for a miscellaneous metal parts and products dip coating line. This line is located at the Gehl facility in Washington County, Wisconsin. In a May 31, 1988 (53 FR 19806), notice of proposed rulemaking, United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed to disapprove this site-specific revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan for ozone.
(b) Disapproval—On August 22, 1986, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a proposed revision to its ozone State Implementation Plan consisting of a site-specific reasonably available control technology determination for two miscellaneous metal parts and products spray coatings lines. These operations are located at the General Electric Company, Medical Systems facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, an area which has been designated as nonattainment for ozone, pursuant to section 107 of the Clean Air Act and 40 Code of Federal Regulations, part 81, § 81.350.
(c) [Reserved]
(d) Approval—On November 15, 1992, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan. The submittal pertained to the development of a process for assessing conformity of any federally-funded transportation and other federally funded projects in the nonattainment area.
(e) Approval—On January 15, 1993, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan for the 1990 base year inventory. The inventory was submitted by the State of Wisconsin to satisfy Federal requirements under section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (the Act), as a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP) for all areas in Wisconsin designated nonattainment, classified marginal to extreme. These areas include counties of Walworth, Door, Kewaunee, Manitowoc, Sheboygan, and the six county Milwaukee area (counties of Washington, Ozaukee, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Racine, and Kenosha).
(f) Approval—The Administrator approves the incorporation of the photochemical assessment ambient monitoring system submitted by Wisconsin
on November 15, 1993, into the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan. This submittal satisfies 40 CFR 58.20(f) which requires the State to provide for the establishment and maintenance of photochemical assessment monitoring stations (PAMS).
(g) Approval—On November 15, 1993, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan. The submittal pertained to a plan for forecasting VMT in the severe ozone nonattainment area of southeastern Wisconsin and demonstrated that Transportation Control Measures would not be necessary to offset growth in emissions.
(h) Approval—On November 15, 1993, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan. The submittal pertained to a plan for forecasting VMT in the severe ozone nonattainment area of southeastern Wisconsin and demonstrated that Transportation Control Measures would not be necessary to meet the 15 percent Rate-of-Progress milestone.
(i) Approval—EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen (NO
X
) reasonably available control technology (RACT), new source review (NSR), vehicle inspection/maintenance (I/M), and general conformity exemptions for the moderate and above ozone nonattainment areas within Wisconsin as requested by the States of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin in a July 13, 1994 submittal. This approval also covers the exemption of transportation and general conformity requirements of section 176(c) for the Door and Walworth marginal ozone nonattainment areas. Approval of these exemptions is contingent on the results of the final ozone attainment demonstration expected to be submitted in mid-1997. The approval will be modified if the final attainment demonstration demonstrates that NO
X
emission controls are needed in any of the nonattainment areas to attain the ozone standard in the Lake Michigan Ozone Study modeling domain.
(j) Approval—On June 14, 1995, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan. The submittal pertained to a plan for the implementation and enforcement of the Federal transportation conformity requirements at the State or local level in accordance with 40 CFR part 51, subpart T—Conformity to State or Federal Implementation Plans of Transportation Plans, Programs, and Projects Developed, Funded or Approved Under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act.
(k) Approval—On December 15, 1995, and May 15, 1996, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted requests to redesignate Walworth County and Sheboygan and Kewaunee Counties, respectively, from nonattainment to attainment for ozone. The State also submitted maintenance plans as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7505a. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plans include attainment emission inventories for NO
X
and VOC, demonstrations of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2007 for NO
X
and VOC, plans to verify continued attainment, and contingency plans. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS, determined to be caused by local sources is monitored, Wisconsin will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) contained in the contingency plan. Once a violation of the ozone NAAQS is recorded, the State will notify EPA and review the data for quality assurance. A plan to analyze the violation, including an analysis of meteorological conditions, will be submitted within 60 days to EPA-Region 5 for approval. Within 14 months of the violation, Wisconsin will complete and public notice the analysis and submit it to EPA-Region 5 for review. If the analysis shows that local sources caused the violation, Wisconsin will implement the contingency measures within 24 months after the violation. The contingency measures to be implemented in Walworth County are Stage II vapor recovery and non-Control Technology Guideline (non-CTG) Reasonably available control technology (RACT) limits. Contingency measures to be implemented in either Kewaunee or Sheboygan County are lower major source applicability thresholds for industrial sources and new gasoline
standards which will lower VOC emissions. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act, respectively.
(l) Wisconsin's November 15, 1994 request for a temporary delay of the ozone attainment date for Manitowoc County from 1996 to 2007 and suspension of the automatic reclassification of Manitowoc County to serious nonattainment for ozone is approved, based on Wisconsin's demonstration through photochemical grid modeling that transport from upwind areas makes it “practicably impossible” for the County to attain the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard by its original attainment date.
(m) Approval—On July 10, 1996, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan. The submittal pertained to a request to waive the Oxide of Nitrogen requirements for transportation conformity in the Milwaukee and Manitowoc ozone nonattainment areas.
(n) Approval—On September 8, 2000, Wisconsin submitted a revision to the ozone maintenance plan for the Walworth County area. The revision consists of allocating a portion of the Walworth County area's Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) safety margin to the transportation conformity Motor Vehicle Emission Budget (MVEB). The MVEB for transportation conformity purposes for the Walworth County area are now: 5.39 tons per day of VOC emissions and 7.20 tons per day of oxides of nitrogen emissions for the year 2007. This approval only changes the VOC transportation conformity MVEB for Walworth County.
(o) Approval—On December 11, 1997, Wisconsin submitted a post-1996 Rate Of Progress plan for the Milwaukee-Racine ozone nonattainment area as a requested revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan. Supplements to the December 11, 1997 plan were submitted on August 5, 1999, January 31, 2000, March 3, 2000, and February 21, 2001 establishing the post-1996 ROP plan for the Milwaukee-Racine ozone nonattainment area. This plan reduces ozone precursor emissions by 9 percent from 1990 baseline emissions by November 15, 1999.
(p) Approval—On December 27, 2000, Wisconsin submitted a one-hour ozone attainment demonstration plan as a revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan (SIP). Supplements to the December 27, 2001 plan were submitted on May 28, 2001, June 6, 2001, and August 29, 2001. This plan includes a modeled demonstration of attainment, rules for the reduction of ozone precursor emissions, a plan to reduce ozone precursor emissions by three percent per year from 2000 to 2007, an analysis of reasonably achievable control measures, an analysis of transportation conformity budgets, a revision of the waiver for emission of oxides of nitrogen, and commitments to conduct a mid-course review of the area's attainment status and to use the new MOBILE6 emissions model.
(q) Approval—On January 28, 2003, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a request to redesignate Manitowoc and Door Counties to attainment. Additional information was submitted on February 5, 2003 and February 27, 2003. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175 maintenance plan include a contingency plan and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. The 2013 motor vehicle emission budgets for Door County are 0.74 tons of volatile organic compounds (VOC) per day and 1.17 tons of oxides of nitrogen (NO
X
) per day. The 2013 motor vehicle emission budgets for Manitowoc County are 1.89 tons of VOC per day and 3.59 tons of NO
X
per day.
(r) Approval—On January 28, 2003, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a 1999 periodic emissions inventory for the Milwaukee-Racine area. Additional information was submitted on February 5, 2003 and February 27, 2003. The inventory meets the requirement of section 182(2)(3)(A) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990.
(s) Approval—On January 31, 2003, Wisconsin submitted a revision to the
ozone attainment plan for the Milwaukee severe ozone area and maintenance plan for Sheboygan County. These plans revised 2007 motor vehicle emission inventories and 2007 Motor Vehicle Emissions Budgets (MVEB) recalculated using the emissions factor model MOBILE6. The plan also included a new 2012 projected MVEB for the Sheboygan County.

(y)
Determination of attainment.
EPA has determined, as of March 1, 2011 that the Milwaukee-Racine, WI and Sheboygan, WI areas have attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. These determinations suspend the requirements for these areas to submit attainment demonstrations and associated reasonably available control measures (RACM), reasonable further progress plans (RFP), contingency measures, and other State Implementation Plan (SIP) revisions related to attainment of the standard for as long as the areas continue to attain the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. These determinations also stay the requirement for EPA to promulgate attainment demonstration and RFP Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) for these areas. On July 15, 2019, EPA revised the designation for the Sheboygan, WI area for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard, by splitting the original area into two distinct nonattainment areas, called the Inland Sheboygan County, WI area and Shoreline Sheboygan County, WI area, that together cover the identical geographic area of the original nonattainment area. EPA's March 1, 2011 determination of attainment for the Sheboygan County, WI area applies to the Inland Sheboygan County, WI area and Shoreline Sheboygan County, WI area.
(z) Approval—Wisconsin submitted 2005 VOC and NO
X
emissions inventories for the Milwaukee-Racine and Sheboygan areas on September 11, 2009, and supplemented the submittal on November 16, 2011. Wisconsin's 2005 inventories satisfy the emissions inventory requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act for the Milwaukee-Racine and Sheboygan areas under the 1997 8-hour ozone standard.
(aa) Approval—On September 11, 2009, Wisconsin submitted a request to redesignate the Milwaukee-Racine area to attainment of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. The state supplemented this submittal on November 16, 2011. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Elements of the section 175 maintenance plan include a contingency plan and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. The ozone maintenance plan also establishes 2015 and 2022 Motor Vehicle Emission Budgets (MVEBs) for the area. The 2015 MVEBs for the Milwaukee-Racine area is 21.08 tpd for VOC and 51.22 tpd for NO
X
. The 2022 MVEBs for the Milwaukee-Racine area is 15.98 tpd for VOC and 31.91 tpd for NO
X
.

Review of new sources and modifications.
Disapproval—On May 12, 2011, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a proposed revision to its State Implementation Plan to update its rules to match the 2008 New Source Review Implementation Rule for PM
2.5
. The State supplemented the submittal on March 5, 2012. EPA determined that this submittal was not approvable because the revisions did not explicitly identify the precursors to PM
2.5
and did not contain the prescribed language to ensure that gases that condense to form PM, known as condensables, are regulated within PM
2.5
and PM
10
emission limits.

(55) On January 28, 1985, Wisconsin submitted its Rothschild (Marathon County) SO
2
plan, which contains emission limits for sources in the City of Rothschild and the Town of Weston, specifically for the Weyerhaeuser Paper Company and the Reed-Lignin Company, respectively. USEPA is approving NR 418.08 because this revision meets the requirements of part D of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7501-7508. The Wisconsin SIP, however, contains additional existing requirements for SO
2
. Today's action on NR 418.08 has been integrated within Wisconsin's existing SIP regulations, and does not eliminate a source's obligation to comply with all existing SO
2
SIP requirements. Specifically, today's action in no way affects the terms and conditions of a Federal Consent Decree entered into by USEPA and the Weyerhaeuser Company located in Rothschild, Wisconsin No. 89-C-0973-C (W.D. Wis., filed November 1, 1989). This Consent Decree resolves USEPA's enforcement action against Weyerhaeuser Company for violations of SIP rule NR 154.12(1) (now recodified as 418.08). In that Decree, Weyerhaeuser committed to comply with NR 154.12(1) by installing a desulfurization scrubber. August 15, 1989, the WDNR issued a construction permit to Weyerhaeuser which limit the combined emissions of Weyerhaeuser's acid plant and desulfurization scrubber to 28 pounds of SO
2
per hour. The conditions and terms of this construction permit and of the Consent Decree remain federally enforceable. On May 9, 1987, 18 months
past the effective date of USEPA's designation of Marathon County as a primary SO
2
non-attainment area (October 9, 1985, (50 FR 41139)), a construction moratorium was imposed in Marathon County under section 110(a)(2)(I) of the Clean Air Act because the county did not have a USEPA approved plan which assured the attainment and maintenance of the SO
2
NAAQS. However, USEPA final approval of Rothschild's SO
2
SIP will lift the section 110(a)(2)(I) construction ban in Marathon County.

, standards and revising the coarse particulate matter, PM
10
, standards. Wisconsin added annual and 24-hour PM
2.5
standards. It also revoked the annual PM
10
ambient air quality standard while retaining the 24-hour PM
10
standard. On January 4, 2018, the WDNR submitted a SIP revision request updating its ambient air quality standards for fine particulate matter to be consistent with EPA's 2012 revisions to the fine particulate matter national ambient air quality standards.

Method.
(A) For any hour in which fuel is combusted in a unit, the owner/operator of each unit shall calculate the hourly average NO
X
emission rates in lb/MMBtu at the CEMS in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 75. At the end of each operating day, the owner/operator shall calculate and record a new 30-day rolling average emission rate in lb/MMBtu from the arithmetic average of all valid hourly emission rates from the CEMS for the current operating day and the previous 29 successive operating days.
(B) At the end of each calendar year, the owner/operator shall calculate the annual average SO
2
emission rate in lb/MMBtu across Laramie River Station Units 1 and 2 as the sum of the SO
2
annual mass emissions (pounds) divided by the sum of the annual heat inputs (MMBtu). For Laramie River Station Units 1 and 2, the owner/operator shall calculate the annual mass emissions for SO
2
and the annual heat input in accordance with 40 CFR part 75 for each unit.
(C) An hourly average SO
2
and/or NO
X
emission rate in lb/MMBtu is valid only if the minimum number of data points, as specified in 40 CFR part 75, is acquired by both the pollutant concentration monitor (SO
2
and/or NO
X
) and the diluent monitor (O
2
or CO
2
).
(D) Data reported to meet the requirements of this section shall not include data substituted using the missing data substitution procedures of subpart D of 40 CFR part 75, nor shall the data have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of 40 CFR part 75.
(2) For all Trona Plant BART units:
(i)
CEMS.
At all times after the compliance date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the owner/operator of each unit shall maintain, calibrate, and operate a CEMS, in full compliance with the requirements found at 40 CFR part 60, to accurately measure NO
X
, diluent, and stack gas volumetric flow rate from each unit, including the CEMS quality assurance requirements in appendix F of 40 CFR part 60. The CEMS shall be used to determine compliance with the emission limitations in paragraph (c) of this section for each unit.
(ii)
Method.
(A) For any hour in which fuel is combusted in a unit, the owner/operator of each unit shall calculate the hourly average NO
X
emission rate in lb/MMBtu at the CEMS in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part 60. At the end of each operating day, the owner/operator shall calculate and record a new 30-day rolling average emission rate in lb/MMBtu from the arithmetic average of all valid hourly emission rates from the CEMS for the current operating day and the previous 29 successive operating days.
(B) An hourly average NO
X
emission rate in lb/MMBtu is valid only if the minimum number of data points, as specified in 40 CFR part 60, is acquired by both the pollutant concentration monitor (NO
X
) and the diluent monitor (O
2
or CO
2
).
(f)
Compliance determinations for particulate matter.
Compliance with the
particulate matter emission limit for each BART unit shall be determined from annual performance stack tests. Within 60 days of the compliance deadline specified in paragraph (d) of this section, and on at least an annual basis thereafter, the owner/operator of each unit shall conduct a stack test on each unit to measure particulate emissions using EPA Method 5, 5B, 5D, or 17, as appropriate, in 40 CFR part 60, Appendix A. A test shall consist of three runs, with each run at least 120 minutes in duration and each run collecting a minimum sample of 60 dry standard cubic feet. Results shall be reported in lb/MMBtu. In addition to annual stack tests, the owner/operator shall monitor particulate emissions for compliance with the BART emission limits in accordance with the applicable Compliance Assurance Monitoring (CAM) plan developed and approved by the State in accordance with 40 CFR part 64.
(g)
Recordkeeping.
The owner/operator shall maintain the following records for at least five years:
(1) All CEMS data, including the date, place, and time of sampling or measurement; parameters sampled or measured; and results.
(2) Records of quality assurance and quality control activities for emissions measuring systems including, but not limited to, any records required by 40 CFR part 75. Or, for Trona Plant units, records of quality assurance and quality control activities for emissions measuring systems including, but not limited to appendix F of 40 CFR part 60.
(3) Records of all major maintenance activities conducted on emission units, air pollution control equipment, and CEMS.
(4) Any other CEMS records required by 40 CFR part 75. Or, for Trona Plant units, any other CEMs records required by 40 CFR part 60.
(5) Records of all particulate stack test results.
(6) All data collected pursuant to the CAM plan.

(2) The entire regulation as it applies to the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority's Christiansted Power Plant on the island of St. Croix.
(3) The entire regulation excluding subsection (a)(2) as it applies to the remaining sources on the island of St. Croix.
Subsection (a)(2) of the regulation is not approved as it applies to the remaining sources on St. Croix because of the inadequacy of the control strategy demonstration noted in paragraph (a) of this section. Accordingly, all sources on St. Croix with the exception of the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority's Christiansted Power Plant are required to conform to the sulfur-in-fuel-oil limitations contained in 12 V.I.R. and R. 9:204-26 as originally submitted to EPA on January 31, 1972.
(c) Reference to “Section (a)(2)” in subsection (d) of 12 V.I.R. and R. 9:204-26, as submitted to EPA on January 21, 1976 and as amended and resubmitted to EPA on June 3, 1976, refers to the following approved limitations: (1) For the islands of St. Thomas and St. John, subsection (a)(2) of section 204-26 as submitted to EPA on January 21, 1976 and as amended and resubmitted to EPA on June 3, 1976; (2) for the island of St. Croix, subsection (a)(2) of section 204-26 as originally submitted to EPA on January 31, 1972 and approved by EPA on May 31, 1972.
[41 FR 28493, July 12, 1976, as amended at 41 FR 55531, Dec. 21, 1976; 43 FR 4016, Jan. 31, 1978; 51 FR 40676, Nov. 7, 1986]
§ 52.2781
Visibility protection.
(a) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met, because the plan does not include approvable procedures for protection of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas.
(b)-(c) [Reserved]
(d) Regional Haze Plan for Virgin Islands National Park. The regional haze plan for the Virgin Islands consists of a Federal Implementation Plan entitled: “FEDERAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR REGIONAL HAZE FOR THE UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS.” The applicable requirements consist of:
(1)
Applicability.
This section addresses Clean Air Act requirements and EPA's rules to prevent and remedy future and existing man-made impairment of visibility in the mandatory Class I area of the Virgin Islands National Park through a Regional Haze Program. This section applies to the owner and operator of HOVENSA L.L.C. (HOVENSA), a petroleum refinery located on St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.
(2)
Definitions.
Terms not defined below shall have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act or EPA's regulations implementing the Clean Air Act. For purposes of this section:
NO
X
means nitrogen oxides.
Owner/operator
means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises a facility or source identified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
PM
means particulate matter.
Process unit
means any collection of structures and/or equipment that processes, assembles, applies, blends, or otherwise uses material inputs to produce or store an intermediate or a completed product. A single stationary source may contain more than one process unit, and a process unit may contain more than one emissions unit. For a petroleum refinery, there are several categories of process units that could include: Those that separate and/or distill petroleum feedstocks; those that change molecular structures; petroleum treating processes; auxiliary facilities, such as steam generators and hydrogen production units; and those that load, unload, blend or store intermediate or completed products.
SO
2
means sulfur dioxide.
Startup
means the setting in operation of an affected facility for any purpose.
(3)
Reasonable Progress Measures.
On June 7, 2011, EPA and HOVENSA entered into a Consent Decree (CD) in the U.S. District Court for the Virgin Islands to resolve alleged Clean Air Act violations at its St. Croix, Virgin Islands facility. The CD requires HOVENSA, among other things, to achieve emission limits and install new pollution controls pursuant to a schedule for compliance. The measures required by the CD reduce emissions of NO
X
by 5,031 tons per year (tpy) and SO
2
by 3,460 tpy. The emission limitations, pollution controls, schedules for compliance, reporting, and recordkeeping provisions of the HOVENSA CD constitute an element of the long term strategy and address the reasonable progress provisions of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1). Should the existing federally enforceable HOVENSA CD be revised, EPA will reevaluate, and if necessary, revise the FIP after public notice and comment.
(4)
HOVENSA requirement for notification.
HOVENSA must notify EPA 60 days in advance of startup and resumption of operation of refinery process units at the HOVENSA, St. Croix, Virgin Islands facility. HOVENSA shall submit such notice to the Director of the Clean Air and Sustainability Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 2, 290 Broadway, 25th Floor, New York, New York, 10007-1866. HOVENSA's notification to EPA that it intends to startup refinery process units must include information regarding those emission units that will be operating, including unit design parameters such as heat input and hourly emissions, information on potential to emit limitations, pollution controls and control efficiencies, and schedules for compliance. EPA will revise the FIP as necessary, after public notice and comment, in accordance with regional haze requirements including the “reasonable progress” provisions in 40 CFR 51.308(d)(1). HOVENSA will be required to install any controls that are required by the revised FIP as expeditiously as practicable, but no later
than 5 years after the effective date of the revised FIP.
(5)
Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) measures.
Emissions limitations, the owners/operators subject to this section shall not emit or cause to be emitted SO

5.
Performance Specification Test Procedures.
The following test procedures shall be used to determine compliance with the requirements of paragraph 4:
5.1
Calibration test.
5.1.1 Analyze each calibration gas mixture (50 percent, 90 percent) for sulfur dioxide by the Reference method and record the results on the example sheet shown in Figure D-1. This step may be omitted for nonextractive monitors where dynamic calibration gas mixtures are not used (see section 5.1.2).
5.1.2 Set up and calibrate the complete measurement system according to the manufacturer's written instructions. This may be accomplished either in the laboratory or in the field. Make a series of five nonconsecutive readings with span gas mixtures alternately at each concentration (example, 50 percent, 90 percent, 50 percent, 90 percent, 50 percent). For nonextractive measurement systems, this test may be performed using procedures specified by the manufacturer and two or more calibration gases whose concentrations are certified by the manufacturer and differ by a factor of two or more. Convert the measurement system output readings to ppm and record the results on the example sheet shown in Figure D-2.
5.2
Field Test for Accuracy
(
Relative
),
Zero Drift and Calibration Drift.
Install and operate the measurement system in accordance with the manufacturer's written instructions and drawings as follows:
5.2.1
Conditioning Period.
Offset the zero setting at least 10 percent of span so that negative zero drift may be quantified. Operate the system for an initial 168-hour conditioning period. During this period the system should measure the SO
2
content of the effluent in a normal operational manner.
5.2.2
Operational Test Period.
Operate the system for an additional 168-hour period. The system shall be monitoring the source effluent at all times when not being zeroed, calibrated or backpurged.
5.2.2.1
Field Test for Accuracy
(
Relative
). The analyzer output for the following test shall be maintained between 20 percent and 90 percent of span. It is recommended that a calibrated gas mixture be used to verify the span setting utilized. During this 168-hour test period, make a minimum of nine (9) SO
2
concentration measurements using the Reference Method with a sampling period of one hour. If a measurement system operates across the stack or a portion of it, the Reference Method test shall make a four-point traverse over the measurement system operating path. Isokinetic sampling and analysis for SO
3
and H
2
SO
4
mist are not required. For measurement systems employing extractive sampling, place the measurement system and the Reference Method probe tips adjacent to each other in the duct. One test will consist of two simultaneous samples with not less than two analyses on each sample. Record the test data and measurement system concentrations on the example sheet shown in Figure D-3.
5.2.2.2
Field Test for Zero Drift and Calibration Drift.
Determine the values given by zero and span gas SO
2
concentrations at 2-hour intervals until 15 sets of data are obtained. Alternatively, for nonextractive measurement systems, determine the values given by an electrically or mechanically produced zero condition, and by inserting a certified calibration gas concentration equivalent to not less than 20 percent of span, into the measurement system. Record these readings on the example sheet shown in Figure D-4. These 2-hour periods need not be consecutive but may not overlap. If the analyzer span is set at the expected maximum concentration for the tests performed under section 5.2.2, then the zero and span determinations to be made under this paragraph may be made concurrent with the tests under section 5.2.2.1. Zero and calibration corrections and adjustments are allowed only at 24-hour intervals (except as required under section 5.2.2) or at such shorter intervals as the manufacturer's written instructions specify. Automatic corrections made by the measurement system without operator intervention or initiation are allowable at any time. During the entire 168-hour test period, record the values given by zero and span gas SO
2
concentrations before and after adjustment at 24-hour intervals in the example sheet shown in Figure D-5.
5.3
Field Test for Response Time.
5.3.1 This test shall be accomplished using the entire measurement system as installed including sample transport lines if used. Flow rates, line diameters, pumping rates, pressures (do not allow the pressurized calibration gas to change the normal operating pressure in the sample line), etc., shall be at the nominal values for normal operation as specified in the manufacturer's written instructions. In the case of cyclic analyzers, the response time test shall include one cycle.
5.3.2 Introduce a zero concentration of SO
2
into the measurement system sampling interface or as close to the sampling interface as possible. When the system output reading has stabilized, switch quickly to a known concentration of SO
2
at 70 to 90 percent of span. Record the time from concentration switching to final stable response. After the system response has stabilized at the upper level, switch quickly to a zero concentration of SO
2
. Record the time from concentration switching to final stable response. Alternatively, for nonextractive monitors, a calibration gas concentration equivalent to 20 percent of span or more may be switched into and out of the sample path and response times recorded. Perform this test sequence three (3) times. For each test record the results on the example sheet shown in Figure D-6.

6.2
Data Analysis and Reporting.
6.2.1
Accuracy
(
Relative
). For each of the nine reference method testing periods, determine the average sulfur dioxide concentration reported by the continuous measurement system. These average concentrations shall be determined from the measurement
system data recorded under section 5.2.2.1 by integrating the pollutant concentrations over each of the time intervals concurrent with each reference method test, then dividing by the cumulative time of each applicable reference method testing period. Before proceeding to the next step, determine the basis (wet or dry) of the measurement system data and reference method test data concentrations.
If the bases are not consistent, apply a moisture correction to either the referenced method concentrations or the measurement system concentrations, as appropriate. Determine the correction factor by moisture tests concurrent with the reference method testing periods. Report the moisture test method and the correction procedure employed. For each of the nine test runs, subtract the Reference Method test concentrations from the continuous monitoring system average concentrations. Using these data, compute the mean difference and the 95 percent confidence interval using equations D-1 and D-2. Accuracy is reported as the sum of the absolute value of the mean difference and the 95 percent confidence interval expressed as a percentage of the mean reference method value. Use the example sheet shown in Figure D-3.
6.2.2
Calibration Error.
Using the data from section 5.1 of this appendix, subtract the measured SO
2
value determined under section 5.1.1 (Figure D-1) from the value shown by the measurement system for each of the 5 readings at each concentration measured under section 5.1.2 (Figure D-2). Calculate the mean of these difference values and the 95 percent confidence intervals according to equations D-1 and D-2. The calibration error is reported as the sum of absolute value of the mean difference and the 95 percent confidence interval as a percentage of each respective calibration gas concentration. Use example sheet shown in Figure D-2.
6.2.3
Zero Drift
(
2-hour
). Using the zero concentration values measured each two hours during the field test, calculate the differences between
consecutive
two-hour readings expressed in ppm. Calculate the mean difference and the confidence interval using Equations D-1 and D-2. Report the zero drift as the sum of the absolute mean value and the confidence interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use example sheet shown in Figure D-4.
6.2.4
Zero Drift
(
24-hour
). Using the zero concentration values measured every 24 hours during the field test, calculate the differences between the zero point after zero adjustment and the zero value 24 hours later just prior to zero adjustment. Calculate the mean value of these points and the confidence interval using Equations D-1 and D-2. Report the zero drift as the sum of the absolute mean and confidence interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use example sheet shown in Figure D-5.
6.2.5
Calibration Drift
(
2-hour
). Using the calibration values obtained at two-hour intervals during the field test, calculate the differences between
consecutive
two-hour readings expressed as ppm. These values should be corrected for the corresponding zero drift during that two-hour period. Calculate the mean and confidence interval of these corrected difference values using Equations D-1 and D-2. Do not use the differences between non-consecutive readings. Report the calibration drift as the sum of the absolute mean and confidence interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use the example sheet shown in Figure D-4.
6.2.6
Calibration Drift
(
24-hour
). Using the calibration values measured every 24 hours during the field test, calculate the differences between the calibration concentration reading after zero and calibration adjustment and the calibration concentration reading 24 hours later after zero adjustment but before calibration adjustment. Calculate the mean value of these differences and the confidence interval using equations D-1 and D-2. Report the sum of the absolute mean and confidence interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use the example sheet shown in Figure D-5.
6.2.7
Response Time.
Using the charts from section 5.3 of this Appendix, calculate the time interval from concentration switching to 95 percent to the final stable value for all upscale and downscale tests. Report the mean of the three upscale test times and the mean of the three downscale test times. For nonextractive instruments using a calibration gas cell to determine response time, the observed times shall be extrapolated to 90 percent of full scale response time. For example, if the observed time for a 20 percent of span gas cell is one minute, this would be equivalent to a 4
1/2
-minute response time when extrapolated to 90 percent of span. The two average times should not differ by more than 15 percent of the slower time. Report the slower time as the system response time. Use the example sheet shown in Figure D-6.
6.2.8
Operational Period.
During the 168-hour performance and operational test period, the measurement system shall not require any corrective maintenance, repair, replacement, or adjustment other than that clearly specified as required in the operation and maintenance manuals as routine and expected during a one-week period. If the measurement system operates within the specified performance parameters and does not require corrective maintenance, repair, replacement or adjustment other than specified above, during the 168-hour test period, the operational period will be successfully concluded. Failure of the measurement to meet this requirement shall call for a repetition of the 168-hour test period. Portions of
the test which were satisfactorily completed need not be repeated. Failure to meet any performance specifications shall call for a repetition of the one-week performance test period and that portion of the testing which is related to the failed specification. All maintenance and adjustments required shall be recorded. Output readings shall be recorded before and after all adjustments.
6.2.9
Performance Specifications Testing Frequency.
In the event that significant repair work is performed in the system, the company shall demonstrate to the Administrator that the system still meets the performance specifications listed in Table I of this appendix. The Administrator may require a performance test at any time he determines that such test is necessary to verify the performance of the measurement system.

# Appendix E to Part 52—Performance Specifications and, Specification Test Procedures for Monitoring Systems for Effluent Stream Gas Volumetric Flow Rate
1.
Principle and applicability.
1.1
Principle.
Effluent stream gas volumetric flow rates are sampled and analyzed by a continuous measurement system. To verify the measurement system performance, values obtained from the measurement system are compared against simultaneous values obtained using the reference method. These comparison tests will be performed to determine the relative accuracy, and drift of the measurement system over the range of operating conditions expected to occur during normal operation of the source. If the measurement system is such that the specified tests in section 5.1 for drift do not apply, those test procedures shall be disregarded.
1.2
Applicability.
This method is applicable to subparts which require continuous gas volumetric flow rate measurement. Specifications are given in terms of performance. Test procedures are given for determining compliance with performance specifications.
2.
Apparatus.
2.1 Continuous measurement system for determining stack gas volumetric flow rate.
2.2 Equipment for measurement of stack gas volumetric flow rate as specified in the reference method.
3.
Definitions.
3.1
Measurement system.
The total equipment required for the determination of the gas volumetric flow rate in a duct or stack. The system consists of three major subsystems:
3.1.1
Sampling interface.
That portion of the measurement system that performs one or more of the following operations: Delineation, acquisition, transportation, and conditioning of a signal from the stack gas and protection of the analyzer from any hostile aspects of the source environment.
3.1.2
Analyzer.
That portion of the measurement system which senses the stack gas flow rate or velocity pressure and generates a signal output that is a function of the flow rate or velocity of the gases.
3.1.3
Data presentation.
That portion of the measurement system that provides a display of the output signal in terms of volumetric flow rate units, or other units which are convertible to volumetric flow rate units.
3.2
Span.
The value of gas volumetric flow rate at which the measurement system is set to produce the maximum data display output. For the purposes of this method, the span shall be set at 1.5 times the maximum volumetric flow rate expected under varying operating conditions of the source.
3.3
Zero drift.
The change in measurement system output over a stated period of time of normal continuous operation when gas volumetric flow rate at the time of the measurements is zero.
3.4
Calibration drift.
The change in measurement system output over a stated time period of normal continuous operation when the gas volumetric flow rate at the time of the measurement is 67 percent of the span value.
3.5
Operation period.
A minimum period of time over which a measurement system is expected to operate within certain performance specifications without unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment.
3.6
Orientation sensitivity.
The angular tolerance to which the sensor can be misaligned from its correct orientation to measure the flow rate vector before a specified error occurs in the indicated flow rate compared to the reference flow rate.
3.7
Reference method.
Method 2 as delineated in 40 CFR Part 60.
4.
Measurement system performance specifications.
A measurement system must meet the performance specifications in Table E-1 to be considered acceptable under this method.
Table E-1
Parameter
Specifications
Accuracy (relative)
10 percent of mean reference value (paragraph 6.3.1).
Zero drift (24 hours)
3 percent of span (paragraph 6.3.2).
Calibration drift (24 hours)
3 percent of span (paragraph 6.3.3).
Operational period
168 hours minimum.
5.
Test procedures.
5.1 Field test for accuracy, zero drift, calibration drift, and operation period.
5.1.1
System conditioning.
Set up and operate the measurement system in accordance with the manufacturer's written instructions and drawings. Offset the zero point of the chart recorder so that negative values up to 5 percent of the span value may be registered. Operate the system for an initial 168-hour conditioning period. During this initial period, the system should measure the gas stream volumetric flow rate in a normal operational manner. After completion of this conditioning period, the formal 168-hour performance and operational test period shall begin.
5.1.2
Field test for accuracy and operational period.
During the 168-hour test period, the system should be continuously measuring gas volumetric flow rate at all times. During this period make a series of 14 volumetric flow rate determinations simultaneously using the reference method and the measurement system. The 14 determinations can be made at any time interval at least one hour apart during the 168-hour period except that at least one determination on five different days must be made with one determination on the last day of such period. The determinations shall be conducted over the range of volumetric flow rates expected to occur during normal operation of the source. The measurement system volumetric flow rate reading corresponding to the period of time during which each reference method run was made may be obtained by continuous integration of the measurement system signal over the test interval. Integration may be by use of mechanical integration of electrical units on the chart recorder or use of a planimeter on the strip chart recorder. The location and orientation of the reference method measurement device and the measurement system should be as close as practical without interference, but no closer than 1.3 cm (0.5 inch) to each other and shall be such that dilution air or other interferences cannot be interjected into the stack or duct between the pitot tube and the measurement system. Be careful not to locate the reference method pitot tube directly up or down stream of the measurement system sensor.
5.1.3
Field test for calibration drift and zero drift.
At 24-hour intervals, but more frequently if recommended by the manufacturer, subject the measurement system to the manufacturer's specified zero and calibration procedures, if appropriate. Record the measurement system output readings before and after adjustment. Automatic corrections made by the system without operator intervention are allowable at anytime.
5.1.4
Field test for orientation sensitivity.
If a velocity measurement system is either a single point measurement device or a pressure sensor or any other device such as pitot tube which uses the flow direction of the test gas, then the following test shall be followed and a performance specification of ±10 degrees device orientation sensitivity for ±4 percent flow rate determination accuracy must be met in order for the measurement system to be considered acceptable under this method. This is in addition to the performance specifications given in paragraph 4 of this appendix. During a period of relatively steady state gas flow, perform the following orientation test using the measurement system. The system should be continuously measuring gas velocity at all times. Rotate the measurement 10° on each side of the direction of flow in increments of 5°. Perform this test three times each at:
(1) Maximum operating velocity (±15 percent);
(2) 67 percent ±7.5 percent of the maximum operating velocity; and
(3) 33 percent ±7.5 percent of the maximum operating velocity if (2) and (3) are normal operating practices.

6.3
Data analysis and reporting.
6.3.1
Accuracy
(
relative
). First, calculate the mean reference value (Equation E-1) of the 14 average volumetric flow rates calculated by the reference method. Second, from the 14 pairs of average volumetric flow rates calculated by the reference method and measurement system volumetric flow rate readings, calculate the mean value (Equation E-1) of the differences of the 14 paired readings. Calculate the 95 percent confidence interval (Equation E-2) using the differences of fourteen paired readings. To calculate the values in the second part of this section substitute
d
i
for
x
i
and
d
for
x
in Equations E-1 and E-2 where
d
i
equals the difference of each paired reading and
d
equals the mean value of the fourteen paired differences. Third, report the sum of the absolute mean value of the differences of the fourteen paired readings and the 95 percent confidence interval of the differences of value calculated in the first part of the section. Divide this total by the mean reference value and report the result as a percentage. This percentage is the relative accuracy.
6.3.2
Zero drift
(
24 hour
). From the zero values measured each 24 hours during the field test, calculate the differences between successive readings expressed in volumetric flow rate units. Calculate the mean value of these differences and the confidence interval of these differences using Equations E-1 and E-2. Report the sum of the absolute value of the mean difference and the confidence interval as a percentage of the measurement system span. This percentage is the zero drift.
6.3.3
Calibration drift
(
24 hour
). From the calibration values measured every 24 hours during the field test calculate the differences between: (1) The calibration reading after zero and calibration adjustment, and (2) the calibration reading 24 hours later after zero adjustment but before calibration adjustment. Calculate the mean value of these differences and the confidence interval using Equations E-1 and E-2. Report the sum of the absolute value of the mean difference and confidence interval as a percentage of the measurement system span. This percentage is the calibration drift.
6.3.4
Operation period.
Other than that clearly specified as required in the operation and maintenance manual, the measurement system shall not require any corrective maintenance, repair, replacement or adjustment during the 168-hour performance and operational test period. If the measurement system operates within the specified performance parameters and does not require corrective maintenance, repair, replacement or adjustment other than as specified above during the 168-hour test period, the operational period will be successfully concluded. Failure of the measurement to meet this requirement shall call for a repetition of the 168-hour test period. Portions of the test, except for the 168-hour field test period, which were satisfactorily completed need not be repeated. Failure to meet any performance specifications shall call for a repetition of the one-week performance test period and that portion of the testing which is related to the failed specification. All maintenance and adjustments required shall be recorded. Output readings shall be recorded before and after all adjustments.
6.3.5
Orientation sensitivity.
In the event the conditions of paragraph 5.1.4 of this appendix are required, the following calculations shall be performed. Calculate the ratio of each measurement system reading divided by the reference pitot tube readings. Graph the ratio vs. angle of deflection on each side of center. Report the points at which the ratio differs by more than ±4 percent from unity (1.00).
