# 3.6.4 Tests for a Heat Pump Having a Variable-Speed Compressor
a. Conduct one maximum temperature test (H0
1
), two high temperature tests (H1
N
and H1
1
), one frost accumulation test (H2
V
), and one low temperature test (H3
2
). Conducting one or both of the following tests is optional: An additional high temperature test (H1
2
) and an additional frost accumulation test (H2
2
). If desired, conduct the optional maximum temperature cyclic (H0C

the default value of 0.25. Test conditions for the eight tests are specified in Table 14 to this appendix. The compressor shall operate at the same heating full speed, measured by RPM or power input frequency (Hz), for the H1
2
, H2
2
and H3
2
tests. For a cooling/heating heat pump, the compressor shall operate for the H1

# 3.6.5 Additional Test for a Heat Pump Having a Heat Comfort Controller
Test any heat pump that has a heat comfort controller (see section 1.2 of this appendix, Definitions) according to section 3.6.1, 3.6.2, or 3.6.3, whichever applies, with the heat comfort controller disabled. Additionally, conduct the abbreviated test described in section 3.1.10 of this appendix with the heat comfort controller active to determine the system's maximum supply air temperature. (
Note:
Heat pumps having a variable speed compressor and a heat comfort controller are not covered in the test procedure at this time.)

# 3.6.6 Heating Mode Tests for Northern Heat Pumps With Triple-Capacity Compressors.
Test triple-capacity, northern heat pumps for the heating mode as follows:
a. Conduct one maximum-temperature test (H0
1
), two high-temperature tests (H1
2
and H1
1
), one frost accumulation test (H2
2
), two low-temperature tests (H3
2
, H3
3
), and one minimum-temperature test (H4
3
). Conduct an additional frost accumulation test (H2
1
) and low-temperature test (H3
1
) if both of the following conditions exist: (1) Knowledge of the heat pump's capacity and electrical power at low compressor capacity for outdoor temperatures of 37 °F and less is needed to complete the section 4.2.6 seasonal performance calculations; and (2) the heat pump's controls allow low-capacity operation at outdoor temperatures of 37 °F and less. If the above two conditions are met, an alternative to conducting the H2
1
frost accumulation test to determine Q
h
k=1
(35) and E
h
k=1
(35) is to use the following equations to approximate this capacity and electrical power:
ER05JA17.310
In evaluating the above equations, determine the quantities Q
h
k=1
(47) from the H1
1
test and evaluate them according to section 3.7 of this appendix. Determine the quantities Q
h
k=1
(17) and E
h
k=1
(17) from the H3
1
test and evaluate them according to section 3.10 of this appendix. Use the paired values of Q
h
k=1
(35) and E
h
k=1
(35) derived from conducting the H2
1
frost accumulation test and evaluated as specified in section 3.9.1 of this appendix or use the paired values calculated using the above default equations, whichever contribute to a higher Region IV HSPF based on the DHRmin.
b. Conducting a frost accumulation test (H2
3
) with the heat pump operating at its booster capacity is optional. If this optional test is not conducted, determine Q
h
k=3
(35) and E
h
k=3
(35) using the following equations to approximate this capacity and electrical power:
ER05JA17.311
Where:
ER05JA17.026
Determine the quantities Q
h
k=2
(47) and E
h
k=2
(47) from the H1
2
test and evaluate them according to section 3.7 of this appendix. Determine the quantities Q
h
k=2
(35) and E
h
k=2
(35) from the H2
2
test and evaluate them according to section 3.9.1 of this appendix. Determine the quantities Q
h
k=2
(17) and E
h
k=2
(17) from the H3
2
test, determine the quantities Q
h
k=3
(17) and E
h
k=3
(17) from the H3
3
test, and determine the quantities Q
h
k=3
(5) and E
h
k=3
(5)
from the H4
3
test. Evaluate all six quantities according to section 3.10 of this appendix. Use the paired values of Q
h
k=3
(35) and E
h
k=3
(35) derived from conducting the H2
3
frost accumulation test and calculated as specified in section 3.9.1 of this appendix or use the paired values calculated using the above default equations, whichever contribute to a higher Region IV HSPF based on the DHRmin.
c. Conduct the optional high-temperature cyclic test (H1C
1
) to determine the heating mode cyclic-degradation coefficient, C
D
h
. A default value for C
D
h
may be used in lieu of conducting the cyclic. The default value of C
D
h
is 0.25. If a triple-capacity heat pump locks out low capacity operation at lower outdoor temperatures, conduct the high-temperature cyclic test (H1C
2
) to determine the high-capacity heating mode cyclic-degradation coefficient, C
D
h
(k=2). The default C
D
h
(k=2) is the same value as determined or assigned for the low-capacity cyclic-degradation coefficient, C
D
h
[or equivalently, C
D
h
(k=1)]. Finally, if a triple-capacity heat pump locks out both low and high capacity operation at the lowest outdoor temperatures, conduct the low-temperature cyclic test (H3C
3
) to determine the booster-capacity heating mode cyclic-degradation coefficient, C
D
h
(k=3). The default C
D
h
(k=3) is the same value as determined or assigned for the high-capacity cyclic-degradation coefficient, C
D
h
[or equivalently, C
D
h
(k=2)]. Table 15 specifies test conditions for all 13 tests.

# Tests)
a. For the pretest interval, operate the test room reconditioning apparatus and the heat pump until equilibrium conditions are maintained for at least 30 minutes at the specified section 3.6 test conditions. Use the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus and, if installed, the indoor blower of the heat pump to obtain and then maintain the indoor air volume rate and/or the external static pressure specified for the particular test. Continuously record the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor coil, and the dry-bulb temperature and water vapor content of the air entering the outdoor coil. Refer to section 3.11 of this appendix for additional requirements that depend on the selected secondary test method. After satisfying the pretest equilibrium requirements, make the measurements specified in Table 3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) for the indoor air enthalpy method and the user-selected secondary method. Make said Table 3 measurements at equal intervals that span 5 minutes
or less. Continue data sampling until a 30-minute period (
e.g.,
seven consecutive 5-minute samples) is reached where the test tolerances specified in Table 16 are satisfied. For those continuously recorded parameters, use the entire data set for the 30-minute interval when evaluating Table 16 compliance. Determine the average electrical power consumption of the heat pump over the same 30-minute interval.

b. Calculate indoor-side total heating capacity as specified in sections 7.3.4.1 and 7.3.4.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3). To calculate capacity, use the averages of the measurements (
e.g.
inlet and outlet dry bulb temperatures measured at the psychrometers) that are continuously recorded for the same 30-minute interval used as described above to evaluate compliance with test tolerances. Do not adjust the parameters used in calculating capacity for the permitted variations in test conditions. Assign the average space heating capacity and electrical power over the 30-minute data collection interval to the variables Q
h
k
and E
h
k
(T) respectively. The “T” and superscripted “k” are the same as described in section 3.3 of this appendix. Additionally, for the heating mode, use the superscript to denote results from the optional H1
N
test, if conducted.
c. For coil-only system heat pumps, increase Q
h
k
(T) by
ER05JA17.028
where V
s
is the average measured indoor air volume rate expressed in units of cubic feet per minute of standard air (scfm). During the 30-minute data collection interval of a high temperature test, pay attention to preventing a defrost cycle. Prior to this time, allow the heat pump to perform a defrost cycle if automatically initiated by its own controls. As in all cases, wait for the heat pump's defrost controls to automatically terminate the defrost cycle. Heat pumps that undergo a defrost should operate in the heating mode for at least 10 minutes after defrost termination prior to beginning the 30-minute data collection interval. For some heat pumps, frost may accumulate on the outdoor
coil during a high temperature test. If the indoor coil leaving air temperature or the difference between the leaving and entering air temperatures decreases by more than 1.5 °F over the 30-minute data collection interval, then do not use the collected data to determine capacity. Instead, initiate a defrost cycle. Begin collecting data no sooner than 10 minutes after defrost termination. Collect 30 minutes of new data during which the Table 16 test tolerances are satisfied. In this case, use only the results from the second 30-minute data collection interval to evaluate Q
h
k
(47) and E
h
k
(47).
d. If conducting the cyclic heating mode test, which is described in section 3.8 of this appendix, record the average indoor-side air volume rate, V
, specific heat of the air, C
p,a
(expressed on dry air basis), specific volume of the air at the nozzles, v
n
′ (or v
n
), humidity ratio at the nozzles, W
n
, and either pressure difference or velocity pressure for the flow nozzles. If either or both of the below criteria apply, determine the average, steady-state, electrical power consumption of the indoor blower motor (E
fan,1
):
(1) The section 3.8 cyclic test will be conducted and the heat pump has a variable-speed indoor blower that is expected to be disabled during the cyclic test; or
(2) The heat pump has a (variable-speed) constant-air volume-rate indoor blower and during the steady-state test the average external static pressure (ΔP
1
) exceeds the applicable section 3.1.4.4 minimum (or targeted) external static pressure (ΔP
min
) by 0.03 inches of water or more.
Determine E
fan,1
by making measurements during the 30-minute data collection interval, or immediately following the test and prior to changing the test conditions. When the above “2” criteria applies, conduct the following four steps after determining E
fan,1
(which corresponds to ΔP
1
):
(i) While maintaining the same test conditions, adjust the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus until the external static pressure increases to approximately ΔP
1
+ (ΔP
1
− ΔP
min
).
(ii) After re-establishing steady readings for fan motor power and external static pressure, determine average values for the indoor blower power (E
fan,2
) and the external static pressure (ΔP
2
) by making measurements over a 5-minute interval.
(iii) Approximate the average power consumption of the indoor blower motor if the 30-minute test had been conducted at ΔP
min
using linear extrapolation:
ER05JA17.029
(iv) Decrease the total space heating capacity, Q
h
k
(T), by the quantity (E
fan,1
− E
fan,min
), when expressed on a Btu/h basis. Decrease the total electrical power, E
h
k
(T) by the same fan power difference, now expressed in watts.
e. If the temperature sensors used to provide the primary measurement of the indoor-side dry bulb temperature difference during the steady-state dry-coil test and the subsequent cyclic dry-coil test are different, include measurements of the latter sensors among the regularly sampled data. Beginning at the start of the 30-minute data collection period, measure and compute the indoor-side air dry-bulb temperature difference using both sets of instrumentation, ΔT (Set SS) and ΔT (Set CYC), for each equally spaced data sample. If using a consistent data sampling rate that is less than 1 minute, calculate and record minutely averages for the two temperature differences. If using a consistent sampling rate of one minute or more, calculate and record the two temperature differences from each data sample. After having recorded the seventh (i=7) set of temperature differences, calculate the following ratio using the first seven sets of values:

a. Except as noted below, conduct the cyclic heating mode test as specified in section 3.5 of this appendix. As adapted to the heating mode, replace section 3.5 references to “the steady-state dry coil test” with “the heating mode steady-state test conducted at the same test conditions as the cyclic heating mode test.” Use the test tolerances in Table 17 rather than Table 10. Record the outdoor coil entering wet-bulb temperature according to the requirements given in section 3.5 of this appendix for the outdoor coil entering dry-bulb temperature. Drop the subscript “dry” used in variables cited in section 3.5 of this appendix when referring to quantities from the cyclic heating mode test. Determine the total space heating delivered during the cyclic heating test, q

b. For ducted coil-only system heat pumps (excluding the special case where a variable-speed fan is temporarily removed), increase q

cyc
by the amount calculated using Equation 3.5-2. In making these calculations, use the average indoor air volume rate (V

) determined from the section 3.7 steady-state heating mode test conducted at the same test conditions.
c. For non-ducted heat pumps, subtract the electrical energy used by the indoor blower during the 3 minutes after compressor cutoff from the non-ducted heat pump's integrated heating capacity, q
cyc
.
d. If a heat pump defrost cycle is manually or automatically initiated immediately prior to or during the OFF/ON cycling, operate the heat pump continuously until 10 minutes after defrost termination. After that, begin cycling the heat pump immediately or delay until the specified test conditions have been re-established. Pay attention to preventing defrosts after beginning the cycling process. For heat pumps that cycle off the indoor blower during a defrost cycle, make no effort here to restrict the air movement through the indoor coil while the fan is off. Resume the OFF/ON cycling while conducting a minimum of two complete compressor OFF/ON cycles before determining q
cyc
and e

# , H2

# , and H2

# tests)
a. Confirm that the defrost controls of the heat pump are set as specified in section 2.2.1 of this appendix. Operate the test room reconditioning apparatus and the heat pump for at least 30 minutes at the specified section 3.6 test conditions before starting the “preliminary” test period. The preliminary test period must immediately precede the “official” test period, which is the heating and defrost interval over which data are collected for evaluating average space heating capacity and average electrical power consumption.
b. For heat pumps containing defrost controls which are likely to cause defrosts at intervals less than one hour, the preliminary test period starts at the termination of an automatic defrost cycle and ends at the termination of the next occurring automatic defrost cycle. For heat pumps containing defrost controls which are likely to cause defrosts at intervals exceeding one hour, the preliminary test period must consist of a heating interval lasting at least one hour followed by a defrost cycle that is either manually or automatically initiated. In all cases, the heat pump's own controls must govern when a defrost cycle terminates.
c. The official test period begins when the preliminary test period ends, at defrost termination. The official test period ends at the termination of the next occurring automatic defrost cycle. When testing a heat pump that uses a time-adaptive defrost control system (see section 1.2 of this appendix, Definitions), however, manually initiate the defrost cycle that ends the official test period at the instant indicated by instructions provided by the manufacturer. If the heat pump has not undergone a defrost after 6 hours, immediately conclude the test and use the results from the full 6-hour period to calculate the average space heating capacity and average electrical power consumption.
For heat pumps that turn the indoor blower off during the defrost cycle, take steps to cease forced airflow through the indoor coil and block the outlet duct whenever the heat pump's controls cycle off the indoor blower. If it is installed, use the outlet damper box described in section 2.5.4.1 of this appendix to affect the blocked outlet duct.
d. Defrost termination occurs when the controls of the heat pump actuate the first change in converting from defrost operation to normal heating operation. Defrost initiation occurs when the controls of the heat pump first alter its normal heating operation in order to eliminate possible accumulations of frost on the outdoor coil.
e. To constitute a valid frost accumulation test, satisfy the test tolerances specified in Table 18 during both the preliminary and official test periods. As noted in Table 18, test operating tolerances are specified for two sub-intervals:
(1) When heating, except for the first 10 minutes after the termination of a defrost cycle (sub-interval H, as described in Table 18) and
(2) When defrosting, plus these same first 10 minutes after defrost termination (sub-interval D, as described in Table 18). Evaluate compliance with Table 18 test condition tolerances and the majority of the test operating tolerances using the averages from measurements recorded only during sub-interval H. Continuously record the dry bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor coil, and the dry bulb temperature and water vapor content of the air entering the outdoor coil. Sample the remaining parameters listed in Table 18 at equal intervals that span 5 minutes or less.
f. For the official test period, collect and use the following data to calculate average space heating capacity and electrical power. During heating and defrosting intervals when the controls of the heat pump have the indoor blower on, continuously record the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering (as noted above) and leaving the indoor coil. If using a thermopile, continuously record the difference between the leaving and entering dry-bulb temperatures during the interval(s) that air flows through the indoor coil. For coil-only system heat pumps, determine the corresponding cumulative time (in hours) of indoor coil airflow, Δτ

Sample measurements used in calculating the air volume rate (refer to sections 7.7.2.1 and 7.7.2.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009) at equal intervals that span 10 minutes or less. (

# 3.11 Additional Requirements for the Secondary Test Methods

# 3.11.1 If Using the Outdoor Air Enthalpy Method as the Secondary Test Method
a. For all cooling mode and heating mode tests, first conduct a test without the outdoor air-side test apparatus described in section 2.10.1 of this appendix connected to the outdoor unit (“free outdoor air” test).
b. For the first section 3.2 steady-state cooling mode test and the first section 3.6 steady-state heating mode test, conduct a second test in which the outdoor-side apparatus is connected (“ducted outdoor air” test). No other cooling mode or heating mode tests require the ducted outdoor air test so long as the unit operates the outdoor fan during all cooling mode steady-state tests at the same speed and all heating mode steady-state tests at the same speed. If using more than one outdoor fan speed for the cooling mode steady-state tests, however, conduct the ducted outdoor air test for each cooling mode test where a different fan speed is first used. This same requirement applies for the heating mode tests.

# 3.11.1.1 Free Outdoor Air Test
a. For the free outdoor air test, connect the indoor air-side test apparatus to the indoor coil; do not connect the outdoor air-side test apparatus. Allow the test room reconditioning apparatus and the unit being tested to operate for at least one hour. After attaining equilibrium conditions, measure the following quantities at equal intervals that span 5 minutes or less:
(1) The section 2.10.1 evaporator and condenser temperatures or pressures;
(2) Parameters required according to the indoor air enthalpy method.
Continue these measurements until a 30-minute period (
e.g.,
seven consecutive 5-minute samples) is obtained where the Table 9 or Table 16, whichever applies, test tolerances are satisfied.
b. For cases where a ducted outdoor air test is not required per section 3.11.1.b of this appendix, the free outdoor air test constitutes the “official” test for which validity is not based on comparison with a secondary test.
c. For cases where a ducted outdoor air test is required per section 3.11.1.b of this appendix, the following conditions must be met for the free outdoor air test to constitute a valid “official” test:
(1) Achieve the energy balance specified in section 3.1.1 of this appendix for the ducted outdoor air test (
i.e.,
compare the capacities determined using the indoor air enthalpy method and the outdoor air enthalpy method).
(2) The capacities determined using the indoor air enthalpy method from the ducted outdoor air and free outdoor tests must agree within 2 percent.

# 3.11.1.2 Ducted Outdoor Air Test
a. The test conditions and tolerances for the ducted outdoor air test are the same as specified for the free outdoor air test described in Section 3.11.1.1 of this appendix.
b. After collecting 30 minutes of steady-state data during the free outdoor air test,
connect the outdoor air-side test apparatus to the unit for the ducted outdoor air test. Adjust the exhaust fan of the outdoor airflow measuring apparatus until averages for the evaporator and condenser temperatures, or the saturated temperatures corresponding to the measured pressures, agree within ±0.5 °F of the averages achieved during the free outdoor air test. Collect 30 minutes of steady-state data after re-establishing equilibrium conditions.
c. During the ducted outdoor air test, at intervals of 5 minutes or less, measure the parameters required according to the indoor air enthalpy method and the outdoor air enthalpy method for the prescribed 30 minutes.
d. For cooling mode ducted outdoor air tests, calculate capacity based on outdoor air-enthalpy measurements as specified in sections 7.3.3.2 and 7.3.3.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3). For heating mode ducted tests, calculate heating capacity based on outdoor air-enthalpy measurements as specified in sections 7.3.4.2 and 7.3.3.4.3 of the same ANSI/ASHRAE Standard. Adjust the outdoor-side capacity according to section 7.3.3.4 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 to account for line losses when testing split systems. As described in section 8.6.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009, use the outdoor air volume rate as measured during the ducted outdoor air tests to calculate capacity for checking the agreement with the capacity calculated using the indoor air enthalpy method.

# 3.11.2 If Using the Compressor Calibration Method as the Secondary Test Method
a. Conduct separate calibration tests using a calorimeter to determine the refrigerant flow rate. Or for cases where the superheat of the refrigerant leaving the evaporator is less than 5 °F, use the calorimeter to measure total capacity rather than refrigerant flow rate. Conduct these calibration tests at the same test conditions as specified for the tests in this appendix. Operate the unit for at least one hour or until obtaining equilibrium conditions before collecting data that will be used in determining the average refrigerant flow rate or total capacity. Sample the data at equal intervals that span 5 minutes or less. Determine average flow rate or average capacity from data sampled over a 30-minute period where the Table 9 (cooling) or the Table 16 (heating) tolerances are satisfied. Otherwise, conduct the calibration tests according to sections 5, 6, 7, and 8 of ASHRAE 23.1-2010 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3); sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 of ASHRAE 41.9-2011 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3); and section 7.4 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3).
b. Calculate space cooling and space heating capacities using the compressor calibration method measurements as specified in section 7.4.5 and 7.4.6 respectively, of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009.

# 3.11.3 If Using the Refrigerant-Enthalpy Method as the Secondary Test Method
Conduct this secondary method according to section 7.5 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009. Calculate space cooling and heating capacities using the refrigerant-enthalpy method measurements as specified in sections 7.5.4 and 7.5.5, respectively, of the same ASHRAE Standard.

# 3.12 Rounding of Space Conditioning Capacities for Reporting Purposes
a. When reporting rated capacities, round them off as specified in § 430.23 (for a single unit) and in 10 CFR 429.16 (for a sample).
b. For the capacities used to perform the calculations in section 4 of this appendix, however, round only to the nearest integer.

# 3.13 Laboratory Testing to Determine Off Mode Average Power Ratings
Voltage tolerances: As a percentage of reading, test operating tolerance shall be 2.0 percent and test condition tolerance shall be 1.5 percent (see section 1.2 of this appendix for definitions of these tolerances).
Conduct one of the following tests: If the central air conditioner or heat pump lacks a compressor crankcase heater, perform the test in section 3.13.1 of this appendix; if the central air conditioner or heat pump has a compressor crankcase heater that lacks controls and is not self-regulating, perform the test in section 3.13.1 of this appendix; if the central air conditioner or heat pump has a crankcase heater with a fixed power input controlled with a thermostat that measures ambient temperature and whose sensing element temperature is not affected by the heater, perform the test in section 3.13.1 of this appendix; if the central air conditioner or heat pump has a compressor crankcase heater equipped with self-regulating control or with controls for which the sensing element temperature is affected by the heater, perform the test in section 3.13.2 of this appendix.

# 3.13.1 This Test Determines the Off Mode Average Power Rating for Central Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps That Lack a Compressor Crankcase Heater, or Have a Compressor Crankcase Heating System That Can Be Tested Without Control of Ambient Temperature During the Test. This Test Has No Ambient Condition Requirements
a. Test Sample Set-up and Power Measurement: For coil-only systems, provide a furnace or modular blower that is compatible with the system to serve as an interface with the thermostat (if used for the test) and to provide low-voltage control circuit power.
Make all control circuit connections between the furnace (or modular blower) and the outdoor unit as specified by the manufacturer's installation instructions. Measure power supplied to both the furnace or modular blower and power supplied to the outdoor unit. Alternatively, provide a compatible transformer to supply low-voltage control circuit power, as described in section 2.2.d of this appendix. Measure transformer power, either supplied to the primary winding or supplied by the secondary winding of the transformer, and power supplied to the outdoor unit. For blower coil and single-package systems, make all control circuit connections between components as specified by the manufacturer's installation instructions, and provide power and measure power supplied to all system components.
b. Configure Controls: Configure the controls of the central air conditioner or heat pump so that it operates as if connected to a building thermostat that is set to the OFF position. Use a compatible building thermostat if necessary to achieve this configuration. For a thermostat-controlled crankcase heater with a fixed power input, bypass the crankcase heater thermostat if necessary to energize the heater.
c. Measure
P2
x
: If the unit has a crankcase heater time delay, make sure that time delay function is disabled or wait until delay time has passed. Determine the average power from non-zero value data measured over a 5-minute interval of the non-operating central air conditioner or heat pump and designate the average power as
P2
x
, the heating season total off mode power.
d. Measure
P

for coil-only split systems and for blower coil split systems for which a furnace or a modular blower is the designated air mover: Disconnect all low-voltage wiring for the
outdoor
components and
outdoor
controls from the low-voltage transformer. Determine the average power from non-zero value data measured over a 5-minute interval of the power supplied to the (remaining) low-voltage components of the central air conditioner or heat pump, or low-voltage power,
P
x
. This power measurement does not include line power supplied to the outdoor unit. It is the line power supplied to the air mover, or, if a compatible transformer is used instead of an air mover, it is the line power supplied to the transformer primary coil. If a compatible transformer is used instead of an air mover and power output of the low-voltage secondary circuit is measured,
P
x
is zero.
e. Calculate
P2
: Set the number of compressors equal to the unit's number of single-stage compressors plus 1.75 times the unit's number of compressors that are not single-stage.
For single-package systems and blower coil split systems for which the designated air mover is not a furnace or modular blower, divide the heating season total off mode power (
P2

to the nearest watt. The expression for calculating

is as follows:

For coil-only split systems and blower coil split systems for which a furnace or a modular blower is the designated air mover, subtract the low-voltage power (

P2
, the heating season per-compressor off mode power. Round
P2

is as follows:

f. Shoulder-season per-compressor off mode power, P1: If the system does not have a crankcase heater, has a crankcase heater without controls that is not self-regulating, or has a value for the crankcase heater turn-on temperature (as certified in the DOE Compliance Certification Database) that is higher than 71 °F, P1 is equal to P2.
Otherwise, de-energize the crankcase heater (by removing the thermostat bypass or otherwise disconnecting only the power supply to the crankcase heater) and repeat the measurement as described in section 3.13.1.c of this appendix. Designate the measured average power as
P
1
x
, the shoulder season total off mode power.
Determine the number of compressors as described in section 3.13.1.e of this appendix.

# 3.13.2 This Test Determines the Off Mode Average Power Rating for Central Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps for Which Ambient Temperature Can Affect the Measurement of Crankcase Heater Power
a. Test Sample Set-up and Power Measurement: Set up the test and measurement as described in section 3.13.1.a of this appendix.
b. Configure Controls: Position a temperature sensor to measure the outdoor dry-bulb temperature in the air between 2 and 6 inches from the crankcase heater control temperature sensor or, if no such temperature sensor exists, position it in the air between 2 and 6 inches from the crankcase heater. Utilize the temperature measurements from this sensor for this portion of the test procedure. Configure the controls of the central air conditioner or heat pump so that it operates as if connected to a building thermostat that is set to the OFF position. Use a compatible building thermostat if necessary to achieve this configuration.
Conduct the test after completion of the B, B
1
, or B
2
test. Alternatively, start the test when the outdoor dry-bulb temperature is at 82 °F and the temperature of the compressor shell (or temperature of each compressor's shell if there is more than one compressor) is at least 81 °F. Then adjust the outdoor temperature at a rate of change of no more than 20 °F per hour and achieve an outdoor dry-bulb temperature of 72 °F. Maintain this temperature within ±2 °F while making the power measurement, as described in section 3.13.2.c of this appendix.
c. Measure
P
1
x
: If the unit has a crankcase heater time delay, make sure that time delay function is disabled or wait until delay time has passed. Determine the average power from non-zero value data measured over a 5-minute interval of the non-operating central air conditioner or heat pump and designate the average power as
P
1
x
, the shoulder season total off mode power. For units with crankcase heaters which operate during this part of the test and whose controls cycle or vary crankcase heater power over time, the test period shall consist of three complete crankcase heater cycles or 18 hours, whichever comes first. Designate the average power over the test period as
P
1
x
, the shoulder season total off mode power.
d. Reduce outdoor temperature: Approach the target outdoor dry-bulb temperature by adjusting the outdoor temperature at a rate of change of no more than 20 °F per hour. This target temperature is five degrees Fahrenheit less than the temperature specified by the manufacturer in the DOE Compliance Certification Database at which the crankcase heater turns on. Maintain the target temperature within ±2 °F while making the power measurement, as described in section 3.13.2.e of this appendix.
e. Measure
P2
x
: If the unit has a crankcase heater time delay, make sure that time delay function is disabled or wait until delay time has passed. Determine the average non-zero power of the non-operating central air conditioner or heat pump over a 5-minute interval and designate it as
P2
x
, the heating season total off mode power. For units with crankcase heaters whose controls cycle or vary crankcase heater power over time, the test period shall consist of three complete crankcase heater cycles or 18 hours, whichever comes first. Designate the average power over the test period as
P2
x
, the heating season total off mode power.
f. Measure
P
x
for coil-only split systems and for blower coil split systems for which a furnace or modular blower is the designated air mover: Disconnect all low-voltage wiring for the
outdoor
components and
outdoor
controls from the low-voltage transformer. Determine the average power from non-zero value data measured over a 5-minute interval of the power supplied to the (remaining) low-voltage components of the central air conditioner or heat pump, or low-voltage power,
P
x
.. This power measurement does not include line power supplied to the outdoor unit. It is the line power supplied to the air mover, or, if a compatible transformer is used instead of an air mover, it is the line power supplied to the transformer primary coil. If a compatible transformer is used instead of an air mover and power output of the low-voltage secondary circuit is measured,
P
x
is zero.
g. Calculate
P1
:
Set the number of compressors equal to the unit's number of single-stage compressors plus 1.75 times the unit's number of compressors that are not single-stage.
For single-package systems and blower coil split systems for which the air mover is not a furnace or modular blower, divide the shoulder season total off mode power (
P
1

) by the number of compressors to calculate
P1
, the shoulder season per-compressor off mode power. Round to the nearest watt. The expression for calculating

# 4.2 Heating Seasonal Performance Factor (HSPF) Calculations
Unless an approved alternative efficiency determination method is used, as set forth in 10 CFR 429.70(e), HSPF must be calculated as follows: Six generalized climatic regions are depicted in Figure 1 and otherwise defined in Table 20. For each of these regions and for each applicable standardized design heating requirement, evaluate the heating seasonal performance factor using,
ER05JA17.087
where:
e2(T
j
)/N = The ratio of the electrical energy consumed by the heat pump during periods of the space heating season when the outdoor temperature fell within the range represented by bin temperature T
j
to the total number of hours in the heating season (N), W. For heat pumps having a heat comfort controller, this ratio may also include electrical energy used by resistive elements to maintain a minimum air delivery temperature (see 4.2.5).
RH(T
j
)/N = The ratio of the electrical energy used for resistive space heating during periods when the outdoor temperature fell within the range represented by bin temperature T
j
to the total number of hours in the heating season (N), W. Except as noted in section 4.2.5 of this appendix, resistive space heating is modeled as being used to meet that portion of the building load that the heat pump does not meet because of insufficient capacity or because the heat pump automatically turns off at the lowest outdoor temperatures. For heat pumps having a heat comfort controller, all or part of the electrical energy used by resistive heaters at a particular bin temperature may be reflected in e
h
(T
j
)/N (see section 4.2.5 of this appendix).
T
j
= the outdoor bin temperature, °F. Outdoor temperatures are “binned” such that calculations are only performed based one temperature within the bin. Bins of 5 °F are used.
n
j
/N= Fractional bin hours for the heating season; the ratio of the number of hours during the heating season when the outdoor temperature fell within the range represented by bin temperature T
j
to the total number of hours in the heating season, dimensionless. Obtain n
j
/N values from Table 20.
j = the bin number, dimensionless.
J = for each generalized climatic region, the total number of temperature bins, dimensionless. Referring to Table 20, J is the highest bin number (j) having a nonzero entry for the fractional bin hours for the generalized climatic region of interest.
F
def
= the demand defrost credit described in section 3.9.2 of this appendix, dimensionless.
BL(T
j
) = the building space conditioning load corresponding to an outdoor temperature of T
j
; the heating season building load also depends on the generalized climatic region's outdoor design temperature and the design heating requirement, Btu/h.

For all heat pumps, HSPF accounts for the heating delivered and the energy consumed by auxiliary resistive elements when operating below the balance point. This condition occurs when the building load exceeds the space heating capacity of the heat pump condenser. For HSPF calculations for all heat pumps, see either section 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, or 4.2.4 of this appendix, whichever applies.
For heat pumps with heat comfort controllers (see section 1.2 of this appendix, Definitions), HSPF also accounts for resistive heating contributed when operating above the heat-pump-plus-comfort-controller balance point as a result of maintaining a minimum supply temperature. For heat pumps having a heat comfort controller, see section 4.2.5 of this appendix for the additional steps required for calculating the HSPF.

# 4.2.3 Additional Steps for Calculating the HSPF of a Heat Pump Having a Two-Capacity Compressor
The calculation of the Equation 4.2-1 to this appendix quantities differ depending upon whether the heat pump would operate at low capacity (section 4.2.3.1 of this appendix), cycle between low and high capacity (section 4.2.3.2 of this appendix), or operate at high capacity (sections 4.2.3.3 and 4.2.3.4 of this appendix) in responding to the building load. For heat pumps that lock out low capacity operation at low outdoor temperatures, the outdoor temperature at which the unit locks out must be that specified by the manufacturer in the certification report so that the appropriate equations can be selected.

# 4.2.5 Heat Pumps Having a Heat Comfort Controller
Heat pumps having heat comfort controllers, when set to maintain a typical minimum air delivery temperature, will cause the heat pump condenser to operate less because of a greater contribution from the resistive elements. With a conventional heat pump, resistive heating is only initiated if the heat pump condenser cannot meet the building load (
i.e.,
is delayed until a second stage call from the indoor thermostat). With a heat comfort controller, resistive heating can occur even though the heat pump condenser has adequate capacity to meet the building load (
i.e.,
both on during a first stage call from the indoor thermostat). As a result, the outdoor temperature where the heat pump compressor no longer cycles (
i.e.,
starts to run continuously), will be lower than if the heat pump did not have the heat comfort controller.

# 1.2 Definitions
Airflow-control settings
are programmed or wired control system configurations that control a fan to achieve discrete, differing ranges of airflow—often designated for performing a specific function (
e.g.,
cooling, heating, or constant circulation)—without manual adjustment other than interaction with a user-operable control (
i.e.,
a thermostat) that meets the manufacturer specifications for installed-use. For the purposes of this appendix, manufacturer specifications for installed-use are those found in the product literature shipped with the unit.
Air sampling device
is an assembly consisting of a manifold with several branch tubes with multiple sampling holes that draws an air sample from a critical location from the unit under test (
e.g.
indoor air inlet, indoor air outlet, outdoor air inlet, etc.).
Airflow prevention device
denotes a device that prevents airflow via natural convection by mechanical means, such as an air damper box, or by means of changes in duct height, such as an upturned duct.
Aspirating psychrometer
is a piece of equipment with a monitored airflow section that draws uniform airflow through the measurement section and has probes for measurement of air temperature and humidity.
Blower coil indoor unit
means an indoor unit either with an indoor blower housed with the coil or with a separate designated air mover such as a furnace or a modular blower (as defined in appendix AA to this subpart).
Blower coil system
refers to a split system that includes one or more blower coil indoor units.
Cased coil
means a coil-only indoor unit with external cabinetry.
Ceiling-mount blower coil system
means a split system for which a) the outdoor unit has a certified cooling capacity less than or equal to 36,000 Btu/h; b) the indoor unit(s) is/are shipped with manufacturer-supplied installation instructions that specify to secure the indoor unit only to the ceiling, within a furred-down space, or above a dropped ceiling of the conditioned space, with return air directly to the bottom of the unit without ductwork, or through the furred-down space, or optional insulated return air plenum that is shipped with the indoor unit; c) the installed height of the indoor unit is no more than 12 inches (not including condensate drain lines) and the installed depth (in the direction of airflow) of the indoor unit is no more than 30 inches; and d) supply air is discharged horizontally.
Coefficient of Performance (COP)
means the ratio of the average rate of space heating delivered to the average rate of electrical energy consumed by the heat pump. Determine these rate quantities from a single test or, if derived via interpolation, determine at a single set of operating conditions. COP is a dimensionless quantity. When determined for a ducted coil-only system, COP must be calculated using the default values for heat output and power input of a fan motor specified in sections 3.7 and 3.9.1 of this appendix.
Coil-only indoor unit
means an indoor unit that is distributed in commerce without an indoor blower or separate designated air mover. A coil-only indoor unit installed in the field relies on a separately installed furnace or a modular blower for indoor air movement.
Coil-only system
means a system that includes only (one or more) coil-only indoor units.
Condensing unit
removes the heat absorbed by the refrigerant to transfer it to the outside environment and consists of an outdoor coil, compressor(s), and air moving device.
Constant-air-volume-rate indoor blower
means a fan that varies its operating speed to provide a fixed air-volume-rate from a ducted system.
Continuously recorded,
when referring to a dry bulb measurement, dry bulb temperature used for test room control, wet bulb temperature, dew point temperature, or relative humidity measurements, means that the specified value must be sampled at regular intervals that are equal to or less than 15 seconds.
Cooling load factor (CLF)
means the ratio having as its numerator the total cooling delivered during a cyclic operating interval
consisting of one ON period and one OFF period, and as its denominator the total cooling that would be delivered, given the same ambient conditions, had the unit operated continuously at its steady-state, space-cooling capacity for the same total time (ON + OFF) interval.
Crankcase heater
means any electrically powered device or mechanism for intentionally generating heat within and/or around the compressor sump volume. Crankcase heater control may be achieved using a timer or may be based on a change in temperature or some other measurable parameter, such that the crankcase heater is not required to operate continuously. A crankcase heater without controls operates continuously when the compressor is not operating.
Cyclic Test
means a test where the unit's compressor is cycled on and off for specific time intervals. A cyclic test provides half the information needed to calculate a degradation coefficient.
Damper box
means a short section of duct having an air damper that meets the performance requirements of section 2.5.7 of this appendix.
Degradation coefficient (C
D
)
means a parameter used in calculating the part load factor. The degradation coefficient for cooling is denoted by C

. The degradation coefficient for heating is denoted by C
D
h
.
Demand-defrost control system
means a system that defrosts the heat pump outdoor coil-only when measuring a predetermined degradation of performance. The heat pump's controls either:
(1) Monitor one or more parameters that always vary with the amount of frost accumulated on the outdoor coil (
e.g.,
coil to air differential temperature, coil differential air pressure, outdoor fan power or current, optical sensors) at least once for every ten minutes of compressor ON-time when space heating; or
(2) Operate as a feedback system that measures the length of the defrost period and adjusts defrost frequency accordingly. In all cases, when the frost parameter(s) reaches a predetermined value, the system initiates a defrost. In a demand-defrost control system, defrosts are terminated based on monitoring a parameter(s) that indicates that frost has been eliminated from the coil. (
Note:
Systems that vary defrost intervals according to outdoor dry-bulb temperature are not demand-defrost systems.) A demand-defrost control system, which otherwise meets the requirements, may allow time-initiated defrosts if, and only if, such defrosts occur after 6 hours of compressor operating time.
Design heating requirement (DHR)
predicts the space heating load of a residence when subjected to outdoor design conditions. Estimates for the minimum and maximum DHR are provided for six generalized U.S. climatic regions in section 4.2 of this appendix.
Dry-coil tests
are cooling mode tests where the wet-bulb temperature of the air supplied to the indoor unit is maintained low enough that no condensate forms on the evaporator coil.
Ducted system
means an air conditioner or heat pump that is designed to be permanently installed equipment and delivers conditioned air to the indoor space through a duct(s). The air conditioner or heat pump may be either a split-system or a single-package unit.
Energy efficiency ratio (EER)
means the ratio of the average rate of space cooling delivered to the average rate of electrical energy consumed by the air conditioner or heat pump. Determine these rate quantities from a single test or, if derived via interpolation, determine at a single set of operating conditions. EER is expressed in units of

Heat pump having a heat comfort controller
means a heat pump with controls that can regulate the operation of the electric resistance elements to assure that the air temperature leaving the indoor section does not fall below a specified temperature. Heat pumps that actively regulate the rate of electric resistance heating when operating below the balance point (as the result of a second stage call from the thermostat) but do not operate to maintain a minimum delivery temperature are not considered as having a heat comfort controller.
Heating load factor (HLF)
means the ratio having as its numerator the total heating delivered during a cyclic operating interval consisting of one ON period and one OFF period, and its denominator the heating capacity measured at the same test conditions used for the cyclic test, multiplied by the total time interval (ON plus OFF) of the cyclic-test.
Heating season
means the months of the year that require heating,
e.g.,
typically, and roughly, October through April.
Heating seasonal performance factor 2 (HSPF2)
means the total space heating required during the heating season, expressed in Btu, divided by the total electrical energy consumed by the heat pump system during the same season, expressed in watt-hours.

(1) The system consists of one outdoor unit with one or more compressors matched with between two and five indoor units;
(2) The indoor units must:
(i) Collectively, have a nominal cooling capacity greater than or equal to 95 percent and less than or equal to 105 percent of the nominal cooling capacity of the outdoor unit;

Time-adaptive defrost control system
is a demand-defrost control system that measures the length of the prior defrost period(s) and uses that information to automatically determine when to initiate the next defrost cycle.
Time-temperature defrost control systems
initiate or evaluate initiating a defrost cycle only when a predetermined cumulative compressor ON-time is obtained. This predetermined ON-time is generally a fixed value (
e.g.,
30, 45, 90 minutes) although it may vary based on the measured outdoor dry-bulb temperature. The ON-time counter accumulates if controller measurements (
e.g.,
outdoor temperature, evaporator temperature) indicate that frost formation conditions are present, and it is reset/remains at zero at all other times. In one application of the control scheme, a defrost is initiated whenever the counter time equals the predetermined ON-time. The counter is reset when the defrost cycle is completed.
In a second application of the control scheme, one or more parameters are measured (
e.g.,
air and/or refrigerant temperatures) at the predetermined, cumulative, compressor ON-time. A defrost is initiated only if the measured parameter(s) falls within a predetermined range. The ON-time counter is reset regardless of whether or not a defrost is initiated. If systems of this second type use cumulative ON-time intervals of 10 minutes or less, then the heat pump may qualify as having a demand defrost control system (see definition).
Triple-capacity, northern heat pump
means a heat pump that provides two stages of cooling and three stages of heating. The two common stages for both the cooling and heating modes are the low capacity stage and the high capacity stage. The additional heating mode stage is the booster capacity stage, which offers the highest heating capacity output for a given set of ambient operating conditions.
Triple-split system

Two-capacity (or two-stage) compressor system
means a central air conditioner or heat pump that has a compressor or a group of compressors operating with only two stages of capacity. For such systems, low capacity means the compressor(s) operating at low stage, or at low load test conditions. The low compressor stage that operates for heating mode tests may be the same or different from the low compressor stage that operates for cooling mode tests. For such systems, high capacity means the compressor(s) operating at high stage, or at full load test conditions.
Two-capacity, northern heat pump
means a heat pump that has a factory or field-selectable lock-out feature to prevent space cooling at high-capacity. Two-capacity heat pumps having this feature will typically have two sets of ratings, one with the feature disabled and one with the feature enabled. The heat pump is a two-capacity northern heat pump only when this feature is enabled at all times. The certified indoor coil model number must reflect whether the ratings pertain to the lockout enabled option via the inclusion of an extra identifier, such as “+LO”. When testing as a two-capacity, northern heat pump, the lockout feature must remain enabled for all tests.
Uncased coil
means a coil-only indoor unit without external cabinetry.
Variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system
means a multi-split system with at least three compressor capacity stages, distributing refrigerant through a piping network to multiple indoor blower coil units each capable of individual zone temperature control, through proprietary zone temperature control devices and a common communications network. Note: Single-phase VRF systems less than 65,000 Btu/h are central air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps.
Variable-speed communicating coil-only central air conditioner or heat pump
means a variable-speed compressor system having a coil-only indoor unit that is installed with a control system that:
(a) Communicates the difference in space temperature and space setpoint temperature (not a setpoint value inferred from on/off thermostat signals) to the control that sets compressor speed;
(b) Provides a signal to the indoor fan to set fan speed appropriate for compressor staging; and
(c) Has installation instructions indicating that the control system having these capabilities must be installed.
Variable-speed compressor system
means a central air conditioner or heat pump that has a compressor that uses a variable-speed drive to vary the compressor speed to achieve variable capacities.
Variable-speed non-communicating coil-only central air conditioner or heat pump
means a variable-speed compressor system having a coil-only indoor unit that is does not meet the definition of variable-speed communicating coil-only central air conditioner or heat pump.
Wall-mount blower coil system
means a split system air conditioner or heat pump for which:
(a) The outdoor unit has a certified cooling capacity less than or equal to 36,000 Btu/h;
(b) The indoor unit(s) is/are shipped with manufacturer-supplied installation instructions that specify mounting only by:
(1) Securing the back side of the unit to a wall within the conditioned space, or
(2) Securing the unit to adjacent wall studs or in an enclosure, such as a closet, such that the indoor unit's front face is flush with a wall in the conditioned space;
(c) Has front air return without ductwork and is not capable of horizontal air discharge; and
(d) Has a height no more than 45 inches, a depth (perpendicular to the wall) no more than 22 inches (including tubing connections), and a width no more than 24 inches (parallel to the wall).

# 2 Testing Overview and Conditions
(A) Test VRF systems using AHRI 1230-2010 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) and appendix M. Where AHRI 1230-2010 refers to the appendix C therein substitute the provisions of this appendix. In cases where there is a conflict, the language of the test procedure in this appendix takes precedence over AHRI 1230-2010.
For definitions use section 1 of appendix M and section 3 of AHRI 1230-2010. For rounding requirements, refer to § 430.23(m). For determination of certified ratings, refer to § 429.16 of this chapter.
For test room requirements, refer to section 2.1 of this appendix. For test unit installation requirements refer to sections 2.2.a, 2.2.b, 2.2.c, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3.a, 2.2.3.c, 2.2.4, 2.2.5, and 2.4 to 2.12 of this appendix, and sections 5.1.3 and 5.1.4 of AHRI 1230-2010. The “manufacturer's published instructions,” as stated in section 8.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) and “manufacturer's installation instructions” discussed in this appendix mean the manufacturer's installation instructions that come packaged with or appear in the labels applied to the unit. This does not include online manuals. Installation instructions that appear in the labels applied to the unit take precedence over installation instructions that are shipped with the unit.
For general requirements for the test procedure, refer to section 3.1 of this appendix, except for sections 3.1.3 and 3.1.4, which are requirements for indoor air volume and outdoor air volume. For indoor air volume and outdoor air volume requirements, refer instead to section 6.1.5 (except where section 6.1.5 refers to Table 8, refer instead to Table 4 of this appendix) and 6.1.6 of AHRI 1230-2010.
For the test method, refer to sections 3.3 to 3.5 and 3.7 to 3.13 of this appendix. For cooling mode and heating mode test conditions, refer to section 6.2 of AHRI 1230-2010. For calculations of seasonal performance descriptors, refer to section 4 of this appendix.
(B) For systems other than VRF, only a subset of the sections listed in this test procedure apply when testing and determining represented values for a particular unit. Table 1 to this appendix shows the sections of the test procedure that apply to each system. Table 1 is meant to assist manufacturers in finding the appropriate sections of the test procedure. Manufacturers are responsible for determining which sections apply to each unit tested based on the model characteristics. The appendix sections provide the specific requirements for testing. To use Table 1, first refer to the sections listed under “all units”. Then refer to additional requirements based on:
(1) System configuration(s),
(2) The compressor staging or modulation capability, and
(3) Any special features.
Testing requirements for space-constrained products do not differ from similar products that are not space-constrained, and thus space-constrained products are not listed separately in Table 1. Air conditioners and heat pumps are not listed separately in Table 1, but heating procedures and calculations apply only to heat pumps.
The “manufacturer's published instructions,” as stated in Section 8.2 of ANSI/
ASHRAE Standard 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) and “manufacturer's installation instructions” discussed in this appendix mean the manufacturer's installation instructions that come packaged with the unit or appear in the labels applied to the unit. Manufacturer's installation instructions do not include online manuals. Installation instructions that appear in the labels applied to the unit shall take precedence over installation instructions that come packaged with the unit.

# 2.1 Test Room Requirements.
a. Test using two side-by-side rooms: An indoor test room and an outdoor test room. For multiple-split, single-zone-multi-coil or multi-circuit air conditioners and heat pumps, however, use as many indoor test rooms as needed to accommodate the total number of indoor units. These rooms must
comply with the requirements specified in sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3).
b. Inside these test rooms, use artificial loads during cyclic tests and frost accumulation tests, if needed, to produce stabilized room air temperatures. For one room, select an electric resistance heater(s) having a heating capacity that is approximately equal to the heating capacity of the test unit's condenser. For the second room, select a heater(s) having a capacity that is close to the sensible cooling capacity of the test unit's evaporator. Cycle the heater located in the same room as the test unit evaporator coil ON and OFF when the test unit cycles ON and OFF. Cycle the heater located in the same room as the test unit condensing coil ON and OFF when the test unit cycles OFF and ON.

# 2.2 Test Unit Installation Requirements.
a. Install the unit according to section 8.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3), subject to the following additional requirements:
(1) When testing split systems, follow the requirements given in section 6.1.3.5 of AHRI 210/240-2008 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3). For the vapor refrigerant line(s), use the insulation included with the unit; if no insulation is provided, use insulation meeting the specifications for the insulation in the installation instructions included with the unit by the manufacturer; if no insulation is included with the unit and the installation instructions do not contain provisions for insulating the line(s), fully insulate the vapor refrigerant line(s) with vapor proof insulation having an inside diameter that matches the refrigerant tubing and a nominal thickness of at least 0.5 inches. For the liquid refrigerant line(s), use the insulation included with the unit; if no insulation is provided, use insulation meeting the specifications for the insulation in the installation instructions included with the unit by the manufacturer; if no insulation is included with the unit and the installation instructions do not contain provisions for insulating the line(s), leave the liquid refrigerant line(s) exposed to the air for air conditioners and heat pumps that heat and cool; or, for heating-only heat pumps, insulate the liquid refrigerant line(s) with insulation having an inside diameter that matches the refrigerant tubing and a nominal thickness of at least 0.5 inches. However, these requirements do not take priority over instructions for application of insulation for the purpose of improving refrigerant temperature measurement accuracy as required by sections 2.10.2 and 2.10.3 of this appendix. Insulation must be the same for the cooling and heating tests.
(2) When testing split systems, if the indoor unit does not ship with a cooling mode expansion device, test the system using the device as specified in the installation instructions provided with the indoor unit. If none is specified, test the system using a fixed orifice or piston type expansion device that is sized appropriately for the system.
(3) When testing triple-split systems (see section 1.2 of this appendix, Definitions), use the tubing length specified in section 6.1.3.5 of AHRI 210/240-2008 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) to connect the outdoor coil, indoor compressor section, and indoor coil while still meeting the requirement of exposing 10 feet of the tubing to outside conditions;
(4) When testing split systems having multiple indoor coils, connect each indoor blower coil unit to the outdoor unit using:
(a) 25 feet of tubing, or
(b) Tubing furnished by the manufacturer, whichever is longer.
(5) When testing split systems having multiple indoor coils, expose at least 10 feet of the system interconnection tubing to the outside conditions. If they are needed to make a secondary measurement of capacity or for verification of refrigerant charge, install refrigerant pressure measuring instruments as described in section 8.2.5 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3). Section 2.10 of this appendix specifies which secondary methods require refrigerant pressure measurements and section 2.2.5.5 of this appendix discusses use of pressure measurements to verify charge. At a minimum, insulate the low-pressure line(s) of a split system with insulation having an inside diameter that matches the refrigerant tubing and a nominal thickness of 0.5 inch.
b. For units designed for both horizontal and vertical installation or for both up-flow and down-flow vertical installations, use the orientation for testing specified by the manufacturer in the certification report. Conduct testing with the following installed:
(1) The most restrictive filter(s);
(2) Supplementary heating coils; and
(3) Other equipment specified as part of the unit, including all hardware used by a heat comfort controller if so equipped (see section 1 of this appendix, Definitions). For small-duct, high-velocity systems, configure all balance dampers or restrictor devices on or inside the unit to fully open or lowest restriction.
c. Testing a ducted unit without having an indoor air filter installed is permissible as long as the minimum external static pressure requirement is adjusted as stated in Table 4, note 3 (see section 3.1.4 of this appendix). Except as noted in section 3.1.10 of this appendix, prevent the indoor air supplementary heating coils from operating during all tests. For uncased coils, create an enclosure using 1 inch fiberglass foil-faced ductboard having a nominal density of 6
pounds per cubic foot. Or alternatively, construct an enclosure using sheet metal or a similar material and insulating material having a thermal resistance (“R” value) between 4 and 6 hr · ft
2
· °F/Btu. Size the enclosure and seal between the coil and/or drainage pan and the interior of the enclosure as specified in installation instructions shipped with the unit. Also seal between the plenum and inlet and outlet ducts.
d. When testing a coil-only system, install a toroidal-type transformer to power the system's low-voltage components, complying with any additional requirements for the transformer mentioned in the installation manuals included with the unit by the system manufacturer. If the installation manuals do not provide specifications for the transformer, use a transformer having the following features:
(1) A nominal volt-amp rating such that the transformer is loaded between 25 and 90 percent of this rating for the highest level of power measured during the off mode test (section 3.13 of this appendix);
(2) Designed to operate with a primary input of 230 V, single phase, 60 Hz; and
(3) That provides an output voltage that is within the specified range for each low-voltage component. Include the power consumption of the components connected to the transformer as part of the total system power consumption during the off mode tests; do not include the power consumed by the transformer when no load is connected to it.
e. Test an outdoor unit with no match (
i.e.,
that is not distributed in commerce with any indoor units) using a coil-only indoor unit with a single cooling air volume rate whose coil has:
(1) Round tubes of outer diameter no less than 0.375 inches, and
(2) A normalized gross indoor fin surface (NGIFS) no greater than 1.0 square inch per British thermal unit per hour (sq. in./Btu/hr). NGIFS is calculated as follows:

f. If the outdoor unit or the outdoor portion of a single-package unit has a drain pan heater to prevent freezing of defrost water, energize the heater, subject to control to de-energize it when not needed by the heater's thermostat or the unit's control system, for all tests.
g. If pressure measurement devices are connected to a cooling/heating heat pump refrigerant circuit, the refrigerant charge M
t
that could potentially transfer out of the connected pressure measurement systems (transducers, gauges, connections, and lines) between operating modes must be less than 2 percent of the factory refrigerant charge listed on the nameplate of the outdoor unit. If the outdoor unit nameplate has no listed refrigerant charge, or the heat pump is shipped without a refrigerant charge, use a factory refrigerant charge equal to 30 ounces per ton of certified cooling capacity. Use Equation 2.2-1 to calculate M
t
for heat pumps that have a single expansion device located in the outdoor unit to serve each indoor unit, and use Equation 2.2-2 to calculate M

for heat pumps that have two expansion devices per indoor unit.

Calculate the internal volume of each pressure measurement system using internal volume reported for pressure transducers and gauges in product literature, if available. If such information is not available, use the value of 0.1 cubic inch internal volume for each pressure transducer, and 0.2 cubic inches for each pressure gauge.
In addition, for heat pumps that have a single expansion device located in the outdoor unit to serve each indoor unit, the internal volume of the pressure system at location 2 (as indicated in Table 2) must be no more than 1 cubic inches. Once the pressure measurement lines are set up, no change should be made until all tests are finished.

# 2.2.1 Defrost Control Settings
Set heat pump defrost controls at the normal settings which most typify those encountered in generalized climatic region IV. (Refer to Figure 1 and Table 20 of section 4.2 of this appendix for information on region IV.) For heat pumps that use a time-adaptive defrost control system (see section 1.2 of this appendix, Definitions), the manufacturer must specify in the certification report the frosting interval to be used during frost accumulation tests and provide the procedure for manually initiating the defrost at the specified time.

# 2.2.2 Special Requirements for Units Having a Multiple-Speed Outdoor Fan
Configure the multiple-speed outdoor fan according to the installation manual included with the unit by the manufacturer, and thereafter, leave it unchanged for all tests. The controls of the unit must regulate the operation of the outdoor fan during all lab tests except dry coil cooling mode tests. For dry coil cooling mode tests, the outdoor fan must operate at the same speed used during the required wet coil test conducted at the same outdoor test conditions.

# 2.2.3 Special Requirements for Multi-Split Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps and Ducted Systems Using a Single Indoor Section Containing Multiple Indoor Blowers That Would Normally Operate Using Two or More Indoor Thermostats
Because these systems will have more than one indoor blower and possibly multiple outdoor fans and compressor systems, references in this test procedure to a singular indoor blower, outdoor fan, and/or compressor means all indoor blowers, all outdoor fans, and all compressor systems that are energized during the test.
a. Additional requirements for multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps. For any test where the system is operated at part load (
i.e.,
one or more compressors “off”, operating at the intermediate or minimum compressor speed, or at low compressor capacity), the manufacturer must designate in the certification report the indoor coil(s) that are not providing heating or cooling during the test. For variable-speed systems, the manufacturer must designate in the certification report at least one indoor unit that is not providing heating or cooling for all tests conducted at minimum compressor speed. For all other part-load tests, the manufacturer must choose to turn off zero, one, two, or more indoor units. The chosen configuration must remain unchanged for all tests conducted at the same compressor speed/capacity. For any indoor coil that is not providing heating or cooling during a test, cease forced airflow through this indoor coil and block its outlet duct.
b. Additional requirements for ducted split systems with a single indoor unit containing multiple indoor blowers (or for single-package units with an indoor section containing multiple indoor blowers) where the indoor blowers are designed to cycle on and off independently of one another and are not controlled such that all indoor blowers are modulated to always operate at the same air volume rate or speed. For any test where the system is operated at its lowest capacity—
i.e.,
the lowest total air volume rate allowed when operating the single-speed compressor or when operating at low compressor capacity—turn off indoor blowers accounting for at least one-third of the full-load air volume rate unless prevented by the controls of the unit. In such cases, turn off as many indoor blowers as permitted by the unit's controls. Where more than one option exists for meeting this “off” requirement, the manufacturer must indicate in its certification report which indoor blower(s) are turned off. The chosen configuration shall remain unchanged for all tests conducted at the same lowest capacity configuration. For any indoor coil turned off during a test, cease forced airflow through any outlet duct connected to a switched-off indoor blower.
c. For test setups where the laboratory's physical limitations require use of more than the required line length of 25 feet as listed in section 2.2.a.(4) of this appendix, then the actual refrigerant line length used by the laboratory may exceed the required length and the refrigerant line length correction factors in Table 4 of AHRI 1230-2010 are applied to the cooling capacity measured for each cooling mode test.

# 2.2.4 Wet-Bulb Temperature Requirements for the Air Entering the Indoor and Outdoor Coils

# 2.2.4.1 Cooling Mode Tests
For wet-coil cooling mode tests, regulate the water vapor content of the air entering the indoor unit so that the wet-bulb temperature is as listed in Tables 5 to 8. As noted in these same tables, achieve a wet-bulb temperature during dry-coil cooling mode tests that results in no condensate forming on the indoor coil. Controlling the water vapor content of the air entering the outdoor side of the unit is not required for cooling mode tests except when testing:
(1) Units that reject condensate to the outdoor coil during wet coil tests. Tables 5-8 list the applicable wet-bulb temperatures.
(2) Single-package units where all or part of the indoor section is located in the outdoor test room. The average dew point temperature of the air entering the outdoor coil during wet coil tests must be within ±3.0 °F of the average dew point temperature of the air entering the indoor coil over the 30-minute data collection interval described in section 3.3 of this appendix. For dry coil tests on such units, it may be necessary to limit the moisture content of the air entering the outdoor coil of the unit to meet the requirements of section 3.4 of this appendix.

# 2.2.4.2 Heating Mode Tests
For heating mode tests, regulate the water vapor content of the air entering the outdoor unit to the applicable wet-bulb temperature listed in Tables 12 to 15. The wet-bulb temperature entering the indoor side of the heat pump must not exceed 60 °F. Additionally, if the Outdoor Air Enthalpy test method (section 2.10.1 of this appendix) is used while testing a single-package heat pump where all or part of the outdoor section is located in the indoor test room, adjust the wet-bulb temperature for the air entering the indoor side to yield an indoor-side dew point temperature that is as close as reasonably possible to the dew point temperature of the outdoor-side entering air.

# 2.2.5 Additional Refrigerant Charging Requirements

# 2.2.5.1 Instructions to Use for Charging
a. Where the manufacturer's installation instructions contain two sets of refrigerant charging criteria, one for field installations and one for lab testing, use the field installation criteria.
b. For systems consisting of an outdoor unit manufacturer's outdoor section and indoor section with differing charging procedures, adjust the refrigerant charge per the outdoor installation instructions.
c. For systems consisting of an outdoor unit manufacturer's outdoor unit and an independent coil manufacturer's indoor unit with differing charging procedures, adjust the refrigerant charge per the indoor unit's installation instructions. If instructions are provided only with the outdoor unit or are provided only with an independent coil manufacturer's indoor unit, then use the provided instructions.

# 2.2.5.2 Test(s) to Use for Charging
a. Use the tests or operating conditions specified in the manufacturer's installation instructions for charging. The manufacturer's installation instructions may specify use of tests other than the A or A
2
test for charging, but, unless the unit is a heating-only heat pump, determine the air volume rate by the A or A
2
test as specified in section 3.1 of this appendix.
b. If the manufacturer's installation instructions do not specify a test or operating conditions for charging or there are no manufacturer's instructions, use the following test(s):
(1) For air conditioners or cooling and heating heat pumps, use the A or A
2
test.
(2) For cooling and heating heat pumps that do not operate in the H1 or H1
2
test (
e.g.
due to shut down by the unit limiting devices) when tested using the charge determined at the A or A
2
test, and for heating-only heat pumps, use the H1 or H1
2
test.

# 2.2.5.3 Parameters to Set and Their Target Values
a. Consult the manufacturer's installation instructions regarding which parameters (
e.g.,
superheat) to set and their target values. If the instructions provide ranges of values, select target values equal to the midpoints of the provided ranges.
b. In the event of conflicting information between charging instructions (
i.e.,
multiple conditions given for charge adjustment where all conditions specified cannot be met), follow the following hierarchy.
(1) For fixed orifice systems:
(i) Superheat
(ii) High side pressure or corresponding saturation or dew-point temperature
(iii) Low side pressure or corresponding saturation or dew-point temperature
(iv) Low side temperature
(v) High side temperature
(vi) Charge weight
(2) For expansion valve systems:
(i) Subcooling
(ii) High side pressure or corresponding saturation or dew-point temperature
(iii) Low side pressure or corresponding saturation or dew-point temperature
(iv) Approach temperature (difference between temperature of liquid leaving condenser and condenser average inlet air temperature)
(v) Charge weight
c. If there are no installation instructions and/or they do not provide parameters and target values, set superheat to a target value of 12 °F for fixed orifice systems or set subcooling to a target value of 10 °F for expansion valve systems.

# 2.2.5.4 Charging Tolerances
a. If the manufacturer's installation instructions specify tolerances on target values for the charging parameters, set the values within these tolerances.
b. Otherwise, set parameter values within the following test condition tolerances for the different charging parameters:
11. Superheat: ± 2.0 °F
12. Subcooling: ± 2.0 °F
13. High side pressure or corresponding saturation or dew point temperature: ± 4.0 psi or ± 1.0 °F
14. Low side pressure or corresponding saturation or dew point temperature: ± 2.0 psi or ± 0.8 °F
15. High side temperature: ± 2.0 °F
16. Low side temperature: ± 2.0 °F
17. Approach temperature: ± 1.0 °F
18. Charge weight: ± 2.0 ounce

# 2.2.5.5 Special Charging Instructions
a. Cooling and Heating Heat Pumps
If, using the initial charge set in the A or A
2
test, the conditions are not within the range specified in manufacturer's installation instructions for the H1 or H1
2
test, make as small as possible an adjustment to obtain conditions for this test in the specified range. After this adjustment, recheck conditions in the A or A
2
test to confirm that they are still within the specified range for the A or A
2
test.

# b. Single-Package Systems
i. Unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer's installation instructions, install one or more refrigerant line pressure gauges during the setup of the unit, located depending on the parameters used to verify or set charge, as described:
(1) Install a pressure gauge at the location of the service valve on the liquid line if charging is on the basis of subcooling, or high side pressure or corresponding saturation or dew point temperature;
(2) Install a pressure gauge at the location of the service valve on the suction line if charging is on the basis of superheat, or low side pressure or corresponding saturation or dew point temperature.
ii. Use methods for installing pressure gauge(s) at the required location(s) as indicated in manufacturer's instructions if specified.

# 2.2.5.6 Near-Azeotropic and Zeotropic Refrigerants
Perform charging of near-azeotropic and zeotropic refrigerants only with refrigerant in the liquid state.

# 2.2.5.7 Adjustment of Charge Between Tests
After charging the system as described in this test procedure, use the set refrigerant charge for all tests used to determine performance. Do not adjust the refrigerant charge at any point during testing. If measurements indicate that refrigerant charge has leaked during the test, repair the refrigerant leak, repeat any necessary set-up steps, and repeat all tests.

# 2.3 Indoor Air Volume Rates
If a unit's controls allow for overspeeding the indoor blower (usually on a temporary basis), take the necessary steps to prevent overspeeding during all tests.

# 2.3.1 Cooling Tests
a. Set indoor blower airflow-control settings (
e.g.,
fan motor pin settings, fan motor speed) according to the requirements that are specified in section 3.1.4 of this appendix.
b. Express the Cooling full-load air volume rate, the Cooling Minimum Air Volume Rate, and the Cooling Intermediate Air Volume Rate in terms of standard air.

# 2.3.2 Heating Tests
a. Set indoor blower airflow-control settings (
e.g.,
fan motor pin settings, fan motor speed) according to the requirements that are specified in section 3.1.4 of this appendix.
b. Express the heating full-load air volume rate, the heating minimum air volume rate, the heating intermediate air volume rate, and the heating nominal air volume rate in terms of standard air.

# 2.4 Indoor Coil Inlet and Outlet Duct Connections
Insulate and/or construct the outlet plenum as described in section 2.4.1 of this appendix and, if installed, the inlet plenum described in section 2.4.2 of this appendix with thermal insulation having a nominal overall resistance (R-value) of at least 19 hr·ft
2
°F/Btu.

# 2.4.1 Outlet Plenum for the Indoor Unit
a. Attach a plenum to the outlet of the indoor coil. (
Note:
For some packaged systems, the indoor coil may be located in the outdoor test room.)
b. For systems having multiple indoor coils, or multiple indoor blowers within a single indoor section, attach a plenum to
each indoor coil or indoor blower outlet. In order to reduce the number of required airflow measurement apparatuses (section 2.6 of this appendix), each such apparatus may serve multiple outlet plenums connected to a single common duct leading to the apparatus. More than one indoor test room may be used, which may use one or more common ducts leading to one or more airflow measurement apparatuses within each test room that contains multiple indoor coils. At the plane where each plenum enters a common duct, install an adjustable airflow damper and use it to equalize the static pressure in each plenum. The outlet air temperature grid(s) (section 2.5.4 of this appendix) and airflow measuring apparatus shall be located downstream of the inlet(s) to the common duct(s). For multiple-circuit (or multi-circuit) systems for which each indoor coil outlet is measured separately and its outlet plenum is not connected to a common duct connecting multiple outlet plenums, install the outlet air temperature grid and airflow measuring apparatus at each outlet plenum.
c. For small-duct, high-velocity systems, install an outlet plenum that has a diameter that is equal to or less than the value listed in Table 3. The limit depends only on the Cooling full-load air volume rate (see section 3.1.4.1.1 of this appendix) and is effective regardless of the flange dimensions on the outlet of the unit (or an air supply plenum adapter accessory, if installed in accordance with the manufacturer's installation instructions).
d. Add a static pressure tap to each face of the (each) outlet plenum, if rectangular, or at four evenly distributed locations along the circumference of an oval or round plenum. Create a manifold that connects the four static pressure taps. Figure 9 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) shows allowed options for the manifold configuration. The cross-sectional dimensions of plenum must be equal to the dimensions of the indoor unit outlet. See Figures 7a, 7b, and 7c of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 for the minimum length of the (each) outlet plenum and the locations for adding the static pressure taps for ducted blower coil indoor units and single-package systems. See Figure 8 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 for coil-only indoor units.

# 2.4.2 Inlet Plenum for the Indoor Unit
Install an inlet plenum when testing a coil-only indoor unit, a ducted blower coil indoor unit, or a single-package system. See Figures 7b and 7c of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 for cross-sectional dimensions, the minimum length of the inlet plenum, and the locations of the static-pressure taps for ducted blower coil indoor units and single-package systems. See Figure 8 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 for coil-only indoor units. The inlet plenum duct size shall equal the size of the inlet opening of the air-handling (blower coil) unit or furnace. For a ducted blower coil indoor unit the set up may omit the inlet plenum if an inlet airflow prevention device is installed with a straight internally unobstructed duct on its outlet end with a minimum length equal to 1.5 times the square root of the cross-sectional area of the indoor unit inlet. See section 2.1.5.2 of this appendix for requirements for the locations of static pressure taps built into the inlet airflow prevention device. For all of these arrangements, make a manifold that connects the four static-pressure taps using one of the three configurations specified in section 2.4.1.d. of this appendix. Never use an inlet plenum when testing a non-ducted system.

# 2.5 Indoor Coil Air Property Measurements and Airflow Prevention Devices.
Follow instructions for indoor coil air property measurements as described in section 2.14 of this appendix, unless otherwise instructed in this section.
a. Measure the dry-bulb temperature and water vapor content of the air entering and leaving the indoor coil. If needed, use an air sampling device to divert air to a sensor(s) that measures the water vapor content of the air. See section 5.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 41.1-2013 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) for guidance on constructing an air sampling device. No part of the air sampling device or the tubing transferring the sampled air to the sensor must be within two inches of the test chamber floor, and the transfer tubing must be insulated. The sampling device may also be used for measurement of dry bulb temperature by transferring the sampled air to a remotely located
sensor(s). The air sampling device and the remotely located temperature sensor(s) may be used to determine the entering air dry bulb temperature during any test. The air sampling device and the remotely located sensor(s) may be used to determine the leaving air dry bulb temperature for all tests except:
(1) Cyclic tests; and
(2) Frost accumulation tests.
b. Install grids of temperature sensors to measure dry bulb temperatures of both the entering and leaving airstreams of the indoor unit. These grids of dry bulb temperature sensors may be used to measure average dry bulb temperature entering and leaving the indoor unit in all cases (as an alternative to the dry bulb sensor measuring the sampled air). The leaving airstream grid is required for measurement of average dry bulb temperature leaving the indoor unit for cyclic tests and frost accumulation tests. The grids are also required to measure the air temperature distribution of the entering and leaving airstreams as described in sections 3.1.8 of this appendix. Two such grids may be applied as a thermopile, to directly obtain the average temperature difference rather than directly measuring both entering and leaving average temperatures.
c. Use of airflow prevention devices. Use an inlet and outlet air damper box, or use an inlet upturned duct and an outlet air damper box when conducting one or both of the cyclic tests listed in sections 3.2 and 3.6 of this appendix on ducted systems. If not conducting any cyclic tests, an outlet air damper box is required when testing ducted and non-ducted heat pumps that cycle off the indoor blower during defrost cycles and there is no other means for preventing natural or forced convection through the indoor unit when the indoor blower is off. Never use an inlet damper box or an inlet upturned duct when testing non-ducted indoor units. An inlet upturned duct is a length of ductwork installed upstream from the inlet such that the indoor duct inlet opening, facing upwards, is sufficiently high to prevent natural convection transfer out of the duct. If an inlet upturned duct is used, install a dry bulb temperature sensor near the inlet opening of the indoor duct at a centerline location not higher than the lowest elevation of the duct edges at the inlet, and ensure that any pair of 5-minute averages of the dry bulb temperature at this location, measured at least every minute during the compressor OFF period of the cyclic test, do not differ by more than 1.0 °F.

# 2.5.1 Test Set-Up on the Inlet Side of the Indoor Coil: for Cases Where the Inlet Airflow Prevention Device is Installed
a. Install an airflow prevention device as specified in section 2.5.1.1 or 2.5.1.2 of this appendix, whichever applies.
b. For an inlet damper box, locate the grid of entering air dry-bulb temperature sensors, if used, and the air sampling device, or the sensor used to measure the water vapor content of the inlet air, at a location immediately upstream of the damper box inlet. For an inlet upturned duct, locate the grid of entering air dry-bulb temperature sensors, if used, and the air sampling device, or the sensor used to measure the water vapor content of the inlet air, at a location at least one foot downstream from the beginning of the insulated portion of the duct but before the static pressure measurement.
2.5.1.1 If the section 2.4.2 inlet plenum is installed, construct the airflow prevention device having a cross-sectional flow area equal to or greater than the flow area of the inlet plenum. Install the airflow prevention device upstream of the inlet plenum and construct ductwork connecting it to the inlet plenum. If needed, use an adaptor plate or a transition duct section to connect the airflow prevention device with the inlet plenum. Insulate the ductwork and inlet plenum with thermal insulation that has a nominal overall resistance (R-value) of at least 19 hr · ft
2
· °F/Btu.
2.5.1.2 If the section 2.4.2 inlet plenum is not installed, construct the airflow prevention device having a cross-sectional flow area equal to or greater than the flow area of the air inlet of the indoor unit. Install the airflow prevention device immediately upstream of the inlet of the indoor unit. If needed, use an adaptor plate or a short transition duct section to connect the airflow prevention device with the unit's air inlet. Add static pressure taps at the center of each face of a rectangular airflow prevention device, or at four evenly distributed locations along the circumference of an oval or round airflow prevention device. Locate the pressure taps at a distance from the indoor unit inlet equal to 0.5 times the square root of the cross sectional area of the indoor unit inlet. This location must be between the damper and the inlet of the indoor unit, if a damper is used. Make a manifold that connects the four static pressure taps using one of the configurations shown in Figure 9 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3). Insulate the ductwork with thermal insulation that has a nominal overall resistance (R-value) of at least 19 hr·ft

# 2.5.2 Test Set-Up on the Inlet Side of the Indoor Unit: for Cases Where No Airflow Prevention Device is Installed
If using the section 2.4.2 inlet plenum and a grid of dry bulb temperature sensors, mount the grid at a location upstream of the static pressure taps described in section 2.4.2 of this appendix, preferably at the entrance plane of the inlet plenum. If the section 2.4.2
inlet plenum is not used (
i.e.
for non-ducted units) locate a grid approximately 6 inches upstream of the indoor unit inlet. In the case of a system having multiple non-ducted indoor units, do this for each indoor unit. Position an air sampling device, or the sensor used to measure the water vapor content of the inlet air, immediately upstream of the (each) entering air dry-bulb temperature sensor grid. If a grid of sensors is not used, position the entering air sampling device (or the sensor used to measure the water vapor content of the inlet air) as if the grid were present.

# 2.5.3 Indoor Coil Static Pressure Difference Measurement
Fabricate pressure taps meeting all requirements described in section 6.5.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) and illustrated in Figure 2A of AMCA 210-2007 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3), however, if adhering strictly to the description in section 6.5.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009, the minimum pressure tap length of 2.5 times the inner diameter of Figure 2A of AMCA 210-2007 is waived. Use a differential pressure measuring instrument that is accurate to within ±0.01 inches of water and has a resolution of at least 0.01 inches of water to measure the static pressure difference between the indoor coil air inlet and outlet. Connect one side of the differential pressure instrument to the manifolded pressure taps installed in the outlet plenum. Connect the other side of the instrument to the manifolded pressure taps located in either the inlet plenum or incorporated within the airflow prevention device. For non-ducted systems that are tested with multiple outlet plenums, measure the static pressure within each outlet plenum relative to the surrounding atmosphere.

# 2.5.4 Test Set-Up on the Outlet Side of the Indoor Coil
a. Install an interconnecting duct between the outlet plenum described in section 2.4.1 of this appendix and the airflow measuring apparatus described below in section 2.6 of this appendix. The cross-sectional flow area of the interconnecting duct must be equal to or greater than the flow area of the outlet plenum or the common duct used when testing non-ducted units having multiple indoor coils. If needed, use adaptor plates or transition duct sections to allow the connections. To minimize leakage, tape joints within the interconnecting duct (and the outlet plenum). Construct or insulate the entire flow section with thermal insulation having a nominal overall resistance (R-value) of at least 19 hr·ft
2
· °F/Btu.
b. Install a grid(s) of dry-bulb temperature sensors inside the interconnecting duct. Also, install an air sampling device, or the sensor(s) used to measure the water vapor content of the outlet air, inside the interconnecting duct. Locate the dry-bulb temperature grid(s) upstream of the air sampling device (or the in-duct sensor(s) used to measure the water vapor content of the outlet air). Turn off the sampler fan motor during the cyclic tests. Air leaving an indoor unit that is sampled by an air sampling device for remote water-vapor-content measurement must be returned to the interconnecting duct at a location:
(1) Downstream of the air sampling device;
(2) On the same side of the outlet air damper as the air sampling device; and
(3) Upstream of the section 2.6 airflow measuring apparatus.

# 2.5.4.1 Outlet Air Damper Box Placement and Requirements
If using an outlet air damper box (see section 2.5 of this appendix), the leakage rate from the combination of the outlet plenum, the closed damper, and the duct section that connects these two components must not exceed 20 cubic feet per minute when a negative pressure of 1 inch of water column is maintained at the plenum's inlet.

# 2.5.4.2 Procedures to Minimize Temperature Maldistribution
Use these procedures if necessary to correct temperature maldistributions. Install a mixing device(s) upstream of the outlet air, dry-bulb temperature grid (but downstream of the outlet plenum static pressure taps). Use a perforated screen located between the mixing device and the dry-bulb temperature grid, with a maximum open area of 40 percent. One or both items should help to meet the maximum outlet air temperature distribution specified in section 3.1.8 of this appendix. Mixing devices are described in sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 41.1-2013 and section 5.2.2 of ASHRAE 41.2-1987 (RA 1992) (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3).

# 2.5.4.3 Minimizing Air Leakage
For small-duct, high-velocity systems, install an air damper near the end of the interconnecting duct, just prior to the transition to the airflow measuring apparatus of section 2.6 of this appendix. To minimize air leakage, adjust this damper such that the pressure in the receiving chamber of the airflow measuring apparatus is no more than 0.5 inch of water higher than the surrounding test room ambient. If applicable, in lieu of installing a separate damper, use the outlet air damper box of sections 2.5 and 2.5.4.1 of this appendix if it allows variable positioning. Also apply these steps to any conventional indoor blower unit that creates a static pressure within the receiving chamber
of the airflow measuring apparatus that exceeds the test room ambient pressure by more than 0.5 inches of water column.

# 2.5.5 Dry Bulb Temperature Measurement
a. Measure dry bulb temperatures as specified in sections 4, 5.3, 6, and 7 of ANSI/ASHRAE 41.1-2013 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3).
b. Distribute the sensors of a dry-bulb temperature grid over the entire flow area. The required minimum is 9 sensors per grid.

# 2.5.6 Water Vapor Content Measurement
Determine water vapor content by measuring dry-bulb temperature combined with the air wet-bulb temperature, dew point temperature, or relative humidity. If used, construct and apply wet-bulb temperature sensors as specified in sections 4, 5, 6, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4 of ASHRAE 41.6-2014 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3). The temperature sensor (wick removed) must be accurate to within ±0.2 °F. If used, apply dew point hygrometers as specified in sections 4, 5, 6, 7.1, and 7.4 of ASHRAE 41.6-2014. The dew point hygrometers must be accurate to within ±0.4 °F when operated at conditions that result in the evaluation of dew points above 35 °F. If used, a relative humidity (RH) meter must be accurate to within ±0.7% RH. Other means to determine the psychrometric state of air may be used as long as the measurement accuracy is equivalent to or better than the accuracy achieved from using a wet-bulb temperature sensor that meets the above specifications.

# 2.5.7 Air Damper Box Performance Requirements
If used (see section 2.5 of this appendix), the air damper box(es) must be capable of being completely opened or completely closed within 10 seconds for each action.

# 2.6 Airflow Measuring Apparatus
a. Fabricate and operate an airflow measuring apparatus as specified in section 6.2 and 6.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3). Place the static pressure taps and position the diffusion baffle (settling means) relative to the chamber inlet as indicated in Figure 12 of AMCA 210-07 and/or Figure 14 of ASHRAE 41.2-1987 (RA 1992) (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3). When measuring the static pressure difference across nozzles and/or velocity pressure at nozzle throats using electronic pressure transducers and a data acquisition system, if high frequency fluctuations cause measurement variations to exceed the test tolerance limits specified in section 9.2 and Table 2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009, dampen the measurement system such that the time constant associated with response to a step change in measurement (time for the response to change 63% of the way from the initial output to the final output) is no longer than five seconds.
b. Connect the airflow measuring apparatus to the interconnecting duct section described in section 2.5.4 of this appendix. See sections 6.1.1, 6.1.2, and 6.1.4, and Figures 1, 2, and 4 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009; and Figures D1, D2, and D4 of AHRI 210/240-2008 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) with Addendum 1 and 2 for illustrative examples of how the test apparatus may be applied within a complete laboratory set-up. Instead of following one of these examples, an alternative set-up may be used to handle the air leaving the airflow measuring apparatus and to supply properly conditioned air to the test unit's inlet. The alternative set-up, however, must not interfere with the prescribed means for measuring airflow rate, inlet and outlet air temperatures, inlet and outlet water vapor contents, and external static pressures, nor create abnormal conditions surrounding the test unit. (
Note:
Do not use an enclosure as described in section 6.1.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 when testing triple-split units.)

# 2.7 Electrical Voltage Supply
Perform all tests at the voltage specified in section 6.1.3.2 of AHRI 210/240-2008 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) for “Standard Rating Tests.” If either the indoor or the outdoor unit has a 208V or 200V nameplate voltage and the other unit has a 230V nameplate rating, select the voltage supply on the outdoor unit for testing. Otherwise, supply each unit with its own nameplate voltage. Measure the supply voltage at the terminals on the test unit using a volt meter that provides a reading that is accurate to within ±1.0 percent of the measured quantity.

# 2.8 Electrical Power and Energy Measurements
a. Use an integrating power (watt-hour) measuring system to determine the electrical energy or average electrical power supplied to all components of the air conditioner or heat pump (including auxiliary components such as controls, transformers, crankcase heater, integral condensate pump on non-ducted indoor units, etc.). The watt-hour measuring system must give readings that are accurate to within ±0.5 percent. For cyclic tests, this accuracy is required during both the ON and OFF cycles. Use either two different scales on the same watt-hour meter or two separate watt-hour meters. Activate the scale or meter having the lower power rating within 15 seconds after beginning an OFF cycle. Activate the scale or meter having the higher power rating within 15 seconds prior to beginning an ON cycle. For ducted blower coil systems, the ON cycle lasts from compressor ON to indoor blower OFF. For ducted coil-only systems, the ON
cycle lasts from compressor ON to compressor OFF. For non-ducted units, the ON cycle lasts from indoor blower ON to indoor blower OFF. When testing air conditioners and heat pumps having a variable-speed compressor, avoid using an induction watt/watt-hour meter.
b. When performing section 3.5 and/or 3.8 cyclic tests on non-ducted units, provide instrumentation to determine the average electrical power consumption of the indoor blower motor to within ±1.0 percent. If required according to sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, 3.9.1 of this appendix, and/or 3.10 of this appendix, this same instrumentation requirement (to determine the average electrical power consumption of the indoor blower motor to within ±1.0 percent) applies when testing air conditioners and heat pumps having a variable-speed constant-air-volume-rate indoor blower or a variable-speed, variable-air-volume-rate indoor blower.

# 2.9 Time Measurements
Make elapsed time measurements using an instrument that yields readings accurate to within ±0.2 percent.

# 2.10 Test Apparatus for the Secondary Space Conditioning Capacity Measurement
For all tests, use the indoor air enthalpy method to measure the unit's capacity. This method uses the test set-up specified in sections 2.4 to 2.6 of this appendix. In addition, for all steady-state tests, conduct a second, independent measurement of capacity as described in section 3.1.1 of this appendix. For split systems, use one of the following secondary measurement methods: outdoor air enthalpy method, compressor calibration method, or refrigerant enthalpy method. For single-package units, use either the outdoor air enthalpy method or the compressor calibration method as the secondary measurement.

# 2.10.1 Outdoor Air Enthalpy Method
a. To make a secondary measurement of indoor space conditioning capacity using the outdoor air enthalpy method, do the following:
(1) Measure the electrical power consumption of the test unit;
(2) Measure the air-side capacity at the outdoor coil; and
(3) Apply a heat balance on the refrigerant cycle.
b. The test apparatus required for the outdoor air enthalpy method is a subset of the apparatus used for the indoor air enthalpy method. Required apparatus includes the following:
(1) On the outlet side, an outlet plenum containing static pressure taps (sections 2.4, 2.4.1, and 2.5.3 of this appendix),
(2) An airflow measuring apparatus (section 2.6 of this appendix),
(3) A duct section that connects these two components and itself contains the instrumentation for measuring the dry-bulb temperature and water vapor content of the air leaving the outdoor coil (sections 2.5.4, 2.5.5, and 2.5.6 of this appendix), and
(4) On the inlet side, a sampling device and temperature grid (section 2.11.b of this appendix).
c. During the free outdoor air tests described in sections 3.11.1 and 3.11.1.1 of this appendix, measure the evaporator and condenser temperatures or pressures. On both the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, solder a thermocouple onto a return bend located at or near the midpoint of each coil or at points not affected by vapor superheat or liquid subcooling. Alternatively, if the test unit is not sensitive to the refrigerant charge, install pressure gages to the access valves or to ports created from tapping into the suction and discharge lines according to sections 7.4.2 and 8.2.5 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009. Use this alternative approach when testing a unit charged with a zeotropic refrigerant having a temperature glide in excess of 1 °F at the specified test conditions.

# 2.10.2 Compressor Calibration Method
Measure refrigerant pressures and temperatures to determine the evaporator superheat and the enthalpy of the refrigerant that enters and exits the indoor coil. Determine refrigerant flow rate or, when the superheat of the refrigerant leaving the evaporator is less than 5 °F, total capacity from separate calibration tests conducted under identical operating conditions. When using this method, install instrumentation and measure refrigerant properties according to section 7.4.2 and 8.2.5 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3). If removing the refrigerant before applying refrigerant lines and subsequently recharging, use the steps in 7.4.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 in addition to the methods of section 2.2.5 of this appendix to confirm the refrigerant charge. Use refrigerant temperature and pressure measuring instruments that meet the specifications given in sections 5.1.1 and 5.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009.

# 2.10.3 Refrigerant Enthalpy Method
For this method, calculate space conditioning capacity by determining the refrigerant enthalpy change for the indoor coil and directly measuring the refrigerant flow rate. Use section 7.5.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) for the requirements for this method, including the additional instrumentation requirements, and information on placing the flow
meter and a sight glass. Use refrigerant temperature, pressure, and flow measuring instruments that meet the specifications given in sections 5.1.1, 5.2, and 5.5.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009. Refrigerant flow measurement device(s), if used, must be either elevated at least two feet from the test chamber floor or placed upon insulating material having a total thermal resistance of at least R-12 and extending at least one foot laterally beyond each side of the device(s)' exposed surfaces.

# 2.11 Measurement of Test Room Ambient Conditions
Follow instructions for setting up air sampling device and aspirating psychrometer as described in section 2.14 of this appendix, unless otherwise instructed in this section.
a. If using a test set-up where air is ducted directly from the conditioning apparatus to the indoor coil inlet (see Figure 2, Loop Air-Enthalpy Test Method Arrangement, of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3)), add instrumentation to permit measurement of the indoor test room dry-bulb temperature.
b. On the outdoor side, use one of the following two approaches, except that approach (1) is required for all evaporatively cooled units and units that transfer condensate to the outdoor unit for evaporation using condenser heat.
(1) Use sampling tree air collection on all air-inlet surfaces of the outdoor unit.
(2) Use sampling tree air collection on one or more faces of the outdoor unit and demonstrate air temperature uniformity as follows. Install a grid of evenly distributed thermocouples on each air-permitting face on the inlet of the outdoor unit. Install the thermocouples on the air sampling device, locate them individually or attach them to a wire structure. If not installed on the air sampling device, install the thermocouple grid 6 to 24 inches from the unit. Evenly space the thermocouples across the coil inlet surface and install them to avoid sampling of discharge air or blockage of air recirculation. The grid of thermocouples must provide at least 16 measuring points per face or one measurement per square foot of inlet face area, whichever is less. Construct this grid and use as per section 5.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 41.1-2013 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3). The maximum difference between the average temperatures measured during the test period of any two pairs of these individual thermocouples located at any of the faces of the inlet of the outdoor unit, must not exceed 2.0 °F, otherwise use approach (1).
Locate the air sampling devices at the geometric center of each side; the branches may be oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the longer edges of the air inlet area. Size the air sampling devices in the outdoor air inlet location such that they cover at least 75% of the face area of the side of the coil that they are measuring.
Review air distribution at the test facility point of supply to the unit and remediate as necessary prior to the beginning of testing. Mixing fans can be used to ensure adequate air distribution in the test room. If used, orient mixing fans such that they are pointed away from the air intake so that the mixing fan exhaust does not affect the outdoor coil air volume rate. Particular attention should be given to prevent the mixing fans from affecting (enhancing or limiting) recirculation of condenser fan exhaust air back through the unit. Any fan used to enhance test room air mixing shall not cause air velocities in the vicinity of the test unit to exceed 500 feet per minute.
The air sampling device may be larger than the face area of the side being measured. Take care, however, to prevent discharge air from being sampled. If an air sampling device dimension extends beyond the inlet area of the unit, block holes in the air sampling device to prevent sampling of discharge air. Holes can be blocked to reduce the region of coverage of the intake holes both in the direction of the trunk axis or perpendicular to the trunk axis. For intake hole region reduction in the direction of the trunk axis, block holes of one or more adjacent pairs of branches (the branches of a pair connect opposite each other at the same trunk location) at either the outlet end or the closed end of the trunk. For intake hole region reduction perpendicular to the trunk axis, block off the same number of holes on each branch on both sides of the trunk.
Connect a maximum of four (4) air sampling devices to each aspirating psychrometer. In order to proportionately divide the flow stream for multiple air sampling devices for a given aspirating psychrometer, the tubing or conduit conveying sampled air to the psychrometer must be of equivalent lengths for each air sampling device. Preferentially, the air sampling device should be hard connected to the aspirating psychrometer, but if space constraints do not allow this, the assembly shall have a means of allowing a flexible tube to connect the air sampling device to the aspirating psychrometer. Insulate and route the tubing or conduit to prevent heat transfer to the air stream. Insulate any surface of the air conveying tubing in contact with surrounding air at a different temperature than the sampled air with thermal insulation with a nominal thermal resistance (R-value) of at least 19 hr • ft
2
• °F/Btu. Alternatively the conduit may have lower thermal resistance if additional sensor(s) are used to measure dry bulb temperature at the outlet of each air sampling device. No part of the air sampling device or the tubing conducting the sampled air to the sensors may be within two inches of the test chamber floor.
Take pairs of measurements (
e.g.
dry bulb temperature and wet bulb temperature) used to determine water vapor content of sampled air in the same location.

# 2.12 Measurement of Indoor Blower Speed
When required, measure fan speed using a revolution counter, tachometer, or stroboscope that gives readings accurate to within ±1.0 percent.

# 2.13 Measurement of Barometric Pressure
Determine the average barometric pressure during each test. Use an instrument that meets the requirements specified in section 5.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3).

# 2.14 Air Sampling Device and Aspirating Psychrometer Requirements
Make air temperature measurements in accordance with ANSI/ASHRAE 41.1-2013 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3), unless otherwise instructed in this section.

# 2.14.1 Air Sampling Device Requirements
The air sampling device is intended to draw in a sample of the air at the critical locations of a unit under test. Construct the device from stainless steel, plastic or other suitable, durable materials. It shall have a main flow trunk tube with a series of branch tubes connected to the trunk tube. Holes must be on the side of the sampler facing the upstream direction of the air source. Use other sizes and rectangular shapes, and scale them accordingly with the following guidelines:
1. Minimum hole density of 6 holes per square foot of area to be sampled.
2. Sampler branch tube pitch (spacing) of 6 ± 3 in.
3. Manifold trunk to branch diameter ratio having a minimum of 3:1 ratio.
4. Distribute hole pitch (spacing) equally over the branch (
1/2
pitch from the closed end to the nearest hole).
5. Maximum individual hole to branch diameter ratio of 1:2 (1:3 preferred).
The minimum average velocity through the air sampling device holes must be 2.5 ft/s as determined by evaluating the sum of the open area of the holes as compared to the flow area in the aspirating psychrometer.

# 2.14.2 Aspirating Psychrometer
The psychrometer consists of a flow section and a fan to draw air through the flow section and measures an average value of the sampled air stream. At a minimum, the flow section shall have a means for measuring the dry bulb temperature (typically, a resistance temperature device (RTD) and a means for measuring the humidity (RTD with wetted sock, chilled mirror hygrometer, or relative humidity sensor). The aspirating psychrometer shall include a fan that either can be adjusted manually or automatically to maintain required velocity across the sensors.
Construct the psychrometer using suitable material which may be plastic (such as polycarbonate), aluminum or other metallic materials. Construct all psychrometers for a given system being tested, using the same material. Design the psychrometers such that radiant heat from the motor (for driving the fan that draws sampled air through the psychrometer) does not affect sensor measurements. For aspirating psychrometers, velocity across the wet bulb sensor must be 1000 ± 200 ft/min. For all other psychrometers, velocity must be as specified by the sensor manufacturer.

# 3 Testing Procedures

# 3.1 General Requirements
If, during the testing process, an equipment set-up adjustment is made that would have altered the performance of the unit during any already completed test, then repeat all tests affected by the adjustment. For cyclic tests, instead of maintaining an air volume rate, for each airflow nozzle, maintain the static pressure difference or velocity pressure during an ON period at the same pressure difference or velocity pressure as measured during the steady-state test conducted at the same test conditions.
Use the testing procedures in this section to collect the data used for calculating
(1) Performance metrics for central air conditioners and heat pumps during the cooling season;
(2) Performance metrics for heat pumps during the heating season; and
(3) Power consumption metric(s) for central air conditioners and heat pumps during the off mode season(s).

# 3.1.1 Primary and Secondary Test Methods
For all tests, use the indoor air enthalpy method test apparatus to determine the unit's space conditioning capacity. The procedure and data collected, however, differ slightly depending upon whether the test is a steady-state test, a cyclic test, or a frost accumulation test. The following sections described these differences. For full-capacity cooling-mode test and (for a heat pump) the full-capacity heating-mode test, use one of the acceptable secondary methods specified in section 2.10 of this appendix to determine indoor space conditioning capacity. Calculate this secondary check of capacity according to section 3.11 of this appendix. The two capacity measurements must agree to within 6 percent to constitute a valid test. For this capacity comparison, use the Indoor Air Enthalpy Method capacity that is calculated in section 7.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3)
(and, if testing a coil-only system, compare capacities before making the after-test fan heat adjustments described in section 3.3, 3.4, 3.7, and 3.10 of this appendix). However, include the appropriate section 3.3 to 3.5 and 3.7 to 3.10 fan heat adjustments within the indoor air enthalpy method capacities used for the section 4 seasonal calculations of this appendix.

# 3.1.2 Manufacturer-Provided Equipment Overrides
Where needed, the manufacturer must provide a means for overriding the controls of the test unit so that the compressor(s) operates at the specified speed or capacity and the indoor blower operates at the specified speed or delivers the specified air volume rate. For variable-speed non-communicating coil-only air conditioners and heat pumps, the control system shall be provided with a control signal indicating operation at high or low stage, rather than testing with the compressor speed fixed at specific speeds, with the exception that compressor speed override may be used for heating mode test H1
2
.

# 3.1.3 Airflow Through the Outdoor Coil
For all tests, meet the requirements given in section 6.1.3.4 of AHRI 210/240-2008 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) when obtaining the airflow through the outdoor coil.

# 3.1.3.1 Double-Ducted
For products intended to be installed with the outdoor airflow ducted, install the unit with outdoor coil ductwork installed per manufacturer installation instructions. The unit must operate between 0.10 and 0.15 in H
2
O external static pressure. Make external static pressure measurements in accordance with ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 section 6.4 and 6.5.

# 3.1.4 Airflow Through the Indoor Coil
Determine airflow setting(s) before testing begins. Unless otherwise specified within this or its subsections, make no changes to the airflow setting(s) after initiation of testing.

# 3.1.4.1 Cooling Full-Load Air Volume Rate

# 3.1.4.1.1 Cooling Full-Load Air Volume Rate for Ducted Units
Identify the certified Cooling full-load air volume rate and certified instructions for setting fan speed or controls. If there is no certified Cooling full-load air volume rate, use a value equal to the certified cooling capacity of the unit times 400 scfm per 12,000 Btu/h. If there are no instructions for setting fan speed or controls, use the as-shipped settings. Use the following procedure to confirm and, if necessary, adjust the Cooling full-load air volume rate and the fan speed or control settings to meet each test procedure requirement:
a. For all ducted blower-coil systems, except those having a constant-air-volume-rate indoor blower:
Step (1) Operate the unit under conditions specified for the A test (for single-stage units) or A
2
test (for non-single-stage units) using the certified fan speed or controls settings, and adjust the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus to achieve the certified cooling full-load air volume rate;
Step (2) Measure the external static pressure;
Step (3) If this external static pressure is equal to or greater than the applicable minimum external static pressure cited in Table 4 to this appendix, the pressure requirement is satisfied; proceed to step 7 of this section. If this external static pressure is not equal to or greater than the applicable minimum external static pressure cited in Table 4, proceed to step 4 of this section;
Step (4) Increase the external static pressure by adjusting the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus until the first to occur of:
(i) The applicable Table 4 to this appendix minimum is equaled or
(ii) The measured air volume rate equals 90 percent or less of the cooling full-load air volume rate;
Step (5) If the conditions of step 4 (i) of this section occur first, the pressure requirement is satisfied; proceed to step 7 of this section. If the conditions of step 4 (ii) of this section occur first, proceed to step 6 of this section;
Step (6) Make an incremental change to the setup of the indoor blower (
e.g.,
next highest fan motor pin setting, next highest fan motor speed) and repeat the evaluation process beginning at step 1 of this section. If the indoor blower setup cannot be further changed, increase the external static pressure by adjusting the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus until the applicable Table 4 to this appendix minimum is equaled; proceed to step 7 of this section;
Step (7) The airflow constraints have been satisfied. Use the measured air volume rate as the cooling full-load air volume rate. Use the final indoor fan speed or control settings of the unit under test for all tests that use the cooling full-load air volume rate. Adjust the fan of the airflow measurement apparatus if needed to obtain the same full-load air volume rate (in scfm) for all such tests, unless the system modulates indoor blower speed with outdoor dry bulb temperature or to adjust the sensible to total cooling capacity ratio—in this case, use an air volume rate that represents a normal installation and calculate the target external static pressure as described in section 3.1.4.2 of this appendix.
b. For ducted blower-coil systems with a constant-air-volume-rate indoor blower. For all tests that specify the cooling full-load air volume rate, obtain an external static pressure as close to (but not less than) the applicable Table 4 to this appendix value that does not cause either automatic shutdown of the indoor blower or a value of air volume rate variation Q
Var
, defined as follows, that is greater than 10 percent.

Additional test steps as described in section 3.3.f of this appendix are required if the measured external static pressure exceeds the target value by more than 0.03 inches of water.
c. For coil-only indoor units. For the A or A
2
Test, (exclusively), the pressure drop across the indoor coil assembly must not exceed 0.30 inches of water. If this pressure drop is exceeded, reduce the air volume rate until the measured pressure drop equals the specified maximum. Use this reduced air volume rate for all tests that require the Cooling full-load air volume rate.

If a closed-loop, air-enthalpy test apparatus is used on the indoor side, limit the resistance to airflow on the inlet side of the indoor blower coil to a maximum value of 0.1 inch of water.
d. For ducted systems having multiple indoor blowers within a single indoor section, obtain the full-load air volume rate with all indoor blowers operating unless prevented by the controls of the unit. In such cases, turn on the maximum number of indoor blowers permitted by the unit's controls. Where more than one option exists for meeting this “on” indoor blower requirement, which indoor blower(s) are turned on must match that specified in the certification report. Conduct section 3.1.4.1.1 setup steps for each indoor blower separately. If two or more indoor blowers are connected to a common duct as per section 2.4.1 of this appendix, temporarily divert their air volume to the test room when confirming or adjusting the setup configuration of individual indoor blowers. The allocation of the system's full-load air volume rate assigned to each “on” indoor blower must match that specified by the manufacturer in the certification report.

# 3.1.4.1.2 Cooling Full-Load Air Volume Rate for Non-Ducted Units
For non-ducted units, the Cooling full-load air volume rate is the air volume rate that results during each test when the unit is operated at an external static pressure of zero inches of water.

# 3.1.4.2 Cooling Minimum Air Volume Rate
Identify the certified cooling minimum air volume rate and certified instructions for setting fan speed or controls. If there is no certified cooling minimum air volume rate, use the final indoor blower control settings as determined when setting the cooling full-load air volume rate, and readjust the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus if necessary to reset to the cooling full load air volume obtained in section 3.1.4.1 of this appendix. Otherwise, calculate the target external static pressure and follow instructions a, b, c, d, or e of this section. The target external static pressure, ΔP
st__i
, for any test “i” with a specified air volume rate not equal to the Cooling full-load air volume rate is determined as follows:
ER05JA17.154
Where:
ΔP
st__i
= target minimum external static pressure for test i;
ΔP
st__full
= minimum external static pressure for test A or A

(Table 4);
Q
i
= air volume rate for test i; and
Q
full
= Cooling full-load air volume rate as measured after setting and/or adjustment as described in section 3.1.4.1.1 of this appendix.
a. For a ducted blower-coil system without a constant-air-volume indoor blower, adjust for external static pressure as follows:
Step (1) Operate the unit under conditions specified for the B
1
test using the certified fan speed or controls settings, and adjust the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus to achieve the certified cooling minimum air volume rate;
Step (2) Measure the external static pressure;
Step (3) If this pressure is equal to or greater than the minimum external static pressure computed in step 2 of this section, the pressure requirement is satisfied; proceed to step 7 of this section. If this pressure is not equal to or greater than the minimum external static pressure computed in step 2 of this section, proceed to step 4 of this section;
Step (4) Increase the external static pressure by adjusting the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus until either:
(i) The pressure is equal to the target minimum external static pressure, ΔP
st_i
, computed in step 1 of this section; or
(ii) The measured air volume rate equals 90 percent or less of the cooling minimum air volume rate, whichever occurs first;
Step (5) If the conditions of step 4 (i) of this section occur first, the pressure requirement is satisfied; proceed to step 7 of this section. If the conditions of step 4 (ii) of this section occur first, proceed to step 6 of this section;
Step (6) Make an incremental change to the setup of the indoor blower (
e.g.,
next highest fan motor pin setting, next highest fan motor speed) and repeat the evaluation process beginning at step 1 of this section. If the indoor blower setup cannot be further changed, increase the external static pressure by adjusting the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus until it equals the minimum external static pressure computed in step 2 of this section; proceed to step 7 of this section;
Step (7) The airflow constraints have been satisfied. Use the measured air volume rate as the cooling minimum air volume rate. Use the final indoor fan speed or control settings of the unit under test for all tests that use the cooling minimum air volume rate. Adjust the fan of the airflow measurement apparatus if needed to obtain the same cooling minimum air volume rate (in scfm) for all such tests, unless the system modulates the indoor blower speed with outdoor dry bulb temperature or to adjust the sensible to total cooling capacity ratio—in this case, use an air volume rate that represents a normal installation and calculate the target minimum external static pressure as described in this section.
b. For ducted units with constant-air-volume indoor blowers, conduct all tests that specify the cooling minimum air volume rate—(
i.e.,

Tests)—at an external static pressure that does not cause either an automatic shutdown of the indoor blower or a value of air volume rate variation Q
Var
, defined in section 3.1.4.1.1.b of this appendix, that is greater than 10 percent, while being as close to, but not less than the target minimum external static pressure. Additional test steps as described in section 3.3.f of this appendix are required if the measured external static pressure exceeds the target value by more than 0.03 inches of water.
c. For ducted two-capacity coil-only systems, the cooling minimum air volume rate is the higher of—
(1) The rate specified by the installation instructions included with the unit by the manufacturer; or
(2) 75 percent of the cooling full-load air volume rate. During the laboratory tests on a coil-only (fanless) system, obtain this cooling minimum air volume rate regardless of the pressure drop across the indoor coil assembly.
d. For non-ducted units, the cooling minimum air volume rate is the air volume rate that results during each test when the unit operates at an external static pressure of zero inches of water and at the indoor blower setting used at low compressor capacity (two-capacity system) or minimum compressor speed (variable-speed system). For units having a single-speed compressor and a variable-speed variable-air-volume-rate indoor blower, use the lowest fan setting allowed for cooling.
e. For ducted systems having multiple indoor blowers within a single indoor section,
operate the indoor blowers such that the lowest air volume rate allowed by the unit's controls is obtained when operating the lone single-speed compressor or when operating at low compressor capacity while meeting the requirements of section 2.2.3.2 of this appendix for the minimum number of blowers that must be turned off. Using the target external static pressure and the certified air volume rates, follow the procedures described in section 3.1.4.2.a of this appendix if the indoor blowers are not constant-air-volume indoor blowers or as described in section 3.1.4.2.b of this appendix if the indoor blowers are not constant-air-volume indoor blowers. The sum of the individual “on” indoor blowers' air volume rates is the cooling minimum air volume rate for the system.
f. For ducted variable-speed compressor systems tested with a coil-only indoor unit, the cooling minimum air volume rate is the higher of:
(1) The rate specified by the installation instructions included with the unit by the manufacturer; or
(2) 75 percent of the cooling full-load air volume rate. During the laboratory tests on a coil-only (fanless) system, obtain this cooling minimum air volume rate regardless of the pressure drop across the indoor coil assembly.

Identify the certified cooling intermediate air volume rate and certified instructions for setting fan speed or controls. If there is no certified cooling intermediate air volume rate, use the final indoor blower control settings as determined when setting the cooling full load air volume rate, and readjust the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus if necessary to reset to the cooling full load air volume obtained in section 3.1.4.1 of this appendix. Otherwise, calculate target minimum external static pressure as described in section 3.1.4.2 of this appendix, and set the air volume rate as follows.
a. For a ducted blower coil system without a constant-air-volume indoor blower, adjust for external static pressure as described in section 3.1.4.2.a of this appendix for cooling minimum air volume rate.
b. For a ducted blower-coil system with a constant-air-volume indoor blower, conduct the E
V
Test at an external static pressure that does not cause either an automatic shutdown of the indoor blower or a value of air volume rate variation Q
Var
, defined in section 3.1.4.1.1.b of this appendix, that is greater than 10 percent, while being as close to, but not less than the target minimum external static pressure. Additional test steps as described in section 3.3.f of this appendix are required if the measured external static pressure exceeds the target value by more than 0.03 inches of water.
c. For non-ducted units, the cooling intermediate air volume rate is the air volume rate that results when the unit operates at an external static pressure of zero inches of water and at the fan speed selected by the controls of the unit for the E
V
Test conditions.

# 3.1.4.4 Heating Full-Load Air Volume Rate

# 3.1.4.4.1 Ducted Heat Pumps Where the Heating and Cooling Full-Load Air Volume Rates Are the Same
a. Use the Cooling full-load air volume rate as the heating full-load air volume rate for:
(1) Ducted blower coil system heat pumps that do not have a constant-air-volume indoor blower, and that operate at the same airflow-control setting during both the A (or A

) and the H1 (or H1
2
) Tests;

b. For heat pumps that meet the above criteria “1” and “3,” no minimum requirements apply to the measured external or internal, respectively, static pressure. Use the final indoor blower control settings as determined when setting the Cooling full-load air volume rate, and readjust the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus if necessary to reset to the cooling full-load air volume obtained in section 3.1.4.1 of this appendix. For heat pumps that meet the above criterion “2,” test at an external static pressure that does not cause an automatic shutdown of the indoor blower or air volume rate variation Q
Var
, defined in section 3.1.4.1.1.b of this appendix, greater than 10 percent, while being as close to, but not less than, the same Table 4 minimum external static pressure as was specified for the A (or A

Identify the certified heating full-load air volume rate and certified instructions for
setting fan speed or controls. If there is no certified heating full-load air volume rate, use the final indoor blower control settings as determined when setting the cooling full-load air volume rate, and readjust the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus if necessary to reset to the cooling full-load air volume obtained in section 3.1.4.1 of this appendix. Otherwise, calculate the target minimum external static pressure as described in section 3.1.4.2 of this appendix and set the air volume rate as follows.

c. When testing ducted, two-capacity blower coil system northern heat pumps (see section 1.2 of this appendix, Definitions), use the appropriate approach of the above two cases. For coil-only system northern heat pumps, the heating full-load air volume rate is the lesser of the rate specified by the manufacturer in the installation instructions included with the unit or 133 percent of the cooling full-load air volume rate. For this latter case, obtain the heating full-load air volume rate regardless of the pressure drop across the indoor coil assembly.

# 3.1.4.4.3 Ducted Heating-Only Heat Pumps
Identify the certified heating full-load air volume rate and certified instructions for setting fan speed or controls. If there is no certified heating full-load air volume rate, use a value equal to the certified heating capacity of the unit times 400 scfm per 12,000 Btu/h. If there are no instructions for setting fan speed or controls, use the as-shipped settings.
a. For all ducted heating-only blower-coil system heat pumps, except those having a constant-air-volume-rate indoor blower: conduct the following steps only during the first test, the H1 or H1

Test, (exclusively), the pressure drop across the indoor coil assembly must not exceed 0.30 inches of water. If this pressure drop is exceeded, reduce the air volume rate until the measured pressure drop equals the specified maximum. Use this reduced air volume rate for all tests that require the heating full-load air volume rate.

# 3.1.4.4.4 Non-Ducted Heat Pumps, Including Non-Ducted Heating-Only Heat Pumps
For non-ducted heat pumps, the heating full-load air volume rate is the air volume rate that results during each test when the unit operates at an external static pressure of zero inches of water.

# 3.1.5 Indoor Test Room Requirement When the Air Surrounding the Indoor Unit is Not Supplied From the Same Source as the Air Entering the Indoor Unit
If using a test set-up where air is ducted directly from the air reconditioning apparatus to the indoor coil inlet (see Figure 2, Loop Air-Enthalpy Test Method Arrangement, of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3)), maintain the dry bulb temperature within the test room within ±5.0 °F of the applicable sections 3.2 and 3.6 dry bulb temperature test condition for the air entering the indoor unit.

# 3.1.7 Test Sequence
Before making test measurements used to calculate performance, operate the equipment for the “break-in” period specified in the certification report, which may not exceed 20 hours. Each compressor of the unit must undergo this “break-in” period. When testing a ducted unit (except if a heating-only heat pump), conduct the A or A
2
Test first to establish the cooling full-load air volume rate. For ducted heat pumps where the heating and cooling full-load air volume rates are different, make the first heating mode test one that requires the heating full-load air volume rate. For ducted heating-only heat pumps, conduct the H1 or H1
2
Test first to establish the heating full-load air volume rate. When conducting a cyclic test, always conduct it immediately after the steady-state test that requires the same test conditions. For variable-speed systems, the first test using the cooling minimum air volume rate should precede the E
V
Test, and the first test using the heating minimum air volume rate must precede the H2
V
Test. The test laboratory makes all other decisions on the test sequence.

# 3.1.8 Requirement for the Air Temperature Distribution Leaving the Indoor Coil
For at least the first cooling mode test and the first heating mode test, monitor the temperature distribution of the air leaving the indoor coil using the grid of individual sensors described in sections 2.5 and 2.5.4 of this appendix. For the 30-minute data collection interval used to determine capacity, the maximum spread among the outlet dry bulb temperatures from any data sampling must not exceed 1.5 °F. Install the mixing devices described in section 2.5.4.2 of this appendix to minimize the temperature spread.

# 3.1.9 Requirement for the Air Temperature Distribution Entering the Outdoor Coil
Monitor the Temperatures of the Air Entering the Outdoor Coil Using Air Sampling Devices and/or Temperature Sensor Grids, Maintaining the Required Tolerances, if Applicable, as Described in section 2.11 of this appendix

# 3.1.10 Control of Auxiliary Resistive Heating Elements
Except as noted, disable heat pump resistance elements used for heating indoor air at all times, including during defrost cycles and if they are normally regulated by a heat comfort controller. For heat pumps equipped with a heat comfort controller, enable the heat pump resistance elements only during the below-described, short test. For single-speed heat pumps covered under section 3.6.1 of this appendix, the short test follows the H1 or, if conducted, the H1C Test. For two-capacity heat pumps and heat pumps covered under section 3.6.2 of this appendix, the short test follows the H1
2
Test. Set the heat comfort controller to provide the maximum supply air temperature. With the heat pump operating and while maintaining the heating full-load air volume rate, measure the temperature of the air leaving the indoor-side beginning 5 minutes after activating the heat comfort controller. Sample the outlet dry-bulb temperature at regular intervals that span 5 minutes or less. Collect data for 10 minutes, obtaining at least 3 samples. Calculate the average outlet temperature over the 10-minute interval, T
CC.

This set of tests is for single-speed-compressor units that do not have a cooling minimum air volume rate or a cooling intermediate air volume rate that is different than the cooling full load air volume rate. Conduct two steady-state wet coil tests, the A and B Tests. Use the two optional dry-coil tests, the steady-state C Test and the cyclic D Test, to determine the cooling mode cyclic degradation coefficient, C

tests. The compressor shall operate at the same cooling minimum speed, measured by RPM or power input frequency (Hz), for the B

tests. Determine the cooling intermediate compressor speed cited in Table 8 to this appendix, as required, using:
ER25OC22.022
Where a tolerance of plus 5 percent or the next higher inverter frequency step from that calculated is allowed.
b. For units that modulate the indoor blower speed to adjust the sensible to total (S/T) cooling capacity ratio, use cooling full-load, cooling intermediate, and cooling minimum air volume rates that represent a normal installation. Additionally, if conducting the dry-coil tests, operate the unit in the same S/T capacity control mode as used for the F

Test.
c. For multiple-split air conditioners and heat pumps (except where noted), the following procedures supersede the above requirements: For all Table 8 tests specified for a minimum compressor speed, turn off at least one indoor unit. The manufacturer shall designate the particular indoor unit(s) that is turned off. The manufacturer must also specify the compressor speed used for the Table 8 E
V
Test, a cooling-mode intermediate compressor speed that falls within
1/4
and
3/4
of the difference between the full and minimum cooling-mode speeds. The manufacturer should prescribe an intermediate speed that is expected to yield the highest EER for the given E
V
Test conditions and bracketed compressor speed range. The manufacturer can designate that one or more indoor units are turned off for the E
V
Test.
d. For variable-speed non-communicating coil-only air conditioners and heat pumps, the manufacturer-provided equipment overrides for full and minimum compressor speed described in section 3.1.2 of this appendix shall be limited to two stages of digital on/off control.

a. For the pretest interval, operate the test room reconditioning apparatus and the unit to be tested until maintaining equilibrium conditions for at least 30 minutes at the specified section 3.2 test conditions. Use the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus and, if installed, the indoor blower of the test unit to obtain and then maintain the indoor air volume rate and/or external static pressure specified for the particular test. Continuously record (see section 1.2 of this appendix, Definitions):
(1) The dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor coil,
(2) The water vapor content of the air entering the indoor coil,
(3) The dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the outdoor coil, and
(4) For the section 2.2.4 of this appendix cases where its control is required, the water vapor content of the air entering the outdoor coil.
Refer to section 3.11 of this appendix for additional requirements that depend on the selected secondary test method.
b. After satisfying the pretest equilibrium requirements, make the measurements specified in Table 3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 for the indoor air enthalpy method and the user-selected secondary method. Make said Table 3 measurements at equal intervals that span 5 minutes or less. Continue data sampling until reaching a 30-minute period (
e.g.,
seven consecutive 5-minute samples) where the test tolerances specified in Table 9 are satisfied. For those continuously recorded parameters, use the entire data set from the 30-minute interval to evaluate Table 9 compliance. Determine the average electrical power consumption of the air conditioner or heat pump over the same 30-minute interval.
c. Calculate indoor-side total cooling capacity and sensible cooling capacity as specified in sections 7.3.3.1 and 7.3.3.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3). To calculate capacity, use the averages of the measurements (
e.g.
inlet and outlet dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures measured at the psychrometers) that are continuously recorded for the same 30-minute interval used as described above to evaluate compliance with test tolerances. Do not adjust the parameters used in calculating capacity for the permitted variations in test conditions. Evaluate air enthalpies based on the measured barometric pressure. Use the values of the specific heat of air given in section 7.3.3.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) for calculation of the sensible cooling capacities. Assign the average total space cooling capacity, average sensible cooling capacity, and electrical power consumption over the 30-minute data collection interval to the variables Q
c
k
(T), Q
sc
k
(T) and E
c
k
(T), respectively. For these three variables, replace the “T” with the nominal outdoor temperature at which the test was conducted. The superscript k is used only when testing multi-capacity units. Use the superscript k=2 to denote a test with the unit operating at high capacity or full speed, k=1 to denote low capacity or minimum speed, and k=v to denote the intermediate speed.

# 3.4 Test Procedures for the Steady-State Dry-Coil Cooling-Mode Tests (the C, C
1

# , C

# , and G
1

# Tests)
a. Except for the modifications noted in this section, conduct the steady-state dry coil cooling mode tests as specified in section 3.3 of this appendix for wet coil tests. Prior to recording data during the steady-state dry coil test, operate the unit at least one hour after achieving dry coil conditions. Drain the drain pan and plug the drain opening. Thereafter, the drain pan should remain completely dry.
b. Denote the resulting total space cooling capacity and electrical power derived from the test as Q
ss,dry
and E
ss,dry.
With regard to a section 3.3 deviation, do not adjust Q
ss,dry
for duct losses (
i.e.,
do not apply section 7.3.3.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009). In preparing for the section 3.5 cyclic tests of this appendix, record the average indoor-side air volume rate, V
, specific heat of the air, Cp,a (expressed on dry air basis), specific volume of the air at the nozzles, v′
n
, humidity ratio at the nozzles, W
n
, and either pressure difference or velocity pressure for the flow nozzles. For units having a variable-speed indoor blower (that provides either a constant or variable air volume rate) that will or may be tested during the cyclic dry coil cooling mode test with the indoor blower turned off (see section 3.5 of this appendix), include the electrical power used by the indoor blower motor among the recorded parameters from the 30-minute test.
c. If the temperature sensors used to provide the primary measurement of the indoor-side dry bulb temperature difference during the steady-state dry-coil test and the subsequent cyclic dry-coil test are different, include measurements of the latter sensors among the regularly sampled data. Beginning at the start of the 30-minute data collection period, measure and compute the indoor-side air dry-bulb temperature difference using both sets of instrumentation, ΔT (Set SS) and ΔT (Set CYC), for each equally spaced data sample. If using a consistent data sampling rate that is less than 1 minute, calculate and record minutely averages for the two temperature differences. If using a consistent sampling rate of one minute or more, calculate and record the two temperature differences from each data sample. After having recorded the seventh (i=7) set of temperature differences, calculate the following ratio using the first seven sets of values:
ER05JA17.161
Each time a subsequent set of temperature differences is recorded (if sampling more frequently than every 5 minutes), calculate
F
CD
using the most recent seven sets of values. Continue these calculations until the 30-minute period is completed or until a value for
F
CD
is calculated that falls outside the allowable range of 0.94-1.06. If the latter occurs, immediately suspend the test and identify the cause for the disparity in the two temperature difference measurements. Recalibration of one or both sets of instrumentation may be required. If all the values for
F
CD
are within the allowable range, save the final value of the ratio from the 30-minute test as
F
CD
*. If the temperature sensors used to provide the primary measurement of the indoor-side dry bulb temperature difference during the steady-state dry-coil test and the subsequent cyclic dry-coil test are the same, set

# 3.5 Test Procedures for the Cyclic Dry-Coil Cooling-Mode Tests (the D, D
1

# , D
2

# , and I
1

# Tests)
After completing the steady-state dry-coil test, remove the outdoor air enthalpy method test apparatus, if connected, and begin manual OFF/ON cycling of the unit's compressor. The test set-up should otherwise be identical to the set-up used during the steady-state dry coil test. When testing heat pumps, leave the reversing valve during the compressor OFF cycles in the same position as used for the compressor ON cycles, unless automatically changed by the controls of the unit. For units having a variable-speed indoor blower, the manufacturer has the option of electing at the outset whether to conduct the cyclic test with the indoor blower enabled or disabled. Always revert to testing with the indoor blower disabled if cyclic testing with the fan enabled is unsuccessful.
a. For all cyclic tests, the measured capacity must be adjusted for the thermal mass stored in devices and connections located between measured points. Follow the procedure outlined in section 7.4.3.4.5 of ASHRAE 116-2010 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) to ensure any required measurements are taken.
b. For units having a single-speed or two-capacity compressor, cycle the compressor OFF for 24 minutes and then ON for 6 minutes (Δτ
cyc,dry
= 0.5 hours). For units having a variable-speed compressor, cycle the compressor OFF for 48 minutes and then ON for 12 minutes (Δτ
cyc,dry
= 1.0 hours). Repeat the OFF/ON compressor cycling pattern until the test is completed. Allow the controls of the unit to regulate cycling of the outdoor fan. If an upturned duct is used, measure the dry-bulb temperature at the inlet of the device at least once every minute and ensure that its test operating tolerance is within 1.0 °F for each compressor OFF period.
c. Sections 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 of this appendix specify airflow requirements through the indoor coil of ducted and non-ducted indoor units, respectively. In all cases, use the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus (covered under section 2.6 of this appendix) along with the indoor blower of the unit, if installed and operating, to approximate a step response in the indoor coil airflow. Regulate the exhaust fan to quickly obtain and then maintain the flow nozzle static pressure difference or velocity pressure at the same value as was measured during the steady-state dry coil test. The pressure difference or velocity pressure should be within 2 percent of the value from the steady-state dry coil test within 15 seconds after airflow initiation. For units having a variable-speed indoor blower that ramps when cycling on and/or off, use the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus to impose a step response that begins at the initiation of ramp up and ends at the termination of ramp down.
d. For units having a variable-speed indoor blower, conduct the cyclic dry coil test using the pull-thru approach described below if any of the following occur when testing with the fan operating:
(1) The test unit automatically cycles off;
(2) Its blower motor reverses; or
(3) The unit operates for more than 30 seconds at an external static pressure that is 0.1 inches of water or more higher than the value measured during the prior steady-state test.
For the pull-thru approach, disable the indoor blower and use the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus to generate the specified flow nozzles static pressure difference or velocity pressure. If the exhaust fan cannot deliver the required pressure difference because of resistance created by the unpowered indoor blower, temporarily remove the indoor blower.
e. Conduct three complete compressor OFF/ON cycles with the test tolerances given in Table 10 satisfied. Calculate the degradation coefficient C
D
for each complete cycle. If all three C
D
values are within 0.02 of the average C
D
then stability has been achieved, use the highest C
D
value of these three. If
stability has not been achieved, conduct additional cycles, up to a maximum of eight cycles, until stability has been achieved between three consecutive cycles. Once stability has been achieved, use the highest C
D
value of the three consecutive cycles that establish stability. If stability has not been achieved after eight cycles, use the highest C
D
from cycle one through cycle eight, or the default C
D
, whichever is lower.
f. With regard to the Table 10 parameters, continuously record the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor and outdoor coils during periods when air flows through the respective coils. Sample the water vapor content of the indoor coil inlet air at least every 2 minutes during periods when air flows through the coil. Record external static pressure and the air volume rate indicator (either nozzle pressure difference or velocity pressure) at least every minute during the interval that air flows through the indoor coil. (These regular measurements of the airflow rate indicator are in addition to the required measurement at 15 seconds after flow initiation.) Sample the electrical voltage at least every 2 minutes beginning 30 seconds after compressor start-up. Continue until the compressor, the outdoor fan, and the indoor blower (if it is installed and operating) cycle off.
g. For ducted units, continuously record the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering (as noted above) and leaving the indoor coil. Or if using a thermopile, continuously record the difference between these two temperatures during the interval that air flows through the indoor coil. For non-ducted units, make the same dry-bulb temperature measurements beginning when the compressor cycles on and ending when indoor coil airflow ceases.
h. Integrate the electrical power over complete cycles of length Δτ
cyc,dry
. For ducted blower coil systems tested with the unit's indoor blower operating for the cycling test, integrate electrical power from indoor blower OFF to indoor blower OFF. For all other ducted units and for non-ducted units, integrate electrical power from compressor OFF to compressor OFF. (Some cyclic tests will use the same data collection intervals to determine the electrical energy and the total space cooling. For other units, terminate data collection used to determine the electrical energy before terminating data collection used to determine total space cooling.)

# 3.5.1 Procedures When Testing Ducted Systems
The automatic controls that are installed in the test unit must govern the OFF/ON cycling of the air moving equipment on the indoor side (
i.e.,
the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus and the indoor blower of the test unit). For ducted coil-only systems rated based on using a fan time-delay relay, control the indoor coil airflow according to the OFF delay listed by the manufacturer in the certification report. For ducted units having a variable-speed indoor blower that has been disabled (and possibly removed), start and stop the indoor airflow at the same instances as if the fan were enabled. For all other ducted coil-only systems, cycle the indoor coil airflow in unison with the cycling of the compressor. If air damper boxes are used, close them on the inlet and outlet side during the OFF period. Airflow through the indoor coil should stop within 3 seconds after the automatic controls of the test unit de-energize (or if the airflow system has been disabled (and possibly removed), within 3 seconds after the automatic controls of the test unit
would have
de-energized) the indoor blower.

And %FLAVR is the air volume rate used for the test, expressed as a percentage of the cooling full load air volume rate. For all tests specifying the full-load air volume rate (

and increase e

based on: The product of [τ

− τ

] and the indoor blower power (in W) measured during or following the dry coil steady-state test; or,
d. The following algorithm if the indoor blower ramps its speed when cycling.
(1) Measure the electrical power consumed by the variable-speed indoor blower at a minimum of three operating conditions: at the speed/air volume rate/external static pressure that was measured during the steady-state test, at operating conditions associated with the midpoint of the ramp-up interval, and at conditions associated with the midpoint of the ramp-down interval. For these measurements, the tolerances on the airflow volume or the external static pressure are
the same as required for the section 3.4 steady-state test.
(2) For each case, determine the fan power from measurements made over a minimum of 5 minutes.
(3) Approximate the electrical energy consumption of the indoor blower if it had operated during the cyclic test using all three power measurements. Assume a linear profile during the ramp intervals. The manufacturer must provide the durations of the ramp-up and ramp-down intervals. If the test setup instructions included with the unit by the manufacturer specifies a ramp interval that exceeds 45 seconds, use a 45-second ramp interval nonetheless when estimating the fan energy.

# 3.5.2 Procedures When Testing Non-Ducted Indoor Units
Do not use airflow prevention devices when conducting cyclic tests on non-ducted indoor units. Until the last OFF/ON compressor cycle, airflow through the indoor coil must cycle off and on in unison with the compressor. For the last OFF/ON compressor cycle—the one used to determine e
cyc,dry
and q
cyc,dry
—use the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus and the indoor blower of the test unit to have indoor airflow start 3 minutes prior to compressor cut-on and end three minutes after compressor cutoff. Subtract the electrical energy used by the indoor blower during the 3 minutes prior to compressor cut-on from the integrated electrical energy, e
cyc,dry.
Add the electrical energy used by the indoor blower during the 3 minutes after compressor cutoff to the integrated cooling capacity, q
cyc,dry.
For the case where the non-ducted indoor unit uses a variable-speed indoor blower which is disabled during the cyclic test, correct e
cyc,dry
and q
cyc,dry
using the same approach as prescribed in section 3.5.1 of this appendix for ducted units having a disabled variable-speed indoor blower.

# 3.5.3 Cooling-Mode Cyclic-Degradation Coefficient Calculation
Use the two dry-coil tests to determine the cooling-mode cyclic-degradation coefficient, C
D
c
. Append “(k=2)” to the coefficient if it corresponds to a two-capacity unit cycling at high capacity. If the two optional tests are conducted but yield a tested C

c
that exceeds the default C
D
c
or if the two optional tests are not conducted, assign C
D
c
the default value of 0.25 for variable-speed compressor systems and outdoor units with no match, and 0.20 for all other systems. The default value for two-capacity units cycling at high capacity, however, is the low-capacity coefficient,
i.e.,
C
D

(k=2) = C

. Evaluate C

using the above results and those from the section 3.4 dry-coil steady-state test.

For all Table 14A of this appendix tests specified for a minimum compressor speed, turn off at least one indoor unit. The manufacturer shall designate the particular indoor unit(s) to be turned off. The manufacturer must also specify the compressor speed used for the Table 14A H2
V
test, a heating mode intermediate compressor speed that falls within
1/4
and
3/4
of the difference between the full and minimum heating mode speeds. The manufacturer should prescribe an intermediate speed that is expected to yield the highest COP for the given H2
V
test conditions and bracketed compressor speed range. The manufacturer can designate that one or more specific indoor units are turned off for the H2

# 3.6.5 Additional Test for a Heat Pump Having a Heat Comfort Controller
Test any heat pump that has a heat comfort controller (see section 1.2 of this appendix, Definitions) according to section 3.6.1, 3.6.2, or 3.6.3, whichever applies, with the heat comfort controller disabled. Additionally, conduct the abbreviated test described in section 3.1.9 of this appendix with the heat comfort controller active to determine the system's maximum supply air temperature. (
Note:
heat pumps having a variable-speed compressor and a heat comfort controller are not covered in the test procedure at this time.)

# 3.6.6 Heating Mode Tests for Northern Heat Pumps with Triple-Capacity Compressors
Test triple-capacity, northern heat pumps for the heating mode as follows:
a. Conduct one maximum temperature test (H0
1
), two high temperature tests (H1
2
and H1
1
), one frost accumulation test (H2
2
), two low temperature tests (H3
2
, H3
3
), and one very low temperature test (H4
3
). Conduct an additional frost accumulation test (H2
1
) and low temperature test (H3
1
) if both of the following conditions exist: (1) Knowledge of the heat pump's capacity and electrical power at low compressor capacity for outdoor temperatures of 37 °F and less is needed to complete the section 4.2.6 seasonal performance calculations; and (2) the heat pump's controls allow low capacity operation at outdoor temperatures of 37 °F and less. If the above two conditions are met, an alternative to conducting the H2
1
frost accumulation test to determine
Q
h
k=1
(35) and E
h
k=1
(35) is to use the following equations to approximate this capacity and electrical power:
ER05JA17.178
In evaluating the above equations, determine the quantities Q
h
k=1
(47) from the H1
1
test and evaluate them according to section 3.7 of this appendix. Determine the quantities
Q
h
k=1
(17) and
E
h
k=1
(17) from the H3
1
test and evaluate them according to section 3.10 of this appendix. Use the paired values of
Q
h
k=1
(35) and
E
h
k=1
(35) derived from conducting the H2
1
frost accumulation test and evaluated as specified in section 3.9.1 of this appendix or use the paired values calculated using the above default equations, whichever contribute to a higher Region IV HSPF2 based on the DHRmin.
b. Conducting a frost accumulation test (H2
3
) with the heat pump operating at its booster capacity is optional. If this optional test is not conducted, determine Q
h
k=3
(35) and E
h
k=3
(35) using the following equations to approximate this capacity and electrical power:
ER05JA17.179
Where:
ER05JA17.180
Determine the quantities Q

(47) and E

(17) from the H3

test, determine the quantities Q
h
k=3
(17) and E
h

(17) from the H3
3
test, and determine the quantities Q
h
k=3
(5) and E
h
k=3
(5) from the H4

test. Evaluate all six quantities according to section 3.10 of this appendix. Use the paired values of Q
h
k=3
(35) and E
h
k=3
(35) derived from conducting the H2
3
frost accumulation test and calculated as specified in section 3.9.1 of this appendix or use the paired values calculated using the above default equations, whichever contribute to a higher Region IV HSPF2 based on the DHRmin.
c. Conduct the optional high temperature cyclic test (H1C
1
) to determine the heating mode cyclic-degradation coefficient, C
D
h
. A default value for C
D
h
of 0.25 may be used in lieu of conducting the cyclic. If a triple-capacity heat pump locks out low capacity operation at lower outdoor temperatures, conduct the high temperature cyclic test (H1C
2
) to determine the high capacity heating mode cyclic-degradation coefficient, C
D
h
(k=2). The default C
D
h
(k=2) is the same value as determined or assigned for the low-capacity cyclic-degradation coefficient, C
D
h
[or equivalently, C
D
h
(k=1)]. Finally, if a triple-capacity heat pump locks out both low and high capacity operation at the lowest outdoor temperatures, conduct the low temperature cyclic test (H3C
3
) to determine the booster-capacity heating mode cyclic-degradation coefficient, C
D
h
(k=3). The default C
D
h
(k=3) is the same value as determined or assigned for the high capacity cyclic-degradation coefficient, C
D
h
[or equivalently, C
D

(k=2)]. Table 15 specifies test conditions for all 13 tests.

a. For the pretest interval, operate the test room reconditioning apparatus and the heat pump until equilibrium conditions are maintained for at least 30 minutes at the specified section 3.6 test conditions. Use the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus and, if installed, the indoor blower of the heat pump to obtain and then maintain the indoor air volume rate and/or the external static pressure specified for the particular test. Continuously record the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor coil, and the dry-bulb temperature and water vapor content of the air entering the outdoor coil. Refer to section 3.11 of this appendix for additional requirements that depend on the selected secondary test method. After satisfying the pretest equilibrium requirements, make the measurements specified in Table 3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) for the indoor air enthalpy method and the user-selected secondary method. Make said Table 3 measurements at equal intervals that span 5 minutes or less. Continue data sampling until a 30-minute period (
e.g.,
seven consecutive 5-minute samples) is reached where the test tolerances specified in Table 16 are satisfied. For those continuously recorded parameters, use the entire data set for the 30-minute interval when evaluating Table 16 compliance. Determine the average electrical power consumption of the heat pump over the same 30-minute interval.

p,a
(expressed on dry air basis), specific volume of the air at the nozzles, v
n
′ (or v

), humidity ratio at the nozzles, W
n
, and either pressure difference or velocity pressure for the flow nozzles. If either or both of the below criteria apply, determine the average, steady-state, electrical power consumption of the indoor blower motor (E
fan,1
):
(1) The section 3.8 cyclic test will be conducted and the heat pump has a variable-speed indoor blower that is expected to be disabled during the cyclic test; or
(2) The heat pump has a (variable-speed) constant-air volume-rate indoor blower and during the steady-state test the average external static pressure (ΔP

) exceeds the applicable section 3.1.4.4 minimum (or targeted) external static pressure (ΔP
min
) by 0.03 inches of water or more.
Determine E
fan,1
by making measurements during the 30-minute data collection interval, or immediately following the test and prior to changing the test conditions. When the above “2” criteria applies, conduct the following four steps after determining E
fan,1
(which corresponds to ΔP

):
(i) While maintaining the same test conditions, adjust the exhaust fan of the airflow measuring apparatus until the external static pressure increases to approximately ΔP

+ (ΔP

).
(ii) After re-establishing steady readings for fan motor power and external static pressure, determine average values for the indoor blower power (E

(iii) Approximate the average power consumption of the indoor blower motor if the 30-minute test had been conducted at ΔP

f. If the temperature sensors used to provide the primary measurement of the indoor-side dry bulb temperature difference during the steady-state dry-coil test and the subsequent cyclic dry-coil test are different, include measurements of the latter sensors among the regularly sampled data. Beginning at the start of the 30-minute data collection period, measure and compute the indoor-side air dry-bulb temperature difference using both sets of instrumentation, ΔT (Set SS) and ΔT (Set CYC), for each equally spaced data sample. If using a consistent data sampling rate that is less than 1 minute, calculate and record minutely averages for the two temperature differences. If using a consistent sampling rate of one minute or more, calculate and record the two temperature differences from each data sample. After having recorded the seventh (i=7) set of temperature differences, calculate the following ratio using the first seven sets of values:
ER05JA17.184
Each time a subsequent set of temperature differences is recorded (if sampling more frequently than every 5 minutes), calculate F
CD
using the most recent seven sets of values. Continue these calculations until the 30-minute period is completed or until a value for F
CD
is calculated that falls outside the allowable range of 0.94-1.06. If the latter occurs, immediately suspend the test and identify the cause for the disparity in the two temperature difference measurements. Recalibration of one or both sets of instrumentation may be required. If all the values for F
CD
are within the allowable range, save the final value of the ratio from the 30-minute test as F
CD
*. If the temperature sensors used
to provide the primary measurement of the indoor-side dry bulb temperature difference during the steady-state dry-coil test and the subsequent cyclic dry-coil test are the same, set F

a. Except as noted below, conduct the cyclic heating mode test as specified in section 3.5 of this appendix. As adapted to the heating mode, replace section 3.5 references to “the steady-state dry coil test” with “the heating mode steady-state test conducted at the same test conditions as the cyclic heating mode test.” Use the test tolerances in Table 17 rather than Table 10. Record the outdoor coil entering wet-bulb temperature according to the requirements given in section 3.5 of this appendix for the outdoor coil entering dry-bulb temperature. Drop the subscript “dry” used in variables cited in section 3.5 of this appendix when referring to quantities from the cyclic heating mode test. If available, use electric resistance heaters (see section 2.1 of this appendix) to minimize the variation in the inlet air temperature. Determine the total space heating delivered during the cyclic heating test, q

, as specified in section 3.5 of this appendix except for making the following changes:
(1) When evaluating Equation 3.5-1, use the values of V

that were recorded during the section 3.7 steady-state test conducted at the same test conditions.
(2) Calculate

b. For ducted coil-only system heat pumps (excluding the special case where a variable-speed fan is temporarily removed),

(i) For two-stage or variable-speed systems, for all cyclic heating tests (
i.e.,

tests), increase q

by the amount calculated using Equation 3.5-2 to this appendix. Additionally, increase e

by the amount calculated using Equation 3.5-3 to this appendix.
(ii) For single-stage systems, for all cyclic heating tests (

by the amount calculated using Equation 3.5-4 to this appendix. Additionally, increase e

by the amount calculated using Equation 3.5-8 to this appendix. Additionally, increase e

by the amount calculated using Equation 3.5-9 to this appendix.
In making these calculations, use the average indoor air volume rate (
V
s
) determined from the section 3.7 of this appendix steady-state heating mode test conducted at the same test conditions.
c. For non-ducted heat pumps, subtract the electrical energy used by the indoor blower during the 3 minutes after compressor cutoff from the non-ducted heat pump's integrated heating capacity, q
cyc.
d. If a heat pump defrost cycle is manually or automatically initiated immediately prior to or during the OFF/ON cycling, operate the heat pump continuously until 10 minutes after defrost termination. After that, begin cycling the heat pump immediately or delay until the specified test conditions have been re-established. Pay attention to preventing defrosts after beginning the cycling process. For heat pumps that cycle off the indoor blower during a defrost cycle, make no effort here to restrict the air movement through the indoor coil while the fan is off. Resume the OFF/ON cycling while conducting a minimum of two complete compressor OFF/ON cycles before determining q
cyc
and e
cyc.

# 3.8.1 Heating Mode Cyclic-Degradation Coefficient Calculation
Use the results from the required cyclic test and the required steady-state test that were conducted at the same test conditions to determine the heating mode cyclic-degradation coefficient C
D
h
. Add “(k=2)” to the coefficient if it corresponds to a two-capacity unit cycling at high capacity. For the below calculation of the heating mode cyclic degradation coefficient, do not include the duct loss correction from section 7.3.3.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) in determining Q

# 3.9 Test Procedures for Frost Accumulation Heating Mode Tests (the H2, H2
2

# , H2
V

# , and H2
1

# Tests).
a. Confirm that the defrost controls of the heat pump are set as specified in section 2.2.1 of this appendix. Operate the test room reconditioning apparatus and the heat pump for at least 30 minutes at the specified section 3.6 test conditions before starting the “preliminary” test period. The preliminary test period must immediately precede the “official” test period, which is the heating and defrost interval over which data are collected for evaluating average space heating capacity and average electrical power consumption.
b. For heat pumps containing defrost controls which are likely to cause defrosts at intervals less than one hour, the preliminary test period starts at the termination of an automatic defrost cycle and ends at the termination of the next occurring automatic defrost cycle. For heat pumps containing defrost controls which are likely to cause defrosts at intervals exceeding one hour, the preliminary test period must consist of a heating interval lasting at least one hour followed by a defrost cycle that is either manually or automatically initiated. In all cases, the heat pump's own controls must govern when a defrost cycle terminates.
c. The official test period begins when the preliminary test period ends, at defrost termination. The official test period ends at the termination of the next occurring automatic defrost cycle. When testing a heat pump that uses a time-adaptive defrost control system (see section 1.2 of this appendix, Definitions), however, manually initiate the defrost cycle that ends the official test period at the instant indicated by instructions provided by the manufacturer. If the heat pump has not undergone a defrost after 6 hours, immediately conclude the test and use the results from the full 6-hour period to calculate the average space heating capacity and average electrical power consumption.
For heat pumps that turn the indoor blower off during the defrost cycle, take steps to cease forced airflow through the indoor coil and block the outlet duct whenever the heat pump's controls cycle off the indoor blower. If it is installed, use the outlet damper box described in section 2.5.4.1 of this appendix to affect the blocked outlet duct.
d. Defrost termination occurs when the controls of the heat pump actuate the first change in converting from defrost operation to normal heating operation. Defrost initiation occurs when the controls of the heat pump first alter its normal heating operation in order to eliminate possible accumulations of frost on the outdoor coil.
e. To constitute a valid frost accumulation test, satisfy the test tolerances specified in Table 18 during both the preliminary and official test periods. As noted in Table 18, test operating tolerances are specified for two sub-intervals:
(1) When heating, except for the first 10 minutes after the termination of a defrost cycle (sub-interval H, as described in Table 18) and
(2) When defrosting, plus these same first 10 minutes after defrost termination (sub-interval D, as described in Table 18). Evaluate compliance with Table 18 test condition tolerances and the majority of the test operating tolerances using the averages from measurements recorded only during sub-interval H. Continuously record the dry bulb temperature of the air entering the indoor coil, and the dry bulb temperature and water vapor content of the air entering the outdoor coil. Sample the remaining parameters listed in Table 18 at equal intervals that span 5 minutes or less.
f. For the official test period, collect and use the following data to calculate average space heating capacity and electrical power. During heating and defrosting intervals when the controls of the heat pump have the indoor blower on, continuously record the dry-bulb temperature of the air entering (as noted above) and leaving the indoor coil. If using a thermopile, continuously record the difference between the leaving and entering dry-bulb temperatures during the interval(s) that air flows through the indoor coil. For coil-only system heat pumps, determine the corresponding cumulative time (in hours) of
indoor coil airflow, Δτ
a.
Sample measurements used in calculating the air volume rate (refer to sections 7.7.2.1 and 7.7.2.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009) at equal intervals that span 10 minutes or less. (

This defrost cycle may be manually or automatically initiated. Terminate the defrost sequence using the heat pump's defrost controls. Begin the 30-minute data collection interval described in section 3.7 of this appendix, from which the capacity and power input are determined, no sooner than 10 minutes after defrost termination. Defrosts should be prevented over the 30-minute data collection interval.

# 3.11 Additional Requirements for the Secondary Test Methods

# 3.11.1 If Using the Outdoor Air Enthalpy Method as the Secondary Test Method.
a. For all cooling mode and heating mode tests, first conduct a test without the outdoor air-side test apparatus described in section 2.10.1 of this appendix connected to the outdoor unit (“free outdoor air” test).
b. For the first section 3.2 steady-state cooling mode test and the first section 3.6 steady-state heating mode test, conduct a
second test in which the outdoor-side apparatus is connected (“ducted outdoor air” test). No other cooling mode or heating mode tests require the ducted outdoor air test so long as the unit operates the outdoor fan during all cooling mode steady-state tests at the same speed and all heating mode steady-state tests at the same speed. If using more than one outdoor fan speed for the cooling mode steady-state tests, however, conduct the ducted outdoor air test for each cooling mode test where a different fan speed is first used. This same requirement applies for the heating mode tests.

# 3.11.1.1 Free Outdoor Air Test
a. For the free outdoor air test, connect the indoor air-side test apparatus to the indoor coil; do not connect the outdoor air-side test apparatus. Allow the test room reconditioning apparatus and the unit being tested to operate for at least one hour. After attaining equilibrium conditions, measure the following quantities at equal intervals that span 5 minutes or less:
(1) The section 2.10.1 evaporator and condenser temperatures or pressures;
(2) Parameters required according to the Indoor Air Enthalpy Method.
Continue these measurements until a 30-minute period (
e.g.,
seven consecutive 5-minute samples) is obtained where the Table 9 or Table 16, whichever applies, test tolerances are satisfied.
b. For cases where a ducted outdoor air test is not required per section 3.11.1.b of this appendix, the free outdoor air test constitutes the “official” test for which validity is not based on comparison with a secondary test.
c. For cases where a ducted outdoor air test is required per section 3.11.1.b of this appendix, the following conditions must be met for the free outdoor air test to constitute a valid “official” test:
(1) The energy balance specified in section 3.1.1 of this appendix is achieved for the ducted outdoor air test (
i.e.,
compare the capacities determined using the indoor air enthalpy method and the outdoor air enthalpy method).
(2) The capacities determined using the indoor air enthalpy method from the ducted outdoor air and free outdoor air tests must agree within 2 percent.

# 3.11.1.2 Ducted Outdoor Air Test
a. The test conditions and tolerances for the ducted outdoor air test are the same as specified for the official test, where the official test is the free outdoor air test described in section 3.11.1.1 of this appendix.
b. After collecting 30 minutes of steady-state data during the free outdoor air test, connect the outdoor air-side test apparatus to the unit for the ducted outdoor air test. Adjust the exhaust fan of the outdoor airflow measuring apparatus until averages for the evaporator and condenser temperatures, or the saturated temperatures corresponding to the measured pressures, agree within ±0.5 °F of the averages achieved during the free outdoor air test. Collect 30 minutes of steady-state data after re-establishing equilibrium conditions.
c. During the ducted outdoor air test, at intervals of 5 minutes or less, measure the parameters required according to the indoor air enthalpy method and the outdoor air enthalpy method for the prescribed 30 minutes.
d. For cooling mode ducted outdoor air tests, calculate capacity based on outdoor air-enthalpy measurements as specified in sections 7.3.3.2 and 7.3.3.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3). For heating mode ducted tests, calculate heating capacity based on outdoor air-enthalpy measurements as specified in sections 7.3.4.2 and 7.3.3.4.3 of the same ANSI/ASHRAE Standard. Adjust the outdoor-side capacity according to section 7.3.3.4 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 to account for line losses when testing split systems. As described in section 8.6.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009, use the outdoor air volume rate as measured during the ducted outdoor air tests to calculate capacity for checking the agreement with the capacity calculated using the indoor air enthalpy method.

# 3.11.2 If Using the Compressor Calibration Method as the Secondary Test Method
a. Conduct separate calibration tests using a calorimeter to determine the refrigerant flow rate. Or for cases where the superheat of the refrigerant leaving the evaporator is less than 5 °F, use the calorimeter to measure total capacity rather than refrigerant flow rate. Conduct these calibration tests at the same test conditions as specified for the tests in this appendix. Operate the unit for at least one hour or until obtaining equilibrium conditions before collecting data that will be used in determining the average refrigerant flow rate or total capacity. Sample the data at equal intervals that span 5 minutes or less. Determine average flow rate or average capacity from data sampled over a 30-minute period where the Table 9 (cooling) or the Table 16 (heating) tolerances are satisfied. Otherwise, conduct the calibration tests according to sections 5, 6, 7, and 8 of ASHRAE 23.1-2010 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3); sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 of ASHRAE 41.9-2011 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3); and section 7.4 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3).
b. Calculate space cooling and space heating capacities using the compressor calibration method measurements as specified in section 7.4.5 and 7.4.6 respectively, of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009.

# 3.11.3 If Using the Refrigerant-Enthalpy Method as the Secondary Test Method
Conduct this secondary method according to section 7.5 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37-2009. Calculate space cooling and heating capacities using the refrigerant-enthalpy method measurements as specified in sections 7.5.4 and 7.5.5, respectively, of the same ANSI/ASHRAE Standard.

# 3.12 Rounding of Space Conditioning Capacities for Reporting Purposes
a. When reporting rated capacities, round them off as specified in § 430.23 (for a single unit) and in 10 CFR 429.16 (for a sample).
b. For the capacities used to perform the calculations in section 4 of this appendix, however, round only to the nearest integer.

# 3.13 Laboratory Testing To Determine Off Mode Average Power Ratings
Voltage tolerances: As a percentage of reading, test operating tolerance must be 2.0 percent and test condition tolerance must be 1.5 percent (see section 1.2 of this appendix for definitions of these tolerances).
Conduct one of the following tests: If the central air conditioner or heat pump lacks a compressor crankcase heater, perform the test in section 3.13.1 of this appendix; if the central air conditioner or heat pump has a compressor crankcase heater that lacks controls and is not self-regulating, perform the test in section 3.13.1 of this appendix; if the central air conditioner or heat pump has a crankcase heater with a fixed power input controlled with a thermostat that measures ambient temperature and whose sensing element temperature is not affected by the heater, perform the test in section 3.13.1 of this appendix; if the central air conditioner or heat pump has a compressor crankcase heater equipped with self-regulating control or with controls for which the sensing element temperature is affected by the heater, perform the test in section 3.13.2 of this appendix.

# 3.13.1 This Test Determines the Off Mode Average Power Rating for Central Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps That Lack a Compressor Crankcase Heater, or Have a Compressor Crankcase Heating System That Can Be Tested Without Control of Ambient Temperature During the Test. This Test Has No Ambient Condition Requirements
a. Test Sample Set-up and Power Measurement: For coil-only systems, provide a furnace or modular blower that is compatible with the system to serve as an interface with the thermostat (if used for the test) and to provide low-voltage control circuit power. Make all control circuit connections between the furnace (or modular blower) and the outdoor unit as specified by the manufacturer's installation instructions. Measure power supplied to both the furnace (or modular blower) and power supplied to the outdoor unit. Alternatively, provide a compatible transformer to supply low-voltage control circuit power, as described in section 2.2.d of this appendix. Measure transformer power, either supplied to the primary winding or supplied by the secondary winding of the transformer, and power supplied to the outdoor unit. For blower coil and single-package systems, make all control circuit connections between components as specified by the manufacturer's installation instructions, and provide power and measure power supplied to all system components.
b. Configure Controls: Configure the controls of the central air conditioner or heat pump so that it operates as if connected to a building thermostat that is set to the OFF position. Use a compatible building thermostat if necessary to achieve this configuration. For a thermostat-controlled crankcase heater with a fixed power input, bypass the crankcase heater thermostat if necessary to energize the heater.
c. Measure

Otherwise, de-energize the crankcase heater (by removing the thermostat bypass or otherwise disconnecting only the power supply to the crankcase heater) and repeat the measurement as described in section 3.13.1.c of this appendix. Designate the measured average power as

a. Test Sample Set-up and Power Measurement: set up the test and measurement as described in section 3.13.1.a of this appendix.
b. Configure Controls: Position a temperature sensor to measure the outdoor dry-bulb temperature in the air between 2 and 6 inches from the crankcase heater control temperature sensor or, if no such temperature sensor exists, position it in the air between 2 and 6 inches from the crankcase heater. Utilize the temperature measurements from this sensor for this portion of the test procedure. Configure the controls of the central air conditioner or heat pump so that it operates as if connected to a building thermostat that is set to the OFF position.
Use a compatible building thermostat if necessary to achieve this configuration.
Conduct the test after completion of the B, B

test. Alternatively, start the test when the outdoor dry-bulb temperature is at 82 °F and the temperature of the compressor shell (or temperature of each compressor's shell if there is more than one compressor) is at least 81 °F. Then adjust the outdoor temperature and achieve an outdoor dry-bulb temperature of 72 °F. If the unit's compressor has no sound blanket, wait at least 4 hours after the outdoor temperature reaches 72 °F. Otherwise, wait at least 8 hours after the outdoor temperature reaches 72 °F. Maintain this temperature within ±2 °F while the compressor temperature equilibrates and while making the power measurement, as described in section 3.13.2.c of this appendix.

d. Reduce outdoor temperature: Approach the target outdoor dry-bulb temperature by adjusting the outdoor temperature. This target temperature is five degrees Fahrenheit less than the temperature certified by the manufacturer as the temperature at which the crankcase heater turns on. If the unit's compressor has no sound blanket, wait at least 4 hours after the outdoor temperature reaches the target temperature. Otherwise, wait at least 8 hours after the outdoor temperature reaches the target temperature. Maintain the target temperature within ±2 °F while the compressor temperature equilibrates and while making the power measurement, as described in section 3.13.2.e of this appendix.
e. Measure

For each of these regions and for each applicable standardized design heating requirement, evaluate the heating seasonal performance factor using,
ER05JA17.238
Where:
e
h
(T
j
)/N = The ratio of the electrical energy consumed by the heat pump during periods of the heating season when the outdoor temperature fell within the range represented by bin temperature T
j
to the total number of hours in the heating season (N), W. For heat pumps having a heat comfort controller, this ratio may also
include electrical energy used by resistive elements to maintain a minimum air delivery temperature (see 4.2.5).
RH(T
j
)/N = The ratio of the electrical energy used for resistive space heating during periods when the outdoor temperature fell within the range represented by bin temperature T
j
to the total number of hours in the heating season (N), W. Except as noted in section 4.2.5 of this appendix, resistive space heating is modeled as being used to meet that portion of the building load that the heat pump does not meet because of insufficient capacity or because the heat pump automatically turns off at the lowest outdoor temperatures. For heat pumps having a heat comfort controller, all or part of the electrical energy used by resistive heaters at a particular bin temperature may be reflected in e
h
(T
j
)/N (see section 4.2.5 of this appendix).
T
j
= the outdoor bin temperature, °F. Outdoor temperatures are “binned” such that calculations are only performed based one temperature within the bin. Bins of 5 °F are used.
n

/N = Fractional bin hours for the heating season; the ratio of the number of hours during the heating season when the outdoor temperature fell within the range represented by bin temperature T
j
to the total number of hours in the heating season, dimensionless. Obtain n
j
/N values from Table 20.
j = the bin number, dimensionless.
J = for each generalized climatic region, the total number of temperature bins, dimensionless. Referring to Table 20, J is the highest bin number (j) having a nonzero entry for the fractional bin hours for the generalized climatic region of interest.
F
def
= the demand defrost credit described in section 3.9.2 of this appendix, dimensionless.
BL(T

= the zero-load temperature, °F, which varies by climate region according to Table 20 to this appendix;

a. For all heat pumps, HSPF2 accounts for the heating delivered and the energy consumed by auxiliary resistive elements when operating below the balance point. This condition occurs when the building load exceeds the space heating capacity of the heat pump condenser. For HSPF2 calculations for all heat pumps, see either section 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, or 4.2.4 of this appendix, whichever applies.
b. For heat pumps with heat comfort controllers (see section 1.2 of this appendix, Definitions), HSPF2 also accounts for resistive heating contributed when operating above the heat-pump-plus-comfort-controller balance point as a result of maintaining a minimum supply temperature. For heat pumps having a heat comfort controller, see section 4.2.5 of this appendix for the additional steps required for calculating the HSPF2.

load. For heat pumps that lock out low capacity operation at low outdoor temperatures, the outdoor temperature at which the unit locks out must be that specified by the manufacturer in the certification report so that the appropriate equations can be selected.

# 4.2.5 Heat Pumps Having a Heat Comfort Controller
Heat pumps having heat comfort controllers, when set to maintain a typical minimum air delivery temperature, will cause the heat pump condenser to operate less because of a greater contribution from the resistive elements. With a conventional heat pump, resistive heating is only initiated if the heat pump condenser cannot meet the building load (
i.e.,
is delayed until a second stage call from the indoor thermostat). With a heat comfort controller, resistive heating can occur even though the heat pump condenser has adequate capacity to meet the building load (
i.e.,
both on during a first stage call from the indoor thermostat). As a result, the outdoor temperature where the heat pump compressor no longer cycles (
i.e.,
starts to run continuously), will be lower than if the heat pump did not have the heat comfort controller.

However, do not apply the insulation for the jacket loss test (if conducted) described in section 8.6 of ASHRAE 103-1993 or the steady-state test described in section 9.1 of ASHRAE 103-1993.
(c) For power-vented units, insulate the shroud surrounding the blower impeller with insulation having an R-value of not less than 7 and an outer layer of aluminum foil before the cool-down and heat-up tests described in sections 9.5 and 9.6, respectively, of ASHRAE 103-1993. However, do not apply the insulation for the jacket loss test (if conducted) described in section 8.6 of ASHRAE 103-1993 or the steady-state test described in section 9.1 of ASHRAE 103-1993. Do not insulate the blower motor or block the airflow openings that facilitate the cooling of the combustion blower motor or bearings.
6.3
Downflow furnaces.
Install an internal section of vent pipe the same size as the flue collar for connecting the flue collar to the top of the unit, if not supplied by the manufacturer. However, do not insulate the internal vent pipe during the jacket loss test (if conducted) described in section 8.6 of ASHRAE 103-1993 or the steady-state test described in section 9.1 of ASHRAE 103-1993. Do not insulate the internal vent pipe before the cool-down and heat-up tests described in sections 9.5 and 9.6, respectively, of ASHRAE 103-1993. If the vent pipe is surrounded by a metal jacket, do not insulate the metal jacket. Install a 5-ft test stack of the same cross-sectional area or perimeter as the vent pipe above the top of the furnace. Tape or seal around the junction connecting the vent pipe and the 5-ft test stack. Insulate the 5-ft test stack with insulation having an R-value not less than 7 and an outer layer of aluminum foil. (
See
Figure 3-E of ASHRAE 103-1993.)
6.4

(a) For units with an integral draft diverter, cover the 5-ft stack with insulation having an R-value of not less than 7 and an outer layer of aluminum foil.
(b) For units with draft hoods, insulate the flue pipe between the outlet of the furnace and the draft hood with insulation having an R-value of not less than 7 and an outer layer of aluminum foil.
(c) For units with integral draft diverters that are mounted in an exposed position (not inside the overall unit cabinet), cover the diverter boxes (excluding any openings through which draft relief air flows) before the beginning of any test (including jacket loss test) with insulation having an R-value of not less than 7 and an outer layer of aluminum foil.
(d) For units equipped with integral draft diverters that are enclosed within the overall unit cabinet, insulate the draft diverter box with insulation as described in section 6.4.c before the cool-down and heat-up tests described in sections 9.5 and 9.6, respectively, of ASHRAE 103-1993. However, do not apply the insulation for the jacket loss test (if conducted) described in section 8.6 of ASHRAE 103-1993 or the steady-state test described in section 9.1 of ASHRAE 103-1993.
6.5
Condensate collection.
Attach condensate drain lines to the unit as specified in the I
O manual. Maintain a continuous downward slope of drain lines from the unit. Additional precautions (such as eliminating any line configuration or position that would otherwise restrict or block the flow of condensate or checking to ensure a proper connection with condensate drain spout that allows for unobstructed flow) must be taken to facilitate uninterrupted flow of condensate during the test. Collection containers must be glass or polished stainless steel to facilitate removal of interior deposits. The collection container must have a vent opening to the atmosphere.
7.
Testing conditions.
The testing conditions must be as specified in section 8 of ASHRAE 103-1993 (except for the excluded sub-sections as enumerated at § 430.3(g)(15)); and as specified in sections 7.1 to 7.9 of this appendix, respectively.
7.1
Fuel supply, gas.
In conducting the tests specified herein, gases with characteristics as shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-1993 shall be used. Maintain the gas supply, ahead of all controls for a furnace, at a test pressure between the normal and increased values shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-1993. Maintain the regulator outlet pressure at a level approximating that recommended in the I
O manual, as defined in section 2.6 of this appendix, or, in the absence of such recommendation, to the nominal regulator settings used when the product is shipped by the manufacturer. Use a gas having a specific gravity as shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-1993 and with a higher heating value within ±5% of the higher heating value shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-1993. Determine the actual higher heating value in Btu per standard cubic foot for the gas to be used in the test within an error no greater than 1%.
7.2
Gas burner.
Adjust the burners of gas-fired furnaces to their maximum Btu input ratings at the normal test pressure specified by section 7.1 of this appendix. Correct the burner input rate to reflect gas characteristics at a temperature of 60 °F and atmospheric pressure of 30 in of Hg and adjust down to within ±2 percent of the hourly Btu nameplate input rating specified by the manufacturer as measured during the steady-state performance test in section 8 of this appendix. Set the primary air shutters in accordance with the I
O manual to give a good flame at this condition. If, however, the setting results in the deposit of carbon on the burners during any test specified herein, the tester shall adjust the shutters and burners until no more carbon is deposited and shall perform the tests again with the new settings (
see
Figure 9 of ASHRAE 103-1993). After the steady-state performance test has been started, do not make additional adjustments to the burners during the required series of performance tests specified in section 9 of ASHRAE 103-1993. If a vent-limiting means is provided on a gas pressure regulator, keep it in place during all tests.
7.3
Modulating gas burner adjustment at reduced input rate.
For gas-fired furnaces equipped with modulating-type controls, adjust the controls to operate the unit at the nameplate minimum input rate. If the modulating control is of a non-automatic type, adjust the control to the setting recommended in the I
O manual. In the absence of such recommendation, the midpoint setting of the non-automatic control shall be used as the setting for determining the reduced fuel input rate. Start the furnace by turning the safety control valve to the “ON” position.
7.4
Oil burner.
Adjust the burners of oil-fired furnaces to give a CO
2
reading specified in the I
O manual and an hourly Btu input during the steady-state performance test described in section 8 of this appendix. Ensure the hourly BTU input is within ±2% of the normal hourly Btu input rating as specified in the I
O manual. Smoke in the flue may not exceed a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state performance test as measured by the procedure in ASTM D2156R13). Maintain the average draft over the fire and in the flue during the steady-state performance test at the value specified in the I
O manual. Do not allow draft fluctuations exceeding 0.005 in. water. Do not make additional adjustments to the burner during the required series of performance tests. The instruments and measuring apparatus for this test are described in section 6 of this appendix and shown in Figure 8 of ASHRAE 103-1993.
7.5
Temperature Rise Targets.
Adjust air throughputs to achieve a temperature rise that is the higher of a and b, below, unless c applies. A tolerance of ±2 °F is permitted.
(a) 15 °F less than the nameplate maximum temperature rise or
(b) 15 °F higher than the minimum temperature rise specified in the I
O manual.
(c) A furnace with a non-adjustable air temperature rise range and an automatically controlled airflow that does not permit a temperature rise range of 30 °F or more must be tested at the midpoint of the rise range.
7.6
Temperature Rise Adjustments.
Establish the temperature rise specified in section 7.5 of this appendix by adjusting the circulating airflow. This adjustment must be accomplished by symmetrically restricting the outlet air duct and varying blower speed selection to obtain the desired temperature rise and minimum external static pressure, as specified in Table 4 of ASHRAE 103-1993. If the required temperature rise cannot be obtained at the minimum specified external static pressure by adjusting blower speed selection and duct outlet restriction, then the following applies.
(a) If the resultant temperature rise is less than the required temperature rise, vary the blower speed by gradually adjusting the blower voltage so as to maintain the minimum external static pressure listed in Table 4 of ASHRAE 103-1993. The airflow restrictions shall then remain unchanged. If static pressure must be varied to prevent unstable blower operation, then increase the static pressure until blower operation is stabilized, except that the static pressure must not exceed the maximum external static pressure as specified by the manufacturer in the I
O manual.
(b) If the resultant temperature rise is greater than the required temperature rise, then the unit can be tested at a higher temperature rise value, but one not greater than nameplate maximum temperature rise. In order not to exceed the maximum temperature rise, the speed of a direct-driven blower may be increased by increasing the circulating air blower motor voltage.
7.7
Measurement of jacket surface temperature.
Divide the jacket of the furnace into 6-inch squares when practical, and otherwise into 36-square-inch regions comprising 4-inch by 9-inch or 3-inch by 12-inch sections, and determine the surface temperature at the center of each square or section with a surface thermocouple. Record the surface temperature of the 36-square-inch areas in groups where the temperature differential of the 36-square-inch areas is less than 10 °F for temperature up to 100 °F above room temperature, and less than 20 °F for temperatures more than 100 °F above room temperature. For forced-air central furnaces, the circulating air blower compartment is considered as part of the duct system, and no surface temperature measurement of the blower compartment needs to be recorded for the purpose of this test. For downflow furnaces, measure all cabinet surface temperatures of the heat exchanger and combustion section, including the bottom around the outlet duct and the burner door, using the 36-square-inch thermocouple grid. The cabinet surface temperatures around the blower section do not need to be measured (
See
Figure 3-E of ASHRAE 103-1993).
7.8
Installation of vent system.
Keep the vent or air intake system supplied by the manufacturer in place during all tests. Test units intended for installation with a variety of vent pipe lengths with the minimum vent length as specified in the I
O manual, or a 5-ft. flue pipe if there are no recommendations in the I
O manual. Do not connect a furnace employing a direct vent system to a chimney or induced-draft source. Vent combustion products solely by using the venting incorporated in the furnace and the vent or air intake system supplied by the manufacturer. For units that are not designed to significantly preheat the incoming air, see section 7.4 of this appendix and Figure 4a or 4b of ASHRAE 103-1993. For units that do significantly preheat the incoming air, see Figure 4c or 4d of ASHRAE 103-1993.
7.9
Additional optional method of testing for determining D
P
and D
F
for furnaces.
On units whose design is such that there is no measurable airflow through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger when the burner(s) is (are) off as determined by the optional test procedure in section 7.9.1 of this appendix, D
F
and D
P
may be set equal to 0.05.
7.9.1
Optional test method for indicating the absence of flow through the heat exchanger.
Manufacturers may use the following test protocol to determine whether air flows through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger when the burner(s) is (are) off. The minimum default draft factor may be used only for units determined pursuant to this protocol to have no airflow through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger.
7.9.1.1
Test apparatus.
Use a smoke stick that produces smoke that is easily visible and has a density less than or approximately equal to air. Use a smoke stick that produces smoke that is non-toxic to the test personnel and produces gas that is unreactive with the environment in the test chamber.
7.9.1.2
Test conditions.
Minimize all air currents and drafts in the test chamber, including turning off ventilation if the test chamber is mechanically ventilated. Wait at least two minutes following the termination of the furnace on-cycle before beginning the optional test method for indicating the absence of flow through the heat exchanger.
7.9.1.3
Location of the test apparatus.
After all air currents and drafts in the test chamber have been eliminated or minimized, position the smoke stick based on the following equipment configuration:
(a) For horizontal combustion air intakes, approximately 4 inches from the vertical plane at the termination of the intake vent and 4 inches below the bottom edge of the combustion air intake; or
(b) for vertical combustion air intakes, approximately 4 inches horizontal from vent perimeter at the termination of the intake vent and 4 inches down (parallel to the vertical axis of the vent).
7.9.1.4
Duration of test.
Establish the presence of smoke from the smoke stick and then monitor the direction of the smoke flow for no less than 30 seconds.
7.9.1.5
Test results.
During visual assessment, determine whether there is any draw of smoke into the combustion air intake vent.
(a) If absolutely no smoke is drawn into the combustion air intake, the furnace meets the requirements to allow use of the minimum default draft factor pursuant to section 7.9 of this appendix.
(b) If there is any smoke drawn into the intake, proceed with the methods of testing as prescribed in section 8.8 of ASHRAE 103-1993.
8.
Test procedure.
Conduct testing and measurements as specified in section 9 of ASHRAE 103-1993 (except for the excluded sub-sections as enumerated at § 430.3(g)(15)); and as specified in sections 8.1 through 8.10 of this appendix. Section 8.4 of this appendix may be used in lieu of section 9.2 of ASHRAE 103-1993.
8.1
Fuel input.
For gas units, measure and record the steady-state gas input rate in Btu/hr, including pilot gas, corrected to standard conditions of 60 °F and 30 in. Hg. Use measured values of gas temperature and pressure at the meter and barometric pressure to correct the metered gas flow rate to the above standard conditions. For oil units, measure and record the steady-state fuel input rate.
8.2
Electrical input.
During the steady-state test, perform a single measurement of all of the electrical power involved in burner operation (PE), including energizing the ignition system, controls, gas valve or oil control valve, and draft inducer, if applicable.
During the steady-state test, perform a single measurement of the electrical power to the circulating air blower (BE).
8.3
Input to interrupted ignition device.
For burners equipped with an interrupted ignition device, record the nameplate electric power used by the ignition device, PE
IG
, or record that PE
IG
= 0.4 kW if no nameplate power input is provided. Record the nameplate ignition device on-time interval, t
IG
, or, if the nameplate does not provide the ignition device on-time interval, measure the on-time interval with a stopwatch at the beginning of the test, starting when the burner is turned on. Set t
IG
= 0 and PE
IG
= 0 if the device on-time interval is less than or equal to 5 seconds after the burner is on.
8.4
Optional test procedures for condensing furnaces, measurement of condensate during the establishment of steady-state conditions.
For units with step-modulating or two-stage controls, conduct the test at both the maximum and reduced inputs. In lieu of collecting the condensate immediately after the steady state conditions have been reached as required by section 9.2 of ASHRAE 103-1993, condensate may be collected during the establishment of steady state conditions as defined by section 9.1.2.1 of ASHRAE 103-1993. Perform condensate collection for at least 30 minutes. Measure condensate mass immediately at the end of the collection period to prevent evaporation loss from the sample. Record fuel input for the 30-minute condensate collection test period. Observe and record fuel higher heating value (HHV), temperature, and pressures necessary for determining fuel energy input (Qc,ss). Measure the fuel quantity and HHV with errors no greater than 1%. The humidity for the room air shall at no time exceed 80%. Determine the mass of condensate for the establishment of steady state conditions (Mc,ss) in pounds by subtracting the tare container weight from the total container and condensate weight measured at the end of the 30-minute condensate collection test period.
8.5
Cool-down test for gas- and oil-fueled gravity and forced-air central furnaces without stack dampers.
Turn off the main burner after completing steady-state testing, and measure the flue gas temperature by means of the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ASHRAE 103-1993 at 1.5 minutes (T
F,OFF
(t
3
)) and 9 minutes (T
F,OFF
(t
4
)) after shutting off the burner. When taking these temperature readings, the integral draft diverter must remain blocked and insulated, and the stack restriction must remain in place. On atmospheric systems with an integral draft diverter or draft hood and equipped with either an electromechanical inlet damper or an electromechanical flue damper that closes within 10 seconds after the burner shuts off to restrict the flow through the heat exchanger in the off-cycle, bypass or adjust the control for the electromechanical damper so that the damper remains open during the cool-down test.
For furnaces that employ post-purge, measure the length of the post-purge period with a stopwatch. Record the time from burner “OFF” to combustion blower “OFF” (electrically de-energized) as t
P
. If the measured t
P
is less than or equal to 30 seconds, set t
P
at 0 and conduct the cool-down test as if there is no post-purge. If t
P
is prescribed by the I
O manual or measured to be greater than 180 seconds, stop the combustion blower at 180 seconds and use that value for t
P
. Measure the flue gas temperature by means of the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ASHRAE 103-1993 at the end of the post-purge period, t
P
(T
F,OFF
(t
P
)), and at the time (1.5 + t
P
) minutes (T
F,OFF
(t
3
)) and (9.0 + t
P
) minutes (T
F,OFF
(t
4
)) after the main burner shuts off.
8.6
Cool-down test for gas- and oil-fueled gravity and forced-air central furnaces without stack dampers and with adjustable fan control.
For a furnace with adjustable fan control, measure the time delay between burner shutdown and blower shutdown, t
+
. This time delay, t
+
, will be 3.0 minutes for non-condensing furnaces or 1.5 minutes for condensing furnaces or until the supply air temperature drops to a value of 40 °F above the inlet air temperature, whichever results in the longest fan on-time. For a furnace without adjustable fan control or with the type of adjustable fan control whose range of adjustment does not allow for the time delay, t
+
, specified above, bypass the fan control and manually control the fan to allow for the appropriate delay time as specified in section 9.5.1.2 of ASHRAE 103-1993. For a furnace that employs a single motor to drive both the power burner and the indoor air circulating blower, the power burner and indoor air circulating blower must be stopped at the same time.
8.7 [Reserved]
8.8
Calculation options.
The rate of the flue gas mass flow through the furnace and the factors D
P
, D
F
, and D
S
are calculated by the equations in sections 11.6.1, 11.6.2, 11.6.3, 11.6.4, 11.7.1, and 11.7.2 of ASHRAE 103-1993. On units whose design is such that there is no measurable airflow through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger when the burner(s) is (are) off (as determined by the optional test procedure in section 7.9 of this appendix), D
F
and D
P
may be set equal to 0.05.
8.9
Optional test procedures for condensing furnaces that have no off-period flue losses.
For units that have applied the test method in section 7.9 of this appendix to determine that no measurable airflow exists through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger during the burner off-period and having post-purge periods of less than 5 seconds, the cool-down and heat-up tests specified in sections 9.5 and 9.6 of ASHRAE 103-1993 may be omitted. In lieu of conducting the cool-down and
heat-up tests, the tester may use the losses determined during the steady-state test described in section 9.1 of ASHRAE 103-1993 when calculating heating seasonal efficiency, Effy
HS
.

10.1
Annual fuel utilization efficiency.
The annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE) is as defined in sections 11.2.12 (non-condensing systems), 11.3.12 (condensing systems), 11.4.12 (non-condensing modulating systems) and 11.5.12 (condensing modulating systems) of ASHRAE 103-1993, except for the definition for the term Effy

O manual. Use propane having a specific gravity between 1.522 and 1.574 and a higher heating value within ±5 percent of 2,500 Btu per standard cubic foot. Determine the actual higher heating value in Btu per standard cubic foot for the propane to be used in the test. If the burner cannot be adjusted to obtain a heat input rate of within ±2 percent of the hourly Btu rating specified by the manufacturer on the nameplate of the unit or in the I
O manual, as required by section 2.4.1 of this appendix, maintain the gas supply to the unit under test at an inlet test pressure immediately ahead of all controls at any value within the range specified on the nameplate of the unit or in the I
O manual that results in a heat input rate of within ±2 percent of the hourly Btu rating specified by the manufacturer on the nameplate of the unit or in the I
O manual.
2.3.3 Other test gas.
For vented heaters fueled by other test gases, use test gases with characteristics as described in Table 3 of Section 5.2 of ANSI Z21.86-2016. Use gases with a measured higher heating value within ±5 percent of the values specified in Table 3 of Section 5.2 of ANSI Z21.86-2016. Determine the actual higher heating value of the gas used in the test with an error no greater than one percent.

If a voltage range is used for nameplate voltage, maintain the electrical supply within ±1 percent of the mid-point of the nameplate voltage range.
2.4
Burner adjustments.
2.4.1 Gas burner adjustments.
Adjust the burners of gas-fueled vented heaters to their maximum Btu ratings at the test pressure specified in section 2.3 of this appendix. Correct the burner volumetric flow rate to 60 °F (15.6 °C) and 30 inches of mercury barometric pressure, set the fuel flow rate to obtain a
heat rate of within ±2 percent of the hourly Btu rating specified by the manufacturer on the nameplate of the unit or in the I
O manual, as measured after 15 minutes of operation, starting with all parts of the vented heater at room temperature. Set the primary air shutters in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations on the nameplate of the unit or in the I
O manual to give a good flame at this adjustment. Do not allow the deposit of carbon during any test specified herein. If a vent limiting means is provided on a gas pressure regulator, have it in place during all tests.
For gas-fueled heaters with modulating controls, adjust the controls to operate the heater at the maximum fuel input rate. Set the thermostat control to the maximum setting. Start the heater by turning the safety control valve to the “on” position. In order to prevent modulation of the burner at maximum input, place the thermostat sensing element in a temperature control bath which is held at a temperature below the maximum set point temperature of the control.
For gas-fueled heaters with modulating controls, adjust the controls to operate the heater at the reduced fuel input rate. Set the thermostat control to the minimum setting. Start the heater by turning the safety control valve to the “on” position. If ambient test room temperature is above the lowest control set point temperature, initiate burner operation by placing the thermostat sensing element in a temperature control bath that is held at a temperature below the minimum set point temperature of the control.
2.4.2 Oil burner adjustments.
Adjust the burners of oil-fueled vented heaters to give the CO
2
reading recommended by the manufacturer and an hourly Btu input, during the steady-state performance test described below, which is within ±2 percent of the heater manufacturer's specified hourly Btu input rating on the nameplate of the unit or in the I
O manual. On units employing a power burner, do not allow smoke in the flue to exceed a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state performance test as measured by the procedure in ASTM D2156-09 (R2018). If, on units employing a power burner, the smoke in the flue exceeds a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state test, readjust the burner to give a lower smoke reading, and, if necessary, a lower CO
2
reading, and start all tests over. Maintain the average draft over the fire and in the flue during the steady-state performance test at that recommended by the manufacturer within ±0.005 inches of water gauge. Do not make additional adjustments to the burner during the required series of performance tests. The instruments and measuring apparatus for this test are described in Section 6 and shown in Figure 8 of ASHRAE 103-2017. Calibrate instruments for measuring oil pressure so that the error is no greater than ±0.5 psi.
2.5 Circulating air adjustments.

Begin the steady-state performance test by operating the burner and the circulating air blower, on units so equipped, with the adjustments specified by sections 2.4.1 and 2.5 of this appendix, until steady-state conditions are attained as indicated by three successive readings taken 15 minutes apart with a temperature variation of not more than ±3 °F (1.7 C) in the stack gas temperature for vented heaters equipped with draft diverters or ±5 °F (2.8 C) in the flue gas temperature for vented heaters equipped with either draft hoods or direct vent systems. The measurements described in this section are to coincide with the last of these 15 minute readings.
On units employing draft diverters, measure the room temperature (T
RA
) as described in section 2.9 of this appendix and measure the steady-state stack gas temperature (T
S,SS
) using the nine thermocouples located in the 5 foot test stack as specified in section 2.6.1 of this appendix. Secure a sample of the stack gases in the plane where T
S,SS
is measured or within 3.5 feet downstream of this plane. Determine the concentration by volume of carbon dioxide (X
CO2S
) present in the dry stack gas. If the location of the gas sampling differs from the temperature measurement plane, there shall be no air leaks through the stack between these two locations.
On units employing draft hoods or direct vent systems, measure the room temperature (T
RA
) as described in section 2.9 of this appendix and measure the steady-state flue gas temperature (T
F,SS
), using the nine thermocouples located in the flue pipe as described in section 2.6.1 of this appendix. Secure a sample of the flue gas in the plane of temperature measurement and determine the concentration by volume of CO
2
(X
CO2F
) present in dry flue gas. In addition, for units employing draft hoods, secure a sample of the stack gas in a horizontal plane in the five foot test stack located one foot from the test stack inlet; and determine the concentration by volume of CO
2
(X
CO2S
) present in dry stack gas.
Determine the steady-state heat input rate (Qin) including pilot gas by multiplying the measured higher heating value of the test gas by the steady-state gas input rate corrected to standard conditions of 60 °F and 30 inches of mercury. Use measured values of gas temperature and pressure at the meter and the barometric pressure to correct the metered gas flow rate to standard conditions.
After the above test measurements have been completed on units employing draft diverters, secure a sample of the flue gases at the exit of the heat exchanger(s) and determine the concentration of CO
2
(X
CO2F
) present. In obtaining this sample of flue gas, move the sampling probe around or use a sample probe with multiple sampling ports in order to assure that an average value is obtained for the CO
2
concentration. For units with multiple heat exchanger outlets, measure the CO
2
concentration in a sample from each outlet to obtain the average CO
2
concentration for the unit. A manifold (parallel connected sampling tubes) may be used to obtain this sample.
For heaters with single-stage thermostat control (wall mounted electric thermostats), determine the steady-state efficiency at the
maximum fuel input rate as specified in section 2.4 of this appendix.
For gas fueled vented heaters equipped with either two stage control or step-modulating control, determine the steady-state efficiency at the maximum fuel input rate and at the reduced fuel input rate, as specified in section 2.4.1 of this appendix.
For manually controlled gas fueled vented heaters with various input rates, determine the steady-state efficiency at a fuel input rate that is within ±5 percent of 50 percent of the maximum rated fuel input rate as indicated on the nameplate of the unit or in the manufacturer's installation and operation manual shipped with the unit. If the heater is designed to use a control that precludes operation at other than maximum rated fuel input rate (single firing rate) determine the steady state efficiency at the maximum rated fuel input rate only.
3.1.2 Oil-fueled vented home heating equipment (including direct vent systems).
Set up and adjust the vented heater as specified in sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.4 of this appendix. Begin the steady-state performance test by operating the burner and the circulating air blower, on units so equipped, with the adjustments specified by sections 2.4.2 and 2.5 of this appendix, until steady-state conditions are attained as indicated by a temperature variation of not more than ±5 °F (2.8 °C) in the flue gas temperature in three successive readings taken 15 minutes apart. The measurements described in this section are to coincide with the last of these 15 minutes readings.
For units equipped with power burners, do not allow smoke in the flue to exceed a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state performance test as measured by the procedure described in ASTM D2156-09 (R2018). Maintain the average draft over the fire and in the breeching during the steady-state performance test at that recommended by the manufacturer ±0.005 inches of water gauge.
Measure the room temperature (T
RA
) as described in section 2.9 of this appendix. Measure the steady-state flue gas temperature (T
F,SS
) using nine thermocouples (or five, as applicable) located in the flue pipe as described in section 2.6.2 of this appendix. From the plane where T
F,SS
was measured, collect a sample of the flue gas and determine the concentration by volume of CO
2
(X
CO2F
) present in dry flue gas. Measure and record the steady-state heat input rate (Q
in
).
For manually controlled oil fueled vented heaters, determine the steady-state efficiency at a fuel input rate that is within ±5 percent of 50 percent of the maximum fuel input rate; or, if the design of the heater is such that the fuel input rate cannot be set to ±5 percent of 50 percent of the maximum rated fuel input rate, determine the steady-state efficiency at the minimum rated fuel input rate as measured in section 3.1.2 of this appendix for manually controlled oil fueled vented heaters.
3.1.3
Auxiliary Electric Power Measurement.
Allow the auxiliary electrical system of a gas or oil vented heater to operate for at least five minutes before recording the maximum auxiliary electric power measurement from the wattmeter. Record the maximum electric power (P
E
) expressed in kilowatts. For vented heaters with modulating controls, the recorded (P
E
) shall be maximum measured electric power multiplied by the following factor (R). For two stage controls, R = 1.3. For step modulating controls, R = 1.4 when the ratio of minimum-to-maximum fuel input is greater than or equal to 0.7, R = 1.7 when the ratio of minimum-to-maximum fuel input is less than 0.7 and greater than or equal to 0.5, and R = 2.2 when the ratio of minimum-to-maximum fuel input is less than 0.5.
3.2 Jacket loss measurement.
Conduct a jacket loss test for vented floor furnaces. Measure the jacket loss (L
j
) in accordance with ASHRAE 103-2017 Section 8.6, applying the provisions for furnaces and not the provisions for boilers.
3.3
Measurement of the off-cycle losses for vented heaters equipped with thermal stack dampers.
Unless specified otherwise, the thermal stack damper should be at the draft diverter exit collar. Attach a five foot length of bare stack to the outlet of the damper. Install thermocouples as specified in section 2.6.1 of this appendix.
For vented heaters equipped with single-stage thermostats, measure the off-cycle losses at the maximum fuel input rate. For vented heaters equipped with two stage thermostats, measure the off-cycle losses at the maximum fuel input rate and at the reduced fuel input rate. For vented heaters equipped with step-modulating thermostats, measure the off-cycle losses at the reduced fuel input rate.
Allow the vented heater to heat up to a steady-state condition. Feed a tracer gas at a constant metered rate into the stack directly above and within one foot above the stack damper. Record tracer gas flow rate and temperature. Measure the tracer gas concentration in the stack at several locations in a horizontal plane through a cross-section of the stack at a point sufficiently above the stack damper to ensure that the tracer gas is well mixed in the stack.
Continuously measure the tracer gas concentration and temperature during a 10-minute cool-down period. Shut the burner off and immediately begin measuring tracer gas concentration in the stack, stack temperature, room temperature, and barometric pressure. Record these values as the midpoint of each one-minute interval between burner shut-down and ten minutes after burner shut-down. Meter response time and
sampling delay time shall be considered in timing these measurements.
3.4
Measurement of the effectiveness of electro-mechanical stack dampers.
For vented heaters equipped with electro-mechanical stack dampers, measure the cross sectional area of the stack (A
s
), the net area of the damper plate (A
o
), and the angle that the damper plate makes when closed with a plane perpendicular to the axis of the stack (Ω). The net area of the damper plate means the area of the damper plate minus the area of any holes through the damper plate.
3.5
Pilot light measurement.
3.5.1 Measure the energy input rate to the pilot light (Q
P
) with an error no greater than 3 percent for vented heaters so equipped.
3.5.2 For manually controlled heaters where the pilot light is designed to be turned off by the user when the heater is not in use, that is, turning the control to the OFF position will shut off the gas supply to the burner(s) and to the pilot light, the measurement of Q
P
is not needed. This provision applies only if an instruction to turn off the unit is provided on the heater near the gas control valve (e.g. by label) by the manufacturer.
3.6
Optional procedure for determining
D
p′
D
F′
and D
s
for systems for all types of vented heaters.
For all types of vented heaters, D
p′
D
F′
and D
S
can be measured by the following optional cool down test.
Conduct a cool down test by letting the unit heat up until steady-state conditions are reached, as indicated by temperature variation of not more than 5 °F (2.8 °C) in the flue gas temperature in three successive readings taken 15 minutes apart, and then shutting the unit off with the stack or flue damper controls by-passed or adjusted so that the stack or flue damper remains open during the resulting cool down period. If a draft was maintained on oil fueled units in the flue pipe during the steady-state performance test described in section 3.1 of this appendix, maintain the same draft (within a range of −.001 to + .005 inches of water gauge of the average steady-state draft) during this cool down period.
Measure the flue gas mass flow rate (m
F,OFF
) during the cool down test described above at a specific off-period flue gas temperature and corrected to obtain its value at the steady-state flue gas temperature (T
F,SS
), using the procedure described below.
Within one minute after the unit is shut off to start the cool down test for determining D
F
, begin feeding a tracer gas into the combustion chamber at a constant flow rate of V
T
, and at a point which will allow for the best possible mixing with the air flowing through the chamber. (On units equipped with an oil fired power burner, the best location for injecting this tracer gas appears to be through a hole drilled in the air tube.) Periodically measure the value of V
T
with an instantaneously reading flow meter having an accuracy of ±3 percent of the quantity measured. Maintain V
T
at less than 1 percent of the air flow rate through the furnace. If a combustible tracer gas is used, there should be a delay period between the time the burner gas is shut off and the time the tracer gas is first injected to prevent ignition of the tracer gas.
Between 5 and 6 minutes after the unit is shut off to start the cool down test, measure at the exit of the heat exchanger the average flue gas temperature, T*
F,Off
. At the same instant the flue gas temperature is measured, also measure the percent volumetric concentration of tracer gas C
T
in the flue gas in the same plane where T*
F,Off
is determined. Obtain the concentration of tracer gas using an instrument which will result in an accuracy of ±2 percent in the value of C
T
measured. If use of a continuous reading type instrument results in a delay time between drawing of a sample and its analysis, this delay should be taken into account so that the temperature measurement and the measurement of tracer gas concentration coincide. In addition, determine the temperature of the tracer gas entering the flow meter (T
T
) and the barometric pressure (P
B
).
The rate of the flue gas mass flow through the vented heater and the factors D
P
, D
F
, and D
S
are calculated by the equations in sections 4.5.1 through 4.5.3 of this appendix.
3.6.1
Procedure for determining (
D
F and
D
P
)
of vented home heating equipment with no measurable airflow.
On units whose design is such that there is no measurable airflow through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger when the burner(s) is off (as determined by the test procedure in section 3.6.2 of this appendix), D
F
and D
P
may be set equal to 0.05.
3.6.2
Test Method to Determine Whether the Use of the Default Draft Factors (
D
F and
D
P
)
of 0.05 is Allowed.
Manufacturers may use the following test protocol to determine whether air flows through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger when the burner(s) is off using a smoke stick device. The default draft factor of 0.05 (as allowed per section 3.6.1 of this appendix) may be used only for units determined pursuant to this protocol to have no air flow through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger.
3.6.2.1
Test Conditions.
Wait for two minutes following the termination of the vented heater's on-cycle.
3.6.2.2
Location of Test Apparatus
3.6.2.2.1 After all air currents and drafts in the test chamber have been minimized, position the operable smoke stick/pencil as specified, based on the following equipment configuration: for horizontal combustion air intakes, approximately 4 inches from the vertical plane at the termination of the intake vent and 4 inches below the bottom edge of the combustion air intake, or for
vertical combustion air intakes, approximately 4 inches horizontal from vent perimeter at the termination of the intake vent and 4 inches down (parallel to the vertical axis of the vent). In the instance where the boiler combustion air intake is closer than 4 inches to the floor, place the smoke device directly on the floor without impeding the flow of smoke.
3.6.2.2.2 Monitor the presence and the direction of the smoke flow.
3.6.2.3
Duration of Test.
Continue monitoring the release of smoke for no less than 30 seconds.
3.6.2.4
Test Results
3.6.2.4.1 During visual assessment, determine whether there is any draw of smoke into the combustion air intake.
3.6.2.4.2 If absolutely no smoke is drawn into the combustion air intake, the vented heater meets the requirements to allow use of the default draft factor of 0.05.
3.6.2.4.3 If there is any smoke drawn into the intake, use of default draft factor of 0.05 is prohibited. Proceed with the methods of testing as prescribed in section 3.6 of this appendix, or select the appropriate default draft factor from Table 1.
3.7
Measurement of electrical standby mode and off mode power.
3.7.1
Standby power measurements.
With all electrical auxiliaries of the vented heater not activated, measure the standby power (P

Room ambient temperature,
and the voltage provision of section 2.3.5,
Electrical supply,
of this appendix shall apply in lieu of the IEC 62301 (Second Edition) corresponding sections 4.2,
Test room,
and 4.3,
Power supply.
Clarifying further, the IEC 62301 (Second Edition) sections 4.4,
Power measuring instruments,
and section 5,
Measurements,
shall apply in lieu of section 2.8,
Energy flow instrumentation,
of this appendix. Measure the wattage so that all possible standby mode wattage for the entire appliance is recorded, not just the standby mode wattage of a single auxiliary. The recorded standby power (P
W,SB
) shall be rounded to the second decimal place, and for loads greater than or equal to 10W, at least three significant figures shall be reported.
3.7.2
Off mode power measurement.
If the unit is equipped with a seasonal off switch or there is an expected difference between off mode power and standby mode power, measure off mode power (P
W,OFF
) in accordance with the standby power procedures in IEC 62301 (Second Edition) (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3), except that section 2.9,
Room ambient temperature,
and the voltage provision of section 2.3.5,
Electrical supply,
of this appendix shall apply in lieu of the IEC 62301 (Second Edition) corresponding sections 4.2,
Test room,
and 4.3,
Power supply.
Clarifying further, the IEC 62301 (Second Edition) sections 4.4,
Power measuring instruments,
and section 5,
Measurements,
shall apply in lieu of section 2.8,
Energy flow instrumentation,
of this appendix. Measure the wattage so that all possible off mode wattage for the entire appliance is recorded, not just the off mode wattage of a single auxiliary. If there is no expected difference in off mode power and standby mode power, let P
W,OFF
= P
W,SB
, in which case no separate measurement of off mode power is necessary. The recorded off mode power (P
W,OFF
) shall be rounded to the second decimal place, and for loads greater than or equal to 10W, at least three significant figures shall be reported.
3.8
Condensing vented heaters—measurement of condensate under steady-state and cyclic conditions.
Attach condensate drain lines to the vented heater as specified in the manufacturer's I
O manual provided with the unit. The test unit shall be level prior to all testing. A continuous downward slope of drain lines from the unit shall be maintained. The drain lines must facilitate uninterrupted flow of condensate during the test. The condensate collection container must be glass or polished stainless steel to facilitate removal of interior deposits. The collection container shall have a vent opening to the atmosphere, be dried prior to each use, and be at room ambient temperature. The humidity of the room air shall at no time exceed 80 percent relative humidity. For condensing units not designed for collecting and draining condensate, drain lines must be provided during testing that meet the criteria set forth in this section 3.8. Units employing manual controls and units not tested under the optional tracer gas procedures of sections 3.3 and 3.6 of this appendix shall only conduct the steady-state condensate collection test.
3.8.1
Steady-state condensate collection test.
Begin steady-state condensate collection concurrently with or immediately after completion of the steady-state testing of section 3.1 of this appendix. The steady-state condensate collection period shall be 30 minutes. Condensate mass shall be measured immediately at the end of the collection period to minimize evaporation loss from the sample. Record fuel input during the 30-minute condensate collection steady-state test period. Measure and record fuel higher heating value (HHV), temperature, and pressures necessary for determining fuel energy input (Q
c,ss
). The fuel quantity and HHV shall be measured with errors no greater than ±1 percent. Determine the mass of condensate for the steady-state test (M
c,ss
) in pounds by subtracting the tare container weight from the total container and condensate weight measured at the end of the 30-minute condensate collection test period. The error associated with the mass measurement instruments
shall not exceed ±0.5 percent of the quantity measured.
For units with step-modulating or two stage controls, the steady-state condensate collection test shall be conducted at both the maximum and reduced input rates.
3.8.2 Cyclic condensate collection tests.
If existing controls do not allow for cyclical operation of the tested unit, install control devices to allow cyclical operation of the vented heater. Run three consecutive test cycles. For each cycle, operate the unit until flue gas temperatures at the end of each on-cycle, rounded to the nearest whole number, are within 5 °F of each other for two consecutive cycles. On-cycle and off-cycle times are 4 minutes and 13 minutes respectively. Control of ON and OFF operation actions shall be within ±6 seconds of the scheduled time. For fan-type vented heaters, maintain circulating air adjustments as specified in section 2.5 of this appendix. Begin condensate collection at one minute before the on-cycle period of the first test cycle. Remove the container one minute before the end of each off-cycle period. Measure condensate mass for each test-cycle. The error associated with the mass measurement instruments shall not exceed ±0.5 percent of the quantity measured.
Record fuel input during the entire test period starting at the beginning of the on-time period of the first cycle to the beginning of the on-time period of the second cycle, from the beginning of the on-time period of the second cycle to the beginning of the on-time period of the third cycle, etc., for each of the test cycles. Record fuel HHV, temperature, and pressure necessary for determining fuel energy input, Q
C
. Determine the mass of condensate for each cycle, M
C
, in pounds. If at the end of three cycles, the sample standard deviation is less than or equal to 20 percent of the mean value for three cycles, use total condensate collected in the three cycles as M
C
; if not, continue collection for an additional three cycles and use the total condensate collected for the six cycles as M
C
. Determine the fuel energy input, Q
C
, during the three or six test cycles, expressed in Btu.
For units with step-modulating controls, conduct the cyclic condensate collection test at reduced input rate only. For units with two-stage controls, conduct the cyclic condensate collection test at both maximum and reduced input rates unless the balance-point temperature (T
C
) as determined in section 4.1.10 of this appendix O is equal to or less than the typical outdoor design temperature of 5 °F (-5 °C), in which case, conduct testing at the reduced input rate only.

In addition to the specifications in section 9 of ANSI C78.375A, the current probe must be galvanically isolated and have frequency response between 40 Hz and 20 MHz.

# 2.3. Test Setup
2.3.1. Connect the ballast to a main power source and to the fluorescent lamp(s) as specified in this section. Ensure the ballast is connected to fluorescent lamp(s) according to any manufacturer's wiring instructions on or sold with each unit (including those provided online). To test a low-frequency ballast, follow ANSI C82.1 but disregard section 5.3 of ANSI C82.1. To test a high-frequency ballast, follow ANSI C82.11 but disregard sections 5.3.1 and 5.13 and Annex D of ANSI C82.11.
2.3.2. In the test setup, all wires used in the apparatus, including any wires from the ballast to the lamps and from the lamps to the measuring devices, must meet the following specifications:
2.3.2.1. Use the wires provided by the ballast manufacturer and only the minimum wire length necessary to reach both ends of each lamp. If the wire lengths supplied with the ballast are too short to reach both ends of each lamp, add the minimum additional wire length necessary to reach both ends of each lamp, using wire of the same wire gauge(s) as the wire supplied with the ballast. If no wiring is provided with the ballast, use 18 gauge or thicker wire.
2.3.2.2. Keep wires loose. Do not shorten or allow bundling of any wires. Separate all wires from each other, and ground them to prevent parasitic capacitance.
2.3.3. Test each ballast with only one fluorescent lamp type. Select the one type of fluorescent lamp for testing as follows:
2.3.3.1. Each fluorescent lamp must meet the specifications of a reference lamp as defined by ANSI C82.13, be seasoned at least 12 hours, and be stabilized as specified in 2.5.2.1 of this appendix. Test each reference lamp with a reference ballast that meets the criteria of ANSI C82.3. For low frequency ballasts that operate:
(a) 32 W 4-foot medium bipin T8 lamps, use the following reference lamp specifications: 30.8 W, arc wattage; 1.7 W, approximate cathode wattage (with 3.6 V on each cathode); 32.5 W, total wattage; 137 V, voltage; 0.265 A, current.

General Instruction for Measuring Flow Rate

# 3.1. Using the Fluid Meter Method To Measure Flow Rate
When measuring flow rate upstream of a showerhead or faucet using a fluid meter (or equivalent device) as described in section 5.4.2.2(c) of ASME A112.18.1, ensure the fluid meter (or equivalent device) meets the following additional requirements. First, ensure the fluid meter is rated for the flow rate range of the product being tested. Second, when testing showerheads or non-metering faucets, ensure that the fluid meter has a resolution for flow rate of at least 0.1 gallons (0.4 liters) per minute. When testing a metering faucet, ensure that the fluid meter has a resolution for flow rate of at least 0.01 gallons (0.04 liters) per minute. Third, verify the fluid meter is calibrated in accordance with the manufacturer printed instructions.

# 3.2. Using the Time/Volume Method To Measure Flow Rate
There are several additional requirements when measuring flow rate downstream of a showerhead or faucet as described in section 5.4.2.2(d) of ASME A112.18.1 to measure flow rate. First, ensure the receiving container is large enough to contain all the water for a single test and has an opening size and/or a partial cover such that loss of water from splashing is minimized. Second, conduct the time/volume test for at least one minute, with the time recorded via a stopwatch with at least 0.1-second resolution. Third, measure and record the temperature of the water using a thermocouple or other similar device either at the receiving container immediately after recording the mass of water, or at the water in the supply line anytime during the duration of the time/volume test. Fourth, measure the mass of water to a resolution of at least 0.01 lb. (0.005 kg) and normalize it to gallons based on the specific gravity of water at the recorded temperature.

# 3. Test Measurement
a. Water closets:
(i) Measure the water flush volume for water closets, expressed in gallons per flush (gpf) or liters per flush (Lpf), in accordance with Section 7.3, Water Consumption Test, of ASME A112.19.2-2018. For dual-flush water closets, the measurement of the water flush volume shall be conducted separately for the full-flush and reduced-flush modes and in accordance with the test requirements specified Section 7.3, Water Consumption Test, of ASME A112.19.2-2018. The final measured flush volume for each tested unit is the average of the total flush volumes recorded at each test pressure as specified in Table 5 “Static test pressures for water closets, kPa (psi),” of ASME A112.19.2-2018, based on the average of the individual flush volumes at a given pressure from the three tests.
(ii) Flush volume and tank trim component adjustments: For gravity flush tank water closets, set trim components that can be adjusted to cause an increase in flush volume, including (but not limited to) the flapper valve, fill valve, and tank water level, in accordance with the printed installation instructions supplied by the manufacturer with the unit. If the printed installation instructions for the model to be tested do not specify trim setting adjustments, adjust these trim components to the maximum water use setting so that the maximum flush volume is produced without causing the water closet to malfunction or leak. Set the water level in the tank to the maximum water line designated in the printed installation instructions supplied by the manufacturer or the designated water line on the tank itself, whichever is higher. If the printed installation instructions or the water closet tank do not indicate a water level, adjust the water level to 1±0.1 inches below the top of the overflow tube or, for gravity flush tank water closets that do not contain an overflow tube, 1±0.1 inches below the top rim
of the water-containing vessel for each designated pressure specified in Table 5 of ASME A112.19.2-2018.
b. Urinals—Measure water flush volume for urinals, expressed in gallons per flush (gpf) or liters per flush (Lpf), in accordance with Section 8.6, Water Consumption Test, of ASME A112.19.2-2018. The final measured flush volume for each tested unit is the average of the total flush volumes recorded at each test pressure as specified in Table 6 “Static test pressures for urinals, kPa (psi),” of ASME A112.19.2-2018, based on the average of the individual flush volumes at a given pressure from the three tests.

Scope:
The provisions in this appendix apply to ceiling fans except:
(1) Ceiling fans where the plane of rotation of a ceiling fan's blades is not less than or equal to 45 degrees from horizontal, or cannot be adjusted based on the manufacturer's specifications to be less than or equal to 45 degrees from horizontal;
(2) Centrifugal ceiling fans;
(3) Belt-driven ceiling fans that are not high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans; and
(4) Oscillating ceiling fans.

# 3.
General Instructions, Test Apparatus, and Test Measurement:
The test apparatus and test measurement used to determine energy performance depend on the ceiling fan's blade span, and in some cases the ceiling fan's blade edge thickness. For each tested ceiling fan, measure the lateral distance from the center of the axis of rotation of the fan blades to the furthest fan blade edge from the center of the axis of rotation. Measure this lateral distance at the resolution of the measurement instrument, using an instrument with a measurement resolution of least 0.25 inches. Multiply the lateral distance by two and then round to the nearest whole inch to determine the blade span. For ceiling fans having a blade span greater than 18 inches and less than or equal to 84 inches, measure the ceiling fan's blade edge thickness. To measure the fan blade edge thickness, use an instrument with a measurement resolution of at least 0.001 inch and measure the thickness of one fan blade's leading edge (in the forward direction) according to the following:
(1) Locate the cross-section perpendicular to the fan blade's radial length that is at least one inch from the tip of the fan blade and for which the blade is thinnest, and
(2) Measure at the thickest point of that cross-section within one inch from the leading edge of the fan blade.
See Figure 1 of this appendix for an instructional schematic on the fan blade edge thickness measurement. Figure 1 depicts a ceiling fan from above. Round the measured blade edge thickness to the nearest 0.01 inch.
ER16AU22.007
3.1. General instructions.
3.1.1. Record measurements at the resolution of the test instrumentation. Round off calculations to the number of significant digits present at the resolution of the test instrumentation, except for blade span, which is rounded to the nearest inch. Round the final ceiling fan efficiency value to the nearest whole number as follows:
3.1.1.1. A fractional number at or above the midpoint between the two consecutive whole numbers shall be rounded up to the higher of the two whole numbers; or
3.1.1.2. A fractional number below the midpoint between the two consecutive whole numbers shall be rounded down to the lower of the two whole numbers.
3.1.2. For multi-head ceiling fans, the effective blade span is the blade span (as specified in section 3) of an individual fan head, if all fan heads are the same size. If the fan heads are of varying sizes, the effective blade span is the blade span (as specified in section 3) of the largest fan head.
3.2. Test apparatus for low-speed small-diameter and high-speed small-diameter ceiling fans: All instruments are to have accuracies within ±1% of reading, except for the air velocity sensors, which must have accuracies within ±5% of reading or 2 feet per minute (fpm), whichever is greater. Equipment is to be calibrated at least once a year to compensate for variation over time.
3.2.1.
Air Delivery Room Requirements
(1) The air delivery room dimensions are to be 20 ± 0.75 feet x 20 ± 0.75 feet with an 11 ± 0.75 foot-high ceiling. The control room shall be constructed external to the air delivery room.
(2) The ceiling shall be constructed of sheet rock or stainless plate. The walls must be of adequate thickness to maintain the specified temperature and humidity during the test. The paint used on the walls, as well as the paint used on the ceiling material, must be of a type that minimizes absorption of humidity and that keeps the temperature of the room constant during the test (
e.g.,
oil-based paint).
(3) The room must not have any ventilation other than an air conditioning and return system used to control the temperature and humidity of the room. The construction of the room must ensure consistent air circulation patterns within the room. Vents must have electronically-operated damper doors controllable from a switch outside of the testing room.
3.2.2.
Equipment Set-Up
(1) Make sure the transformer power is off. Hang the ceiling fan to be tested directly from the ceiling, according to the manufacturer's installation instructions. Hang all non-multi-mount ceiling fans in the fan configuration that minimizes the distance between the ceiling and the lowest point of the fan blades. Hang and test multi-mount fans in two configurations: The configuration associated the definition of a standard fan that minimizes the distance between the ceiling and the lowest point of the fan blades and the configuration associated with the definition of a hugger fan that minimizes the distance between the ceiling and the lowest
point of the fan blades. For all tested configurations, measure the distance between the ceiling and the lowest point of the fan blade using an instrument with a measurement resolution of at least 0.25 inches. Round the measured distance from the ceiling to the lowest point of the fan blade to the nearest quarter inch.
(2) Connect wires as directed by manufacturer's wiring instructions.
Note:
Assemble fan prior to the test; lab personnel must follow the instructions provided with the fan by the fan manufacturer. Balance the fan blade assembly in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions to avoid excessive vibration of the motor assembly (at any speed) during operation.
(3) With the ceiling fan installed, adjust the height of the air velocity sensors to ensure the vertical distance between the lowest point on the ceiling fan blades and the air velocity sensors is 43 inches.
(4) A single rotating sensor arm, two rotating sensor arms, or four fixed sensor arms can be used to take air velocity measurements along four axes, labeled A-D. Axes A, B, C, and D are at 0, 90, 180, and 270 degree positions. Axes A-D must be perpendicular to the four walls of the room. See Figure 2 of this appendix.
ER16AU22.008
(5) Minimize the amount of exposed wiring. Store all sensor lead wires under the floor, if possible.
(6) Place the sensors at intervals of 4 ± 0.0625 inches along a sensor arm, starting with the first sensor at the point where the four axes intersect, aligning the sensors perpendicular to the direction of airflow. Do not touch the actual sensor prior to testing. Use enough sensors to record air delivery within a circle 8 inches larger in diameter than the blade span of the ceiling fan being tested. The experimental set-up is shown in Figure 3 of this appendix.
ER16AU22.009
(7) Table 1 of this appendix shows the appropriate number of sensors needed per each of four axes (including the first sensor at the intersection of the axes) for common fan sizes.

* The fan sizes listed are illustrative and do not restrict which ceiling fan sizes can be tested.
(8) Install an RPM (revolutions per minute) meter, or tachometer, to measure RPM of the ceiling fan blades.
(9) Use an RMS sensor capable of measuring power with an accuracy of ±1% to measure ceiling fan power consumption. If the ceiling fan operates on multi-phase power input, measure the active (real) power in all phases simultaneously. Measure test voltage within 6” of the connection supplied with the ceiling fan.
(10) Complete any conditioning instructions provided in the ceiling fan's instruction or installation manual must be completed prior to conducting testing.
3.2.3.
Multi-Head Ceiling Fan Test Set-Up.
Hang a multi-headed ceiling fan from the ceiling such that one of the ceiling fan heads is centered directly over sensor 1 (
i.e.,
at the intersection of axes A, B, C, and D). The distance between the lowest point any of the fan blades of the centered fan head can reach and the air velocity sensors is to be such that it is the same as for all other small-diameter ceiling fans (
see
Figure 3 of this appendix). If the multi-head ceiling fan has an oscillating function (
i.e.,
the fan heads change their axis of rotation relative to the ceiling) that can be switched off, switch it off prior to taking air velocity measurements. If any multi-head fan does not come with the blades preinstalled, install fan blades only on the fan head that will be directly centered over the intersection of the sensor axes. (Even if the fan heads in a multi-head ceiling fan would typically oscillate when the blades are installed on all fan heads, the ceiling fan is subject to this test procedure if the centered fan head does not oscillate when it is the only fan head with the blades installed.) If the fan blades are preinstalled on all fan heads, measure air velocity in accordance with section 3.3 of this appendix except turn on only the centered fan head. Take the power consumption measurements separately, with the fan blades installed on all fan heads and with any oscillating function, if present, switched on.
3.2.4. Test Set-Up for Ceiling Fans with Airflow Not Directly Downward
For ceiling fans where the airflow is not directly downward, adjust the ceiling fan head such that the airflow is as vertical as possible prior to testing. For ceiling fans where a fully vertical orientation of airflow cannot be achieved, orient the ceiling fan (or fan head, if the ceiling fan is a multi-head fan) such that any remaining tilt is aligned along one of the four sensor axes. Instead of measuring the air velocity for only those sensors directly beneath the ceiling fan, the air velocity is to be measured at all sensors along that axis, as well as the axis oriented 180 degrees with respect to that axis. For example, if the tilt is oriented along axis A, air velocity measurements are to be taken for all sensors along the A-C axis. No measurements would need to be taken along the B-D axis in
this case. All other aspects of test set-up remain unchanged from sections 3 through 3.2.2.
3.3. Active mode test measurement for low-speed small-diameter and high-speed small-diameter ceiling fans.
3.3.1.
Test conditions to be followed when testing:
(1) Maintain the room temperature at 70 degrees ± 5 degrees Fahrenheit and the room humidity at 50% ± 5% relative humidity during the entire test process.
(2) If present, the ceiling fan light fixture is to be installed but turned off during testing.
(3) If present, any additional accessories or features sold with the ceiling fan that do not relate to the ceiling fan's ability to create airflow by rotation of the fan blades (for example light kit, heater, air ionization, ultraviolet technology) is to be installed but turned off during testing. If such an accessory or feature cannot be turned off, it shall be set to the lowest energy-consuming mode during testing. If the ceiling fan is offered with a default controller, test using the default controller. If multiple controllers are offered, test using the minimally functional controller.
(4) If present, turn off any oscillating function causing the axis of rotation of the fan head(s) to change relative to the ceiling during operation prior to taking air velocity measurements. Turn on any oscillating function prior to taking power measurements.
(5) Test ceiling fans rated for operation with only a single- or multi-phase power supply with single- or multi-phase electricity, respectively. Test ceiling fans capable of operating with single- and multi-phase electricity with single-phase electricity. DOE will allow manufacturers of ceiling fans capable of operating with single- and multi-phase electricity to test such fans with single-phase power and make representations of efficiency associated with both single and multi-phase electricity if a manufacturer desires to do so, but the test results in the multi-phase configuration will not be valid to assess compliance with any amended energy conservation standard. All tested power supply should be at 60 Hz.
(6) The supply voltage shall be:
(i) for ceiling fans tested with single-phase electricity, the supply voltage shall be:
(a) 120 V if the ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage is 120 V or the lowest rated voltage range contains 120 V,
(b) 240 V if the ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage is 240 V or the lowest rated voltage range contains 240 V, or
(c) The ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage (if a voltage range is not given) or the mean of the lowest rated voltage range, in all other cases.
(ii) for ceiling fans tested with multi-phase electricity, the supply voltage shall be:
(a) 240 V if the ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage is 240 V or the lowest rated voltage range contains 240 V, or
(b) The ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage (if a voltage range is not given) or the mean of the lowest rated voltage range, in all other cases.
(iii) The test voltage shall not vary by more than ±1% during the tests.
(7) Conduct the test with the fan connected to a supply circuit at the rated frequency.
(8) Measure power input at a point that includes all power-consuming components of the ceiling fan (but without any attached light kit energized; or without any additional accessory or feature energized, if possible; and if not, with the additional accessory or feature set at the lowest energy-consuming mode). If the ceiling fan is offered with a default controller, test using the default controller. If multiple controllers are offered, test using the minimally functional controller.
3.3.2.
Air Velocity and Power Consumption Testing Procedure:
Measure the air velocity (FPM) and power consumption (W) for HSSD ceiling fans until stable measurements are achieved, measuring at high speed only. Measure the air velocity and power consumption for LSSD and VSD ceiling fans that also meet the definition of an LSSD fan until stable measurements are achieved, measuring first at low speed and then at high speed. To determine low speed, start measurements at the lowest available speed and move to the next highest speed until the low speed definition in section 1.13 of this appendix is met. Air velocity and power consumption measurements are considered stable for high speed if:
(1) The average air velocity for each sensor varies by less than 5 percent or 2 FPM, whichever is greater, compared to the average air velocity measured for that same sensor in a successive set of air velocity measurements, and
(2) Average power consumption varies by less than 1 percent in a successive set of power consumption measurements.
(a) Air velocity and power consumption measurements are considered stable for low speed if:
(1) The average air velocity for each sensor varies by less than 10 percent or 2 FPM, whichever is greater, compared to the average air velocity measured for that same sensor in a successive set of air velocity measurements, and
(2) Average power consumption varies by less than 1 percent in a successive set of power consumption measurements.
(b) These stability criteria are applied differently to ceiling fans with airflow not directly downward.
See
section 3.3.3 of this appendix.
Step 1:
Set the first sensor arm (if using four fixed arms), two sensor arm (if using a
two-arm rotating setup), or single sensor arm (if using a single-arm rotating setup) to the 0 degree Position (Axis A). If necessary, use a marking as reference. If using a single-arm rotating setup or two-arm rotating setup, adjust the sensor arm alignment until it is at the 0 degree position by remotely controlling the antenna rotator.
Step 2:
Set software up to read and record air velocity, expressed in feet per minute (FPM) in 1 second intervals. (Temperature does not need to be recorded in 1 second intervals.) Record current barometric pressure.
Step 3:
Allow test fan to run 15 minutes at rated voltage and at high speed if the ceiling fan is an HSSD ceiling fan. If the ceiling fan is an LSSD or VSD ceiling fan that also meets the definition of an LSSD fan, allow the test fan to run 15 minutes at the rated voltage and at the lowest available ceiling fan speed. Turn off all forced-air environmental conditioning equipment entering the chamber (
e.g.,
air conditioning), close all doors and vents, and wait an additional 3 minutes prior to starting test session.
Step 4a:
For a rotating sensor arm: Begin recording readings. Starting with Axis A, take 100 air velocity readings (100 seconds run-time) and record these data. For all fans except multi-head fans and fans capable of oscillating, also measure power during the interval that air velocity measurements are taken. Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM). Determine if the readings meet the low speed definition as defined in section 1.13 of this appendix. If not, restart Step 4a at the next highest speed until the low-speed definition is met. Once the low speed definition is met, rotate the arm, stabilize the arm, and allow 30 seconds to allow the arm to stop oscillating. Repeat data recording and rotation process for Axes B, C, and D. Step 4a is complete when the readings for all axes meet the low speed definition at the same speed. Save the data for all axes only for those measurements that meet the low speed definition. Using the measurements applicable to low speed, record the average value of the power measurement in watts (W) (400 readings). Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM) (400 readings).
Step 4b:
For a two-arm rotating setup: Begin recording readings. Starting with Axes A and C, take 100 air velocity readings (100 seconds run-time) for both axes and record these data. For all fans except multi-head fans and fans capable of oscillating, also measure power during the interval that air velocity measurements are taken. Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM). Determine if the readings meet the low speed definition as defined in section 1.13 of this appendix. If not, restart Step 4b at the next highest speed until the low speed definition is met. Once the low speed definition is met, rotate the two-arm, stabilize the arm, and allow 30 seconds to allow the arm to stop oscillating. Repeat data recording for Axes B and D. Step 4b is complete when the readings for all axes meet the low speed definition at the same speed. Save the data for all axes only for those measurements that meet the low speed definition. Using the measurements applicable to low speed, record the average value of the power measurement in watts (W) (200 readings). Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM) (200 readings).
Step 4c:
For four fixed sensor arms: Begin recording readings. Take 100 air velocity readings (100 seconds run-time) and record this data. Take the readings for all sensor arms (Axes A, B, C, and D) simultaneously. For all fans except multi-head fans and fans capable of oscillating, also measure power during the interval that air velocity measurements are taken. Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM). Determine if the readings meet the low speed definition as defined in section 1.13 of this appendix. If not, restart Step 4c at the next highest speed until the low speed definition is met. Step 4c is complete when the readings for all axes meet the low speed definition at the same speed. Save the data for all axes only for those measurements that meet the low speed definition. Using the measurements applicable to low speed, record the average value of the power measurement in watts (W) (100 readings). Record the average value of the air velocity readings for each sensor in feet per minute (FPM) (100 readings).
Step 5:
Repeat step 4a, 4b or 4c until stable measurements are achieved.
Step 6:
Repeat steps 1 through 5 above on high speed for LSSD and VSD ceiling fans that also meet the definition of an LSSD fan. Note: Ensure that temperature and humidity readings are maintained within the required tolerances for the duration of the test (all tested speeds). Forced-air environmental conditioning equipment may be used and doors and vents may be opened between test sessions to maintain environmental conditions.
Step 7:
If testing a multi-mount ceiling fan, repeat steps 1 through 6 with the ceiling fan in the ceiling fan configuration (associated with either hugger or standard ceiling fans) not already tested.
If a multi-head ceiling fan includes more than one category of ceiling fan head, then test at least one of each unique category. A fan head with different construction that could affect air movement or power consumption, such as housing, blade pitch, or motor, would constitute a different category of fan head.
Step 8:
For multi-head ceiling fans, measure active (real) power consumption in all phases simultaneously at each speed continuously for 100 seconds with all fan heads turned on, and record the average value at each speed in watts (W).
For ceiling fans with an oscillating function, measure active (real) power consumption in all phases simultaneously at each speed continuously for 100 seconds with the oscillating function turned on. Record the average value of the power measurement in watts (W).
For both multi-head ceiling fans and fans with an oscillating function, repeat power consumption measurement until stable power measurements are achieved.
3.3.3.
Air Velocity Measurements for Ceiling Fans with Airflow Not Directly Downward:
Using the number of sensors that cover the same diameter as if the airflow were directly downward, record air velocity at each speed from the same number of continuous sensors with the largest air velocity measurements. This continuous set of sensors must be along the axis that the ceiling fan tilt is directed in (and along the axis that is 180 degrees from the first axis). For example, a 42-inch fan tilted toward axis A may create the pattern of air velocity shown in Figure 4 of this appendix. As shown in Table 1 of this appendix, a 42-inch fan would normally require 7 active sensors per axis. However, because the fan is not directed downward, all sensors must record data. In this case, because the set of sensors corresponding to maximum air velocity are centered 3 sensor positions away from the sensor 1 along the A axis, substitute the air velocity at A axis sensor 4 for the average air velocity at sensor 1. Take the average of the air velocity at A axis sensors 3 and 5 as a substitute for the average air velocity at sensor 2, take the average of the air velocity at A axis sensors 2 and 6 as a substitute for the average air velocity at sensor 3, etc. Lastly, take the average of the air velocities at A axis sensor 10 and C axis sensor 4 as a substitute for the average air velocity at sensor 7. Stability criteria apply after these substitutions. For example, air velocity stability at sensor 7 are determined based on the average of average air velocity at A axis sensor 10 and C axis sensor 4 in successive measurements. Any air velocity measurements made along the B-D axis are not included in the calculation of average air velocity.

Test apparatus for large-diameter ceiling fans and high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans:
The test apparatus and instructions for testing large-diameter ceiling fans and HSBD ceiling fans must conform to the requirements specified in Sections 3 through 7 (including Test Figure 1) of AMCA 230-15, with the following modifications:
3.4.1. A “ceiling fan” is defined as in 10 CFR 430.2.
3.4.2. Test ceiling fans rated for operation with only a single- or multi-phase power supply with single- or multi-phase electricity, respectively. Test ceiling fans capable of operating with single- and multi-phase electricity with multi-phase electricity. DOE will allow manufacturers of ceiling fans capable of operating with single- and multi-phase electricity to test such fans with single-phase power and make representations of efficiency associated with both single and multi-phase electricity if a manufacturer desires to do so, but the test results in the single-phase configuration will not be valid to assess compliance with any amended energy conservation standard. All tested power supply should be at 60 Hz.
3.4.3. Supply Voltage:
(1) For ceiling fans tested with single-phase electricity, the supply voltage shall be:
(a) 120 V if the ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage is 120 V or the lowest rated voltage range contains 120 V,
(b) 240 V if the ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage is 240 V or the lowest rated voltage range contains 240 V, or
(c) The ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage (if a voltage range is not given) or the mean of the lowest rated voltage range, in all other cases.
(2) For ceiling fans tested with multi-phase electricity, the supply voltage shall be:
(a) 240 V if the ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage is 240 V or the lowest rated voltage range contains 240 V, or
(b) The ceiling fan's minimum rated voltage (if a voltage range is not given) or the mean of the lowest rated voltage range, in all other cases.
3.5.
Active mode test measurement for large-diameter ceiling fans and high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans:
(1) Test large-diameter ceiling fans and high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans in accordance with AMCA 208-18, in all phases simultaneously at:
(a) High speed, and
(b) 40 percent or the nearest speed that is not less than 40 percent speed.
(2) When testing at 40 percent speed for large-diameter ceiling fans that can operate over an infinite number of speeds (
e.g.,
ceiling fans with VFDs), ensure the average measured RPM is within the greater of 1 percent of the average RPM at high speed or 1 RPM. For example, if the average measured RPM at high speed is 50 RPM, for testing at 40 percent speed, the average measured RPM should be between 19 RPM and 21 RPM. If the average measured RPM falls outside of this tolerance, adjust the ceiling fan speed and repeat the test. Calculate the airflow and measure the active (real) power consumption in all phases simultaneously in accordance with the test requirements specified in Sections 8 and 9, AMCA 230-15, with the following modifications:
3.5.1. Measure active (real) power consumption in all phases simultaneously at a point that includes all power-consuming components of the ceiling fan. If present, any additional accessories or features sold with the ceiling fan that do not relate to the ceiling fan's ability to create airflow by rotation of the fan blades (for example light kit, heater, air ionization, ultraviolet technology) are to be installed but turned off during testing. If the accessory/feature cannot be turned off, it shall be set to the lowest energy-consuming mode during testing. If the ceiling fan is offered with a default controller, test using the default controller. If multiple controllers are offered, test using the minimally functional controller.
3.5.2. Measure active (real) power consumption in all phases simultaneously continuously at the rated voltage that represents normal operation over the time period for which the load differential test is conducted.
3.6.
Test measurement for standby power consumption.
(1) Measure standby power consumption if the ceiling fan offers one or more of the following user-oriented or protective functions:
(a) The ability to facilitate the activation or deactivation of other functions (including active mode) by remote switch (including remote control), internal sensor, or timer.
(b) Continuous functions, including information or status displays (including clocks), or sensor-based functions.
(2) Measure standby power consumption after completion of active mode testing and after the active mode functionality has been switched off (
i.e.,
the rotation of the ceiling fan blades is no longer energized). The ceiling fan must remain connected to the main power supply and be in the same configuration as in active mode (
i.e.,
any ceiling fan light fixture should still be attached). Measure standby power consumption according to Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.4, and 5.3.1 through 5.3.2, of IEC 62301 with the following modifications:
3.6.1. Allow 3 minutes between switching off active mode functionality and beginning the standby power test. (No additional time before measurement is required.)
3.6.2. Simultaneously in all phases, measure active (real) power consumption continuously for 100 seconds, and record the average value of the standby power measurement in watts (W).
3.6.3. Determine power consumption according to section 5.3.2 of IEC 62301, or by using the following average reading method. Note that a shorter measurement period may be possible using the sample method in section 5.3.2 of IEC 62301.
(1) Connect the product to the power supply and power measuring instrument.
(2) Select the mode to be measured (which may require a sequence of operations and could require waiting for the product to automatically enter the desired mode) and then monitor the power.
(3) Calculate the average power using either the average power method or the accumulated energy method. For the average power method, where the power measuring instrument can record true average power over an operator selected period, the average power is taken directly from the power measuring instrument. For the accumulated energy method, determine the average power by dividing the measured energy by the time for the monitoring period. Use units of watt-hours and hours for both methods to determine average power in watts.

Calculation of Ceiling Fan Efficiency From the Test Results:
4.1. Calculation of effective area for small-diameter ceiling fans other than high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans:
Calculate the effective area corresponding to each sensor used in the test method for small-diameter ceiling fans other than high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans (section 3.3 of this appendix) with the following equations:
(1) For sensor 1, the sensor located directly underneath the center of the ceiling fan, the effective width of the circle is 2 inches, and the effective area is:
ER16AU22.011
(2) For the sensors between sensor 1 and the last sensor used in the measurement, the effective area has a width of 4 inches. If a sensor is a distance
d,
in inches, from sensor 1, then the effective area is:
ER16AU22.012
(3) For the last sensor, the width of the effective area depends on the horizontal displacement between the last sensor and the point on the ceiling fan blades furthest radially from the center of the fan. The total area included in an airflow calculation is the area of a circle 8 inches larger in diameter than the ceiling fan blade span (as specified in section 3 of this appendix).
Therefore, for example, for a 42-inch ceiling fan, the last sensor is 3 inches beyond the end of the ceiling fan blades. Because only the area within 4 inches of the end of the ceiling fan blades is included in the airflow calculation, the effective width of the circle corresponding to the last sensor would be 3 inches. The calculation for the effective area corresponding to the last sensor would then be:
ER16AU22.013
For a 46-inch ceiling fan, the effective area of the last sensor would have a width of 5 inches, and the effective area would be:
ER16AU22.014
4.2 Calculation of airflow and efficiency for small-diameter ceiling fans other than high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans:
Calculate fan airflow using the overall average of both sets of air velocity measurements at each sensor position from the successive sets of measurements that meet the stability criteria from section 3.3 of this appendix. To calculate airflow for HSSD, LSSD, and VSD ceiling fans, multiply the overall average air velocity at each sensor position from section 3.3 (for high speed for HSSD, LSSD, and VSD ceiling fans that also meet the definition of an LSSD ceiling fan; and repeated for low speed only for LSSD and VSD ceiling fans that also meet the definition of an LSSD ceiling fan) by that sensor's effective area (see section 4.1 of this appendix), and then sum the products to obtain the overall calculated airflow at the tested speed.
For each speed, using the overall calculated airflow and the overall average power consumption measurements from the successive sets of measurements as follows:
ER16AU22.015
Where:

Calculate two ceiling fan efficiencies for multi-mount ceiling fans: One efficiency corresponds to the ceiling fan mounted in the configuration associated with the definition of a hugger ceiling fan, and the other efficiency corresponds to the ceiling fan mounted in the configuration associated with the definition of a standard ceiling fan.

4.3 Calculation of airflow and efficiency for multi-head ceiling fans:
Calculate airflow for each fan head using the method described in section 4.2 of this appendix. To calculate overall airflow at a given speed for a multi-head ceiling fan, sum the airflow for each fan head included in the ceiling fan (a single airflow can be applied to each of the identical fan heads, but at least one of each unique fan head must be tested). The power consumption is the measured power consumption with all fan heads on. Using the airflow as described in this section, and power consumption measurements from section 3.3 of this appendix, calculate ceiling fan efficiency for a multi-head ceiling fan as follows:
ER16AU22.016
Where:

Calculation of Ceiling Fan Energy Index (CFEI) From the Test Results for Large Diameter Ceiling Fan and High-Speed Belt-Driven Ceiling Fans:
Calculate CFEI, which is the FEI for large-diameter ceiling fans and high-speed belt-driven ceiling fans, at the speeds specified in section 3.5 of this appendix according to AMCA 208-18, with the following modifications:
(1) Using an Airflow Constant (Q

# 1. Scope
This appendix establishes the test requirements to measure the energy efficiency of all ceiling fan light kits (CFLKs) packaged with fluorescent lamps other than compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) or general service fluorescent lamps (GSFLs), packaged with consumer-replaceable solid-state lighting (SSL) (not integrated light-emitting diode [LED] lamps), packaged with non-consumer-replaceable SSL, or packaged with SSL lamps that have an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard base (not integrated LED lamps).

# 2. Definitions
2.1.
CFLK with non-consumer-replaceable SSL
means a CFLK with a non-ANSI-standard base that has an SSL light source, driver, heat sink, and intermediate circuitry (such as wiring between a driver and a light source) that are not consumer replaceable,
i.e.,
a consumer cannot replace the light source and all components necessary for the starting and stable operation of the light source, without permanently altering the product and must replace the entire CFLK upon failure. Permanently altering the product constitutes the cutting of wires, use of a soldering iron, or damage to or destruction of the CFLK and does not constitute connecting or disconnecting wire nuts, fasteners or screws, or preserving the CFLK as it was sold.
2.2.
CFLK with consumer-replaceable SSL
means a CFLK with a non-ANSI-standard base that has an SSL light source, driver, heat sink, and intermediate circuitry (such as wiring between a driver and light source) that are consumer replaceable,
i.e.,
a consumer can replace the light source and all components necessary for the starting and stable operation of the light source, without permanently altering the product. Permanently altering the product constitutes the cutting of wires, use of a soldering iron, or damage to or destruction of the CFLK and does not constitute connecting or disconnecting wire nuts, fasteners or screws, or preserving the CFLK as it was sold.
2.3.
Covers
means materials used to diffuse or redirect light produced by an SSL light source in CFLKs with non-consumer-replaceable SSL.
2.4.
Other (non-CFL and non-GSFL) fluorescent lamp
means a low-pressure mercury electric-discharge lamp in which a fluorescing coating transforms some of the ultraviolet energy generated by the mercury discharge into light, including but not limited to circline fluorescent lamps, and excluding any compact fluorescent lamp and any general service fluorescent lamp.
2.5.
Solid-State Lighting (SSL)
means technology where light is emitted from a solid object—a block of semiconductor—rather than from a filament or plasma, as in the case of incandescent and fluorescent lighting. This includes inorganic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).

# 3. Test Conditions and Measurements
For any CFLK that utilizes consumer replaceable lamps or consumer-replaceable SSL, measure the lamp efficacy of each basic
model of lamp or SSL light source packaged with the CFLK. For any CFLK only with non-consumer-replaceable SSL, measure the luminaire efficacy of the CFLK. For any CFLK that includes consumer replaceable lamps or consumer-replaceable SSL and non-consumer-replaceable SSL, measure both the lamp efficacy of each basic model of lamp or consumer-replaceable SSL light source packaged with the CFLK and the luminaire efficacy of the CFLK with all consumer replaceable lamps or consumer-replaceable SSL light sources removed. Take measurements at full light output. For each test, use the test procedures in the table in this section. CFLKs with non-consumer-replaceable SSL and consumer replaceable covers may be measured with their covers removed but must otherwise be measured according to the table in this section.

3. Active Mode Test Procedures
3.1. General Instructions.
3.1.1. In cases where there is a conflict, the language of the test procedure in this appendix takes precedence over any materials incorporated by reference.
3.1.2. Maintain lamp operating orientation throughout seasoning and testing, including storage and handling between tests.
3.1.3. Season CFLs prior to photometric and electrical testing in accordance with sections 4, 5, 6.1, and 6.2.2.1 of IES LM-54-12 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3). Season the CFL for a minimum of 100 hours in accordance with section 6.2.2.1 of IES LM-54-12. During the 100 hour seasoning period, cycle the CFL (operate the lamps for 180 minutes, 20 minutes off) as specified in section 6.4 of IES LM-65-14 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3).
3.1.3.1. Unit operating time during seasoning may be counted toward time to failure, lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime of a compact fluorescent lamp (as defined in § 430.2), and lumen maintenance at 1,000 hours if the required operating cycle and test conditions for time to failure testing per section 3.3.1 of this appendix are satisfied.
3.1.3.2. If a lamp breaks, becomes defective, fails to stabilize, exhibits abnormal behavior (such as swirling), or stops producing light prior to the end of the seasoning period, the lamp must be replaced with a new unit. If a lamp exhibits one of the conditions listed in the previous sentence after the seasoning period, the lamp's measurements must be included in the sample. Record number of lamps replaced, if any.
3.1.4. Conduct all testing with the lamp operating at labeled wattage. This requirement applies to all CFLs, including those that are dimmable or multi-level.
3.1.5. Operate the CFL at the rated input voltage throughout testing. For a CFL with multiple rated input voltages including 120 volts, operate the CFL at 120 volts. If a CFL with multiple rated input voltages is not rated for 120 volts, operate the CFL at the highest rated input voltage.
3.1.6. Test CFLs packaged with ballasted adapters or designed exclusively for use with ballasted adapters as non-integrated CFLs, with no ballasted adapter in the circuit.
3.1.7. Conduct all testing of hybrid CFLs with all supplemental light sources in the lamp turned off, if possible. Before taking measurements, verify that the lamp has stabilized in the operating mode that corresponds to its primary light source.
3.2. Test Procedures for Determining Initial Lamp Efficacy, Lumen Maintenance, CCT, CRI, and Power Factor.
Determine initial lamp efficacy, lumen maintenance at 40 percent of lifetime of a compact fluorescent lamp (as defined in in § 430.2), CCT, and CRI for integrated and non-
integrated CFLs. Determine lumen maintenance at 1,000 hours and power factor for integrated CFLs only.
3.2.1. Test Conditions and Setup
3.2.1.1. Test half of the units in the sample in the base up position, and half of the units in the base down position; if the position is restricted by the manufacturer, test the units in the manufacturer-specified position.

Establish ambient conditions, power supply, auxiliary equipment, circuit setup, lamp connections, and instrumentation in accordance with the specifications in sections (and corresponding subsections) 4.0, 5.0 and 6.0 of IES LM-66-14 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3), except maintain ambient temperature at 25 ± 1 °C (77 ± 1.8 °F).
3.2.1.3. Non-integrated CFLs must adhere to the reference ballast requirements in section 5.2 of IES LM-66 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3).
3.2.1.3.1. Test non-integrated lamps rated for operation on and having reference ballast characteristics for either low frequency or high frequency circuits (
e.g.,
many preheat start lamps) at low frequency.
3.2.1.3.2. For low frequency operation, test non-integrated lamps rated for operation on either preheat start (starter) or rapid start (no starter) circuits on preheat.
3.2.1.3.3. Operate non-integrated CFLs not listed in ANSI C78.901-2014 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3) using the following reference ballast settings:

# 2. Definitions
Definitions for terms, modes, calculations, etc. are in accordance with AHAM DH-1-2022, section 3, with the following added definitions:
Energy factor for dehumidifiers
means a measure of energy efficiency of a dehumidifier calculated by dividing the water removed from the air by the energy consumed, measured in liters per kilowatt-hour (L/kWh).
External static pressure (ESP)
means the process air outlet static pressure minus the process air inlet static pressure, measured in inches of water column (in. w.c.).

# 3. Test Apparatus and General Instructions
3.1
Active mode.
3.1.1
Portable dehumidifiers and whole-home dehumidifiers other than refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers.
The test apparatus and instructions for testing in dehumidification mode and off-cycle mode must conform to the requirements specified in Section 4, “Instrumentation,” section 5.1, “General,” section 5.2, “Test Room,” Section 5.3, “Positioning of Test Unit,” and section 5.5, “Control settings” of AHAM DH-1-2022, with the following exceptions. If a product is able to operate as either a portable or whole-home dehumidifier by means of removal or installation of an optional ducting kit, in accordance with any manufacturer instructions available to a consumer, test and rate both configurations.
3.1.1.1
Testing configuration for whole-home dehumidifiers other than refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers.
Test dehumidifiers, other than refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers, with ducting attached to the process air outlet port. The duct configuration and component placement must conform to the requirements specified in section 3.1.3 of this appendix and Figure 1 or Figure 3, except that the flow straightener and dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity instruments are not required. Maintain the external static pressure in the process air flow and measure the external static pressure as specified in section 3.1.2.2.3.1 of this appendix.
3.1.1.2
Instrumentation placement.
If using a sampling tree, follow the instrumentation placement instructions in sections 5.3 and 8.4 of AHAM DH-1-2022. If not using a sampling tree, place the aspirating psychrometer or relative humidity and dry-bulb temperature sensors perpendicular to, and 1 ft. in front of, the center of the process air intake grille. During each test, use the psychrometer or relative humidity and dry-bulb sensors to monitor inlet conditions of only one unit under test. When using relative humidity and dry-bulb temperature sensors without sampling trees to test a unit that has multiple process air intake grilles, place a relative humidity sensor and dry-bulb temperature sensor perpendicular to, and 1 ft. in front of, the center of each process air intake grille.
3.1.1.3
Condensate collection.
If means are provided on the dehumidifier for draining condensate away from the cabinet, collect the condensate in a substantially closed vessel to prevent re-evaporation and place the
vessel on the weight-measuring instrument. If no means for draining condensate away from the cabinet are provided, disable any automatic shutoff of dehumidification mode operation that is activated when the collection container is full and collect any overflow in a pan. Select a collection pan large enough to ensure that all water that overflows from the full internal collection container during the rating test period is captured by the collection pan. Cover the pan as much as possible to prevent re-evaporation without impeding the collection of overflow water. Place both the dehumidifier and the overflow pan on the weight-measuring instrument for direct reading of the condensate weight collected during the rating test. Do not use any internal pump to drain the condensate into a substantially closed vessel unless such pump operation is provided for by default in dehumidification mode.
3.1.1.4
Control settings.
Follow the control settings instructions in section 5.5 of AHAM DH-1-2022.
3.1.1.5
Run-in period.
Perform a single run-in period during which the compressor operates for a cumulative total of at least 24 hours prior to dehumidification mode testing.
3.1.2
Refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers.
The test apparatus and instructions for testing refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers in dehumidification mode must conform to the requirements specified in section 3, “Definitions,” section 4, “Instrumentation,” and section 5.1, “General,” section 5.2, “Test Room,” and section 5.5, “Control settings,” of AHAM DH-1-2022, except as follows.
3.1.2.1
Testing configuration.
Test refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers with ducting attached to the process air inlet and outlet ports and the reactivation air inlet port. The duct configuration and components must conform to the requirements specified in section 3.1.3 of this appendix and Figure 1 through Figure 3. Install a cell-type airflow straightener that conforms to the specifications in Section 5.2.1.6, “Airflow straightener”, and Figure 6A, “Flow Straightener—Cell Type”, of ANSI/AMCA 210 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) in each duct consistent with Figure 1 through Figure 3.
3.1.2.2
Instrumentation.
3.1.2.2.1

Measure relative humidity with a duct-mounted, relative humidity sensor with an accuracy within ±1 percent relative humidity. Place the relative humidity sensor at the duct centerline within 1 inch of the dry-bulb temperature grid plane.
3.1.2.2.3
Pressure.
The pressure instruments used to measure the external static pressure and velocity pressures must have an accuracy within ±0.01 in. w.c. and a resolution of no more than 0.01 in. w.c.
3.1.2.2.3.1 External static pressure.
Measure static pressures in each duct using pitot-static tube traverses, a flow nozzle or a bank of flow nozzles. For pitot-static tube traverses, conform to the specifications in section 4.3.1, “Pitot Traverse,” of ANSI/AMCA 210 and section 4.2.2, “Pitot-Static Tube,” of ANSI/AMCA 210, except use only two intersecting and perpendicular rows of pitot-static tube traverses. For a flow nozzle or bank of flow nozzles, conform to the specifications in section 4.3.2, “Flow nozzle,” of ANSI/AMCA 210 and section 4.2.3, “Static pressure tap” of ANSI/AMCA 210. Record the static pressure within the test duct as follows. When using pitot-static tube traverses, record the pressure as measured at the pressure tap in the manifold of the traverses that averages the individual static pressures at each pitot-static tube. When using a flow nozzle or bank of nozzles, record the pressure or in accordance with section 4.2.3.2, “Averaging,” of ANSI/AMCA 210. Calculate duct pressure losses between the unit under test and the plane of each static pressure measurement in accordance with section 7.5.2, “Pressure Losses,” of ANSI/AMCA 210. The external static pressure is the difference between the measured inlet and outlet static pressure measurements, minus the sum of the inlet and outlet duct pressure losses. For any port with no duct attached, use a static pressure of 0.00 in. w.c. with no duct pressure loss in the calculation of external static pressure. During dehumidification mode testing, the external static pressure must equal 0.20 in. w.c. ± 0.02 in. w.c.
3.1.2.2.3.2 Velocity pressure.
Measure velocity pressures using the same pitot traverses or nozzles as used for measuring external static pressure, which are specified in section 3.1.2.2.3.1 of this appendix. When using pitot-static tube traverses, determine velocity pressures at each pitot-static tube in a traverse as the difference between the pressure at the impact pressure tap and the pressure at the static pressure tap and calculate volumetric flow rates in each duct in accordance with section 7.3.1, “Velocity Traverse,” of ANSI/AMCA 210. When using a flow nozzle or a bank of flow nozzles, calculate the volumetric flow rates in each duct in accordance with section 7.3.2, “Nozzle,” of ANSI/AMCA 210.
3.1.2.2.4
Weight.
No weight-measuring instruments are required.
3.1.2.3
Control settings.
Follow the control settings instructions in section 5.5 of AHAM DH-1-2022.
3.1.2.4
Run-in period.
Perform a single run-in period during which the compressor operates for a cumulative total of at least 24 hours prior to dehumidification mode testing.
3.1.3
Ducting for whole-home dehumidifiers.
Cover and seal with tape any port designed for intake of air from outside or unconditioned space, other than for supplying reactivation air for refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifiers. Use only ducting constructed of galvanized mild steel and with a 10-inch diameter. Position inlet and outlet ducts either horizontally or vertically to accommodate the default dehumidifier port orientation. Install all ducts with the axis of the section interfacing with the dehumidifier perpendicular to plane of the collar to which each is attached. If manufacturer-recommended collars do not measure 10 inches in diameter, use transitional pieces to connect the ducts to the collars. The transitional pieces must not contain any converging element that forms an angle with the duct axis greater than 7.5 degrees or a diverging element that forms an angle with the duct axis greater than 3.5 degrees. Install mechanical throttling devices in each outlet duct consistent with Figure 1 and Figure 3 to adjust the external static pressure and in the inlet reactivation air duct for a refrigerant-desiccant dehumidifier.

This appendix does not provide a method for testing back-up battery chargers.

# 2. Definitions
The following definitions are for the purposes of explaining the terminology associated with the test method for measuring battery charger energy consumption.
1
1
For clarity on any other terminology used in the test method, please refer to IEEE Standard 1515-2000.
2.1.
Active mode
or
charge mode
is the state in which the battery charger system is connected to the main electricity supply, and the battery charger is delivering current, equalizing the cells, and performing other one-time or limited-time functions in order to bring the battery to a fully charged state.
2.2.
Active power
or
real power
(P) means the average power consumed by a unit. For a two terminal device with current and voltage waveforms i(t) and v(t), which are periodic with period T, the real or active power P is:
ER01JN11.020
2.3.
Ambient temperature
is the temperature of the ambient air immediately surrounding the unit under test.
2.4.
Apparent power
(S) is the product of root-mean-square (RMS) voltage and RMS current in volt-amperes (VA).
2.5.
Batch charger
is a battery charger that charges two or more identical batteries simultaneously in a series, parallel, series-parallel, or parallel-series configuration. A batch charger does not have separate voltage or current regulation, nor does it have any separate indicators for each battery in the batch. When testing a batch charger, the term “battery” is understood to mean, collectively, all the batteries in the batch that are charged together. A charger can be both a batch charger and a multi-port charger or multi-voltage charger.
2.6.
Battery
or
battery pack
is an assembly of one or more rechargeable cells and any integral protective circuitry intended to provide electrical energy to a consumer product, and may be in one of the following forms: (a) Detachable battery (a battery that is contained in a separate enclosure from the consumer product and is intended to be removed or disconnected from the consumer product for recharging); or (b) integral battery (a battery that is contained within the consumer product and is not removed from the consumer product for charging purposes). The word “intended” in this context refers to the whether a battery has been designed in such a way as to permit its removal or disconnection from its associated consumer product.
2.7.
Battery energy
is the energy, in watt-hours, delivered by the battery under the specified discharge conditions in the test procedure.
2.8.
Battery maintenance mode
or
maintenance mode
is the mode of operation when the battery charger is connected to the main electricity supply and the battery is fully charged, but is still connected to the charger.
2.9.
Battery rest period
is a period of time between discharge and charge or between charge and discharge, during which the battery is resting in an open-circuit state in ambient air.
2.10.
C-Rate (C)
is the rate of charge or discharge, calculated by dividing the charge or discharge current by the nameplate battery charge capacity of the battery. For example, a 0.2 C-rate would result in a charge or discharge period of 5 hours.
2.11.
Cradle
is an electrical interface between an integral battery product and the rest of the battery charger designed to hold the product between uses.
2.12.
Energy storage system
is a system consisting of single or multiple devices designed to provide power to the UPS inverter circuitry.
2.13.
Equalization
is a process whereby a battery is overcharged, beyond what would be considered “normal” charge return, so that cells can be balanced, electrolyte mixed, and plate sulfation removed.
2.14.
Instructions
or
manufacturer's instructions
means the documentation packaged with a product in printed or electronic form and any information about the product listed on a Web site maintained by the manufacturer and accessible by the general public at the time of the test. It also includes any information on the packaging or on the product itself. “Instructions” also includes any service manuals or data sheets that the manufacturer offers to independent service technicians, whether printed or in electronic form.
2.15.
Measured charge capacity
of a battery is the product of the discharge current in amperes and the time in decimal hours required to reach the specified end-of-discharge voltage.
2.16.
Manual on-off switch
is a switch activated by the user to control power reaching the battery charger. This term does not apply to any mechanical, optical, or electronic switches that automatically disconnect mains power from the battery charger when a battery is removed from a cradle or charging base, or for products with non-detachable batteries that control power to the product itself.
2.17.
Multi-port charger
means a battery charger that charges two or more batteries (which may be identical or different) simultaneously. The batteries are not connected in series or in parallel but with each port having separate voltage and/or current regulation. If the charger has status indicators, each port has its own indicator(s). A charger can be both a batch charger and a multi-port charger if it is capable of charging two or more batches of batteries simultaneously and each batch has separate regulation and/or indicator(s).
2.18.
Multi-voltage charger
is a battery charger that, by design, can charge a variety of batteries (or batches of batteries, if also a batch charger) that are of different nameplate battery voltages. A multi-voltage charger can also be a multi-port charger if it can charge two or more batteries simultaneously with independent voltages and/or current regulation.
2.19.
Normal mode
is a mode of operation for a UPS in which:
(1) The AC input supply is within required tolerances and supplies the UPS,
(2) The energy storage system is being maintained at full charge or is under recharge, and
(3) The load connected to the UPS is within the UPS's specified power rating.
2.20.
Off mode
is the condition, applicable only to units with manual on-off switches, in which the battery charger:
(1) Is connected to the main electricity supply;
(2) Is not connected to the battery; and
(3) All manual on-off switches are turned off.
2.21.
Nameplate battery voltage
is specified by the battery manufacturer and typically printed on the label of the battery itself. If there are multiple batteries that are connected in series, the nameplate battery voltage of the batteries is the total voltage of the series configuration—that is, the nameplate voltage of each battery multiplied by the number of batteries connected in series. Connecting multiple batteries in parallel does not affect the nameplate battery voltage.
2.22.
Nameplate battery charge capacity
is the capacity, claimed by the battery manufacturer on a label or in instructions, that the battery can store, usually given in ampere-hours (Ah) or milliampere-hours (mAh) and typically printed on the label of the battery itself. If there are multiple batteries that are connected in parallel, the nameplate battery charge capacity of the batteries is the total charge capacity of the parallel configuration, that is, the nameplate charge capacity of each battery multiplied by the number of batteries connected in parallel. Connecting multiple batteries in series does not affect the nameplate charge capacity.
2.23.
Nameplate battery energy capacity
means the product (in watts-hours (Wh)) of the nameplate battery voltage and the nameplate battery charge capacity.
2.24.
Reference test load
is a load or a condition with a power factor of greater than 0.99 in which the AC output socket of the UPS delivers the active power (W) for which the UPS is rated.
2.25.
Standby mode
or
no-battery mode
means the condition in which:
(1) The battery charger is connected to the main electricity supply;
(2) The battery is not connected to the charger; and
(3) For battery chargers with manual on-off switches, all such switches are turned on.
2.26.
Total harmonic distortion (THD),
expressed as a percent, is as defined in section 3.5.9 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 3.0.
2.27.
Uninterruptible power supply or UPS
means a battery charger consisting of a combination of convertors, switches and energy storage devices (such as batteries), constituting a power system for maintaining continuity of load power in case of AC input power failure.
2.27.1.
Voltage and frequency dependent UPS or VFD UPS
means a UPS that protects the load from a complete loss of AC input power. The output of a VFD UPS is dependent on changes in voltage and frequency of the AC input power and is not intended to provide additional voltage corrective functions, such as those arising from the use of tapped transformers.
Note to 2.27.1:
VFD input dependency may be verified by performing the AC input failure test in section 6.2.2.7 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 3.0 and observing that, at a minimum, the UPS switches from normal mode of operation to battery power while the input is interrupted.
2.27.2.
Voltage and frequency independent UPS or VFI UPS
means a UPS that is independent of AC input power voltage and frequency variations as specified and declared in section 5.2 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 3.0 and shall protect the load against adverse effects from such variations without discharging the energy storage device.
Note to 2.27.2:
VFI input dependency may be verified by performing the combined input voltage/frequency tolerance and VFI input independency test in section 6.4.1.3 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 3.0 respectively and observing that, at a minimum, the UPS produces an output voltage and frequency within the specified output range when the input voltage is varied by ±10% of the rated input voltage and the input frequency is varied by ±2% of the rated input frequency.
2.27.3.
Voltage independent UPS or VI UPS
means a UPS that protects the load as required for VFD and also from (a) under-voltage applied continuously to the input, and (b) over-voltage applied continuously to the input. The output voltage of a VI UPS shall remain within declared voltage limits (provided by voltage corrective functions, such as those arising from the use of active and/or passive circuits). The output voltage tolerance band shall be narrower than the input voltage tolerance band.
Note to 2.27.3:
VI input dependency may be verified by performing the steady state input voltage tolerance test in section 6.4.1.2 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 3.0 and ensuring that the UPS remains in normal mode with the output voltage within the specified output range when the input voltage is varied by ±10% of the rated input voltage.

# 3.1.2. Verifying Accuracy and Precision of Measuring Equipment
Any power measurement equipment utilized for testing must conform to the uncertainty and resolution requirements outlined in section 4, “General conditions for measurement”, as well as annexes B, “Notes on the measurement of low power modes”, and D, “Determination of uncertainty of measurement”, of IEC 62301 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3).

# 3.1.3. Setting Up the Test Room
All tests, battery conditioning, and battery rest periods shall be carried out in a room with an air speed immediately surrounding the UUT of ≤0.5 m/s. The ambient temperature shall be maintained at 20 °C ± 5 °C throughout the test. There shall be no intentional cooling of the UUT such as by use of separately powered fans, air conditioners, or heat sinks. The UUT shall be conditioned, rested, and tested on a thermally non-conductive surface. When not undergoing active testing, batteries shall be stored at 20 °C ± 5 °C.

# 3.1.4. Verifying the UUT's Input Voltage and Input Frequency
(a) If the UUT is intended for operation on AC line-voltage input in the United States, it shall be tested at 115 V at 60 Hz. If the UUT is intended for operation on AC line-voltage input but cannot be operated at 115 V at 60 Hz, it shall not be tested.
(b) If a charger is powered by a low-voltage DC or AC input, and the manufacturer packages the charger with an external power supply (“EPS”), sells, or recommends an optional EPS capable of providing that low voltage input, then the charger shall be tested using that EPS and the input reference source shall be 115 V at 60 Hz. If the EPS cannot be operated with AC input voltage at 115 V at 60 Hz, the charger shall not be tested.
(c) If the UUT is designed for operation only on DC input voltage and the provisions of section 3.1.4(b) of this appendix do not apply, it shall be tested with one of the following input voltages: 5.0 V DC for products drawing power from a computer USB port or the midpoint of the rated input voltage range for all other products. The input voltage shall be within ±1 percent of the above specified voltage.
(d) If the input voltage is AC, the input frequency shall be within ±1 percent of the specified frequency. The THD of the input voltage shall be ≤2 percent, up to and including the 13th harmonic. The crest factor of the input voltage shall be between 1.34 and 1.49.
(e) If the input voltage is DC, the AC ripple voltage (RMS) shall be:
(1) ≤0.2 V for DC voltages up to 10 V; or
(2) ≤2 percent of the DC voltage for DC voltages over 10 V.

# 3.2. Unit Under Test Setup Requirements

# 3.2.1. General Setup
(a) The battery charger system shall be prepared and set up in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, except where those instructions conflict with the requirements of this test procedure. If no instructions are given, then factory or “default” settings shall be used, or where there are no indications of such settings, the UUT shall be tested in the condition as it would be supplied to an end user.
(b) If the battery charger has user controls to select from two or more charge rates (such as regular or fast charge) or different charge currents, the test shall be conducted at the fastest charge rate that is recommended by the manufacturer for everyday use, or, failing any explicit recommendation, the factory-default charge rate. If the charger has user controls for selecting special charge cycles that are recommended only for occasional use to preserve battery health, such as equalization charge, removing memory, or battery conditioning, these modes are not required to be tested. The settings of the controls shall be listed in the report for each test.

# 3.2.2. Selection and Treatment of the Battery Charger
The UUT, including the battery charger and its associated battery, shall be new products of the type and condition that would be sold to a customer. If the battery is lead-acid chemistry and the battery is to be stored for more than 24 hours between its initial acquisition and testing, the battery shall be charged before such storage.

# 3.2.3. Selection of Batteries To Use for Testing
(a) For chargers with integral batteries, the battery packaged with the charger shall be used for testing. For chargers with detachable batteries, the battery or batteries to be used for testing will vary depending on
whether there are any batteries packaged with the battery charger.
(1) If batteries are packaged with the charger, batteries for testing shall be selected from the batteries packaged with the battery charger, according to the procedure in section 3.2.3(b) of this appendix.
(2) If no batteries are packaged with the charger, but the instructions specify or recommend batteries for use with the charger, batteries for testing shall be selected from those recommended or specified in the instructions, according to the procedure in section 3.2.3(b) of this appendix.
(3) If no batteries are packaged with the charger and the instructions do not specify or recommend batteries for use with the charger, batteries for testing shall be selected from any that are suitable for use with the charger, according to the procedure in section 3.2.3(b) of this appendix.
(b)(1) From the detachable batteries specified above, use Table 3.2.1 of this appendix to select the batteries to be used for testing, depending on the type of battery charger being tested. The battery charger types represented by the rows in the table are mutually exclusive. Find the single applicable row for the UUT, and test according to those requirements. Select only the single battery configuration specified for the battery charger type in Table 3.2.1 of this appendix.
(2) If the battery selection criteria specified in Table 3.2.1 of this appendix results in two or more batteries or configurations of batteries of different chemistries, but with equal voltage and capacity ratings, determine the maintenance mode power, as specified in section 3.3.9 of this appendix, for each of the batteries or configurations of batteries, and select for testing the battery or configuration of batteries with the highest maintenance mode power.
(c) A charger is considered as:
(1) Single-capacity if all associated batteries have the same nameplate battery charge capacity (see definition) and, if it is a batch charger, all configurations of the batteries have the same nameplate battery charge capacity.
(2) Multi-capacity if there are associated batteries or configurations of batteries that have different nameplate battery charge capacities.
(d) The selected battery or batteries will be referred to as the “test battery” and will be used through the remainder of this test procedure.

# 3.2.4. Limiting Other Non-Battery-Charger Functions
(a) If the battery charger or product containing the battery charger does not have any additional functions unrelated to battery charging, this subsection may be skipped.
(b) Any optional functions controlled by the user and not associated with the battery charging process (
e.g.,
the answering machine in a cordless telephone charging base) shall be switched off. If it is not possible to switch such functions off, they shall be set to their lowest power-consuming mode during the test.
(c) If the battery charger takes any physically separate connectors or cables not required for battery charging but associated with its other functionality (such as phone lines, serial or USB connections, Ethernet, cable TV lines,
etc.
), these connectors or cables shall be left disconnected during the testing.
(d) Any manual on-off switches specifically associated with the battery charging process shall be switched on for the duration of the charge, maintenance, and no-battery mode tests, and switched off for the off mode test.

# 3.2.5. Accessing the Battery for the Test
(a) The technician may need to disassemble the end-use product or battery charger to gain access to the battery terminals for the Battery Discharge Energy Test in section 3.3.8 of this appendix. If the battery terminals are not clearly labeled, the technician shall use a voltmeter to identify the positive and negative terminals. These
terminals will be the ones that give the largest voltage difference and are able to deliver significant current (0.2 C or 1/hr) into a load.
(b) All conductors used for contacting the battery must be cleaned and burnished prior to connecting in order to decrease voltage drops and achieve consistent results.
(c) Manufacturer's instructions for disassembly shall be followed, except those instructions that:
(1) Lead to any permanent alteration of the battery charger circuitry or function;
(2) Could alter the energy consumption of the battery charger compared to that experienced by a user during typical use,
e.g.,
due to changes in the airflow through the enclosure of the UUT; or
(3) Conflict requirements of this test procedure.
(d) Care shall be taken by the technician during disassembly to follow appropriate safety precautions. If the functionality of the device or its safety features is compromised, the product shall be discarded after testing.
(e) Some products may include protective circuitry between the battery cells and the remainder of the device. If the manufacturer provides a description for accessing the connections at the output of the protective circuitry, these connections shall be used to discharge the battery and measure the discharge energy. The energy consumed by the protective circuitry during discharge shall not be measured or credited as battery energy.
(f) If any of the following conditions noted immediately below in sections 3.2.5.(f)(1) to 3.2.5.(f)(3) are applicable, preventing the measurement of the Battery Discharge Energy and the Charging and Maintenance Mode Energy, a manufacturer must submit a petition for a test procedure waiver in accordance with § 430.27:
(1) Inability to access the battery terminals;
(2) Access to the battery terminals destroys charger functionality; or
(3) Inability to draw current from the test battery.

# 3.2.6. Determining Charge Capacity for Batteries With No Rating
(a) If there is no rating for the battery charge capacity on the battery or in the instructions, then the technician shall determine a discharge current that meets the following requirements. The battery shall be fully charged and then discharged at this constant-current rate until it reaches the end-of-discharge voltage specified in Table 3.3.2 of this appendix. The discharge time must be not less than 4.5 hours nor more than 5 hours. In addition, the discharge test (section 3.3.8 of this appendix) (which may not be starting with a fully-charged battery) shall reach the end-of-discharge voltage within 5 hours. The same discharge current shall be used for both the preparations step (section 3.3.4 of this appendix) and the discharge test (section 3.3.8 of this appendix). The test report shall include the discharge current used and the resulting discharge times for both a fully-charged battery and for the discharge test.
(b) For this section, the battery is considered as “fully charged” when either: it has been charged by the UUT until an indicator on the UUT shows that the charge is complete; or it has been charged by a battery analyzer at a current not greater than the discharge current until the battery analyzer indicates that the battery is fully charged.
(c) When there is no capacity rating, a suitable discharge current must generally be determined by trial and error. Since the conditioning step does not require constant-current discharges, the trials themselves may also be counted as part of battery conditioning.

# 3.3. Test Measurement
The test sequence to measure the battery charger energy consumption is summarized in Table 3.3.1 of this appendix, and explained in detail in this appendix. Measurements shall be made under test conditions and with the equipment specified in sections 3.1 and 3.2 of this appendix.

# 3.3.1. Recording General Data on the UUT
The technician shall record:
(a) The manufacturer and model of the battery charger;
(b) The presence and status of any additional functions unrelated to battery charging;
(c) The manufacturer, model, and number of batteries in the test battery;
(d) The nameplate battery voltage of the test battery;
(e) The nameplate battery charge capacity of the test battery; and
(f) The nameplate battery charge energy of the test battery.
(g) The settings of the controls, if battery charger has user controls to select from two or more charge rates.

# 3.3.2. Determining the Duration of the Charge and Maintenance Mode Test
(a) The charging and maintenance mode test, described in detail in section 3.3.6 of this appendix, shall be 24 hours in length or longer, as determined by the items below. Proceed in order until a test duration is determined.
(1) If the battery charger has an indicator to show that the battery is fully charged, that indicator shall be used as follows: If the indicator shows that the battery is charged after 19 hours of charging, the test shall be terminated at 24 hours. Conversely, if the full-charge indication is not yet present after 19 hours of charging, the test shall continue until 5 hours after the indication is present.
(2) If there is no indicator, but the manufacturer's instructions indicate that charging this battery or this capacity of battery should be complete within 19 hours, the test shall be for 24 hours. If the instructions indicate that charging may take longer than 19 hours, the test shall be run for the longest estimated charge time plus 5 hours.
(3) If there is no indicator and no time estimate in the instructions, but the charging current is stated on the charger or in the instructions, calculate the test duration as the longer of 24 hours or:
ER12DE16.027
(b) If none of the above applies, the duration of the test shall be 24 hours.

# 3.3.3. Battery Conditioning
(a) No conditioning is to be done on lithium-ion batteries. The test technician shall proceed directly to battery preparation, section 3.3.4 of this appendix, when testing chargers for these batteries.
(b) Products with integral batteries will have to be disassembled per the instructions in section 3.2.5 of this appendix, and the battery disconnected from the charger for discharging.
(c) Batteries of other chemistries that have not been previously cycled are to be conditioned by performing two charges and two discharges, followed by a charge, as below. No data need be recorded during battery conditioning.
(1) The test battery shall be fully charged for the duration specified in section 3.3.2 of this appendix or longer using the UUT.
(2) The test battery shall then be fully discharged using either:
(i) A battery analyzer at a rate not to exceed 1 C, until its average cell voltage under load reaches the end-of-discharge voltage specified in Table 3.3.2 of this appendix for the relevant battery chemistry; or
(ii) The UUT, until the UUT ceases operation due to low battery voltage.
(3) The test battery shall again be fully charged as in step (c)(1) of this section.
(4) The test battery shall again be fully discharged as per step (c)(2) of this section.
(5) The test battery shall be again fully charged as in step (c)(1) of this section.
(d) Batteries of chemistries, other than lithium-ion, that are known to have been through at least two previous full charge/discharge cycles shall only be charged once per step (c)(5), of this section.

# 3.3.4. Preparing the Battery for Charge Testing
Following any conditioning prior to beginning the battery charge test (section 3.3.6 of this appendix), the test battery shall be fully discharged to the end of discharge voltage prescribed in Table 3.3.2 of this appendix, or until the UUT circuitry terminates the discharge.

# 3.3.5. Resting the Battery
The test battery shall be rested between preparation and the battery charge test. The rest period shall be at least one hour and not exceed 24 hours. For batteries with flooded cells, the electrolyte temperature shall be less than 30 °C before charging, even if the rest period must be extended longer than 24 hours.

# 3.3.6. Testing Charge Mode and Battery Maintenance Mode
(a) The Charge and Battery Maintenance Mode test measures the energy consumed during charge mode and some time spent in the maintenance mode of the UUT. Functions required for battery conditioning that happen only with some user-selected switch or other control shall not be included in this measurement. (The technician shall manually turn off any battery conditioning cycle or setting.) Regularly occurring battery conditioning or maintenance functions that are not controlled by the user will, by default, be incorporated into this measurement.
(b) During the measurement period, input power values to the UUT shall be recorded at least once every minute.
(1) If possible, the technician shall set the data logging system to record the average power during the sample interval. The total energy is computed as the sum of power samples (in watts) multiplied by the sample interval (in hours).
(2) If this setting is not possible, then the power analyzer shall be set to integrate or accumulate the input power over the measurement period and this result shall be used as the total energy.
(c) The technician shall follow these steps:
(1) Ensure that the user-controllable device functionality not associated with battery charging and any battery conditioning cycle or setting are turned off, as instructed in section 3.2.4 of this appendix;
(2) Ensure that the test battery used in this test has been conditioned, prepared, discharged, and rested as described in sections 3.3.3 through 3.3.5 of this appendix;
(3) Connect the data logging equipment to the battery charger;
(4) Record the start time of the measurement period, and begin logging the input power;
(5) Connect the test battery to the battery charger within 3 minutes of beginning logging. For integral battery products, connect the product to a cradle or EPS within 3 minutes of beginning logging;
(6) After the test battery is connected, record the initial time and power (W) of the input current to the UUT. These measurements shall be taken within the first 10 minutes of active charging;
(7) Record the input power for the duration of the “Charging and Maintenance Mode Test” period, as determined by section 3.3.2 of this appendix. The actual time that power is connected to the UUT shall be within ±5 minutes of the specified period; and
(8) Disconnect power to the UUT, terminate data logging, and record the final time.

# 3.3.7. Resting the Battery
The test battery shall be rested between charging and discharging. The rest period shall be at least 1 hour and not more than 4 hours, with an exception for flooded cells. For batteries with flooded cells, the electrolyte temperature shall be less than 30 °C before charging, even if the rest period must be extended beyond 4 hours.

# 3.3.8. Battery Discharge Energy Test
(a) If multiple batteries were charged simultaneously, the discharge energy is the sum of the discharge energies of all the batteries.
(1) For a multi-port charger, batteries that were charged in separate ports shall be discharged independently.
(2) For a batch charger, batteries that were charged as a group may be discharged individually, as a group, or in sub-groups connected in series and/or parallel. The position of each battery with respect to the other batteries need not be maintained.
(b) During discharge, the battery voltage and discharge current shall be sampled and recorded at least once per minute. The values recorded may be average or instantaneous values.
(c) For this test, the technician shall follow these steps:
(1) Ensure that the test battery has been charged by the UUT and rested according to sections 3.3.6. and 3.3.7 of this appendix.
(2) Set the battery analyzer for a constant discharge rate and the end-of-discharge voltage in Table 3.3.2 of this appendix for the relevant battery chemistry.
(3) Connect the test battery to the analyzer and begin recording the voltage, current, and wattage, if available from the battery analyzer. When the end-of-discharge voltage is reached or the UUT circuitry terminates the discharge, the test battery shall be returned to an open-circuit condition. If current continues to be drawn from the test battery after the end-of-discharge condition is first reached, this additional energy is not to be counted in the battery discharge energy.
(d) If not available from the battery analyzer, the battery discharge energy (in watt-hours) is calculated by multiplying the voltage (in volts), current (in amperes), and sample period (in hours) for each sample, and then summing over all sample periods until the end-of-discharge voltage is reached.

# 3.3.9. Determining the Maintenance Mode Power
After the measurement period is complete, the technician shall determine the average maintenance mode power consumption by examining the power-versus-time data from the charge and maintenance test and:
(a) If the maintenance mode power is cyclic or shows periodic pulses, compute the average power over a time period that spans a whole number of cycles and includes at least the last 4 hours.
(b) Otherwise, calculate the average power value over the last 4 hours.

# 3.3.10. Determining the 24-Hour Energy Consumption
The accumulated energy or the average input power, integrated over the test period from the charge and maintenance mode test, shall be used to calculate 24-hour energy consumption.

# 3.3.11. Standby Mode Energy Consumption Measurement
The standby mode measurement depends on the configuration of the battery charger, as follows:
(a) Conduct a measurement of standby power consumption while the battery charger is connected to the power source. Disconnect the battery from the charger, allow the charger to operate for at least 30 minutes, and record the power (
i.e.,
watts) consumed as the time series integral of the power consumed over a 10-minute test period, divided by the period of measurement. If the battery charger has manual on-off switches, all must be turned on for the duration of the standby mode test.
(b) Standby mode may also apply to products with integral batteries, as follows:
(1) If the product uses a cradle and/or adapter for power conversion and charging, then “disconnecting the battery from the charger” will require disconnection of the end-use product, which contains the batteries. The other enclosures of the battery charging system will remain connected to the main electricity supply, and standby mode power consumption will equal that of the cradle and/or adapter alone.
(2) If the product is powered through a detachable AC power cord and contains integrated power conversion and charging circuitry, then only the cord will remain connected to mains, and standby mode power consumption will equal that of the AC power cord (
i.e.,
zero watts).
(3) If the product contains integrated power conversion and charging circuitry but is powered through a non-detachable AC power cord or plug blades, then no part of the system will remain connected to mains, and standby mode measurement is not applicable.

# 3.3.12. Off Mode Energy Consumption Measurement
The off mode measurement depends on the configuration of the battery charger, as follows:
(a) If the battery charger has manual on-off switches, record a measurement of off mode energy consumption while the battery charger is connected to the power source. Remove the battery from the charger, allow the charger to operate for at least 30 minutes, and record the power (
i.e.,
watts) consumed as the time series integral of the power consumed over a 10-minute test period, divided by the period of measurement, with all manual on-off switches turned off. If the battery charger does not have manual on-off switches, record that the off mode measurement is not applicable to this product.
(b) Off mode may also apply to products with integral batteries, as follows:
(1) If the product uses a cradle and/or adapter for power conversion and charging, then “disconnecting the battery from the charger” will require disconnection of the end-use product, which contains the batteries. The other enclosures of the battery charging system will remain connected to the main electricity supply, and off mode power consumption will equal that of the cradle and/or adapter alone.
(2) If the product is powered through a detachable AC power cord and contains integrated power conversion and charging circuitry, then only the cord will remain connected to mains, and off mode power consumption will equal that of the AC power cord (
i.e.,
zero watts).
(3) If the product contains integrated power conversion and charging circuitry but is powered through a non-detachable AC power cord or plug blades, then no part of the system will remain connected to mains, and off mode measurement is not applicable.

# 3.3.13. Unit Energy Consumption Calculation
Unit energy consumption (UEC) shall be calculated for a battery charger using one of the two equations (equation (i) or equation (ii)) listed in this section. If a battery charger is tested and its charge duration as determined in section 3.3.2 of this appendix minus 5 hours is greater than the threshold charge time listed in Table 3.3.3 of this appendix (
i.e.

# 4. Testing Requirements for Uninterruptible Power Supplies

# 4.1. Standard Test Conditions

# 4.1.1. Measuring Equipment
(a) The power or energy meter must provide true root mean square (r. m. s) measurements of the active input and output measurements, with an uncertainty at full rated load of less than or equal to 0.5% at the 95% confidence level notwithstanding that voltage and current waveforms can include harmonic components. The meter must measure input and output values simultaneously.
(b) All measurement equipment used to conduct the tests must be calibrated within the measurement equipment manufacturer specified calibration period by a standard traceable to International System of Units such that measurements meet the uncertainty requirements specified in section 4.1.1(a) of this appendix.

# 4.1.2. Test Room Requirements
All portions of the test must be carried out in a room with an air speed immediately surrounding the UUT of ≤0.5 m/s in all directions. Maintain the ambient temperature in the range of 20.0 °C to 30.0 °C, including all inaccuracies and uncertainties introduced by the temperature measurement equipment, throughout the test. No intentional cooling of the UUT, such as by use of separately powered fans, air conditioners, or heat sinks, is permitted. Test the UUT on a thermally non-conductive surface.

# 4.1.3. Input Voltage and Input Frequency
The AC input voltage and frequency to the UPS during testing must be within 3 percent of the highest rated voltage and within 1 percent of the highest rated frequency of the device.

# 4.2. Unit Under Test Setup Requirements

# 4.2.1. General Setup
Configure the UPS according to Annex J.2 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 3.0 with the following additional requirements:
(a)
UPS Operating Mode Conditions.
If the UPS can operate in two or more distinct normal modes as more than one UPS architecture, conduct the test in its lowest input dependency as well as in its highest input dependency mode where VFD represents the highest possible input dependency, followed by VI and then VFI.
(b)
Energy Storage System.
The UPS must not be modified or adjusted to disable energy storage charging features. Minimize the transfer of energy to and from the energy storage system by ensuring the energy storage system is fully charged (at the start of testing) as follows:
(1) If the UUT has a battery charge indicator, charge the battery for 5 hours after the UUT has indicated that it is fully charged.
(2) If the UUT does not have a battery charge indicator but the user manual shipped with the UUT specifies a time to reach full charge, charge the battery for 5 hours longer than the time specified.
(3) If the UUT does not have a battery charge indicator or user manual instructions, charge the battery for 24 hours.
(c)
DC output port(s).
All DC output port(s) of the UUT must remain unloaded during testing.

# 4.2.2. Additional Features
(a) Any feature unrelated to maintaining the energy storage system at full charge or delivery of load power (
e.g.,
LCD display) shall be switched off. If it is not possible to switch such features off, they shall be set to their lowest power-consuming mode during the test.
(b) If the UPS takes any physically separate connectors or cables not required for maintaining the energy storage system at full charge or delivery of load power but associated with other features (such as serial or USB connections, Ethernet, etc.), these connectors or cables shall be left disconnected during the test.
(c) Any manual on-off switches specifically associated with maintaining the energy storage system at full charge or delivery of load power shall be switched on for the duration of the test.

# 4.3. Test Measurement and Calculation
Efficiency can be calculated from either average power or accumulated energy.

# 4.3.1. Average Power Calculations
If efficiency calculation are to be made using average power, calculate the average power consumption (P
avg
) by sampling the power at a rate of at least 1 sample per second and computing the arithmetic mean of all samples over the time period specified for each test as follows:
ER12DE16.021
Where:
P
avg
= average power
P
i
= power measured during individual measurement (
i
)
n
= total number of measurements

# 4.3.2. Steady State
Operate the UUT and the load for a sufficient length of time to reach steady state conditions. To determine if steady state conditions have been attained, perform the following steady state check, in which the difference between the two efficiency calculations must be less than 1 percent:
(a)(1) Simultaneously measure the UUT's input and output power for at least 5 minutes, as specified in section 4.3.1 of this appendix, and record the average of each over the duration as
P
avg__in
and
P
avg__out
, respectively. Or,
(2) Simultaneously measure the UUT's input and output energy for at least 5 minutes and record the accumulation of each over the duration as
E

and
E

, respectively.
(b) Calculate the UUT's efficiency,
Eff

E
in
in the accumulated input energy in watt-hours
(c) Wait a minimum of 10 minutes.
(d) Repeat the steps listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 4.3.2 of this appendix to calculate another efficiency value,
Eff
2
.
(e) Determine if the product is at steady state using the following equation:
ER12DE16.024
If the percentage difference of
Eff
1
and
Eff
2
as described in the equation, is less than 1 percent, the product is at steady state.
(f) If the percentage difference is greater than or equal to 1 percent, the product is not at steady state. Repeat the steps listed in paragraphs (c) to (e) of section 4.3.2 of this appendix until the product is at steady state.

# 4.3.3. Power Measurements and Efficiency Calculations
Measure input and output power of the UUT according to section J.3 of Annex J of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 3.0, or measure the input and output energy of the UUT for efficiency calculations with the following exceptions:
(a) Test the UUT at the following reference test load conditions, in the following order: 100 percent, 75 percent, 50 percent, and 25 percent of the rated output power.
(b) Perform the test at each of the reference test loads by simultaneously measuring the UUT's input and output power in Watts (W), or input and output energy in Watt-Hours (Wh) over a 15 minute test period at a rate of at least 1 Hz. Calculate the efficiency for that reference load using one of the following two equations:
ER12DE16.025
Where:

(c) For representations of no-load losses, measure the active power at the UPS input port with no load applied in accordance with section 6.2.2.4 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 3.0.

# 4.3.4. UUT Classification
Optional Test for determination of UPS architecture. Determine the UPS architecture by performing the tests specified in the definitions of VI, VFD, and VFI (sections 2.28.1 through 2.28.3 of this appendix).

2.2.
Active power
or
real power
(P) means the average power consumed by a unit. For a two terminal device with current and voltage waveforms i(t) and v(t), which are periodic with period T, the real or active power P is:

2.4.
Apparent power (S)
is the product of root-mean-square (RMS) voltage and RMS current in volt-amperes (VA).
2.5.
Batch charger
is a battery charger that charges two or more identical batteries simultaneously in a series, parallel, series-parallel, or parallel-series configuration. A batch charger does not have separate voltage or current regulation, nor does it have any separate indicators for each battery in the
batch. When testing a batch charger, the term “battery” is understood to mean, collectively, all the batteries in the batch that are charged together. A charger can be both a batch charger and a multi-port charger or multi-voltage charger.
2.6.
Battery
or
battery pack
is an assembly of one or more rechargeable cells and any integral protective circuitry intended to provide electrical energy to a consumer product, and may be in one of the following forms:
(a) Detachable battery (a battery that is contained in a separate enclosure from the consumer product and is intended to be removed or disconnected from the consumer product for recharging); or
(b) Integral battery (a battery that is contained within the consumer product and is not removed from the consumer product for charging purposes). The word “intended” in this context refers to whether a battery has been designed in such a way as to permit its removal or disconnection from its associated consumer product.
2.7.
Battery energy
is the energy, in watt-hours, delivered by the battery under the specified discharge conditions in the test procedure.
2.8.
Battery maintenance mode
or
maintenance mode,
is a subset of standby mode in which the battery charger is connected to the main electricity supply and the battery is fully charged, but is still connected to the charger.
2.9.
Battery rest period
is a period of time between discharge and charge or between charge and discharge, during which the battery is resting in an open-circuit state in ambient air.
2.10.
C-Rate
(C) is the rate of charge or discharge, calculated by dividing the charge or discharge current by the nameplate battery charge capacity of the battery. For example, a 0.2 C-rate would result in a charge or discharge period of 5 hours.
2.11.
Cradle
is an electrical interface between an integral battery product and the rest of the battery charger designed to hold the product between uses.
2.12.
Energy storage system
is a system consisting of single or multiple devices designed to provide power to the UPS inverter circuitry.
2.13.
Equalization
is a process whereby a battery is overcharged, beyond what would be considered “normal” charge return, so that cells can be balanced, electrolyte mixed, and plate sulfation removed.
2.14.
Instructions
or
manufacturer's instructions
means the documentation packaged with a product in printed or electronic form and any information about the product listed on a website maintained by the manufacturer and accessible by the general public at the time of the test.

is the product of the discharge current in amperes and the time in decimal hours required to reach the specified end-of-discharge voltage.
2.16.
Manual on-off switch
is a switch activated by the user to control power reaching the battery charger. This term does not apply to any mechanical, optical, or electronic switches that automatically disconnect mains power from the battery charger when a battery is removed from a cradle or charging base, or for products with non-detachable batteries that control power to the product itself.
2.17.
Multi-port charger
means a battery charger that charges two or more batteries (which may be identical or different) simultaneously. The batteries are not connected in series or in parallel but with each port having separate voltage and/or current regulation. If the charger has status indicators, each port has its own indicator(s). A charger can be both a batch charger and a multi-port charger if it is capable of charging two or more batches of batteries simultaneously and each batch has separate regulation and/or indicator(s).
2.18.
Multi-voltage charger
is a battery charger that, by design, can charge a variety of batteries (or batches of batteries, if also a batch charger) that are of different nameplate battery voltages. A multi-voltage charger can also be a multi-port charger if it can charge two or more batteries simultaneously with independent voltages and/or current regulation.
2.19.
Normal mode
is a mode of operation for a UPS in which:
(a) The AC input supply is within required tolerances and supplies the UPS,
(b) The energy storage system is being maintained at full charge or is under recharge, and
(c) The load connected to the UPS is within the UPS's specified power rating.
2.20.
Off mode
is the condition, applicable only to units with manual on-off switches, in which the battery charger:
(a) Is connected to the main electricity supply;
(b) Is not connected to the battery; and
(c) All manual on-off switches are turned off.
2.21.
Nameplate battery voltage
is specified by the battery manufacturer and typically printed on the label of the battery itself. If there are multiple batteries that are connected in series, the nameplate battery voltage of the batteries is the total voltage of the series configuration—that is, the nameplate voltage of each battery multiplied by
the number of batteries connected in series. Connecting multiple batteries in parallel does not affect the nameplate battery voltage.
2.22.
Nameplate battery charge capacity
is the capacity, claimed by the battery manufacturer on a label or in instructions, that the battery can store, usually given in ampere-hours (Ah) or milliampere-hours (mAh) and typically printed on the label of the battery itself. If there are multiple batteries that are connected in parallel, the nameplate battery charge capacity of the batteries is the total charge capacity of the parallel configuration, that is, the nameplate charge capacity of each battery multiplied by the number of batteries connected in parallel. Connecting multiple batteries in series does not affect the nameplate charge capacity.
2.23.
Nameplate battery energy capacity
means the product (in watts-hours (Wh)) of the nameplate battery voltage and the nameplate battery charge capacity.
2.24.
No-battery mode
is a subset of standby mode and means the condition in which:
(a) The battery charger is connected to the main electricity supply;
(b) The battery is not connected to the charger; and
(c) For battery chargers with manual on-off switches, all such switches are turned on.
2.25.
Reference test load
is a load or a condition with a power factor of greater than 0.99 in which the AC output socket of the UPS delivers the active power (W) for which the UPS is rated.
2.26.
Standby mode
means the condition in which the battery charge is either in maintenance mode or no battery mode as defined in this appendix.
2.27.
Total harmonic distortion (THD),
expressed as a percent, is as defined in section 3.5.9 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 3.0.
2.28.
Uninterruptible power supply or UPS
means a battery charger consisting of a combination of convertors, switches and energy storage devices (such as batteries), constituting a power system for maintaining continuity of load power in case of AC input power failure.
2.28.1.
Voltage and frequency dependent UPS or VFD UPS
means a UPS that protects the load from a complete loss of AC input power. The output of a VFD UPS is dependent on changes in voltage and frequency of the AC input power and is not intended to provide additional voltage corrective functions, such as those arising from the use of tapped transformers.
Note to 2.28.1:
VFD input dependency may be verified by performing the AC input failure test in section 6.2.2.7 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 3.0 and observing that, at a minimum, the UPS switches from normal mode of operation to battery power while the input is interrupted.
2.28.2.
Voltage and frequency independent UPS or VFI UPS
means a UPS that is independent of AC input power voltage and frequency variations as specified and declared in section 5.2 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 3.0 and shall protect the load against adverse effects from such variations without discharging the energy storage device.
Note to 2.28.2:
VFI input dependency may be verified by performing the combined input voltage/frequency tolerance and VFI input independency test in section 6.4.1.3 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 3.0 respectively and observing that, at a minimum, the UPS produces an output voltage and frequency within the specified output range when the input voltage is varied by ±10% of the rated input voltage and the input frequency is varied by ±2% of the rated input frequency.
2.28.3.
Voltage independent UPS or VI UPS
means a UPS that protects the load as required for VFD and also from (a) under-voltage applied continuously to the input, and (b) over-voltage applied continuously to the input. The output voltage of a VI UPS shall remain within declared voltage limits (provided by voltage corrective functions, such as those arising from the use of active and/or passive circuits). The output voltage tolerance band shall be narrower than the input voltage tolerance band.
Note to 2.28.3:
VI input dependency may be verified by performing the steady state input voltage tolerance test in section 6.4.1.2 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 3.0 and ensuring that the UPS remains in normal mode with the output voltage within the specified output range when the input voltage is varied by ±10% of the rated input voltage.
2.29.
Unit under test
(UUT) in this appendix refers to the combination of the battery charger and battery being tested.
2.30.
Wireless charger
is a battery charger that can charge batteries inductively.
2.30.1.
Fixed-location wireless charger
is an inductive wireless battery charger that incorporates a physical receiver locating feature (e.g., by physical peg, cradle, locking mechanism, magnet, etc.) to repeatably align or orient the position of the receiver with respect to the transmitter.
2.30.2.
Open-placement wireless charger
is an inductive wireless charger that does not incorporate a physical receiver locating feature (e.g., by a physical peg, cradle, locking mechanism, magnet etc.) to repeatably align or orient the position of the receiver with respect to the transmitter.

# 3.1.4. Verifying the UUT's Input Voltage and Input Frequency
(a) If the UUT is intended for operation on AC line-voltage input in the United States, it shall be tested at 115 V at 60 Hz. If the UUT is intended for operation on AC line-voltage input but cannot be operated at 115 V at 60 Hz, it shall not be tested.
(b) If a battery charger is powered by a low-voltage DC or AC input and the manufacturer packages the battery charger with an external power supply (“EPS”), test the battery charger using the packaged EPS; if the battery charger does not include a pre-packaged EPS, then test the battery charger with an EPS sold and recommended by the manufacturer; if the manufacturer does not recommend an EPS that it sells, test the battery charger with an EPS that the manufacturer recommends for use in the manufacturer materials. The input reference source shall be 115 V at 60 Hz. If the EPS cannot be operated with AC input voltage at 115 V at 60 Hz, the charger shall not be tested.
(c) If a battery charger is designed for operation only on DC input voltage and if the provisions of section 3.1.4.(b) of this appendix do not apply, test the battery charger with an external power supply that minimally complies with the applicable energy conservation standard and meets the external power supply parameters specified by the battery charger manufacturer. The input voltage shall be within ±1 percent of the battery charger manufacturer specified voltage.
(d) If the input voltage is AC, the input frequency shall be within ±1 percent of the specified frequency. The THD of the input voltage shall be ≤2 percent, up to and including the 13th harmonic. The crest factor of the input voltage shall be between 1.34 and 1.49.
(e) If the input voltage is DC, the AC ripple voltage (RMS) shall be:
(1) ≤0.2 V for DC voltages up to 10 V; or
(2) ≤2 percent of the DC voltage for DC voltages over 10 V.

# 3.2. Unit Under Test Setup Requirements

# 3.2.1. General Setup
(a) The battery charger system shall be prepared and set up in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, except where those instructions conflict with the requirements of this test procedure. If no instructions are given, then factory or “default” settings shall be used, or where there are no indications of such settings, the UUT shall
be tested in the condition as it would be supplied to an end user.
(b) If the battery charger has user controls to select from two or more charge rates (such as regular or fast charge) or different charge currents, the test shall be conducted at the fastest charge rate that is recommended by the manufacturer for everyday use, or, failing any explicit recommendation, the factory-default charge rate. If the charger has user controls for selecting special charge cycles that are recommended only for occasional use to preserve battery health, such as equalization charge, removing memory, or battery conditioning, these modes are not required to be tested. The settings of the controls shall be listed in the report for each test.

# 3.2.2. Selection and Treatment of the Battery Charger
The UUT, including the battery charger and its associated battery, shall be new products of the type and condition that would be sold to a customer. If the battery is lead-acid chemistry and the battery is to be stored for more than 24 hours between its initial acquisition and testing, the battery shall be charged before such storage.

# 3.2.3. Selection of Batteries To Use for Testing
(a) For chargers with integral batteries, the battery packaged with the charger shall be used for testing. For chargers with detachable batteries, the battery or batteries to be used for testing will vary depending on whether there are any batteries packaged with the battery charger.
(1) If batteries are packaged with the charger, batteries for testing shall be selected from the batteries packaged with the battery charger, according to the procedure in section 3.2.3(b) of this appendix.
(2) If no batteries are packaged with the charger, but the instructions specify or recommend batteries for use with the charger, batteries for testing shall be selected from those recommended or specified in the instructions, according to the procedure in section 3.2.3(b) of this appendix.
(3) If no batteries are packaged with the charger and the instructions do not specify or recommend batteries for use with the charger, batteries for testing shall be selected from any that are suitable for use with the charger, according to the procedure in section 3.2.3(b) of this appendix.
(b)(1) From the detachable batteries specified in section 3.2.3.(a) of this appendix, use Table 3.2.1 of this appendix to select the batteries to be used for testing, depending on the type of battery charger being tested. The battery charger types represented by the rows in the table are mutually exclusive. Find the single applicable row for the UUT, and test according to those requirements. Select only the single battery configuration specified for the battery charger type in Table 3.2.1 of this section.
(2) If the battery selection criteria specified in Table 3.2.1 of this appendix results in two or more batteries or configurations of batteries of different chemistries, but with equal voltage and capacity ratings, determine the maintenance mode power, as specified in section 3.3.9 of this appendix, for each of the batteries or configurations of batteries, and select for testing the battery or configuration of batteries with the highest maintenance mode power.
(c) A charger is considered as:
(1) Single-capacity if all associated batteries have the same nameplate battery charge capacity (see definition) and, if it is a batch charger, all configurations of the batteries have the same nameplate battery charge capacity.
(2) Multi-capacity if there are associated batteries or configurations of batteries that have different nameplate battery charge capacities.
(d) The selected battery or batteries will be referred to as the “test battery” and will be used through the remainder of this test procedure.

# 3.2.4. Limiting Other Non-Battery-Charger Functions
(a) If the battery charger or product containing the battery charger does not have any additional functions unrelated to battery charging, this section may be skipped.
(b) Any optional functions controlled by the user and not associated with the battery charging process (e.g., the answering machine in a cordless telephone charging base) shall be switched off. If it is not possible to switch such functions off, they shall be set to their lowest power-consuming mode during the test.
(c) If the battery charger takes any physically separate connectors or cables not required for battery charging but associated with its other functionality (such as phone lines, serial or USB connections, Ethernet, cable TV lines, etc.), these connectors or cables shall be left disconnected during the testing.
(d) Any manual on-off switches specifically associated with the battery charging process shall be switched on for the duration of the charge, maintenance, and no-battery mode tests, and switched off for the off mode test.

# 3.2.5. Accessing the Battery for the Test
(a) The technician may need to disassemble the end-use product or battery charger to gain access to the battery terminals for the Battery Discharge Energy Test in section 3.3.8 of this appendix. If the battery terminals are not clearly labeled, the technician shall use a voltmeter to identify the positive and negative terminals. These terminals will be the ones that give the largest voltage difference and are able to deliver significant current (0.2 C or 1/hr) into a load.
(b) All conductors used for contacting the battery must be cleaned and burnished prior to connecting in order to decrease voltage drops and achieve consistent results.
(c) Manufacturer's instructions for disassembly shall be followed, except those instructions that:
(1) Lead to any permanent alteration of the battery charger circuitry or function;
(2) Could alter the energy consumption of the battery charger compared to that experienced by a user during typical use, e.g., due to changes in the airflow through the enclosure of the UUT; or
(3) Conflict requirements of this test procedure.
(d) Care shall be taken by the technician during disassembly to follow appropriate safety precautions. If the functionality of the device or its safety features is compromised, the product shall be discarded after testing.
(e) Some products may include protective circuitry between the battery cells and the remainder of the device. If the manufacturer provides a description for accessing the connections at the output of the protective circuitry, these connections shall be used to discharge the battery and measure the discharge energy. The energy consumed by the protective circuitry during discharge shall not be measured or credited as battery energy.
(f) If any of the following conditions specified in sections 3.2.5.(f)(1) to 3.2.5.(f)(3) of this appendix are applicable, preventing the measurement of the Battery Discharge Energy and the Charging and Maintenance Mode Energy, a manufacturer must submit a petition for a test procedure waiver in accordance with § 430.27:
(1) Inability to access the battery terminals;
(2) Access to the battery terminals destroys charger functionality; or
(3) Inability to draw current from the test battery.

# 3.2.6. Determining Charge Capacity for Batteries With No Rating
(a) If there is no rating for the battery charge capacity on the battery or in the instructions, then the technician shall determine a discharge current that meets the following requirements. The battery shall be fully charged and then discharged at this constant-current rate until it reaches the end-of-discharge voltage specified in Table 3.3.2 of this appendix. The discharge time must be not less than 4.5 hours nor more than 5 hours. In addition, the discharge test (section 3.3.8 of this appendix) (which may not be starting with a fully-charged battery) shall reach the end-of-discharge voltage within 5 hours. The same discharge current shall be used for both the preparations step (section 3.3.4 of this appendix) and the discharge test (section 3.3.8 of this appendix). The test report shall include the discharge current used and the resulting discharge times for both a fully-charged battery and for the discharge test.
(b) For this section, the battery is considered as “fully charged” when either: it has been charged by the UUT until an indicator on the UUT shows that the charge is complete; or it has been charged by a battery analyzer at a current not greater than the discharge current until the battery analyzer indicates that the battery is fully charged.
(c) When there is no capacity rating, a suitable discharge current must generally be determined by trial and error. Since the conditioning step does not require constant-current discharges, the trials themselves may also be counted as part of battery conditioning.

# 3.3. Test Measurement
The test sequence to measure the battery charger energy consumption is summarized in Table 3.3.1 of this appendix, and explained
in detail in this appendix. Measurements shall be made under test conditions and with the equipment specified in sections 3.1 and 3.2 of this appendix.

# 3.3.1. Recording General Data on the UUT
The technician shall record:
(a) The manufacturer and model of the battery charger;
(b) The presence and status of any additional functions unrelated to battery charging;
(c) The manufacturer, model, and number of batteries in the test battery;
(d) The nameplate battery voltage of the test battery;
(e) The nameplate battery charge capacity of the test battery; and
(f) The nameplate battery charge energy of the test battery.
(g) The settings of the controls, if battery charger has user controls to select from two or more charge rates.

# 3.3.2. Determining the Duration of the Charge and Maintenance Modes Test
(a) The charge and maintenance modes test, described in detail in section 3.3.6 of this appendix, shall be 24 hours in length or longer, as determined by the items in sections 3.3.2.(a)(1) to 3.3.2.(a)(3) of this appendix. Proceed in order until a test duration is determined. In case when the battery charger does not enter its true battery maintenance mode, the test shall continue until 5 hours after the true battery maintenance mode has been captured.
(1) If the battery charger has an indicator to show that the battery is fully charged, that indicator shall be used as follows: if the indicator shows that the battery is charged after 19 hours of charging, the test shall be terminated at 24 hours. Conversely, if the full-charge indication is not yet present after 19 hours of charging, the test shall continue until 5 hours after the indication is present.
(2) If there is no indicator, but the manufacturer's instructions indicate that charging this battery or this capacity of battery should be complete within 19 hours, the test shall be for 24 hours. If the instructions indicate that charging may take longer than 19 hours, the test shall be run for the longest estimated charge time plus 5 hours.
(3) If there is no indicator and no time estimate in the instructions, but the charging current is stated on the charger or in the instructions, calculate the test duration as the longer of 24 hours or:
ER08SE22.004
(b) If none of section 3.3.2.(a) applies, the duration of the test shall be 24 hours.

# 3.3.3. Battery Conditioning
(a) No conditioning is to be done on lithium-ion batteries. The test technician shall proceed directly to battery preparation, section 3.3.4 of this appendix, when testing chargers for these batteries.
(b) Products with integral batteries will have to be disassembled per the instructions in section 3.2.5 of this appendix, and the battery disconnected from the charger for discharging.
(c) Batteries of other chemistries that have not been previously cycled are to be conditioned by performing two charges and two discharges, followed by a charge, as sections 3.3.3.(c)(1) to 3.3.3.(c)(5) of this appendix. No data need be recorded during battery conditioning.
(1) The test battery shall be fully charged for the duration specified in section 3.3.2 of this appendix or longer using the UUT.
(2) The test battery shall then be fully discharged using either:
(i) A battery analyzer at a rate not to exceed 1 C, until its average cell voltage under load reaches the end-of-discharge voltage specified in Table 3.3.2 of this appendix for the relevant battery chemistry; or
(ii) The UUT, until the UUT ceases operation due to low battery voltage.
(3) The test battery shall again be fully charged per step in section 3.3.3(c)(1) of this appendix.
(4) The test battery shall again be fully discharged per step in section 3.3.3(c)(2) of this appendix.
(5) The test battery shall be again fully charged per step in section 3.3.3(c)(1) of this appendix.
(d) Batteries of chemistries, other than lithium-ion, that are known to have been through at least two previous full charge/discharge cycles shall only be charged once per step in section 3.3.3(c)(5) of this appendix.

# 3.3.4. Preparing the Battery for Charge Testing
Following any conditioning prior to beginning the battery charge test (section 3.3.6 of this appendix), the test battery shall be fully discharged to the end of discharge voltage prescribed in Table 3.3.2 of this appendix, or until the UUT circuitry terminates the discharge.

# 3.3.5. Resting the Battery
The test battery shall be rested between preparation and the battery charge test. The rest period shall be at least one hour and not exceed 24 hours. For batteries with flooded cells, the electrolyte temperature shall be less than 30 °C before charging, even if the rest period must be extended longer than 24 hours.

# 3.3.6. Testing Active Charge Mode and Battery Maintenance Mode
(a) The Active Charge and Battery Maintenance Modes test measures energy consumed during charge mode and some time spent in the maintenance mode of the UUT. Functions required for battery conditioning that happen only with some user-selected switch or other control shall not be included in this measurement. (The technician shall manually turn off any battery conditioning cycle or setting.) Regularly occurring battery conditioning or maintenance functions that are not controlled by the user will, by default, be incorporated into this measurement.
(b) During the measurement period, input power values to the UUT shall be recorded at least once every minute.
(1) If possible, the technician shall set the data logging system to record the average power during the sample interval. The total energy is computed as the sum of power samples (in watts) multiplied by the sample interval (in hours).
(2) If this setting is not possible, then the power analyzer shall be set to integrate or accumulate the input power over the measurement period and this result shall be used as the total energy.
(c) The technician shall follow these steps:
(1) Ensure that the user-controllable device functionality not associated with battery charging and any battery conditioning cycle or setting are turned off, as instructed in section 3.2.4 of this appendix;
(2) Ensure that the test battery used in this test has been conditioned, prepared, discharged, and rested as described in sections 3.3.3. through 3.3.5. of this appendix;
(3) Connect the data logging equipment to the battery charger;
(4) Record the start time of the measurement period, and begin logging the input power;
(5) Connect the test battery to the battery charger within 3 minutes of beginning logging. For integral battery products, connect the product to a cradle or EPS within 3 minutes of beginning logging;
(6) After the test battery is connected, record the initial time and power (W) of the input current to the UUT. These measurements shall be taken within the first 10 minutes of active charging;
(7) Record the input power for the duration of the “Maintenance Mode Test” period, as determined by section 3.3.2. of this appendix. The actual time that power is connected to the UUT shall be within ±5 minutes of the specified period; and
(8) Disconnect power to the UUT, terminate data logging, and record the final time.

# 3.3.7. Resting the Battery
The test battery shall be rested between charging and discharging. The rest period
shall be at least 1 hour and not more than 4 hours, with an exception for flooded cells. For batteries with flooded cells, the electrolyte temperature shall be less than 30 °C before charging, even if the rest period must be extended beyond 4 hours.

# 3.3.8. Battery Discharge Energy Test
(a) If multiple batteries were charged simultaneously, the discharge energy (E
batt
) is the sum of the discharge energies of all the batteries.
(1) For a multi-port charger, batteries that were charged in separate ports shall be discharged independently.
(2) For a batch charger, batteries that were charged as a group may be discharged individually, as a group, or in sub-groups connected in series and/or parallel. The position of each battery with respect to the other batteries need not be maintained.
(b) During discharge, the battery voltage and discharge current shall be sampled and recorded at least once per minute. The values recorded may be average or instantaneous values.
(c) For this test, the technician shall follow these steps:
(1) Ensure that the test battery has been charged by the UUT and rested according to the procedures prescribed in sections 3.3.6 and 3.3.7 of this appendix.
(2) Set the battery analyzer for a constant discharge rate and the end-of-discharge voltage in Table 3.3.2 of this appendix for the relevant battery chemistry.
(3) Connect the test battery to the analyzer and begin recording the voltage, current, and wattage, if available from the battery analyzer. When the end-of-discharge voltage is reached or the UUT circuitry terminates the discharge, the test battery shall be returned to an open-circuit condition. If current continues to be drawn from the test battery after the end-of-discharge condition is first reached, this additional energy is not to be counted in the battery discharge energy.
(d) If not available from the battery analyzer, the battery discharge energy (in watt-hours) is calculated by multiplying the voltage (in volts), current (in amperes), and sample period (in hours) for each sample, and then summing over all sample periods until the end-of-discharge voltage is reached.

# 3.3.9. Determining the Maintenance Mode Power
After the measurement period is complete, the technician shall determine the average maintenance mode power consumption (P
m
) by examining the power-versus-time data from the charge and maintenance mode test and:
(a) If the maintenance mode power is cyclic or shows periodic pulses, compute the average power over a time period that spans a whole number of cycles and includes at least the last 4 hours.
(b) Otherwise, calculate the average power value over the last 4 hours.

# 3.3.10. Determining the Active Charge Energy
After the measurement period is complete, the technician shall determine the total active charge energy (E
a
) by examining the power-versus-time data from the charge and maintenance mode test and:
(a) First determine when the battery charger enters maintenance mode by examining the power-versus-time data to identify when the input power enters either a steady state or a cyclic state with average power for that period being the same as the maintenance mode power determined in section 3.3.9. of this appendix.
(b) The accumulated energy or the average input power, integrated over the test period from the initial recorded input time up until when the battery charger enters maintenance mode would be the active charge energy, E
a
.

# 3.3.11. No-Battery Mode Energy Consumption Measurement
The no-battery mode measurement depends on the configuration of the battery charger, as follows:
(a) Conduct a measurement of no-battery power consumption while the battery charger is connected to the power source. Disconnect the battery from the charger, allow the charger to operate for at least 30 minutes, and record the power (
i.e.,
watts) consumed as the time series integral of the power consumed over a 10-minute test period, divided by the period of measurement. If the battery charger has manual on-off switches, all must be turned on for the duration of the no-battery mode test.
(b) No-battery mode may also apply to products with integral batteries, as follows:
(1) If the product uses a cradle and/or adapter for power conversion and charging, then “disconnecting the battery from the charger” will require disconnection of the end-use product, which contains the batteries. The other enclosures of the battery charging system will remain connected to the main electricity supply, and no-battery mode power consumption will equal that of the cradle and/or adapter alone.
(2) If the product is powered through a detachable AC power cord and contains integrated power conversion and charging circuitry, then only the cord will remain connected to mains, and no-battery mode power consumption will equal that of the AC power cord (
i.e.,
zero watts).
(3) If the product contains integrated power conversion and charging circuitry but is powered through a non-detachable AC power cord or plug blades, then no part of the system will remain connected to mains, and no-battery mode measurement is not applicable.

# 3.3.12. Off Mode Energy Consumption Measurement
The off mode measurement depends on the configuration of the battery charger, as follows:
(a) If the battery charger has manual on-off switches, record a measurement of off mode energy consumption while the battery charger is connected to the power source. Remove the battery from the charger, allow the charger to operate for at least 30 minutes, and record the power (
i.e.,
watts) consumed as the time series integral of the power consumed over a 10-minute test period, divided by the period of measurement, with all manual on-off switches turned off. If the battery charger does not have manual on-off switches, record that the off mode measurement is not applicable to this product.
(b) Off mode may also apply to products with integral batteries, as follows:
(1) If the product uses a cradle and/or adapter for power conversion and charging, then “disconnecting the battery from the charger” will require disconnection of the end-use product, which contains the batteries. The other enclosures of the battery charging system will remain connected to the main electricity supply, and off mode power consumption will equal that of the cradle and/or adapter alone.
(2) If the product is powered through a detachable AC power cord and contains integrated power conversion and charging circuitry, then only the cord will remain connected to mains, and off mode power consumption will equal that of the AC power cord (
i.e.,
zero watts).
(3) If the product contains integrated power conversion and charging circuitry but is powered through a non-detachable AC power cord or plug blades, then no part of the system will remain connected to mains, and off mode measurement is not applicable.

# 3.3.13. Standby Mode Power
The standby mode power (P
sb
) is the summation power of battery maintenance mode power (P
m
) and no-battery mode power (P
nb
).

# 4. Testing Requirements for Uninterruptible Power Supplies

# 4.1. Standard Test Conditions

# 4.1.1. Measuring Equipment
(a) The power or energy meter must provide true root mean square (r.m.s) measurements of the active input and output measurements, with an uncertainty at full rated load of less than or equal to 0.5 percent at the 95 percent confidence level notwithstanding that voltage and current waveforms can include harmonic components. The meter must measure input and output values simultaneously.
(b) All measurement equipment used to conduct the tests must be calibrated within the measurement equipment manufacturer specified calibration period by a standard traceable to International System of Units such that measurements meet the uncertainty requirements specified in section 4.1.1(a) of this appendix.

# 4.1.2. Test Room Requirements
All portions of the test must be carried out in a room with an air speed immediately surrounding the UUT of ≤0.5 m/s in all directions. Maintain the ambient temperature in the range of 20.0 °C to 30.0 °C, including all inaccuracies and uncertainties introduced by the temperature measurement equipment, throughout the test. No intentional cooling of the UUT, such as by use of separately powered fans, air conditioners, or heat sinks, is permitted. Test the UUT on a thermally non-conductive surface.

# 4.1.3. Input Voltage and Input Frequency
The AC input voltage and frequency to the UPS during testing must be within 3 percent of the highest rated voltage and within 1 percent of the highest rated frequency of the device.

# 4.2. Unit Under Test Setup Requirements

# 4.2.1. General Setup
Configure the UPS according to Annex J.2 of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 3.0 with the following additional requirements:
(a) UPS Operating Mode Conditions. If the UPS can operate in two or more distinct normal modes as more than one UPS architecture, conduct the test in its lowest input dependency as well as in its highest input dependency mode where VFD represents the lowest possible input dependency, followed by VI and then VFI.
(b) Energy Storage System. The UPS must not be modified or adjusted to disable energy storage charging features. Minimize the transfer of energy to and from the energy storage system by ensuring the energy storage system is fully charged (at the start of testing) as follows:
(1) If the UUT has a battery charge indicator, charge the battery for 5 hours after the UUT has indicated that it is fully charged.
(2) If the UUT does not have a battery charge indicator but the user manual shipped with the UUT specifies a time to reach full charge, charge the battery for 5 hours longer than the time specified.
(3) If the UUT does not have a battery charge indicator or user manual instructions, charge the battery for 24 hours.
(c) DC output port(s). All DC output port(s) of the UUT must remain unloaded during testing.

# 4.2.2. Additional Features
(a) Any feature unrelated to maintaining the energy storage system at full charge or delivery of load power (e.g., LCD display) shall be switched off. If it is not possible to switch such features off, they shall be set to their lowest power-consuming mode during the test.
(b) If the UPS takes any physically separate connectors or cables not required for maintaining the energy storage system at full charge or delivery of load power but associated with other features (such as serial or USB connections, Ethernet, etc.), these connectors or cables shall be left disconnected during the test.
(c) Any manual on-off switches specifically associated with maintaining the energy storage system at full charge or delivery of load power shall be switched on for the duration of the test.

# 4.3. Test Measurement and Calculation
Efficiency can be calculated from either average power or accumulated energy.

# 4.3.1. Average Power Calculations
If efficiency calculation are to be made using average power, calculate the average power consumption (P
avg
) by sampling the power at a rate of at least 1 sample per second and computing the arithmetic mean of all samples over the time period specified for each test as follows:
ER08SE22.005
Where:
P

)
n
= total number of measurements

# 4.3.2. Steady State
Operate the UUT and the load for a sufficient length of time to reach steady state conditions. To determine if steady state conditions have been attained, perform the following steady state check, in which the difference between the two efficiency calculations must be less than 1 percent:
(a)(1) Simultaneously measure the UUT's input and output power for at least 5 minutes, as specified in section 4.3.1 of this appendix, and record the average of each over the duration as
P
avg_in
and
P
avg_out
,
respectively; or,
(2) Simultaneously measure the UUT's input and output energy for at least 5 minutes and record the accumulation of each over the duration as
E

respectively.
(b) Calculate the UUT's efficiency,

(c) Wait a minimum of 10 minutes.
(d) Repeat the steps listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 4.3.2 of this appendix to calculate another efficiency value,
Eff
2
.
(e) Determine if the product is at steady state using the following equation:
ER08SE22.008
If the percentage difference of
Eff
1
and
Eff
2
as described in the equation, is less than 1 percent, the product is at steady state.
(f) If the percentage difference is greater than or equal to 1 percent, the product is not at steady state. Repeat the steps listed in paragraphs (c) to (e) of section 4.3.2 of this appendix until the product is at steady state.

# 4.3.3. Power Measurements and Efficiency Calculations
Measure input and output power of the UUT according to section J.3 of Annex J of IEC 62040-3 Ed. 3.0, or measure the input and output energy of the UUT for efficiency calculations with the following exceptions:
(a) Test the UUT at the following reference test load conditions, in the following order: 100 percent, 75 percent, 50 percent, and 25 percent of the rated output power.
(b) Perform the test at each of the reference test loads by simultaneously measuring the UUT's input and output power in Watts (W), or input and output energy in Watt-Hours (Wh) over a 15 minute test period at a rate of at least 1 Hz. Calculate the efficiency for that reference load using one of the following two equations:
(1)
ER08SE22.009
Where:
Eff

Scope:
This appendix covers the test requirements used to measure the energy consumption of external power supplies subject to the energy conservation standards set forth at § 430.32(w)(1). Additionally, this appendix does not apply to external power supplies for which the primary load of the converted voltage within the device is not delivered to a separate end-use product,
i.e.,
products in which the primary load of converted voltage is delivered within the device itself to execute the primary function of the device. Examples of excluded products may include, but are not limited to, consumer electronics with USB outputs and lighting products with USB outputs.

# 3.
Definitions:
The following definitions are for the purposes of understanding terminology associated with the test method for measuring external power supply energy consumption.
Active mode
means the mode of operation when the external power supply is connected to the main electricity supply and the output is (or “all outputs are” for external power supplies with multiple outputs) connected to a load (or “loads” for external power supplies with multiple outputs).
Active mode efficiency
is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the total real output power produced by a power supply to the real input power required to produce it. IEEE Standard 1515-2000, 4.3.1.1 (Reference for guidance only, see § 430.4.)
Active power (P)
(also
real power
) means the average power consumed by a unit. For a two-terminal device with current and voltage waveforms i(t) and v(t), respectively, which are periodic with period T, the real or active power P is:
ER19AU22.003
Adaptive external power supply
means an external power supply that can alter its output voltage during active-mode based on an established digital communication protocol with the end-use application without any user-generated action.
Ambient temperature
means the temperature of the ambient air immediately surrounding the unit under test.
Average Active-Mode Efficiency
means the average of the active mode efficiencies at the loading conditions (100, 75, 50 percent, and 25 percent of unit under test's nameplate output current) for which that unit can sustain the output current.
Manual on-off switch
is a switch activated by the user to control power reaching the device. This term does not apply to any mechanical, optical, or electronic switches that automatically disconnect mains power from the device when a load is disconnected from the device, or that control power to the load itself.
Minimum output current
means the minimum current that must be drawn from an output bus for an external power supply to operate within its specifications.
Multiple-voltage external power supply
means an external power supply that is designed to convert line voltage AC input into
more than one simultaneous lower-voltage output.
Nameplate output current
means the current output of the power supply as specified on the manufacturer's label on the power supply housing (either DC or AC) or, if absent from the housing, as provided by the manufacturer.
Nameplate output power
means the power output of the power supply as specified on the manufacturer's label on the power supply housing or, if absent from the housing, as specified in documentation provided by the manufacturer. For an adaptive external power supply with USB-PD ports, in place of the nameplate output power at the lowest voltage, use an output power calculated as the product of its lowest nameplate output voltage and 2 amps for each USB-PD port and as specified on the manufacturer's label or documentation at the highest voltage. This definition only applies to DOE testing and certification requirements and is unrelated to the physical nameplate label or documentation of an EPS.
Nameplate output voltage
means the voltage output of the power supply as specified on the manufacturer's label on the power supply housing (either DC or AC).
No-load mode
means the mode of operation when an external power supply is connected to the main electricity supply and the output is (or “all outputs are” for a multiple-voltage external power supply) not connected to a load (or “loads” for a multiple-voltage external power supply).
Off-mode
is the condition, applicable only to units with manual on-off switches, in which the external power supply is:
(1) Connected to the main electricity supply;
(2) The output is not connected to any load; and
(3) All manual on-off switches are turned off.
Output bus
means any of the outputs of the power supply to which loads can be connected and from which power can be drawn, as opposed to signal connections used for communication.
RMS
means root mean square.
Single-voltage external AC-AC power supply
means an external power supply that is designed to convert line voltage AC input into lower voltage AC output and is able to convert to only one AC output voltage at a time.
Single-voltage external AC-DC power supply
means an external power supply that is designed to convert line voltage AC input into lower-voltage DC output and is able to convert to only one DC output voltage at a time.
Standby mode
means the condition in which the external power supply is in no-load mode and, for external power supplies with manual on-off switches, all such switches are turned on.
Switch-selectable single voltage external power supply
means a single-voltage AC-AC or AC-DC power supply that allows users to choose from more than one output voltage.
Total harmonic distortion (THD),
expressed as a percentage, is the RMS value of an AC signal after the fundamental component is removed and interharmonic components are ignored, divided by the RMS value of the fundamental component. THD of current is defined as:
ER19AU22.004
where
I
n
is the RMS value of the
n
th harmonic of the current signal.
Unit under test (UUT)
is the external power supply being tested.
USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) EPS
means an adaptive EPS that utilizes a USB Type-C output port and uses a digital protocol to communicate between the EPS and the end-use product to automatically switch between any output voltage within the range of 3.3 volts to 20 volts. The USB-PD output bus must be capable of delivering 3 amps at the lowest output voltage, and the currents must not exceed any of the following values for the supported voltages: 3 amps at 9 volts; 3 amps at 15 volts; and 5 amps at 20 volts.
USB Type-C
means the reversible 24-pin physical USB connector system that supports USB-PD and allows for the transmission of data and power between compatible USB products.

# 4.
Test Apparatus and General Instructions
(a) Any power measurements recorded, as well as any power measurement equipment utilized for testing, shall conform to the uncertainty and resolution specifications in Section 4.4.1, “Power measurement uncertainty,” as well as Annexes B, “Notes on the measurement of low power modes,” and D, “Determination of uncertainty of measurement,” of IEC 62301.
(b) Carry out tests in a room that has an air speed close to the UUT of ≤0.5 m/s. Maintain ambient temperature at 20 ± 5 °C throughout the test. Do not intentionally cool the UUT, for example, by use of separately powered fans, air conditioners, or heat sinks. Test the UUT on a thermally non-conductive surface. Products intended for outdoor use may be tested at additional temperatures, provided those are in addition to the conditions specified and are noted in a separate section on the test report.
(c) If the UUT is intended for operation on AC line-voltage input in the United States, test it at 115 V at 60 Hz. If the UUT is intended for operation on AC line-voltage input but cannot be operated at 115 V at 60 Hz, do not test it. Ensure the input voltage is within ±1 percent of the above specified voltage and the input frequency is within ±1 percent of the specified frequency.
(d) The input voltage source must be capable of delivering at least 10 times the nameplate input power of the UUT as is specified in IEEE 1515-2000 (Referenced for guidance only, see § 430.4). Regardless of the AC source type, the THD of the supply voltage when supplying the UUT in the specified mode must not exceed 2 percent, up to and including the 13th harmonic. The peak value of the test voltage must be within 1.34 and 1.49 multiplied by its RMS value.
(e) Select all leads used in the test set-up with appropriate wire gauges and lengths to minimize voltage drops across the wires during testing. See Table B.2 — “Commonly used values for wire gages [
sic
] and related voltage drops” in IEEE 1515-2000 for further guidance.
(f) Test Load. To load the power supply to produce all active-mode loading conditions, use passive loads, such as rheostats, or active loads, such as electronic loads. Resistive loads need not be measured precisely with an ohmmeter; simply adjust a variable resistor to the point where the ammeter confirms that the desired percentage of nameplate output current is flowing. For electronic loads, adjust the desired output current in constant current mode rather than adjusting the required output power in constant power mode.
(g) Test the external power supply at the end of the wire or cord that connects to an end-use product, regardless of whether the end of the wire or cord is integrated into an end-use product or plugs into and out of an end-use product. If a separate wire or cord is provided by the manufacturer to connect the external power supply to an end-use product, use this wire or cord and perform tests at the end of the cord that connects to an end-use product. An external power supply that is not supplied with a wire or cord must be tested with a wire or an output cord recommended by the manufacturer. If the external power supply is not supplied with a wire or cord and for which the manufacturer does not recommend one, the EPS must be tested with a 3-foot-long output wire or cord with a conductor thickness that is minimally sufficient to carry the maximum required current.
(1) If the connection to an end-use product is removable, there are two options for connecting metering equipment to the output connection of the external power supply:
(i) Cut the cord immediately adjacent to the output connector, or
(ii) Attach leads and measure the efficiency from the output connector itself.
(2) If the connection to an end-use product is not removable, cut the cord immediately adjacent to the powered product and connect metering equipment at that point.
(h) Conduct the tests on the sets of output wires that constitute the output busses. If the product has more than two output wires, including those wires that are necessary for controlling the product, the manufacturer must supply a connection diagram or test fixture that will allow the testing laboratory to put the UUT into active mode. Figure 1 of this section provides one illustration of how to set up a single-voltage external power supply for testing; however, the actual test setup may vary pursuant to the type of external power supply being tested and the requirements of this appendix.
ER19AU22.005
(i) Except as provided in section 4(j) of this appendix, external power supplies must be tested in their final, completed configuration in order to represent their measured efficiency on product labels or specification sheets. Although the same procedure may be used to test the efficiency of a bare circuit board power supply prior to its incorporation into a finished housing and the attachment of its DC output cord, the efficiency of the bare circuit board power supply may not be used to characterize the efficiency of the final product (once enclosed in a case and fitted with a DC output cord). For example, a power supply manufacturer or component manufacturer may wish to assess the efficiency of a design that it intends to provide to an OEM for incorporation into a finished external power supply, but these results may not be used to represent the efficiency of the finished external power supply.
(j) If a product serves one or more other major functions in addition to converting household electric current into DC current or lower-voltage AC current, components of the product that serve other functions may be disconnected before testing so that test measurements do not include power used by other functions and as long as disconnecting such components do not affect the ability of the product to convert household electric current into DC current or lower-voltage AC current. For example, consider an EPS that also acts as a surge protector that offers outlets supplying AC household electric current and one or more USB outputs supplying DC current. If power is provided to the AC outlets through a surge protection circuit, but power to the USB outlet(s) is not, then the surge protection circuit may be disconnected from AC power during testing. Similarly, if a lighted manual on-off switch disconnects power only to the AC outlets, but not the USB outputs, then the manual on-off switch may be turned off and power to the light disconnected during testing. If a disconnection is performed by a technician, the disconnection must be able to be replicated by a third-party test facility.

Test Measurement for all External Power Supplies Other than Adaptive External Power Supplies:
(a) Single-Voltage External Power Supply
(1) Standby Mode and Active-Mode Measurement.
(i) Place in the “on” position any built-in switch in the UUT controlling power flow to the AC input and note the existence of such a switch in the final test report.
(ii) Operate the UUT at 100 percent of nameplate output current for at least 30 minutes immediately prior to conducting efficiency measurements. After this warm-up period, monitor AC input power for a period of 5 minutes to assess the stability of the UUT. If the power level does not drift by more than 5 percent from the maximum value observed, the UUT is considered stable. If the UUT is stable, record the measurements obtained at the end of this 5-minute period. Measure subsequent loading conditions under the same 5-minute stability parameters. Note that only one warm-up period of 30 minutes is required for each UUT at the beginning of the test procedure. If the AC input power is not stable over a 5-minute period, follow the guidelines established by Section 5.3.3 of IEC 62301 for measuring average power or accumulated energy over time for both input and output.
(iii) Test the UUT at the nameplate output voltage(s) at the loading conditions listed in Table 1, derated per the proportional allocation method presented in section 5(a)(1)(iv) of this appendix. Conduct efficiency measurements in sequence from Loading Condition 1 to Loading Condition 4 as indicated in Table 1 of this section. For Loading Condition 5, place the UUT in no-load mode, disconnect any additional signal connections to the UUT, and measure input power.
Table 1—Loading Conditions for Unit Under Test
Loading Condition 1
100% of Derated Nameplate Output Current ±2%.
Loading Condition 2
75% of Derated Nameplate Output Current ±2%.
Loading Condition 3
50% of Derated Nameplate Output Current ±2%.
Loading Condition 4
25% of Derated Nameplate Output Current ±2%.
Loading Condition 5
0%.
Note:
The 2 percent allowance pertains to nameplate output current, not the calculated current value. For example, a UUT at Loading Condition 3 may be tested in a range from 48 percent to 52 percent of the derated output current.
(A) If testing of additional, optional loading conditions is desired, conduct that testing in accordance with this test procedure and subsequent to completing the sequence described in section 5(a)(1)(iii) of this appendix.
(B) Where the external power supply lists both an instantaneous and continuous output current, test the external power supply at the continuous condition only.
(C) If an external power supply cannot sustain output at one or more of the Loading Conditions 1-4 as specified in Table 1 of this section, test the external power supply only at the loading conditions for which it can sustain output.
(iv) Use the following proportional allocation method to provide consistent loading conditions for single-voltage external power supplies with multiple-output busses. For additional explanation (provided for guidance only), please refer to section 6.1.1 of the California Energy Commission's “Generalized Test Protocol for Calculating the Energy Efficiency of Internal Ac-Dc Power Supplies Revision 6.7,” March 2014.
(A) Consider a power supply with N output busses, each with the same nameplate output voltages V

, * * *, V
N
, corresponding output current ratings I

i
V
i
, as follows:
ER19AU22.006
(B) If D ≥1, then loading every port to its nameplate output current does not exceed the overall maximum output power for the power supply. In this case, load each output bus to the percentages of its nameplate output current listed in Table 1 of this section. However, if D
1, it is an indication that loading each port to its nameplate output current will exceed the overall maximum output power for the power supply. In this case, and at each loading condition, load each output bus to the appropriate percentage of its nameplate output current as listed in Table 1, multiplied by the derating factor D.
(v) Test switch-selectable single-voltage external power supplies twice—once at the highest nameplate output voltage and once at the lowest.
(vi) Efficiency calculation. Calculate and record efficiency at each loading point by dividing the UUT's measured active output power at a given loading condition by the active AC input power measured at that loading condition.
(A) Calculate and record average efficiency of the UUT as the arithmetic mean of the efficiency values calculated at Loading Conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Table 1 of this section.
(B) If, when tested, a UUT cannot sustain output current at one or more of the loading conditions as specified in Table 1, the average active-mode efficiency is calculated as the average of the loading conditions for which it can sustain output.
(C) If the UUT can only sustain one output current at any of the output busses, test it at the loading condition that allows for the maximum output power on that bus (
i.e.,
the highest output current possible at the highest output voltage on that bus).
(vii) Power consumption calculation. The power consumption of Loading Condition 5 (no-load) is equal to the active AC input power (W) at that loading condition.
(viii) Off-Mode Measurement. If the UUT incorporates manual on-off switches, place the UUT in off-mode, and measure and record its power consumption at Loading Condition 5 in Table 1 of this section. The measurement of the off-mode energy consumption must conform to the requirements specified in section 5(a)(1) of this appendix, except that all manual on-off switches must be placed in the “off” position for the off-mode measurement. The UUT is considered stable if, over 5 minutes with samples taken at least once every second, the AC input power does not drift from the maximum value observed by more than 1 percent or 50 milliwatts, whichever is greater. Measure the off-mode power consumption of a switch-selectable single-voltage external power supply twice—once at the highest nameplate output voltage and once at the lowest.
(b) Multiple-Voltage External Power Supply.
(1) Standby-Mode and Active-Mode Measurement.
(i) Place in the “on” position any built-in switch in the UUT controlling power flow to the AC input and note the existence of such a switch in the final test report.
(ii) Operate the UUT at 100 percent of nameplate output current for at least 30 minutes immediately prior to conducting efficiency measurements. After this warm-up period, monitor AC input power for a period of 5 minutes to assess the stability of the UUT. If the power level does not drift by more than 1 percent from the maximum value observed, the UUT is considered stable. If the UUT is stable, record the measurements obtained at the end of this 5-minute period. Measure subsequent loading conditions under the same 5-minute stability parameters. Note that only one warm-up period of 30 minutes is required for each UUT at the beginning of the test procedure. If the AC input power is not stable over a 5-minute period, follow the guidelines established by Section 5.3.3 of IEC 62301 for measuring average power or accumulated energy over time for both input and output.
(iii) Test the UUT at the nameplate output voltage(s) at the loading conditions listed in Table 2 of this section, derated per the proportional allocation method presented in section 5(b)(1)(iv) of this appendix. Active or passive loads used for efficiency testing of the UUT must maintain the required current loading set point for each output voltage within an accuracy of ±0.5 percent. Conduct efficiency measurements in sequence from Loading Condition 1 to Loading Condition 4 as indicated in Table 2 of this section. For Loading Condition 5, place the UUT in no-load mode, disconnect any additional signal connections to the UUT, and measure input power.
Table 2—Loading Conditions for Unit Under Test
Loading Condition 1
100% of Derated Nameplate Output Current ±2%.
Loading Condition 2
75% of Derated Nameplate Output Current ±2%.
Loading Condition 3
50% of Derated Nameplate Output Current ±2%.
Loading Condition 4
25% of Derated Nameplate Output Current ±2%.
Loading Condition 5
0%.
Note:
The 2 percent allowance pertains to nameplate output current, not the calculated current value. For example, a UUT at Loading Condition 3 may be tested in a range from 48 percent to 52 percent of the derated output current.
(A) If testing of additional, optional loading conditions is desired, conduct that testing in accordance with this test procedure and subsequent to completing the sequence described in section 5(b)(1)(iii) of this appendix.
(B) Where the external power supply lists both an instantaneous and continuous output current, test the external power supply at the continuous condition only.
(C) If an external power supply cannot sustain output at one or more of the Loading Conditions 1-4 as specified in Table 2 of this section, test the external power supply only at the loading conditions for which it can sustain output.
(iv) Use the following proportional allocation method to provide consistent loading conditions for multiple-voltage external power supplies. For additional explanation (provided for guidance only), please refer to section 6.1.1 of the California Energy Commission's “Proposed Test Protocol for Calculating the Energy Efficiency of Internal Ac-Dc Power Supplies Revision 6.7,” March 2014.
(A) Consider a power supply with N output busses, and nameplate output voltages V
1
, * * *, V
N
, corresponding output current ratings I

, * * *, I
N
, and a maximum output power P as specified on the manufacturer's label on the power supply housing, or, if absent from the housing, as specified in the documentation provided with the unit by the manufacturer. Calculate the derating factor D by dividing the power supply maximum output power P by the sum of the maximum output powers of the individual output busses, equal to the product of bus nameplate output voltage and current I
i
V
i
, as follows:
ER19AU22.007
(B) If D ≥1, then loading every bus to its nameplate output current does not exceed the overall maximum output power for the power supply. In this case, load each output bus to the percentages of its nameplate output current listed in Table 2 of this section. However, if D
1, it is an indication that loading each bus to its nameplate output current will exceed the overall maximum output power for the power supply. In this case, and at each loading condition, load each output bus to the appropriate percentage of its nameplate output current listed in Table 2 of this section, multiplied by the derating factor D.
(v) Minimum output current requirements. Depending on their application, some multiple-voltage power supplies may require a minimum output current for each output bus of the power supply for correct operation. In these cases, ensure that the load current for each output at Loading Condition 4 in Table 2 is greater than the minimum output current requirement. Thus, if the test method's calculated load current for a given voltage bus is smaller than the minimum output current requirement, the minimum output current must be used to load the bus. This load current shall be properly recorded in any test report.
(vi) Efficiency calculation. Calculate and record efficiency at each loading point by dividing the UUT's measured active output power at a given loading condition by the active AC input power measured at that loading condition.
(A) Calculate and record average efficiency of the UUT as the arithmetic mean of the efficiency values calculated at Loading Conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4, in Table 2 of this section.
(B) If, when tested, a UUT cannot sustain output current at one or more of the loading conditions as specified in Table 2 of this section, the average active mode efficiency is calculated as the average of the loading conditions for which it can sustain output.
(C) If the UUT can only sustain one output current at any of the output busses, test it at the loading condition that allows for the maximum output power on that bus (
i.e.,
the highest output current possible at the highest output voltage on that bus).
(vii) Power consumption calculation. The power consumption of Loading Condition 5 (no-load) is equal to the active AC input power (W) at that loading condition.
(2) Off-mode Measurement—If the UUT incorporates manual on-off switches, place the UUT in off-mode and measure and record its power consumption at Loading Condition 5 in Table 2 of this section. The measurement of the off-mode energy consumption must conform to the requirements specified in section (5)(b)(1) of this appendix, except that all manual on-off switches must be placed in the “off” position for the off-mode measurement. The UUT is considered stable if, over 5 minutes with samples taken at least once every second, the AC input power does not drift from the maximum value observed by more than 1 percent or 50 milliwatts, whichever is greater.

# 6.
Test Measurement for Adaptive External Power Supplies:
(a) Single-Voltage Adaptive External Power Supply.
(1) Standby Mode and Active-Mode Measurement.
(i) Place in the “on” position any built-in switch in the UUT controlling power flow to the AC input and note the existence of such a switch in the final test report.
(ii) Operate the UUT at 100 percent of nameplate output current for at least 30 minutes immediately prior to conducting efficiency measurements. After this warm-up period, monitor AC input power for a period of 5 minutes to assess the stability of the UUT. If the power level does not drift by more than 5 percent from the maximum value observed, the UUT is considered stable. If the UUT is stable, record the measurements obtained at the end of this 5-minute period. Measure subsequent loading conditions under the same 5-minute stability parameters. Note that only one warm-up period of 30 minutes is required for each UUT at the beginning of the test procedure. If the AC input power is not stable over a 5-minute period, follow the guidelines established by Section 5.3.3 of IEC 62301 for measuring average power or accumulated energy over time for both input and output.
(iii) Test the UUT at the nameplate output voltage(s) at the loading conditions listed in Table 3 of this section, derated per the proportional allocation method presented in section 6(a)(1)(iv) of this appendix. Adaptive external power supplies must be tested twice—once at the highest nameplate output voltage and once at the lowest nameplate output voltage as described in the following sections.
(A) At the highest nameplate output voltage, test adaptive external power supplies in sequence from Loading Condition 1 to Loading Condition 4, as indicated in Table 3 of this section. For Loading Condition 5, place the UUT in no-load mode, disconnect any additional signal connections, and measure the input power.
(B) At the lowest nameplate output voltage, with the exception of USB-PD EPSs, test all adaptive external power supplies in sequence from Loading Condition 1 to Loading Condition 4, as indicated in Table 3 of this section. For USB-PD adaptive external power supplies, at the lowest nameplate output voltage, test the external power supply such that for Loading Conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4, all adaptive ports are loaded to 2 amperes, 1.5 amperes, 1 ampere, and 0.5 amperes, respectively. All non-adaptive ports will continue to be loaded as indicated in Table 3 of this section. For Loading Condition 5, test all adaptive external power supplies by placing the UUT in no-load mode, disconnecting any additional signal connections, and measuring the input power.

100% of Derated Nameplate Output Current ±2%.
Loading Condition 2
75% of Derated Nameplate Output Current ±2%.
Loading Condition 3
50% of Derated Nameplate Output Current ±2%.

Loading Condition 5
0%.
Note:
The 2 percent allowance pertains to nameplate output current, not the calculated current value. For example, a UUT at Loading Condition 3 may be tested in a range from 48 percent to 52 percent of the derated output current.
(C) If testing of additional, optional loading conditions is desired, conduct that testing in accordance with this test procedure and subsequent to completing the sequence described in section 6(a)(1)(iii) of this appendix.
(D) Where the external power supply lists both an instantaneous and continuous output current, test the external power supply at the continuous condition only.
(E) If an external power supply cannot sustain output at one or more of the Loading Conditions 1-4 as specified in Table 3 of this section, test the external power supply only at the loading conditions for which it can sustain output.
(iv) Use the following proportional allocation method to provide consistent loading conditions for single-voltage adaptive external power supplies with multiple-output busses. For additional explanation, please refer to section 6.1.1 of the California Energy Commission's “Proposed Test Protocol for Calculating the Energy Efficiency of Internal Ac-Dc Power Supplies Revision 6.7,” March 2014.

, and a maximum output power P as specified on the manufacturer's label on the power supply housing, or, if absent from the housing, as specified in the documentation provided with the unit by the manufacturer. Calculate the derating
factor D by dividing the power supply maximum output power P by the sum of the maximum output powers of the individual output busses, equal to the product of port nameplate output voltage and current I

, as follows:
ER19AU22.008
For USB-PD adaptive external power supplies, at the lowest nameplate output voltage, limit the contribution from each port to 10W when calculating the derating factor.
(B) If D ≥1, then loading every port to its nameplate output current does not exceed the overall maximum output power for the power supply. In this case, load each output bus to the percentages of its nameplate output current listed in Table 3 of this section. However, if D
1, it is an indication that loading each port to its nameplate output current will exceed the overall maximum output power for the power supply. In this case, and at each loading condition, each output bus will be loaded to the appropriate percentage of its nameplate output current listed in Table 3 of this section, multiplied by the derating factor D.
(v) Efficiency calculation. Calculate and record the efficiency at each loading point by dividing the UUT's measured active output power at that loading condition by the active AC input power measured at that loading condition.
(A) Calculate and record average efficiency of the UUT as the arithmetic mean of the efficiency values calculated at Loading Conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Table 3 of this section.
(B) If, when tested, a UUT cannot sustain the output current at one or more of the loading conditions as specified in Table 3 of this section, the average active-mode efficiency is calculated as the average of the loading conditions for which it can sustain output.
(C) If the UUT can only sustain one output current at any of the output busses, test it at the loading condition that allows for the maximum output power on that bus (
i.e.,
the highest output current possible at the highest output voltage on that bus).
(vi) Power consumption calculation. The power consumption of Loading Condition 5 (no-load) is equal to the active AC input power (W) at that loading condition.
(2) Off-Mode Measurement—If the UUT incorporates manual on-off switches, place the UUT in off-mode and measure and record its power consumption at Loading Condition 5 in Table 3 of this section. The measurement of the off-mode energy consumption must conform to the requirements specified in section 6(a)(1) of this appendix, except that all manual on-off switches must be placed in the “off” position for the off-mode measurement. The UUT is considered stable if, over 5 minutes with samples taken at least once every second, the AC input power does not drift from the maximum value observed by more than 1 percent or 50 milliwatts, whichever is greater. Measure the off-mode power consumption of a single-voltage adaptive external power supply twice—once at the highest nameplate output voltage and once at the lowest.
(b) Multiple-Voltage Adaptive External Power Supply.
(1) Standby Mode and Active-Mode Measurement.
(i) Place in the “on” position any built-in switch in the UUT controlling power flow to the AC input and note the existence of such a switch in the final test report.
(ii) Operate the UUT at 100 percent of nameplate output current for at least 30 minutes immediately prior to conducting efficiency measurements. After this warm-up period, monitor AC input power for a period of 5 minutes to assess the stability of the UUT. If the power level does not drift by more than 1 percent from the maximum value observed, the UUT is considered stable. If the UUT is stable, record the measurements obtained at the end of this 5-minute period. Measure subsequent loading conditions under the same 5-minute stability parameters. Note that only one warm-up period of 30 minutes is required for each UUT at the beginning of the test procedure. If the AC input power is not stable over a 5-minute period, follow the guidelines established by Section 5.3.3 of IEC 62301 for measuring average power or accumulated energy over time for both input and output.
(iii) Test the UUT at the nameplate output voltage(s) at the loading conditions listed in Table 4 of this section, derated per the proportional allocation method presented in section 6(b)(1)(iv) of this appendix. Active or passive loads used for efficiency testing of the UUT must maintain the required current loading set point for each output voltage within an accuracy of ±0.5 percent. Adaptive external power supplies must be tested twice—once at the highest nameplate output voltage and once at the lowest nameplate output voltage as described in the following sections.
(A) At the highest nameplate output voltage, test adaptive external power supplies in sequence from Loading Condition 1 to Loading Condition 4, as indicated in Table 4 of this section. For Loading Condition 5, place the UUT in no-load mode, disconnect any additional signal connections, and measure the input power.
(B) At the lowest nameplate output voltage, with the exception of USB-PD EPSs, test all other adaptive external power supplies, in sequence from Loading Condition 1 to Loading Condition 4, as indicated in Table 4 of this section. For USB-PD adaptive external power supplies, at the lowest nameplate output voltage, test the external power supply such that for Loading Conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4, all adaptive ports are loaded to 2 amperes, 1.5 amperes, 1 ampere, and 0.5 amperes, respectively. All non-adaptive ports will continue to be loaded as indicated in Table 4 of this section. For Loading Condition 5, test all adaptive external power supplies by placing the UUT in no-load mode, disconnecting any additional signal connections, and measuring the input power.
Table 4—Loading Conditions for a Multiple-Voltage Adaptive External Power Supply
Loading Condition 1
100% of Derated Nameplate Output Current ±2%.
Loading Condition 2
75% of Derated Nameplate Output Current ±2%.
Loading Condition 3
50% of Derated Nameplate Output Current ±2%.
Loading Condition 4
25% of Derated Nameplate Output Current ±2%.
Loading Condition 5
0%.
Note:
The 2 percent allowance pertains to nameplate output current, not the calculated current value. For example, a UUT at Loading Condition 3 may be tested in a range from 48 percent to 52 percent of the derated output current.
(C) If testing of additional, optional loading conditions is desired, conduct that testing in accordance with this test procedure and subsequent to completing the sequence described in section 6(b)(1)(iii) of this appendix.
(D) Where the external power supply lists both an instantaneous and continuous output current, test the external power supply at the continuous condition only.
(E) If an adaptive external power supply is operating as a multiple-voltage external power supply at only the highest nameplate output voltage or lowest nameplate output voltage, test this external power supply as a multiple-voltage adaptive external power supply at both the highest nameplate output voltage and the lowest nameplate output voltage.
(F) If an external power supply has both adaptive and non-adaptive ports, and these ports operate simultaneously at multiple voltages, ensure that testing is performed with all ports active at both the highest and lowest nameplate output voltage. For example, if an external power supply has a USB-PD adaptive output bus that operates at 5 volts and 20 volts and a second non-adaptive output bus that operates at 9 volts, test this EPS at the highest nameplate output voltage with both the adaptive and non-adaptive ports respectively loaded at 20 volts and 9 volts; likewise, test it at the lowest nameplate output voltage with both the adaptive and non-adaptive ports respectively loaded at 5 volts and 9 volts.
(G) If an external power supply cannot sustain output at one or more of the Loading Conditions 1-4 as specified in Table 4 of this section, test the external power supply only at the loading conditions for which it can sustain output.
(iv) Use the following proportional allocation method to provide consistent loading conditions for multiple-voltage adaptive external power supplies. For additional explanation, please refer to section 6.1.1 of the California Energy Commission's “Proposed Test Protocol for Calculating the Energy Efficiency of Internal Ac-Dc Power Supplies Revision 6.7,” March 2014.

, and a maximum output power P as specified on the manufacturer's label on the power supply housing, or, if absent from the housing, as specified in the documentation provided with the unit by the manufacturer.

, as follows:
ER19AU22.009
For USB-PD adaptive external power supplies, at the lowest nameplate output voltage, limit the contribution from each port to 10W when calculating the derating factor.
(B) If D ≥1, then loading every bus to its nameplate output current does not exceed the overall maximum output power for the power supply. In this case, load each output bus to the percentages of its nameplate output current listed in Table 4 of this section. However, if D
1, it is an indication that loading each bus to its nameplate output current will exceed the overall maximum output power for the power supply. In this case, at each loading condition, load each output bus to the appropriate percentage of its nameplate output current listed in Table 4 of this section, multiplied by the derating factor D.
(v) Minimum output current requirements. Depending on their application, some multiple-voltage adaptive external power supplies may require a minimum output current for each output bus of the power supply for correct operation. In these cases, ensure that the load current for each output at Loading Condition 4 in Table 4 of this section is greater than the minimum output current requirement. Thus, if the test method's calculated load current for a given voltage bus is smaller than the minimum output current requirement, use the minimum output current to load the bus. Record this load current in any test report.
(vi) Efficiency calculation. Calculate and record the efficiency at each loading point by dividing the UUT's measured active output power at that loading condition by the active AC input power measured at that loading condition.
(A) Calculate and record average efficiency of the UUT as the arithmetic mean of the efficiency values calculated at Loading Conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Table 4 of this section.
(B) If, when tested, a UUT cannot sustain the output current at one or more of the loading conditions as specified in Table 4, the average active-mode efficiency is calculated as the average of the loading conditions for which it can sustain output.
(C) If the UUT can only sustain one output current at any of the output busses, test it at the loading condition that allows for the maximum output power on that bus (
i.e.,
the highest output current possible at the highest output voltage on that bus).
(vii) Power consumption calculation. The power consumption of Loading Condition 5 (no-load) is equal to the active AC input power at that loading condition.
(2) Off-mode Measurement—If the UUT incorporates manual on-off switches, place the UUT in off-mode, and measure and record its power consumption at Loading Condition 5 in Table 4 of this section. The measurement of the off-mode energy consumption must conform to the requirements specified in section (6)(b)(1) of this appendix, except that all manual on-off switches must be placed in the “off” position for the off-mode measurement. The UUT is considered stable if, over 5 minutes with samples taken at least once every second, the AC input power does not drift from the maximum value observed by more than 1 percent or 50 milliwatts, whichever is greater. Measure the off-mode power consumption of a multiple-voltage adaptive external power supply twice—once at the highest nameplate output voltage and once at the lowest.

7.
Test Conditions.
The testing conditions shall be as specified in section 8, not including sections 8.5.2 and 8.6.1.1 of ASHRAE 103-2017; and as specified in sections 7.1 and 7.2 of this appendix.
7.1
Ambient Temperature and Humidity Conditions.
During the time required to perform all tests, maintain the room temperature within ±5 °F (2.8 °C) of the air temperature value measured at the end of the steady-state performance test (T
RA
). For condensing furnaces and boilers, maintain the relative humidity within ±5% of the relative humidity measured at the end of the steady-state performance test. During all tests, the room temperature shall not fall below 65 °F (18.3 °C) or exceed 85 °F (29.4 °C) and the relative humidity shall not fall below 20% or exceed 80%.
7.2.
Measurement of Jacket Surface Temperature (optional).
The jacket of the furnace or boiler shall be subdivided into 6-inch squares when practical, and otherwise into 36-square-inch regions comprising 4 in. x 9 in. or 3 in. x 12 in. sections, and the surface temperature at the center of each square or section shall be determined with a surface thermocouple. The 36-square-inch areas shall be recorded in groups where the temperature differential of the 36-square-inch area is less than 10 °F for temperature up to 100 °F above room temperature and less than 20 °F for temperature more than 100 °F above room temperature. For forced air central furnaces, the circulating air blower compartment is considered as part of the duct system and no surface temperature measurement of the blower compartment needs to be recorded for the purpose of this test. For downflow furnaces, measure all cabinet surface temperatures of the heat exchanger and combustion section, including the bottom around the outlet duct, and the burner door, using the 36 square-inch thermocouple grid. The cabinet surface temperatures around the blower section do not
need to be measured (
see
Figure 3-E of ASHRAE 103-2017.)

The main burner or electric heating elements shall be turned off. Adjust the external static pressure to within the range shown in table 1 to this appendix. Maintain these settings until steady-state conditions are attained as specified in sections 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 of this appendix. Measure furnace fan electrical input power (E
Max
), external static pressure (ESP
Max

Adjust the external static to within the range shown in table 1 to this appendix. Maintain these settings until steady-state conditions are attained as specified in sections 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5 of this appendix and the temperature rise (ΔT
Max
) is at least 18 °F. Measure furnace fan electrical input power (E
Max
), fuel or electric resistance heat kit input energy (Q

* Once the specified ESP has been achieved, the same outlet duct restrictions shall be used for the remainder of the furnace fan test. If the unit under test is unable to complete the testing (
i.e.,
the unit shuts down before completing a test), reduce the target ESP range by 0.05″ w.c. and restart the test. Repeat this process until the test can be completed.

Ducting components include ducts, connectors for attaching the duct(s) to the test unit, sealing, insulation, and window mounting fixtures. Do not apply additional sealing or insulation. For combined-duct units, the manufacturer must provide the testing facility an adapter that allows for the individual connection of the condenser inlet and outlet airflows to the test facility's airflow measuring apparatuses. Use that adapter to measure the condenser inlet and outlet airflows for any corresponding unit.
3.1.1.2
Single-duct evaporator inlet test conditions.
When testing single-duct portable air conditioners, maintain the evaporator inlet dry-bulb temperature within a range of 1.0 °F with an average difference within 0.3 °F.
3.1.1.3
Condensate Removal.
Set up the test unit in accordance with manufacturer instructions. If the unit has an auto-evaporative feature, keep any provided drain plug installed as shipped and do not provide other means of condensate removal. If the internal condensate collection bucket fills during the
test, halt the test, remove the drain plug, install a gravity drain line, and start the test from the beginning. If no auto-evaporative feature is available, remove the drain plug and install a gravity drain line. If no auto-evaporative feature or gravity drain is available and a condensate pump is included, or if the manufacturer specifies the use of an included condensate pump during cooling mode operation, then test the portable air conditioner with the condensate pump enabled. For units tested with a condensate pump, apply the provisions in Section 7.1.2 of ANSI/AHAM PAC-1-2015 if the pump cycles on and off.
3.1.1.4
Unit Placement.
There shall be no less than 3 feet between any test chamber wall surface and any surface on the portable air conditioner, except the surface or surfaces of the portable air conditioner that include a duct attachment. The distance between the test chamber wall and a surface with one or more duct attachments is prescribed by the test setup requirements in Section 7.3.7 of ANSI/AHAM PAC-1-2015.
3.1.1.5
Electrical supply.
Maintain the input standard voltage at 115 V ±1 percent. Test at the rated frequency, maintained within ±1 percent.
3.1.1.6
Duct temperature measurements.
Install any insulation and sealing provided by the manufacturer. For a dual-duct or single-duct unit, adhere four thermocouples per duct, spaced along the entire length equally, to the outer surface of the duct. Measure the surface temperatures of each duct. For a combined-duct unit, adhere sixteen thermocouples to the outer surface of the duct, spaced evenly around the circumference (four thermocouples, each 90 degrees apart, radially) and down the entire length of the duct (four sets of four thermocouples, evenly spaced along the entire length of the duct), ensuring that the thermocouples are spaced along the entire length equally, on the surface of the combined duct. Place at least one thermocouple preferably adjacent to, but otherwise as close as possible to, the condenser inlet aperture and at least one thermocouple on the duct surface preferably adjacent to, but otherwise as close as possible to, the condenser outlet aperture. Measure the surface temperature of the combined duct at each thermocouple. Temperature measurements must have an error no greater than ±0.5 °F over the range being measured.
3.1.2
Control settings.
For a single-speed unit, set the controls to the lowest available temperature setpoint for cooling mode, as described in section 4.1.1 of this appendix. For a variable-speed unit, set the thermostat setpoint to 75 °F to achieve the full compressor speed and use the manufacturer instructions to achieve the low compressor speed, as described in section 4.1.2 of this appendix. If the portable air conditioner has a user-adjustable fan speed, select the maximum fan speed setting. If the unit has an automatic louver oscillation feature and there is an option to disable that feature, disable that feature throughout testing. If the unit has adjustable louvers, position the louvers parallel with the air flow to maximize air flow and minimize static pressure loss. If the portable air conditioner has network functions, that an end-user can disable and the product's user manual provides instructions on how to do so, disable all network functions throughout testing. If an end-user cannot disable a network function or the product's user manual does not provide instruction for disabling a network function, test the unit with that network function in the factory default configuration for the duration of the test.

# 3.2 Standby Mode and Off Mode
3.2.1
Installation requirements.
For the standby mode and off mode testing, install the portable air conditioner in accordance with Paragraph 5.2 of IEC 62301, referring to Annex D of that standard as necessary. Disregard the provisions regarding batteries and the determination, classification, and testing of relevant modes.
3.2.2
Electrical energy supply.
3.2.2.1
Electrical supply.
For the standby mode and off mode testing, maintain the input standard voltage at 115 V ±1 percent. Maintain the electrical supply at the rated frequency ±1 percent.
3.2.2.2
Supply voltage waveform.
For the standby mode and off mode testing, maintain the electrical supply voltage waveform indicated in, Paragraph 4.3.2 of IEC 62301, referring to Annex D of that standard as necessary.
3.2.3
Standby mode and off mode wattmeter.
The wattmeter used to measure standby mode and off mode power consumption must meet the requirements specified in Paragraph 4.4 of IEC 62301, using a two-tailed confidence interval and referring to Annex D of that standard as necessary.
3.2.4
Standby mode and off mode ambient temperature.
For standby mode and off mode testing, maintain room ambient air temperature conditions as specified in Section 4, Paragraph 4.2 of IEC 62301 (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3).

If an end-user cannot disable a network function or the product's user manual does not provide instruction for disabling a network function, test the unit with that network function in the factory default configuration for the duration of the test.
3.1
Duct temperature measurements.
Install any insulation and sealing provided by the manufacturer. For a dual-duct or single-duct unit, adhere four thermocouples per duct, spaced along the entire length equally, to the outer surface of the duct. Measure the surface temperatures of each duct. For a combined-duct unit, adhere sixteen thermocouples to the outer surface of the duct, spaced evenly around the circumference (four thermocouples, each 90 degrees apart, radially) and down the entire length of the duct (four sets of four thermocouples, evenly spaced along the entire length of the duct), ensuring that the thermocouples are spaced along the entire length equally, on the surface of the combined duct. Place at least one thermocouple preferably adjacent to, but otherwise as close as possible to, the condenser inlet aperture and at least one thermocouple on the duct surface preferably adjacent to, but otherwise as close as possible to, the condenser outlet aperture. Measure the surface temperature of the combined duct at each thermocouple. Temperature measurements must have an error no greater than ±0.5 °F over the range being measured.

# 4. Test Measurement
Follow requirements for test conduct in active and inactive modes of operation in accordance with AHAM PAC-1-2022, section 8, except section 8.1.b, including references to sections 5.4, 6.2, 6.3, 7.3, 7.7, 8.7, 9, 10, and 11 of ASHRAE 37-2009, referring to Figure 12 and Figure 12 Notes of ANSI/AMCA 210 to determine placement of static pressure taps, and including references to ASHRAE 41.1-1986 and ASHRAE 41.6-1994. When conducting cooling mode testing for a variable-speed dual-duct portable air conditioner, use test configurations 1C and 1E in Table 2 of AHAM PAC-1-2022. Conduct the first test in accordance with ambient conditions for test configuration 1C in Table 2 of AHAM PAC-1-2022, and measure cooling capacity (Capacity
DD_95_Full
) and input power (P
DD_95_Full
). Conduct the second test in accordance with the ambient conditions for test configuration 1E in Table 2 of AHAM PAC-1-2022, with the compressor speed set to low for the duration of cooling mode testing (in accordance with the manufacturer instructions as described in section 7.1.10), and measure cooling capacity (Capacity
DD_83_Low
) and input
power (P
DD_83_Low
). When conducting standby power testing using the sampling method described in section 5.3.2 of IEC 62301, if the standby mode is cyclic and irregular or unstable, collect 10 cycles worth of data. As discussed in Paragraph 5.1, Note 1 of IEC 62301, allow sufficient time for the unit to reach the lowest power state before proceeding with the test measurement.

# Appendix DD to Subpart B of Part 430—Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption and Energy Efficiency of General Service Lamps That Are Not General Service Incandescent Lamps, Compact Fluorescent Lamps, or Integrated LED Lamps

# Note:
On or after April 19, 2017, any representations, including certifications of compliance (if required), made with respect to the energy use or efficiency of general service lamps that are not general service incandescent lamps, compact fluorescent lamps, or integrated LED lamps must be made in accordance with the results of testing pursuant to this appendix DD.
1.
Scope:
This appendix DD specifies the test methods required to measure the initial lumen output, input power, lamp efficacy, power factor, and standby mode energy consumption of general service lamps that are not general service incandescent lamps, compact fluorescent lamps, or integrated LED lamps.
2.
Definitions:
Measured initial input power
means the input power to the lamp, measured after the lamp is stabilized and seasoned (if applicable), and expressed in watts (W).
Measured initial lumen output
means the lumen output of the lamp, measured after the lamp is stabilized and seasoned (if applicable), and expressed in lumens (lm).
Power factor
means the measured initial input power (watts) divided by the product of the input voltage (volts) and the input current (amps) measured at the same time as the initial input power.
3. Active Mode Test Procedures
3.1. Take measurements at full light output.
3.2. Do not use a goniophotometer.
3.3. For single base OLED and non-integrated LED lamps, position a lamp in either the base-up and base-down orientation throughout testing. Test an equal number of lamps in the sample in the base-up and base-down orientations, except that, if the manufacturer restricts the orientation, test all of the units in the sample in the manufacturer-specified orientation. For double base OLED and non-integrated LED lamps, test all units in the horizontal orientation except that, if the manufacturer restricts the orientation, test all of the units in the sample in the manufacturer-specified orientation.
3.4. Operate the lamp at the rated voltage throughout testing. For lamps with multiple rated voltages including 120 volts, operate the lamp at 120 volts. If a lamp is not rated for 120 volts, operate the lamp at the highest rated input voltage. For non-integrated LED lamps, operate the lamp at the manufacturer-declared input voltage and current.
3.5. Operate the lamp at the maximum input power. If multiple modes occur at the same maximum input power (such as variable CCT or CRI), the manufacturer may select any of these modes for testing; however, all measurements must be taken at the same selected mode. The manufacturer must indicate in the test report which mode was selected for testing and include detail such that another laboratory could operate the lamp in the same mode.
3.6. To measure initial lumen output, input power, input voltage, and input current use the test procedures in the table in this section.

3.7. Determine initial lamp efficacy by dividing the measured initial lumen output (lumens) by the measured initial input power (watts).
3.8. Determine power factor by dividing the measured initial input power (watts) by the product of the measured input voltage (volts) and measured input current (amps).
4. Standby Mode Test Procedure
4.1. Measure standby mode power only for lamps that are capable of standby mode operation.
4.2. Maintain lamp orientation as specified in section 3.3 of this appendix.
4.3. Connect the lamp to the manufacturer-specified wireless control network (if applicable) and configure the lamp in standby mode by sending a signal to the lamp instructing it to have zero light output. Lamp must remain connected to the network throughout testing.
4.4. Operate the lamp at the rated voltage throughout testing. For lamps with multiple rated voltages including 120 volts, operate the lamp at 120 volts. If a lamp is not rated for 120 volts, operate the lamp at the highest rated input voltage.
4.5. Stabilize the lamp prior to measurement as specified in section 5 of IEC 62301-DD (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3).
4.6. Measure the standby mode power in watts as specified in section 5 of IEC 62301-DD (incorporated by reference; see § 430.3).

3.
Classifications.
Classifications are as specified in section 4 of ASHRAE 103-2017.
4.
Requirements.
Requirements are as specified in section 5 of ASHRAE 103-2017.
5.
Instruments.
Instruments must be as specified in section 6 of ASHRAE 103-2017. In addition to the requirements in Section 6.3 of ASHRAE 103-2017, instruments for oil pressure shall be calibrated so that the error is no greater than ±0.5 psi.
6.
Apparatus.
The apparatus used in conjunction with the boiler during the testing must be as specified in section 7 of ASHRAE 103-2017 except for sections 7.1 and 7.8; and as specified in sections 6.1 and 6.2 of this appendix. In section 7.2.3.1 of ASHRAE 103-2017, substitute “in accordance with the I
O manual” for “in accordance with manufacturer instructions” with regard to installing the stack damper.
6.1
General.
(a) Install the boiler in the test room in accordance with the I
O manual, as defined in section 2.5 of this appendix, except that if provisions within this appendix are specified, then the provisions herein drafted and prescribed by DOE govern. If the I
O manual and any additional provisions of this appendix are not sufficient for testing a boiler, the manufacturer must request a waiver from the test procedure pursuant to § 430.27.
(b) The apparatuses described in section 6 of this appendix are used in conjunction with the boiler during testing. Each piece of apparatus shall conform to material and construction specifications listed in this appendix and in ASHRAE 103-2017, and the reference standards cited in this appendix and in ASHRAE 103-2017.
(c) Test rooms containing equipment must have suitable facilities for providing the utilities (including but not limited to environmental controls, sufficient fluid source(s), applicable measurement equipment, and any other technology or tools) necessary for performance of the test and must be able to maintain conditions within the limits specified in section 6 of this appendix.
6.2
Condensate collection.
Attach condensate drain lines to the unit as specified in the I
O manual. Maintain a continuous downward slope of drain lines from the unit. Additional precautions (such as eliminating any line configuration or position that would otherwise restrict or block the flow of condensate or checking to ensure a proper connection with condensate drain spout that allows for unobstructed flow) must be taken to facilitate uninterrupted flow of condensate during the test. Collection containers must be glass or polished stainless steel to facilitate removal of interior deposits. The collection container must have a vent opening to the atmosphere.
7.
Testing conditions.
The testing conditions must be as specified in section 8 of ASHRAE 103-2017 (except for the excluded sub-sections as enumerated in section 0.1(g) of this appendix); and as specified in sections 7.1 to 7.8 of this appendix, respectively. For condensing furnaces and boilers, the relative humidity of the room air shall be measured in accordance with one of the methods described in ASHRAE 41.6-2014 (see section 8.5 of ASHRAE 103-2017).
7.1
Fuel supply, gas.
In conducting the tests specified herein, gases with characteristics as shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-2017 shall be used. Maintain the gas supply, ahead of all controls for a boiler, at a test pressure between the normal and increased values shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-2017. Maintain the regulator outlet pressure at a level approximating that recommended in
the I
O manual, as defined in section 2.5 of this appendix, or, in the absence of such recommendation, to the regulator settings used when the product is shipped by the manufacturer. Use a gas having a specific gravity of approximately that shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-2017 and with a higher heating value within ±5% of the higher heating value shown in Table 1 of ASHRAE 103-2017. Determine the actual higher heating value in Btu per standard cubic foot of gas (defined in section 2 of this appendix) to be used in the test within an error no greater than 1%.
7.2
Installation of piping.
Install piping equipment in accordance with the I
O manual. In the absence of such specification, install piping in accordance with section 8.3.1.1 of ASHRAE 103-2017.
7.3
Gas burner.
Adjust the burners of gas-fired boilers to their maximum Btu input ratings at the normal test pressure specified by section 7.1 of this appendix. Correct the burner input rate to reflect gas characteristics at a temperature of 60 °F and atmospheric pressure of 30 in of Hg and adjust to within ±2 percent of the hourly Btu nameplate input rating specified by the manufacturer as measured at the maximum input rate during the steady-state performance test in section 8 of this appendix. Set the primary air shutters in accordance with the I
O manual to give a good flame at this condition. If, however, the setting results in the deposit of carbon on the burners during any test specified herein, the tester shall adjust the shutters and burners until no more carbon is deposited and shall perform the tests again with the new settings (
see
Figure 9 of ASHRAE 103-2017). After the steady-state performance test has been started, do not make additional adjustments to the burners during the required series of performance tests specified in section 9 of ASHRAE 103-2017. If a vent-limiting means is provided on a gas pressure regulator, keep it in place during all tests.
7.4
Modulating gas burner adjustment at reduced input rate.
For gas-fired boilers equipped with modulating-type controls, adjust the controls to operate the unit at the nameplate minimum input rate. If the modulating control is of a non-automatic type, adjust the control to the setting recommended in the I
O manual. In the absence of such recommendation, the midpoint setting of the non-automatic control shall be used as the setting for determining the reduced fuel input rate. Start the boiler by turning the safety control valve to the “ON” position. Use a supply water temperature that will allow for continuous operation without shutoff by the control. If necessary to achieve such continuous operation, supply water may be increased above 120 °F; in such cases, gradually increase the supply water temperature to determine what minimum supply water temperature, with a 20 °F temperature rise across the boiler, will be needed to adjust for the minimum input rate at the reduced input rate control setting. Monitor regulated gas pressure out of the modulating control valve (or entering the burner) to determine when no further reduction of gas pressure results. The flow rate of water through the boiler shall be adjusted to achieve a 20 °F temperature rise.
7.5
Oil burner.
Adjust the burners of oil-fired boilers to give a CO
2
reading specified in the I
O manual and an hourly Btu input within ±2% of the hourly Btu nameplate input rating as specified in the I
O manual and as measured at maximum input rate during steady-state performance test as described in section 8 of this appendix. Smoke in the flue may not exceed a No. 1 smoke during the steady-state performance test as measured by the procedure in ASTM D2156-09 (R2018). Maintain the average draft over the fire and in the flue during the steady-state performance test at the value specified in the I
O manual. Do not allow draft fluctuations exceeding 0.005 in. water. Do not make additional adjustments to the burner during the required series of performance tests. The instruments and measuring apparatus for this test are described in section 6 of this appendix and shown in Figure 8 of ASHRAE 103-2017.
7.6
Measurement of jacket surface temperature.
Divide the jacket of the boiler into 6-inch squares when practical, and otherwise into 36-square-inch regions comprising 4 inch by 9 inch or 3 inch by 12 inch sections, and determine the surface temperature at the center of each square or section with a surface thermocouple. Record the surface temperature of the 36-square-inch areas in groups where the temperature differential of the 36-square-inch areas is less than 10 °F for temperature up to 100 °F above room temperature, and less than 20 °F for temperatures more than 100 °F above room temperature.
7.7
Installation of vent system.
Keep the vent or air intake system supplied by the manufacturer in place during all tests. Test units intended for installation with a variety of vent pipe lengths with the minimum vent length as specified in the I
O manual, or a 5-ft. flue pipe if there are no recommendations in the I
O manual. Do not connect a boiler employing a direct vent system to a chimney or induced-draft source. Vent combustion products solely by using the venting incorporated in the boiler and the vent or air intake system supplied by the manufacturer. For units that are not designed to significantly preheat the incoming air, see section 7.5 of this appendix and Figure 4a or 4b in section 7 of ASHRAE 103-2017. For units that do significantly preheat the incoming air,
see
Figure 4c or 4d in section 7 of ASHRAE 103-2017.
7.8
Additional optional method of testing for determining D
P
and D
F
. On units whose design is such that there is no measurable airflow through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger when the burner(s) is (are) off as determined by the optional test procedure in section 7.8.1 of this appendix, D
F
and D
P
may be set equal to 0.05.
7.8.1
Optional test method for indicating the absence of flow through the heat exchanger.
Manufacturers may use the following test protocol to determine whether air flows through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger when the burner(s) is (are) off. The minimum default draft factor may be used only for units determined pursuant to this protocol to have no airflow through the combustion chamber and heat exchanger.
7.8.1.1
Test apparatus.
Use a smoke stick that produces smoke that is easily visible and has a density less than or approximately equal to air. Use a smoke stick that produces smoke that is non-toxic to the test personnel and produces gas that is unreactive with the environment in the test chamber.
7.8.1.2
Test conditions.
Minimize all air currents and drafts in the test chamber, including turning off ventilation if the test chamber is mechanically ventilated. Wait at least two minutes following the termination of the boiler on-cycle before beginning the optional test method for indicating the absence of flow through the heat exchanger.
7.8.1.3
Location of the test apparatus.
After all air currents and drafts in the test chamber have been eliminated or minimized, position the smoke stick based on the following equipment configuration:
(a) For horizontal combustion air intakes, approximately 4 inches from the vertical plane at the termination of the intake vent and 4 inches below the bottom edge of the combustion air intake; or
(b) for vertical combustion air intakes, approximately 4 inches horizontal from vent perimeter at the termination of the intake vent and 4 inches down (parallel to the vertical axis of the vent). In the instance where the boiler combustion air intake is closer than 4 inches to the floor, place the smoke device directly on the floor without impeding the flow of smoke.
7.8.1.4
Duration of test.
Establish the presence of smoke from the smoke stick and then monitor the direction of the smoke flow for no less than 30 seconds.
7.8.1.5
Test results.
During visual assessment, determine whether there is any draw of smoke into the combustion air intake vent.
If absolutely no smoke is drawn into the combustion air intake, the boiler meets the requirements to allow use of the minimum default draft factor provided in section 7.8 of this appendix.
If there is any smoke drawn into the intake, proceed with the methods of testing as prescribed in section 8.8 of ASHRAE 103-2017.
7.8.2 [Reserved]
8.
Test procedure.
Conduct testing and measurements as specified in Section 9 of ASHRAE 103-2017 (except for the excluded sub-sections as enumerated in section 0.1(h) of this appendix); and as specified in sections 8.1 through 8.9 of this appendix. Section 8.4 of this appendix may be used in lieu of section 9.2 of ASHRAE 103-2017.
8.1
Fuel input.
For gas units, measure and record the steady-state gas input rate in Btu/h, including pilot gas, corrected to standard conditions of 60 °F and 30 in. Hg. Use measured values of gas temperature and pressure at the meter and barometric pressure to correct the metered gas flow rate to the above standard conditions. For oil units, measure and record the steady-state fuel input rate. For maximum input rate, the measured burner input rate shall be within ±2% of the hourly Btu nameplate input rating (Q
IN
) specified by the manufacturer. For modulating furnaces and boilers operating at reduced input rate, the measured reduced heat input rate (Q
IN,R
) shall be recorded. At the discretion of the one testing, the hourly Btu nameplate minimum input rating specified by the manufacturer may be used in the calculations in place of Q
IN,R
if the measured rate is within ±2% of the nameplate rating.
8.2
Electrical input.
During the steady-state test, perform a single measurement of all of the electrical power involved in burner operation (PE), including energizing the ignition system, controls, gas valve or oil control valve, and draft inducer, if applicable. For boilers, the measurement of PE must include the boiler pump if so equipped. If the boiler pump does not operate during the measurement of PE, add the boiler pump nameplate power to the measurement of PE. If the boiler pump nameplate power is not available, use 0.13 kW. For hot water boilers, use the circulating water pump nameplate power for BE, or if the pump nameplate power is not available, use 0.13 kW.
8.3
Input to interrupted ignition device.
For burners equipped with an interrupted ignition device, record the nameplate electric power used by the ignition device, PE
IG
, or record that PE
IG
= 0.4 kW if no nameplate power input is provided. Record the nameplate ignition device on-time interval, t
IG
, or, if the nameplate does not provide the ignition device on-time interval, measure the on-time interval with a stopwatch at the beginning of the test, starting when the burner is turned on. Set t
IG
= 0 and PE
IG
= 0 if the device on-time interval is less than or equal to 5 seconds after the burner is on.
8.4
Cycling Test Requirements.
For the measurement of condensate heat loss under cyclic conditions (for condensing boilers), section 9.8 of ASHRAE 103-2017 shall apply.
Cycle times calculated from Table 7 of ASHRAE 103-2017 shall be rounded to the nearest second.
8.5
Optional test procedures for condensing boilers, measurement of condensate during the establishment of steady-state conditions.
For units with step-modulating or two-stage controls, conduct the test at both the maximum and reduced inputs. In lieu of collecting the condensate immediately after the steady state conditions have been reached as required by section 9.2 of ASHRAE 103-2017, condensate may be collected during the establishment of steady state conditions as defined by section 9.1.2.1 of ASHRAE 103-2017. Perform condensate collection for at least 30 minutes. Measure condensate mass immediately at the end of the collection period to prevent evaporation loss from the sample. Record fuel input for the 30-minute condensate collection test period. Observe and record fuel higher heating value (HHV), temperature, and pressures necessary for determining fuel energy input (Q
C,SS
). Measure the fuel quantity and HHV with errors no greater than 1%. The humidity for the room air shall at no time exceed 80%. Determine the mass of condensate for the establishment of steady state conditions (M
C,SS
) in pounds by subtracting the tare container weight from the total container and condensate weight measured at the end of the 30-minute condensate collection test period.
8.6
Cool-down test for gas- and oil-fueled boilers without stack dampers.
After steady-state testing has been completed, turn the main burner(s) “OFF” and measure the flue gas temperature at 3.75 minutes (temperature designated as T
F,OFF
(t
3
)) and 22.5 minutes (temperature designated as T
F,OFF
(t
4
)) after the burner shut-off using the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ASHRAE 103-2017.
a. During this off-period, for units that do not have pump delay after shut-off, do not allow any water to circulate through the hot water boilers.
b. For units that have pump delay on shut-off, except those having pump controls sensing water temperature, the unit control must stop the pump. Measure and record the time between burner shut-off and pump shut-off (t
+
) to the nearest second.
c. For units having pump delay controls that sense water temperature, operate the pump for 15 minutes and record t
+
as 15 minutes. While the pump is operating, maintain the inlet water temperature and flow rate at the same values as used during the steady-state test, as specified in sections 9.1 and 8.4.2.3 of ASHRAE 103-2017.
d. For boilers that employ post-purge, measure the length of the post-purge period with a stopwatch. Record the time from burner “OFF” to combustion blower “OFF” (electrically de-energized) as t
P
. Measure the flue gas temperature by means of the thermocouple grid described in section 7.6 of ASHRAE 103-2017 at the end of the post-purge period t
P
(T
F,OFF
(t
P
)) and at (3.75 + t
P
) minutes (T
F,OFF
(t
3
)) and (22.5 + t
P
) minutes (T
F,OFF
(t
4
)) after the main burner shuts off. If t
P
is prescribed by the I
O manual or measured to be greater than 3 minutes, also measure the flue gas temperature at the midpoint of the post-purge period t
P
/2 (T
F,OFF
(t
P
/2)). If the measured t
P
is less than or equal to 30 seconds, record t
P
as 0 and conduct the cool-down test as if there is no post-purge.
