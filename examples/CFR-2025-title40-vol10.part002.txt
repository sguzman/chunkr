(1) For incinerators and small, remote incinerators: CEMS data collected during the first hours of operation of a CISWI startup from a cold start until waste is fed into the unit and the hours of operation following the cessation of waste material being fed to the CISWI during a unit shutdown. For each startup event, the length of time that CEMS data may be claimed as being CEMS data during startup must be 48 operating hours or less. For each shutdown event, the length of time that CEMS data may be claimed as being CEMS data during shutdown must be 24 operating hours or less;
(2) For energy recovery units: CEMS data collected during the startup or shutdown periods of operation. Startup begins with either the first-ever firing of fuel in a boiler or process heater for the purpose of supplying useful thermal energy (such as steam or heat) for heating, cooling, or process purposes, or producing electricity, or the firing of fuel in a boiler or process heater for any purpose after a shutdown event. Startup ends four hours after when the boiler or process heater makes useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) for heating, cooling, or process purposes, or generates electricity, whichever is earlier. Shutdown begins when the boiler or process heater no longer makes useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) for heating, cooling, or process purposes and/or generates electricity or when no fuel is being fed to the boiler or process heater, whichever is earlier. Shutdown ends when the boiler or process heater no longer makes useful thermal energy (such as steam or heat) for heating, cooling, or process purposes and/or generates electricity, and no fuel is being combusted in the boiler or process heater; and
(3) For waste-burning kilns: CEMS data collected during the periods of kiln operation that do not include normal operations.
Startup
means the time from when a shutdown kiln first begins firing fuel until it begins producing clinker. Startup begins when a shutdown kiln turns on the induced draft fan and begins firing fuel in the main burner.

In-line kiln/raw mill
means a system in a Portland Cement production process where a dry kiln system is integrated with the raw mill so that all or a portion of the kiln exhaust gases are used to perform the drying operation of the raw mill, with no auxiliary heat source used. In this system the kiln is capable of operating without the raw mill operating, but the raw mill cannot operate without the kiln gases, and consequently, the raw mill does not generate a separate exhaust gas stream.
Kiln
means an oven or furnace, including any associated preheater or precalciner devices, in-line raw mills, in-line coal mills, or alkali bypasses used for processing a substance by burning, firing, or drying. Kilns include cement kilns that produce clinker by heating limestone and other materials for subsequent production of Portland Cement. Because the alkali bypass, in-line raw mill, and in-line coal mill are considered an integral part of the kiln, the kiln emissions limits also apply to the exhaust of the alkali bypass, in-line raw mill, and in-line coal mill.
Laboratory analysis unit
means units that burn samples of materials for the purpose of chemical or physical analysis. A laboratory analysis unit is not an incinerator, waste-burning kiln, an energy recovery unit or a small, remote incinerator under this subpart.

(f) If you prefer to use an alternative sulfur dioxide monitoring method, such as parametric monitoring, or cannot monitor emissions at the inlet of the air pollution control device to determine percent reduction, you can apply to the Administrator for approval to use an alternative monitoring method under § 60.13(i) of subpart A of 40 CFR part 60.
§ 62.15180
How are the data from the continuous emission monitoring systems used?
You must use data from the continuous emission monitoring systems for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide to demonstrate continuous compliance with the applicable emission limits specified in tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash, see § 62.15235.
§ 62.15185
How do I make sure my continuous emission monitoring systems are operating correctly?
(a) Conduct initial, daily, quarterly, and annual evaluations of your continuous emission monitoring systems that measure oxygen (or carbon dioxide), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal waste combustion units only), and carbon monoxide.
(b) Complete your initial evaluation of the continuous emission monitoring systems within 180 days after your final compliance date.
(c) For initial and annual evaluations, collect data concurrently (or within 30 to 60 minutes) using your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) continuous
emission monitoring system, your sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or carbon monoxide continuous emission monitoring systems, as appropriate, and the appropriate test methods specified in table 6 of this subpart. Collect these data during each initial and annual evaluation of your continuous emission monitoring systems following the applicable performance specifications in appendix B of 40 CFR part 60. Table 7 of this subpart shows the performance specifications that apply to each continuous emission monitoring system.
(d) Follow the quality assurance procedures in Procedure 1 of appendix F of 40 CFR part 60 for each continuous emission monitoring system. These procedures include daily calibration drift and quarterly accuracy determinations.
§ 62.15190
Am I exempt from any 40 CFR part 60 appendix B or appendix F requirements to evaluate continuous emission monitoring systems?
Yes, the accuracy tests for your sulfur dioxide continuous emission monitoring system require you to also evaluate your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system. Therefore, your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system is exempt from two requirements:
(a) Section 2.3 of Performance Specification 3 in appendix B of 40 CFR part 60 (relative accuracy requirement).
(b) Section 5.1.1 of appendix F of 40 CFR part 60 (relative accuracy test audit).
§ 62.15195
What is my schedule for evaluating continuous emission monitoring systems?
(a) Conduct annual evaluations of your continuous emission monitoring systems no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation was conducted.
(b) Evaluate your continuous emission monitoring systems daily and quarterly as specified in appendix F of 40 CFR part 60.
§ 62.15200
What must I do if I choose to monitor carbon dioxide instead of oxygen as a diluent gas?
You must establish the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide during the initial evaluation of your continuous emission monitoring system. You may reestablish the relationship during annual evaluations. To establish the relationship use three procedures:
(a) Use EPA Reference Method 3A or 3B in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60 to determine oxygen concentration at the location of your carbon dioxide monitor.
(b) Conduct at least three test runs for oxygen. Make sure each test run represents a 1-hour average and that sampling continues for at least 30 minutes in each hour.
(c) Use the fuel-factor equation in EPA Reference Method 3B to determine the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide.
§ 62.15205
What minimum amount of monitoring data must I collect with my continuous emission monitoring systems and is this requirement enforceable?
(a) Where continuous emission monitoring systems are required, obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages. Make sure the averages for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal waste combustion units only), and carbon monoxide are in parts per million by dry volume at 7 percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level). Use the 1-hour averages of oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data from your continuous emission monitoring system to determine the actual oxygen (or carbon dioxide) level and to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level).
(b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) of subpart A of 40 CFR part 60 requires your continuous emission monitoring systems to complete at least one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute period.
(c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for 75 percent of the operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.
(d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, you are in violation
of this data collection requirement regardless of the emission level monitored, and you must notify the Administrator according to § 62.15340(e).
(e) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, you must still use all valid data from the continuous emission monitoring systems in calculating emission concentrations and percent reductions in accordance with § 62.15210.
§ 62.15210
How do I convert my 1-hour arithmetic averages into appropriate averaging times and units?
(a) Use the equation in § 62.15390(a) to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen.
(b) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, section 4.3, to calculate the daily geometric average concentrations of sulfur dioxide emissions. If you are monitoring the percent reduction of sulfur dioxide, use EPA Reference Method 19, section 5.4, to determine the daily geometric average percent reduction of potential sulfur dioxide emissions.
(c) If you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, use EPA Reference Method 19, section 4.1, to calculate the daily arithmetic average for concentrations of nitrogen oxides.
(d) Use EPA Reference Method 19, section 4.1, to calculate the 4-hour or 24-hour daily block averages (as applicable) for concentrations of carbon monoxide.
§ 62.15215
What is required for my continuous opacity monitoring system and how are the data used?
(a) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous opacity monitoring system.

(d) Complete each annual evaluation of your continuous opacity monitoring system no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation.
(e) Use tests conducted according to EPA Reference Method 9, as specified in § 62.15245, to determine compliance with the applicable opacity limit in tables 2 or 4 of this subpart. The data obtained from your continuous opacity monitoring system are not used to determine compliance with the opacity limit.
§ 62.15220
What additional requirements must I meet for the operation of my continuous emission monitoring systems and continuous opacity monitoring system?
Use the required span values and applicable performance specifications in table 8 of this subpart.
§ 62.15225
What must I do if my continuous emission monitoring system is temporarily unavailable to meet the data collection requirements?
Refer to table 8 of this subpart. It shows alternate methods for collecting data when these systems malfunction or when repairs, calibration checks, or zero and span checks keep you from collecting the minimum amount of data.

# Stack Testing
§ 62.15230
What types of stack tests must I conduct?
Conduct initial and annual stack tests to measure the emission levels of dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.
§ 62.15235
How are the stack test data used?
You must use results of stack tests for dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limits in tables 2 and 4 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, see § 62.15180.
§ 62.15240
What schedule must I follow for the stack testing?
(a) Conduct initial stack tests for the pollutants listed in § 62.15230 by 180 days after your final compliance date.
(b) Conduct annual stack tests for these pollutants after the initial stack test. Conduct each annual stack test no later than 13 months after the previous stack test.
§ 62.15245
What test methods must I use to stack test?
(a) Follow table 8 of this subpart to establish the sampling location and to determine pollutant concentrations, number of traverse points, individual test methods, and other specific testing requirements for the different pollutants.
(b) Make sure that stack tests for all these pollutants consist of at least three test runs, as specified in § 60.8 (Performance Tests) of subpart A of 40 CFR part 60. Use the average of the pollutant emission concentrations from the three test runs to determine compliance with the applicable emission limits in tables 2 and 4 of this subpart.
(c) Obtain an oxygen (or carbon dioxide) measurement at the same time as your pollutant measurements to determine diluent gas levels, as specified in § 62.15175.
(d) Use the equations in § 62.15390(a) to calculate emission levels at 7 percent oxygen (or an equivalent carbon dioxide basis), the percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions, and the reduction efficiency for mercury emissions. See the individual test methods in table 6 of this subpart for other required equations.
(e) You can apply to the Administrator for approval under § 60.8(b) of subpart A of 40 CFR part 60 to
(1) Use a reference method with minor changes in methodology;
(2) Use an equivalent method;
(3) Use an alternative method the results of which the Administrator has determined are adequate for demonstrating compliance;
(4) Waive the requirement for a performance test because you have demonstrated by other means that you are in compliance; or
(5) Use a shorter sampling time or smaller sampling volume.
§ 62.15250
May I conduct stack testing less often?
(a) You may test less often if you own or operate a Class II municipal waste combustion unit and if all stack tests for a given pollutant over 3 consecutive years show you comply with the emission limit. In this case, you are not required to conduct a stack test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. However, you must conduct another stack test within 36 months of the anniversary date of the third consecutive stack test that shows you comply with the emission limit. Thereafter, you must perform stack tests every third year but no later than 36 months following the previous stack tests. If a stack test shows noncompliance with an emission limit, you must conduct annual stack tests for that pollutant until all stack tests over 3 consecutive years show compliance with the emission limit for that pollutant. This provision applies to all pollutants subject to stack testing requirements: dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.
(b) You can test less often for dioxins/furans emissions if you own or operate a municipal waste combustion plant that meets two conditions. First, you have multiple municipal waste combustion units onsite that are subject to this subpart. Second, all these municipal waste combustion units have demonstrated levels of dioxins/furans emissions less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, for 2 consecutive years. In this case, you may choose to conduct annual stack tests on only one municipal waste combustion unit per year at your plant. This provision only applies to stack testing for dioxins/furans emissions.
(1) Conduct the stack test no more than 13 months following a stack test on any municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart at your plant. Each year, test a different municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart and test all municipal waste combustion units subject to this
subpart in a sequence that you determine. Once you determine a testing sequence, it must not be changed without approval by the Administrator.
(2) If each annual stack test shows levels of dioxins/furans emissions less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, you may continue stack tests on only one municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart per year.
(3) If any annual stack test indicates levels of dioxins/furans emissions greater than 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, conduct subsequent annual stack tests on all municipal waste combustion units subject to this subpart at your plant. You may return to testing one municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart per year if you can demonstrate dioxins/furans emission levels less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, for all municipal waste combustion units at your plant subject to this subpart for 2 consecutive years.
§ 62.15255
May I deviate from the 13-month testing schedule if unforeseen circumstances arise?
You may not deviate from the 13-month testing schedules specified in §§ 62.15240(b) and 62.15250(b)(1) unless you apply to the Administrator for an alternative schedule, and the Administrator approves your request for alternate scheduling prior to the date on which you would otherwise have been required to conduct the next stack test.

ER31JA03.000
Where:
C
7%
= concentration corrected to 7 percent oxygen.
C
unc
= uncorrected pollutant concentration.
C
O2
= concentration of oxygen (%).
(b)

Hg
= percent reduction of potential mercury emissions
E
i
= mercury emission concentration as measured at the air pollution control device inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry basis

(d)
Capacity of a municipal waste combustion unit.
For a municipal waste combustion unit that can operate continuously for 24-hour periods, calculate the capacity of the municipal waste combustion unit based on 24 hours of operation at the maximum charge rate. To determine the maximum charge rate, use one of two methods:
(1) For municipal waste combustion units with a design based on heat input capacity, calculate the maximum charging rate based on this maximum heat input capacity and one of two heating values:
(i) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts refuse-derived fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram (5,500 British thermal units per pound).
(ii) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts municipal solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram (4,500 British thermal units per pound).
(2) For municipal waste combustion units with a design not based on heat input capacity, use the maximum designed charging rate.
(e)
Capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit.
Calculate the capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit as the maximum design amount of municipal solid waste they can charge per batch multiplied by the maximum number of batches they can process in 24 hours. Calculate this maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the number of hours needed to process one batch. Retain fractional batches in the calculation. For example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the municipal waste combustion unit can combust 24/16, or 1.5 batches, in 24 hours.
(f)
Quarterly carbon usage.
If you use activated carbon to comply with the dioxins/furans or mercury limits, calculate the required quarterly usage of carbon using equation 4 or 5 of this section for plant basis or unit basis:
(1) Plant basis.
ER31JA03.003
Where:
C = required quarterly carbon usage for the plant in kilograms (or pounds).
f
i
= required carbon feed rate for the municipal waste combustion unit in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. This is the average carbon feed rate during the most recent
mercury or dioxins/furans stack tests (whichever has a higher feed rate).

C = required quarterly carbon usage for the unit in kilograms (or pounds).
f = required carbon feed rate for the municipal waste combustion unit in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. This is the average carbon feed rate during the most recent mercury or dioxins/furans stack tests (whichever has a higher feed rate).
h = number of hours the municipal waste combustion unit was in operation during the calendar quarter (hours).

# Subpart LLL—Federal Plan Requirements for Sewage Sludge Incineration Units Constructed on or Before October 14, 2010

# Source:
81 FR 26063, Apr. 29, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

# Applicability
§ 62.15855
Am I subject to this subpart?
(a) You are subject to this subpart if your SSI unit meets all three criteria described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) You own or operate an SSI unit(s) that commenced construction on or before October 14, 2010.
(2) You own or operate an SSI unit(s) that meet the definition of an SSI unit as defined in § 62.16045.
(3) You own or operate an SSI unit(s) not exempt under § 62.15860.
(b) If you own or operator an SSI unit(s) and make changes that meet the definition of modification after September 21, 2011, the SSI unit becomes subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart LLLL, and the federal plan no longer applies to that unit.
(c) If you own or operate an SSI unit(s) and make physical or operational changes to the SSI unit(s) for which construction commenced on or before September 21, 2011 primarily to comply with the federal plan, 40 CFR part 60, subpart LLLL, does not apply to the unit(s). Such changes do not qualify as modifications under 40 CFR part 60, subpart LLLL.
§ 62.15860
What SSI units are exempt from the federal plan?
This subpart exempts combustion units that incinerate sewage sludge and are not located at a wastewater treatment facility designed to treat domestic sewage sludge. These units may be subject to another subpart of this part (
e.g.,
subpart III of this part). If you own or operate such a combustion unit, you must notify the Administrator of an exemption claim under this section.
§ 62.15865
How do I determine if my SSI unit is covered by an approved and effective state or tribal plan?
This part contains a list of all states and tribal areas with approved Clean Air Act (CAA) section 111(d)/129 plans in effect. However, this part is only updated once a year. Thus, if this part does not indicate that your state or tribal area has an approved and effective plan, you should contact your state environmental agency's air director or your EPA regional office to determine if approval occurred since publication of the most recent version of this part. A state may also meet its CAA section 111(d)/129 obligations by submitting an acceptable written request for delegation of the federal plan that meets the requirements of this section. This is the only other option for a state to meet its 111(d)/129 obligations.
(a) An acceptable federal plan delegation request must include the following:
(1) A demonstration of adequate resources and legal authority to administer and enforce the federal plan.
(2) The items under § 60.5015(a)(1), (2), and (7) of this chapter.
(3) Certification that the hearing on the state delegation request, similar to the hearing for a state plan submittal, was held, a list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each presentation or written submission.
(4) A commitment to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Regional Administrator who sets forth the terms, conditions and effective date of the delegation and that serves as the mechanism for the transfer of authority. Additional guidance and information is given in the EPA's “Delegations Manual, Item 7-139, Implementation and Enforcement of 111(d)(2) and 111(d)(2)/129(b)(3) federal plans.”
(b) A state with an already approved SSI CAA section 111(d)/129 state plan is not precluded from receiving EPA approval of a delegation request for the federal plan, providing the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and at the time of the delegation request, the state also requests withdrawal of the EPA's previous state plan approval.
(c) A state's CAA section 111(d)/129 obligations are separate from its obligations under title V of the CAA.
§ 62.15870
If my SSI unit is not listed on the federal plan inventory, am I exempt from this subpart?
Not necessarily. Sources subject to this subpart include, but are not limited to, the inventory of sources listed in Docket ID Number EPA-HQ-OAR-2012-0319 for the federal plan. Review the applicability of § 62.15855 to determine if you are subject to this subpart.

# Compliance Schedules

(a) Meet the applicable operating limits and requirements in § 60.4850 of this chapter, and establish applicable operating limits according to § 62.15985; and
(b) Petition the Administrator for specific operating parameters, operating limits, and averaging periods to be established during the initial performance test and to be monitored continuously thereafter.
(1) You are responsible for submitting any supporting information in a timely manner to enable the Administrator to consider the application prior to the performance test. You must not conduct the initial performance test until after the petition has been approved by the Administrator, and you must comply with the operating limits
as written, pending approval by the Administrator. Neither submittal of an application, nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove the application relieves you of the responsibility to comply with any provision of this subpart;
(2) Your petition must include the five items listed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section:
(i) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to monitor;
(ii) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of regulated pollutants change with changes in these parameters, and how limits on these parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated pollutants;
(iii) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower values for these parameters that will establish the operating limits on these parameters, including a discussion of the averaging periods associated with those parameters for determining compliance;
(iv) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments; and
(v) A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring these parameters.
§ 62.15970
Do the emission limits, emission standards, and operating limits apply during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction?
The emission limits and standards apply at all times and during periods of malfunction. The operating limits apply at all times that sewage sludge is in the combustion chamber (
i.e.,
until the sewage sludge feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the sewage sludge incineration residence time). For determining compliance with the CO concentration limit using CO CEMS, the correction to 7-percent oxygen does not apply during periods of startup or shutdown. Use the measured CO concentration without correcting for oxygen concentration in averaging with other CO concentrations (corrected to 7-percent O
2
) to determine the 24-hour average value.
§ 62.15975
[Reserved]

# Initial Compliance Requirements
§ 62.15980
How and when do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits and standards?
To demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits and standards in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, use the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In lieu of using the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section, you have the option to demonstrate initial compliance using the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead and fugitive emissions from ash handling. You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as applicable, and paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, according to the performance testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements in § 62.16015(a) and (b).
(a) Demonstrate initial compliance using the performance test required in § 60.8 of this chapter. You must demonstrate that your SSI unit meets the emission limits and standards specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead and fugitive emissions from ash handling using the performance test. The initial performance test must be conducted using the test methods, averaging methods, and minimum sampling volumes or durations specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart and according to the testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements specified in § 62.16015(a).
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, you must demonstrate that your SSI unit meets the emission limits and standards specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart by the final compliance date (see Table 1 to this subpart).
(2) You may use the results from a performance test conducted within the 2 previous years that was conducted under the same conditions and demonstrated compliance with the emission limits and standards in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, provided no process changes have been made since you conducted that performance test. However, you must continue to meet the operating limits established during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance with the emission limits and standards in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart. The performance test must have used the test methods specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart.
(b) Demonstrate initial compliance using a continuous emissions monitoring system or continuous automated sampling system. The option to use a continuous emissions monitoring system for hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium or lead is published in the
Federal Register.
The option to use a continuous automated sampling system for dioxins/furans takes effect on the date a final performance specification for such a continuous automated sampling system is published in the
Federal Register.
Collect data as specified in § 62.16015(b)(6) and use the following procedures:
(1) To demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limits specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium and lead, you may substitute the use of a continuous monitoring system in lieu of conducting the initial performance test required in paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:
(i) You may substitute the use of a continuous emissions monitoring system for any pollutant specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in lieu of conducting the initial performance test for that pollutant in paragraph (a) of this section. For determining compliance with the carbon monoxide concentration limit using carbon monoxide CEMS, the correction to 7-percent oxygen does not apply during periods of startup or shutdown.

If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs or has occurred for which you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must notify the Administrator in writing as specified in § 62.16030(f). You must conduct the initial performance test as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs. The Administrator will determine whether or not to grant the extension to the initial performance test deadline and will notify you in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable. Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator, you remain strictly subject to the requirements of this subpart.

# Continuous Compliance Requirements
§ 62.16000
How and when do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits and standards?
To demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits and standards specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, use the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In lieu of using the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section, you have the option to demonstrate initial compliance using the procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium, lead and fugitive emissions from ash handling. You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as applicable, and paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, according to the performance testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements in § 62.16015(a) and (b). You may also petition the Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters as specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
(a) Demonstrate continuous compliance using a performance test. Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (e) of this section, following the date that the initial performance test for each pollutant in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart is completed, you must conduct a performance test for each such pollutant on an annual basis (between 11 and 13 calendar months following the previous performance test). The performance test must be conducted using the test methods, averaging methods, and minimum sampling volumes or durations specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart and according to the testing, monitoring and calibration requirements specified in § 62.16015(a).
(1) You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to establish new values for the operating limits to apply from that point forward. The Administrator may request a repeat performance test at any time.
(2) You must repeat the performance test within 60 days of a process change, as defined in § 62.16045.
(3) Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, you can conduct performance tests less often for a given pollutant, as specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) You can conduct performance tests less often if your performance tests for the pollutant for at least 2 consecutive years show that your emissions are at or below 75-percent of the emission limit specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, and there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions. In this case, you do not have to conduct a
performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test during the third year and no more than 37 months after the previous performance test.
(ii) If your SSI unit continues to meet the emission limit for the pollutant, you may choose to conduct performance tests for the pollutant every third year if your emissions are at or below 75-percent of the emission limit, and if there are no changes in the operation of the affected source or air pollution control equipment that could increase emissions, but each such performance test must be conducted no more than 37 months after the previous performance test.
(iii) If a performance test shows emissions exceeded 75-percent of the emission limit for a pollutant, you must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until all performance tests over 2 consecutive years show compliance.
(b) Demonstrate continuous compliance using a continuous emissions monitoring system or continuous automated sampling system. The option to use a continuous emissions monitoring system for hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium or lead takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium or lead is published in the
Federal Register
.
The option to use a continuous automated sampling system for dioxins/furans takes effect on the date a final performance specification for such a continuous automated sampling system is published in the
Federal Register
.
Collect data as specified in § 62.16015(b)(6) and use the following procedures:
(1) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limits for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, carbon monoxide, dioxins/furans (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis), mercury, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, cadmium and lead, you may substitute the use of a continuous monitoring system in lieu of conducting the annual performance test required in paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:
(i) You may substitute the use of a continuous emissions monitoring system for any pollutant specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in lieu of conducting the annual performance test for that pollutant in paragraph (a) of this section. For determining compliance with the carbon monoxide concentration limit using carbon monoxide CEMS, the correction to 7-percent oxygen does not apply during periods of startup or shutdown. Use the measured carbon monoxide concentration without correcting for oxygen concentration in averaging with other carbon monoxide concentrations (corrected to 7-percent oxygen) to determine the 24-hour average value.
(ii) You may substitute the use of a continuous automated sampling system for mercury or dioxins/furans in lieu of conducting the annual mercury or dioxin/furan performance test in paragraph (a) of this section.
(2) If you use a continuous emissions monitoring system to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must use the continuous emissions monitoring system and follow the requirements specified in § 62.16015(b). You must measure emissions according to § 60.13 of this chapter to calculate 1-hour arithmetic averages, corrected to 7-percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide). You must demonstrate initial compliance using a 24-hour block average of these 1-hour arithmetic average emission concentrations, calculated using Equation 19-19 in section 12.4.1 of Method 19 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7.
(3) If you use a continuous automated sampling system to demonstrate compliance with an applicable emission limit in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you must:
(i) Use the continuous automated sampling system specified in § 60.58b(p) and (q) of this chapter, and measure and calculate average emissions corrected to 7-percent oxygen (or carbon dioxide) according to § 60.58b(p) and your monitoring plan.
(A) Use the procedures specified in § 60.58b(p) of this chapter to calculate 24-hour averages to determine compliance with the mercury emission limit in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart.
(B) Use the procedures specified in § 60.58b(p) of this chapter to calculate 2-
week averages to determine compliance with the dioxin/furan (total mass basis or toxic equivalency basis) emission limits in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart.
(ii) Update your monitoring plan as specified in § 60.4880(e) of this chapter. For mercury continuous automated sampling systems, you must use Performance Specification 12B of appendix B of part 75 of this chapter and Procedure 5 of appendix F of part 60 of this chapter.
(4) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, you must complete your periodic performance evaluations required in your monitoring plan for any continuous emissions monitoring systems and continuous automated sampling systems, according to the schedule specified in your monitoring plan. If you were previously determining compliance by conducting an annual performance test (or according to the less frequent testing for a pollutant as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section), you must complete the initial performance evaluation required under your monitoring plan in § 62.15995 for the continuous monitoring system prior to using the continuous emissions monitoring system to demonstrate compliance or continuous automated sampling system. Your performance evaluation must be conducted using the procedures and acceptance criteria specified in § 62.15995(a)(3).
(c) To demonstrate compliance with the dioxins/furans toxic equivalency emission limit in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you must determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency as follows:

# Performance Testing, Monitoring, and Calibration Requirements
§ 62.16015
What are the performance testing, monitoring, and calibration requirements for compliance with the emission limits and standards?
You must meet, as applicable, the performance testing requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the monitoring requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the air pollution control device inspections requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this section, and the bypass stack provisions specified in paragraph (d) of this section.
(a)
Performance testing requirements.
(1) All performance tests must consist of a minimum of three test runs conducted under conditions representative of normal operations, as specified in § 60.8(c) of this chapter. Emissions in
excess of the emission limits or standards during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction are considered deviations from the applicable emission limits or standards.
(2) You must document that the dry sludge burned during the performance test is representative of the sludge burned under normal operating conditions by:
(i) Maintaining a log of the quantity of sewage sludge burned during the performance test by continuously monitoring and recording the average hourly rate that sewage sludge is fed to the incinerator.
(ii) Maintaining a log of the moisture content of the sewage sludge burned during the performance test by taking grab samples of the sewage sludge fed to the incinerator for each 8 hour period that testing is conducted.
(3) All performance tests must be conducted using the test methods, minimum sampling volume, observation period, and averaging method specified in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart.
(4) Method 1 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, must be used to select the sampling location and number of traverse points.
(5) Method 3A or 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, must be used for gas composition analysis, including measurement of oxygen concentration. Method 3A or 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, must be used simultaneously with each method.
(6) All pollutant concentrations must be adjusted to 7-percent oxygen using Equation 1 of this section:
ER29AP16.025
Where:
C
adj
= Pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen.
C
meas
= Pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis.
(20.9 − 7) = 20.9 percent oxygen − 7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen correction basis).
20.9 = Oxygen concentration in air, percent.
%O
2
= Oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.
(7) Performance tests must be conducted and data reduced in accordance with the test methods and procedures contained in this subpart unless the Administrator does one of the following.
(i) Specifies or approves, in specific cases, the use of a method with minor changes in methodology.
(ii) Approves the use of an equivalent method.
(iii) Approves the use of an alternative method the results of which he has determined to be adequate for indicating whether a specific source is in compliance.
(iv) Waives the requirement for performance tests because you have demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the affected SSI unit is in compliance with the standard.
(v) Approves shorter sampling times and smaller sample volumes when necessitated by process variables or other factors. Nothing in this paragraph (a)(7) is construed to abrogate the Administrator's authority to require testing under section 114 of the Clean Air Act.
(8) You must provide the Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of any performance test, except as specified under other subparts, to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If after 30 days' notice for an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance test, you must notify the Administrator as soon as possible of any delay in the original test date, either by providing at least 7 days prior notice of the rescheduled date of the performance test, or by arranging a rescheduled date with the Administrator by mutual agreement.
(9) You must provide, or cause to be provided, performance testing facilities as follows:
(i) Sampling ports adequate for the test methods applicable to the SSI unit, as follows:
(A) Constructing the air pollution control system such that volumetric flow rates and pollutant emission rates can be accurately determined by applicable test methods and procedures.
(B) Providing a stack or duct free of cyclonic flow during performance tests, as demonstrated by applicable test methods and procedures.
(ii) Safe sampling platform(s).
(iii) Safe access to sampling platform(s).
(iv) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment.
(10) Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, each performance test must consist of three separate runs using the applicable test method. Each run must be conducted for the time and under the conditions specified in the applicable standard. Compliance with each emission limit must be determined by calculating the arithmetic mean of the three runs. In the event that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme meteorological conditions, or other circumstances, beyond your control, compliance may, upon the Administrator's approval, be determined using the arithmetic mean of the results of the two other runs.
(11) During each test run specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must operate your sewage sludge incinerator at a minimum of 85-percent of your maximum permitted capacity.
(b)
Continuous monitor requirements.
You must meet the following requirements, as applicable, when using a continuous monitoring system to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart. The option to use a continuous emissions monitoring system for hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium, or lead takes effect on the date a final performance specification applicable to hydrogen chloride, dioxins/furans, cadmium or lead is published in the
Federal Register.
If you elect to use a continuous emissions monitoring system instead of conducting annual performance testing, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section. If you elect to use a continuous automated sampling system instead of conducting annual performance testing, you must meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(7) of this section.

(5) You may request that compliance with the emission limits be determined using carbon dioxide measurements corrected to an equivalent of 7-percent oxygen. If carbon dioxide is selected for use in diluent corrections, the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide levels must be established during the initial performance test according to the procedures and methods specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section. This relationship may be re-established during subsequent performance tests.
(i) The fuel factor equation in Method 3B at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, must be used to determine the relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide at a sampling location. Method 3A or 3B at 50 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, or as an alternative ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses [Part 10, Instruments and Apparatus], as applicable, must be used to determine the oxygen concentration at the same location as the carbon dioxide monitor(see paragraph (e) of this section).
(ii) Samples must be taken for at least 30 minutes in each hour.

# Subpart OOO—Federal Plan Requirements for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills That Commenced Construction On or Before July 17, 2014 and Have Not Been Modified or Reconstructed Since July 17, 2014

# Source:
86 FR 27770, May 21, 2021, unless otherwise noted.
§ 62.16710
Scope and delegated authorities.
This subpart establishes emission control requirements and compliance schedules for the control of designated pollutants from certain designated municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills in accordance with section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act and subpart B of 40 CFR part 60.
(a) If you own or operate a designated facility as described in § 62.16711, then you must comply with this subpart.
(b) The following authorities will not be delegated to state, local, or tribal agencies:
(1) Approval of alternative methods to determine the site-specific nonmethane organic compounds (NMOC) concentration or a site-specific methane generation rate constant (k).
(2) Alternative emission standards.
(3) Major alternatives to test methods. Major alternatives to test methods or to monitoring are modifications made to a federally enforceable test method or to a Federal monitoring requirement. These changes may involve the use of unproven technology or modified procedures or an entirely new method.
(4) Waivers of recordkeeping.
§ 62.16711
Designated facilities.
(a) The designated facility to which this subpart applies is each municipal solid waste landfill in each state, protectorate, and portion of Indian country that meets the conditions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, except for landfills exempted by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(1) The municipal solid waste landfill commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or before July 17, 2014.
(2) The municipal solid waste landfill has accepted waste at any time since November 8, 1987, or the landfill has additional capacity for future waste deposition.
(b) A municipal solid waste landfill regulated by an EPA-approved and currently effective state or tribal plan implementing 40 CFR 60, subpart Cf, is not subject to the requirements of this subpart.
(c) A municipal solid waste landfill located in a state, locality, or portion of Indian country that submitted a negative declaration letter is not subject to the requirements of this subpart other than the requirements in the definition of design capacity in § 62.16730 to recalculate the site-specific density annually and in § 62.16724(b) to submit an amended design capacity report in the event that the recalculated design capacity is equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters. However, if the existing municipal solid waste landfill already has a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, then it is subject to the requirements of this Federal plan.
(d) Physical or operational changes made to an existing MSW landfill solely to comply with an emission guideline implemented by a state or Federal plan are not considered a modification or reconstruction and would not subject an existing MSW landfill to the requirements of 40 CFR 60, subpart XXX. Landfills that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction after July 17, 2014, are subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart XXX.
(e) For purposes of obtaining an operating permit under title V of the Clean Air Act, the owner or operator of an MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters is not subject to the requirement to obtain an operating permit for the landfill under 40 CFR part 70 or 71, unless the landfill is otherwise subject to either 40 CFR part 70 or 71. For purposes of submitting a timely application for an operating permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 71, the owner or operator of an MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, and not otherwise subject to either 40 CFR part 70 or 71, becomes subject to the requirements of § 70.5(a)(1)(i) or 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter 90 days after the effective date of such CAA section 111(d) program approval, even if the design capacity report is submitted earlier.
(f) When an MSW landfill subject to this subpart is closed as defined in this subpart, the owner or operator is no longer subject to the requirement to maintain an operating permit under 40 CFR part 70 or 71 for the landfill if the landfill is not otherwise subject to the requirements of either 40 CFR part 70 or 71 and if either of the following conditions are met:

[86 FR 27770, May 21, 2021, as amended at 87 FR 8203, Feb. 14, 2022]
§ 62.16716
Operational standards for collection and control systems.
Each owner or operator must comply with the provisions for the operational standards in this section (as well as the provisions in §§ 62.16720 and 62.16722), or the operational standards in § 63.1958 of this chapter (as well as the provisions in §§ 63.1960 and 63.1961 of this chapter), or both as alternative means of compliance, for an MSW landfill with a gas collection and control system used to comply with the provisions of § 62.16714(b) and (c). Once the owner or operator begins to comply with the provisions of § 63.1958 of this chapter, the owner or operator must continue to operate the collection and control device according to those provisions and cannot return to the provisions of this section. Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill with a gas collection and control system used to comply with the provisions of § 62.16714(b) and (c) must:
(a) Operate the collection system such that gas is collected from each area, cell, or group of cells in the MSW landfill in which solid waste has been in place for:
(1) 5 years or more if active; or
(2) 2 years or more if closed or at final grade;
(b) Operate the collection system with negative pressure at each wellhead except under the following conditions:
(1) A fire or increased well temperature. The owner or operator must record instances when positive pressure occurs in efforts to avoid a fire. These records must be submitted with the annual reports as provided in § 62.16724(h)(1);
(2) Use of a geomembrane or synthetic cover. The owner or operator must develop acceptable pressure limits in the design plan;
(3) A decommissioned well. A well may experience a static positive pressure after shut down to accommodate for declining flows. All design changes must be approved by the Administrator as specified in § 62.16724(d);
(c) Operate each interior wellhead in the collection system with a landfill gas temperature less than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit). The owner or operator may establish a higher operating temperature value at a particular well. A higher operating value demonstration must be submitted to the Administrator for approval and must include supporting data demonstrating that the elevated parameter neither causes fires nor significantly inhibits anaerobic decomposition by killing methanogens. The demonstration must satisfy both criteria in order to be approved (
i.e.,
neither causing fires nor killing methanogens is acceptable).
(d) Operate the collection system so that the methane concentration is less than 500 parts per million above background at the surface of the landfill. To determine if this level is exceeded, the owner or operator must conduct surface testing using an organic vapor analyzer, flame ionization detector, or other portable monitor meeting the specifications provided in § 62.16720(d). The owner or operator must conduct surface testing around the perimeter of the collection area and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at no more than 30-meter intervals and where visual observations indicate elevated concentrations of landfill gas, such as distressed vegetation and cracks or seeps in the cover and all cover penetrations. Thus, the owner or operator must monitor any openings that are within an area of the landfill where waste has been placed and a gas collection system is required. The owner or operator may establish an alternative traversing pattern that ensures equivalent coverage. A surface monitoring design plan must be developed that includes a topographical map with the monitoring route and the rationale for any site-specific deviations from the 30-meter intervals. Areas with steep slopes or other dangerous areas may be excluded from the surface testing.
(e) Operate the system such that all collected gases are vented to a control system designed and operated in compliance with § 62.16714(c). In the event the collection or control system is not operating, the gas mover system must be shut down and all valves in the collection and control system contributing to venting of the gas to the atmosphere must be closed within 1 hour of the collection or control system not operating.
(f) Operate the control system at all times when the collected gas is routed to the system.
(g) If monitoring demonstrates that the operational requirements in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section are not met, corrective action must be taken as specified in § 62.16720(a)(3) and (5) or § 62.16720(c). If corrective actions are taken as specified in § 62.16720, the monitored exceedance is not a violation of the operational requirements in this section.
§ 62.16718
Test methods and procedures.
Calculate the landfill NMOC emission rate and conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration according to the provisions in this section.
(a)(1)
NMOC Emission rate.
The landfill owner or operator must calculate the NMOC emission rate using either Equation 1 provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section or Equation 2 provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. Both Equation 1 and Equation 2 may be used if the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is known, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, for part of the
life of the landfill and the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is unknown, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, for part of the life of the landfill. The values to be used in both Equation 1 and Equation 2 are 0.05 per year for k, 170 cubic meters per megagram for Lo, and 4,000 parts per million by volume as hexane for the C
NMOC.
For landfills located in geographical areas with a 30-year annual average precipitation of less than 25 inches, as measured at the nearest representative official meteorological site, the k value to be used is 0.02 per year.
(i)(A) Equation 1 must be used if the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is known.

Tier 1.
The owner or operator must compare the calculated NMOC mass emission rate to the standard of 34 megagrams per year.
(i) If the NMOC emission rate calculated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is less than 34 megagrams per year, then the owner or operator must submit an NMOC emission rate report according to § 62.16724(c) and must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually as required under § 62.16714(e).
(ii) If the NMOC emission rate calculated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year, then the landfill owner or operator must either:
(A) Submit a gas collection and control system design plan within 1 year as specified in § 62.16724(d) and install and operate a gas collection and control system within 30 months according to § 62.16714(b) and (c);
(B) Determine a site-specific NMOC concentration and recalculate the
NMOC emission rate using the Tier 2 procedures provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section; or
(C) Determine a site-specific methane generation rate constant and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the Tier 3 procedures provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(3)
Tier 2.
The landfill owner or operator must determine the site-specific NMOC concentration using the following sampling procedure. The landfill owner or operator must install at least two sample probes per hectare, evenly distributed over the landfill surface that has retained waste for at least 2 years. If the landfill is larger than 25 hectares in area, only 50 samples are required. The probes should be evenly distributed across the sample area. The sample probes should be located to avoid known areas of nondegradable solid waste. The owner or operator must collect and analyze one sample of landfill gas from each probe to determine the NMOC concentration using EPA Method 25 or 25C of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60. Taking composite samples from different probes into a single cylinder is allowed; however, equal sample volumes must be taken from each probe. For each composite, the sampling rate, collection times, beginning and ending cylinder vacuums, or alternative volume measurements must be recorded to verify that composite volumes are equal. Composite sample volumes should not be less than one liter unless evidence can be provided to substantiate the accuracy of smaller volumes. Terminate compositing before the cylinder approaches ambient pressure where measurement accuracy diminishes. If more than the required number of samples is taken, all samples must be used in the analysis. The landfill owner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration from EPA Method 25 or 25C of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60 by 6 to convert from C
NMOC
as carbon to C
NMOC
as hexane. If the landfill has an active or passive gas removal system in place, EPA Method 25 or 25C samples may be collected from these systems instead of surface probes provided the removal system can be shown to provide sampling as representative as the two sampling probes per hectare requirement. For active collection systems, samples may be collected from the common header pipe. The sample location on the common header pipe must be before any gas moving, condensate removal, or treatment system equipment. For active collection systems, a minimum of three samples must be collected from the header pipe.
(i) Within 60 days after the date of determining the NMOC concentration and corresponding NMOC emission rate, the owner or operator must submit the results according to § 62.16724(j)(2).
(ii) The landfill owner or operator must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate using Equation 1 or Equation 2 provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section using the average site-specific NMOC concentration from the collected samples instead of the default value provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(iii) If the resulting NMOC mass emission rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, then the owner or operator must submit a periodic estimate of NMOC emissions in an NMOC emission rate report according to § 62.16724(c) and must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually as required under § 62.16714(e). The site-specific NMOC concentration must be retested every 5 years using the methods specified in this section.
(iv) If the NMOC mass emission rate as calculated using the Tier 2 site-specific NMOC concentration is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year, the owner or operator must either:
(A) Submit a gas collection and control system design plan within 1 year as specified in § 62.16724(d) and install and operate a gas collection and control system within 30 months according to § 62.16714(b) and (c);
(B) Determine a site-specific methane generation rate constant and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the site-specific methane generation rate using the Tier 3 procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section; or
(C) Conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration using the Tier 4 procedures specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
(4)
Tier 3.
The site-specific methane generation rate constant must be determined using the procedures provided in EPA Method 2E of appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60. The landfill owner or operator must estimate the NMOC mass emission rate using Equation 1 or Equation 2 in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section and using a site-specific methane generation rate constant, and the site-specific NMOC concentration as determined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section instead of the default values provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The landfill owner or operator must compare the resulting NMOC mass emission rate to the standard of 34 megagrams per year.
(i) If the NMOC mass emission rate as calculated using the Tier 2 site-specific NMOC concentration and Tier 3 site-specific methane generation rate is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year, the owner or operator must either:
(A) Submit a gas collection and control system design plan within 1 year as specified in § 62.16724(d) and install and operate a gas collection and control system within 30 months according to § 62.16714(b) and (c); or
(B) Conduct a surface emission monitoring demonstration using the Tier 4 procedures specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.
(ii) If the NMOC mass emission rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, then the owner or operator must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually using Equation 1 or Equation 2 in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and using the site-specific Tier 2 NMOC concentration and Tier 3 methane generation rate constant and submit a periodic NMOC emission rate report as provided in § 62.16724(c). The calculation of the methane generation rate constant is performed only once, and the value obtained from this test must be used in all subsequent annual NMOC emission rate calculations.
(5)
Alternative methods.
The owner or operator may use other methods to determine the NMOC concentration or a site-specific methane generation rate constant as an alternative to the methods required in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section if the method has been approved by the Administrator.
(6)
Tier 4.
Demonstrate that surface methane emissions are below 500 parts per million. Surface emission monitoring must be conducted on a quarterly basis using the following procedures. Tier 4 is allowed only if the landfill owner or operator can demonstrate that NMOC emissions are greater than or equal to 34 megagrams per year but less than 50 megagrams per year using Tier 1 or Tier 2. If both Tier 1 and Tier 2 indicate NMOC emissions are megagrams per year or greater, then Tier 4 cannot be used. In addition, the landfill must meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(6)(viii) of this section.
(i) Measure surface concentrations of methane along the entire perimeter of the landfill and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at no more than 30-meter intervals using an organic vapor analyzer, flame ionization detector, or other portable monitor meeting the specifications provided in § 62.16720(d).
(ii) The background concentration must be determined by moving the probe inlet upwind and downwind at least 30 meters from the waste mass boundary of the landfill.
(iii) Surface emission monitoring must be performed in accordance with section 8.3.1 of EPA Method 21 of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60, except that the probe inlet must be placed no more than 5 centimeters above the landfill surface; the constant measurement of distance above the surface should be based on a mechanical device such as with a wheel on a pole.
(A) The owner or operator must use a wind barrier, similar to a funnel, when onsite average wind speed exceeds 4 miles per hour or 2 meters per second or gust exceeding 10 miles per hour. Average on-site wind speed must also be determined in an open area at 5-minute intervals using an on-site anemometer with a continuous recorder and data logger for the entire duration of the monitoring event. The wind barrier must surround the SEM monitor, and must be placed on the ground, to ensure wind turbulence is blocked. The SEM cannot be conducted if average wind speed exceeds 25 miles per hour.
(B) Landfill surface areas where visual observations indicate elevated concentrations of landfill gas, such as distressed vegetation and cracks or seeps in the cover, and all cover penetrations must also be monitored using a device meeting the specifications provided in § 62.16720(d).
(iv) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with the Tier 4 provisions in paragraph (a)(6) of this section must maintain records of surface emission monitoring as provided in § 62.16726(g) and submit a Tier 4 surface emissions report as provided in § 62.16724(d)(4)(iii).
(v) If there is any measured concentration of methane of 500 parts per million or greater from the surface of the landfill, the owner or operator must submit a gas collection and control system design plan within 1 year of the first measured concentration of methane of 500 parts per million or greater from the surface of the landfill according to § 62.16724(d) and install and operate a gas collection and control system according to § 62.16714(b) and (c) within 30 months of the most recent NMOC emission rate report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 34 megagrams per year based on Tier 2.
(vi) If after four consecutive quarterly monitoring periods at a landfill, other than a closed landfill, there is no measured concentration of methane of 500 parts per million or greater from the surface of the landfill, the owner or operator must continue quarterly surface emission monitoring using the methods specified in this section.
(vii) If after four consecutive quarterly monitoring periods at a closed landfill there is no measured concentration of methane of 500 parts per million or greater from the surface of the landfill, the owner or operator must conduct annual surface emission monitoring using the methods specified in this section.
(viii) If a landfill has installed and operates a collection and control system that is not required by this subpart, then the collection and control system must meet the following criteria:
(A) The gas collection and control system must have operated for at least 6,570 out of 8,760 hours preceding the Tier 4 SEM demonstration.
(B) During the Tier 4 SEM demonstration, the gas collection and control system must operate as it normally would to collect and control as much landfill gas as possible.
(b) After the installation and startup of a collection and control system in compliance with this subpart, the owner or operator must calculate the NMOC emission rate for purposes of determining when the system can be capped, removed, or decommissioned as provided in § 62.16714(f), using Equation 3:
ER21MY21.006
Where:
M
NMOC
= Mass emission rate of NMOC, megagrams per year.
Q
LFG
= Flow rate of landfill gas, cubic meters per minute.
C
NMOC
= NMOC concentration, parts per million by volume as hexane.
(1)
Flow rate.
The flow rate of landfill gas, Q
LFG,
must be determined by measuring the total landfill gas flow rate at the common header pipe that leads to the control system using a gas flow measuring device calibrated according to the provisions of section 10 of EPA Method 2E of appendix A-1 of 40 CFR part 60.
(2)
NMOC concentration.
The average NMOC concentration, C
NMOC,
must be determined by collecting and analyzing landfill gas sampled from the common header pipe before the gas moving or condensate removal equipment using the procedures in EPA Method 25 or EPA Method 25C of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60. The sample location on the common header pipe must be before any condensate removal or other gas refining units. The landfill owner
or operator must divide the NMOC concentration from EPA Method 25 or EPA Method 25C of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60 by six to convert from C
NMOC
as carbon to C
NMOC
as hexane.
(3)
Gas flow rate method.
The owner or operator may use another method to determine landfill gas flow rate and NMOC concentration if the method has been approved by the Administrator.
(i) Within 60 days after the date of calculating the NMOC emission rate for purposes of determining when the system can be capped or removed, the owner or operator must submit the results according to § 62.16724(j)(2).
(ii) [Reserved]
(c) When calculating emissions for Prevention of Significant Deterioration purposes, the owner or operator of each MSW landfill subject to the provisions of this subpart must estimate the NMOC emission rate for comparison to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration major source and significance levels in §§ 51.166 or 52.21 of this chapter using Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors, Volume I: Stationary Point and Area Sources (AP-42) or other approved measurement procedures.
(d) For the performance test required in § 62.16714(c)(1), the net heating value of the combusted landfill gas as determined in 40 CFR 60.18(f)(3) of this chapter is calculated from the concentration of methane in the landfill gas as measured by EPA Method 3C. A minimum of three 30-minute EPA Method 3C samples are determined. The measurement of other organic components, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide is not applicable. EPA Method 3C may be used to determine the landfill gas molecular weight for calculating the flare gas exit velocity under 40 CFR 60.18(f)(4) of this chapter.
(1)
Performance test results.
Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in § 60.8 of this chapter), the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance tests required by paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, including any associated fuel analyses, according to § 62.16724(j)(1).
(2) [Reserved]
(e) For the performance test required in § 62.16714(c)(2), EPA Method 25 or 25C (EPA Method 25C may be used at the inlet only) of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60 must be used to determine compliance with the 98 weight-percent efficiency or the 20 parts-per-million by volume outlet NMOC concentration level, unless another method to demonstrate compliance has been approved by the Administrator as provided by § 62.16724(d)(2). EPA Method 3, 3A, or 3C of appendix A-2 of 40 CFR part 60 must be used to determine oxygen for correcting the NMOC concentration as hexane to 3 percent. In cases where the outlet concentration is less than 50 parts-per-million NMOC as carbon (8 parts-per-million NMOC as hexane), EPA Method 25A should be used in place of EPA Method 25. EPA Method 18 of appendix A-6 of 40 CFR part 60 may be used in conjunction with EPA Method 25A on a limited basis (compound specific,
e.g.,
methane) or EPA Method 3C may be used to determine methane. The methane as carbon should be subtracted from the EPA Method 25A total hydrocarbon value as carbon to give NMOC concentration as carbon. The landfill owner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration as carbon by 6 to convert the C
NMOC
as carbon to C
NMOC
as hexane. Equation 4 must be used to calculate efficiency:
ER21MY21.007
Where:
NMOC
in
= Mass of NMOC entering control device.
NMOC
out
= Mass of NMOC exiting control device.
(1)
Performance test submission.
Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in§ 60.8 of this chapter), the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance tests, including any associated fuel analyses, according to § 62.16724(j)(1).
(2) [Reserved]
§ 62.16720
Compliance provisions.
Follow the compliance provisions in this section (as well as the provisions in §§ 62.16716 and 62.16722), or the compliance provisions in § 63.1960 of this chapter (as well as the provisions in §§ 63.1958 and 63.1961 of this chapter), or both as alternative means of compliance, for an MSW landfill with a gas collection and control system used to comply with the provisions of § 62.16714(b) and (c). Once the owner or operator begins to comply with the provisions of § 63.1960 of this chapter, the owner or operator must continue to operate the collection and control device according to those provisions and cannot return to the provisions of this section.
(a) Except as provided in § 62.16724(d)(2), the specified methods in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section must be used to determine whether the gas collection system is in compliance with § 62.16714(b)(2).
(1) For the purposes of calculating the maximum expected gas generation flow rate from the landfill to determine compliance with § 62.16714(b)(2)(i), either Equation 5 or Equation 6 must be used. The methane generation rate constant (k) and methane generation potential (Lo) kinetic factors should be those published in the most recent AP-42 or other site-specific values demonstrated to be appropriate and approved by the Administrator. If k has been determined as specified in § 62.16718(a)(4), the value of k determined from the test must be used. A value of no more than 15 years must be used for the intended use period of the gas mover equipment. The active life of the landfill is the age of the landfill plus the estimated number of years until closure.
(i) For sites with unknown year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate:
ER21MY21.008
Where:
Q
m
= Maximum expected gas generation flow rate, cubic meters per year.
L
o
= Methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram solid waste.
R = Average annual acceptance rate, megagrams per year.
k = Methane generation rate constant, year−1.
t = Age of the landfill at equipment installation plus the time the owner or operator intends to use the gas mover equipment or active life of the landfill, whichever is less. If the equipment is installed after closure, t is the age of the landfill at installation, years.
c = Time since closure, years (for an active landfill c = 0 and e
−
kc
= 1).
(ii) For sites with known year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate:
ER21MY21.009
Where:
Q
M
= Maximum expected gas generation flow rate, cubic meters per year.
k = Methane generation rate constant, year−1.
L
o
= Methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram solid waste.
M
i
= Mass of solid waste in the i
th
section, megagrams.
t
i
= Age of the i
th
section, years.
(iii) If a collection and control system has been installed, actual flow data may be used to project the maximum expected gas generation flow rate instead of, or in conjunction with, Equation 5 or Equation 6 in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section. If the landfill is still accepting waste, the actual measured flow data will not equal
the maximum expected gas generation rate, so calculations using Equation 5 or Equation 6 in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section or other methods must be used to predict the maximum expected gas generation rate over the intended period of use of the gas control system equipment.
(2) For the purposes of determining sufficient density of gas collectors for compliance with § 62.16714(b)(2)(ii), the owner or operator must design a system of vertical wells, horizontal collectors, or other collection devices, satisfactory to the Administrator, capable of controlling and extracting gas from all portions of the landfill sufficient to meet all operational and performance standards.
(3) For the purpose of demonstrating whether the gas collection system flow rate is sufficient to determine compliance with § 62.16714(b)(2)(iii), the owner or operator must measure gauge pressure in the gas collection header applied to each individual well monthly. If a positive pressure exists, action must be initiated to correct the exceedance within 5 calendar days, except for the three conditions allowed under § 62.16716(b). Any attempted corrective measure must not cause exceedances of other operational or performance standards.
(i) If negative pressure cannot be achieved without excess air infiltration within 15 calendar days of the first measurement of positive pressure, the owner or operator must conduct a root cause analysis and correct the exceedance as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after positive pressure was first measured. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 62.16726(e)(3).
(ii) If corrective actions cannot be fully implemented within 60 days following the positive pressure or elevated temperature measurement for which the root cause analysis was required, the owner or operator must also conduct a corrective action analysis and develop an implementation schedule to complete the corrective action(s) as soon as practicable, but no more than 120 days following the measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) or positive pressure. The owner or operator must submit the items listed in § 62.16724(h)(7) as part of the next annual report. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 62.16726(e)(4).
(iii) If corrective action is expected to take longer than 120 days to complete after the initial exceedance, the owner or operator must submit the root cause analysis, corrective action analysis, and corresponding implementation timeline to the Administrator, according to § 62.16724(h)(7) and (k). The owner or operator must keep records according to § 62.16726(e)(5).
(4) For the purpose of identifying whether excess air infiltration into the landfill is occurring, the owner or operator must monitor each well monthly for temperature as provided in § 62.16716(c). If a well exceeds the operating parameter for temperature, action must be initiated to correct the exceedance within 5 calendar days. Any attempted corrective measure must not cause exceedances of other operational or performance standards.
(i) If a landfill gas temperature less than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) cannot be achieved within 15 calendar days of the first measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit), the owner or operator must conduct a root cause analysis and correct the exceedance as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days after a landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) was first measured. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 62.16726(e)(3).
(ii) If corrective actions cannot be fully implemented within 60 days following the measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit) for which the root cause analysis was required, the owner or operator must also conduct a corrective action analysis and develop an implementation schedule to complete the corrective action(s) as soon as practicable, but no more than 120 days following the measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit). The owner or operator must submit the items listed in
§ 62.16724(h)(7) as part of the next annual report. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 62.16726(e)(4).
(iii) If corrective action is expected to take longer than 120 days to complete after the initial exceedance, the owner or operator must submit the root cause analysis, corrective action analysis, and corresponding implementation timeline to the Administrator, according to § 62.16724(h)(7) and § 62.16724(k). The owner or operator must keep records according to § 62.16726(e)(5).
(5) An owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 62.16714(b)(2)(iv) through the use of a collection system not conforming to the specifications provided in § 62.16728 must provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as specified in § 62.16724(d)(3) demonstrating that off-site migration is being controlled.
(b) For purposes of compliance with § 62.16716(a), each owner or operator of a controlled landfill must place each well or design component as specified in the approved design plan as provided in § 62.16724(d). Each well must be installed no later than 60 days after the date on which the initial solid waste has been in place for a period of:
(1) 5 years or more if active; or
(2) 2 years or more if closed or at final grade.
(c) The following procedures must be used for compliance with the surface methane operational standard as provided in § 62.16716(d):
(1) After installation and startup of the gas collection system, the owner or operator must monitor surface concentrations of methane along the entire perimeter of the collection area and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at no more than 30-meter intervals (or a site-specific established spacing) for each collection area on a quarterly basis using an organic vapor analyzer, flame ionization detector, or other portable monitor meeting the specifications provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) The background concentration must be determined by moving the probe inlet upwind and downwind outside the boundary of the landfill at a distance of at least 30 meters from the perimeter wells.
(3) Surface emission monitoring must be performed in accordance with section 8.3.1 of EPA Method 21 of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60, except that the probe inlet must be placed within 5 to 10 centimeters of the ground. Monitoring must be performed during typical meteorological conditions.
(4) Any reading of 500 parts per million or more above background at any location must be recorded as a monitored exceedance and the actions specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (v) of this section must be taken. As long as the specified actions are taken, the exceedance is not a violation of the operational requirements of § 62.16716(d).
(i) The location of each monitored exceedance must be marked, and the location and concentration recorded. For location, you must determine the latitude and longitude coordinates using an instrument with an accuracy of at least 4 meters. The coordinates must be in decimal degrees with at least five decimal places.
(ii) Cover maintenance or adjustments to the vacuum of the adjacent wells to increase the gas collection in the vicinity of each exceedance must be made and the location must be re-monitored within 10 calendar days of detecting the exceedance.
(iii) If the re-monitoring of the location shows a second exceedance, additional corrective action must be taken, and the location must be monitored again within 10 days of the second exceedance. If the re-monitoring shows a third exceedance for the same location, the action specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section must be taken, and no further monitoring of that location is required until the action specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section has been taken.
(iv) Any location that initially showed an exceedance but has a methane concentration less than 500 parts-per-million methane above background at the 10-day re-monitoring specified in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) or (iii) of this section must be re-monitored 1 month from the initial exceedance. If the 1-
month re-monitoring shows a concentration less than 500 parts-per-million above background, no further monitoring of that location is required until the next quarterly monitoring period. If the 1-month re-monitoring shows an exceedance, the actions specified in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) or (v) of this section must be taken.
(v) For any location where monitored methane concentration equals or exceeds 500 parts-per-million above background three times within a quarterly period, a new well or other collection device must be installed within 120 calendar days of the initial exceedance. An alternative remedy to the exceedance, such as upgrading the blower, header pipes or control device, and a corresponding timeline for installation may be submitted to the Administrator for approval.
(5) The owner or operator must implement a program to monitor for cover integrity and implement cover repairs as necessary on a monthly basis.
(d) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with the provisions in paragraph (c) of this section or § 62.16718(a)(6) must comply with the following instrumentation specifications and procedures for surface emission monitoring devices:
(1) The portable analyzer must meet the instrument specifications provided in section 6 of EPA Method 21 of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60, except that “methane” replaces all references to “VOC.”
(2) The calibration gas must be methane, diluted to a nominal concentration of 500 parts-per-million in air.
(3) To meet the performance evaluation requirements in section 8.1 of EPA Method 21 of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60, the instrument evaluation procedures of section 8.1 of EPA Method 21 of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60 must be used.
(4) The calibration procedures provided in sections 8 and 10 of EPA Method 21 of appendix A-7 of 40 CFR part 60 must be followed immediately before commencing a surface monitoring survey.
(e) The provisions of this subpart apply at all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction. During periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, you must comply with the work practice specified in § 62.16716(e) in lieu of the compliance provisions in § 62.16720.
§ 62.16722

Determine the oxygen level by an oxygen meter using EPA Method 3A, 3C, or ASTM D6522-11 (if sample location is prior to combustion) except that:
(A) The span must be set between 10- and 12-percent oxygen;
(B) A data recorder is not required;
(C) Only two calibration gases are required, a zero and span;
(D) A calibration error check is not required;
(E) The allowable sample bias, zero drift, and calibration drift are ±10 percent.
(iii) A portable gas composition analyzer may be used to monitor the oxygen levels provided:
(A) The analyzer is calibrated; and
(B) The analyzer meets all quality assurance and quality control requirements for EPA Method 3A or ASTM D6522-11.
(3) Monitor temperature of the landfill gas on a monthly basis as provided in § 62.16720(a)(4). The temperature measuring device must be calibrated annually using the procedure in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1, EPA Method 2, section 10.3.
(b) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 62.16714(c) using an enclosed combustor must calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications, the following equipment:
(1) A temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder and having a minimum accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being measured expressed in degrees Celsius or ±0.5 degrees Celsius, whichever is greater. A temperature monitoring device is not required for boilers or process heaters with design heat input capacity equal to or greater than 44 megawatts.
(2) A device that records flow to the control device and bypass of the control device (if applicable). The owner or operator must:

must monitor surface concentrations of methane according to the procedures provided in § 62.16720(c) and the instrument specifications in § 62.16720(d). Any closed landfill that has no monitored exceedances of the operational standard in three consecutive quarterly monitoring periods may skip to annual monitoring. Any methane reading of 500 parts-per-million or more above background detected during the annual monitoring returns the frequency for that landfill to quarterly monitoring.
(g) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with the control system requirements in § 62.16714(c) using a landfill gas treatment system must maintain and operate all monitoring systems associated with the treatment system in accordance with the site-specific treatment system monitoring plan required in § 62.16726(b)(5)(ii) and must calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a device that records flow to the treatment system and bypass of the treatment system (if applicable). The owner or operator must:
(1) Install, calibrate, and maintain a gas flow rate measuring device that records the flow to the treatment system at least every 15 minutes; and
(2) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism must be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and that the gas flow is not diverted through the bypass line.
(h) The monitoring requirements of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (g) of this section apply at all times the designated facility is operating, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. You are required to complete monitoring system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable.

§ 62.16724
Reporting guidelines.
Follow the reporting provisions listed in this section, as applicable, except as provided under 40 CFR 60.24 and §§ 62.16711(g), (h), and 62.16724(d)(2).
(a)
Design capacity report.
Submit the initial design capacity report no later than September 20, 2021. The initial design capacity report must contain the following information:
(1) A map or plot of the landfill, providing the size and location of the landfill, and identifying all areas where solid waste may be landfilled according to the permit issued by the state, local, or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill.
(2) The maximum design capacity of the landfill. Where the maximum design capacity is specified in the permit
issued by the state, local, or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill, a copy of the permit specifying the maximum design capacity may be submitted as part of the report. If the maximum design capacity of the landfill is not specified in the permit, the maximum design capacity must be calculated using good engineering practices. The calculations must be provided, along with the relevant parameters as part of the report. The landfill may calculate design capacity in either megagrams or cubic meters for comparison with the exemption values. If the owner or operator chooses to convert the design capacity from volume to mass or from mass to volume to demonstrate its design capacity is less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters, the calculation must include a site-specific density, which must be recalculated annually. Any density conversions must be documented and submitted with the design capacity report. The state, local, or tribal agency or the Administrator may request other reasonable information as may be necessary to verify the maximum design capacity of the landfill.
(b)
Amended design capacity report.
An amended design capacity report must be submitted providing notification of an increase in the design capacity of the landfill, within 90 days of an increase in the maximum design capacity of the landfill to meet or exceed 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters. This increase in design capacity may result from an increase in the permitted volume of the landfill or an increase in the density as documented in the annual recalculation required in § 62.16726(f).
(c)
NMOC emission rate report.
For existing MSW landfills covered by this subpart with a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, the NMOC emission rate report must be submitted following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section no later than 90 days after the effective date of this subpart. The NMOC emission rate report must be submitted to the Administrator annually following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, except as provided for in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The Administrator may request such additional information as may be necessary to verify the reported NMOC emission rate.
(1) The NMOC emission rate report must contain an annual or 5-year estimate of the NMOC emission rate calculated using the formula and procedures provided in § 62.16718(a) or (b), as applicable.
(2) The NMOC emission rate report must include all the data, calculations, sample reports and measurements used to estimate the annual or 5-year emissions.
(3) If the estimated NMOC emission rate as reported in the annual report to the Administrator is less than 34 megagrams per year in each of the next 5 consecutive years, the owner or operator may elect to submit, following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, an estimate of the NMOC emission rate for the next 5-year period in lieu of the annual report. This estimate must include the current amount of solid waste-in-place and the estimated waste acceptance rate for each year of the 5 years for which an NMOC emission rate is estimated. All data and calculations upon which this estimate is based must be provided to the Administrator. This estimate must be revised at least once every 5 years. If the actual waste acceptance rate exceeds the estimated waste acceptance rate in any year reported in the 5-year estimate, a revised 5-year estimate must be submitted to the Administrator. The revised estimate must cover the 5-year period beginning with the year in which the actual waste acceptance rate exceeded the estimated waste acceptance rate.
(4) Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of this subpart is exempted from the requirements to submit an NMOC emission rate report, after installing a collection and control system that complies with § 62.16714(b) and (c), during such time as the collection and control system is in operation and in compliance with §§ 62.16716 and 62.16720.
(d)
Collection and control system design plan.
The collection and control system
design plan must be prepared and approved by a professional engineer and must meet the following requirements:
(1) The collection and control system as described in the design plan must meet the design requirements in § 62.16714(b) and (c).
(2) The collection and control system design plan must include any alternatives to the operational standards, test methods, procedures, compliance measures, monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting provisions of §§ 62.16716 through 62.16726 proposed by the owner or operator.
(3) The collection and control system design plan must either conform to specifications for active collection systems in § 62.16728 or include a demonstration to the Administrator's satisfaction of the sufficiency of the alternative provisions to § 62.16728.
(4) Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters must submit a copy of the collection and control system design plan cover page that contains the engineer's seal to the Administrator within 1 year of the first NMOC emission rate report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 34 megagrams per year, except as follows:
(i) If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after Tier 2 NMOC sampling and analysis as provided in § 62.16718(a)(3) and the resulting rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, annual periodic reporting must be resumed, using the Tier 2 determined site-specific NMOC concentration, until the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 34 megagrams per year or the landfill is closed. The revised NMOC emission rate report, with the recalculated NMOC emission rate based on NMOC sampling and analysis, must be submitted, following the procedures in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, within 180 days of the first calculated exceedance of 34 megagrams per year.
(ii) If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission rate after determining a site-specific methane generation rate constant k, as provided in Tier 3 in § 62.16718(a)(4), and the resulting NMOC emission rate is less than 34 megagrams per year, annual periodic reporting must be resumed. The resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant k must be used in the NMOC emission rate calculation until such time as the emissions rate calculation results in an exceedance. The revised NMOC emission rate report based on the provisions of § 62.16718(a)(4) and the resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant k must be submitted, following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, to the Administrator within 1 year of the first calculated NMOC emission rate equaling or exceeding 34 megagrams per year.
(iii) If the owner or operator elects to demonstrate that site-specific surface methane emissions are below 500 parts-per-million methane, based on the provisions of § 62.16718(a)(6), then the owner or operator must submit annually a Tier 4 surface emissions report as specified in this paragraph following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section until a surface emissions reading of 500 parts-per-million methane or greater is found. If the Tier 4 surface emissions report shows no surface emissions readings of 500 parts-per-million methane or greater for four consecutive quarters at a closed landfill, then the landfill owner or operator may reduce Tier 4 monitoring from a quarterly to an annual frequency. The Administrator may request such additional information as may be necessary to verify the reported instantaneous surface emission readings. The Tier 4 surface emissions report must clearly identify the location, date and time (to the nearest second), average wind speeds including wind gusts, and reading (in parts-per-million) of any value 500 parts-per-million methane or greater, other than non-repeatable, momentary readings. For location, you must determine the latitude and longitude coordinates using an instrument with an accuracy of at least 4 meters. The coordinates must be in decimal degrees with at least five decimal places. The Tier 4 surface emission report should also include the results of the most recent Tier 1 and Tier 2 results in order to verify that the landfill does not exceed 50 megagrams per year of NMOC.
(A) The initial Tier 4 surface emissions report must be submitted annually, starting within 30 days of completing the fourth quarter of Tier 4 SEM that demonstrates that site-specific surface methane emissions are below 500 parts-per-million methane, and following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section
(B) The Tier 4 surface emissions rate report must be submitted within 1 year of the first measured surface exceedance of 500 parts-per-million methane, following the procedure specified in paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
(iv) If the landfill is in the closed landfill subcategory, the owner or operator is exempt from submitting a collection and control system design plan to the Administrator provided that conditions in § 62.16711(g)(3) are met. If not, the owner or operator shall follow the submission procedures and timing in § 62.16724(d)(ii) and (iii) using a level of 50 Mg/yr instead of 34 Mg/yr.
(5) The landfill owner or operator must notify the Administrator that the design plan is completed and submit a copy of the plan's signature page. The Administrator has 90 days to decide whether the design plan should be submitted for review. If the Administrator chooses to review the plan, the approval process continues as described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section. However, if the Administrator indicates that submission is not required or does not respond within 90 days, the landfill owner or operator can continue to implement the plan with the recognition that the owner or operator is proceeding at their own risk. In the event that the design plan is required to be modified to obtain approval, the owner or operator must take any steps necessary to conform any prior actions to the approved design plan and any failure to do so could result in an enforcement action.
(6) Upon receipt of an initial or revised design plan, the Administrator must review the information submitted under paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section and either approve it, disapprove it, or request that additional information be submitted. Because of the many site-specific factors involved with landfill gas system design, alternative systems may be necessary. A wide variety of system designs are possible, such as vertical wells, combination horizontal and vertical collection systems, or horizontal trenches only, leachate collection components, and passive systems. If the Administrator does not approve or disapprove the design plan, or does not request that additional information be submitted within 90 days of receipt, then the owner or operator may continue with implementation of the design plan, recognizing they would be proceeding at their own risk.
(7) If the owner or operator chooses to demonstrate compliance with the emission control requirements of this subpart using a treatment system as defined in this subpart, then the owner or operator must prepare a site-specific treatment system monitoring plan as specified in § 62.16726(b)(5). Legacy controlled landfills must prepare the monitoring plan no later than May 23, 2022.
(e)
Revised design plan.
The owner or operator who has already been required to submit a design plan under paragraph (d) of this section, or under subpart GGG of this part; 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW; or a state plan implementing subpart Cc of 40 CFR part 60, must submit a revised design plan to the Administrator for approval as follows:
(1) At least 90 days before expanding operations to an area not covered by the previously approved design plan.
(2) Prior to installing or expanding the gas collection system in a way that is not consistent with the design plan that was submitted to the Administrator according to paragraph (d) of this section.
(f)
Closure report.
Each owner or operator of a controlled landfill must submit a closure report to the Administrator within 30 days of ceasing waste acceptance. The Administrator may request additional information as may be necessary to verify that permanent closure has taken place in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 258.60. If a closure report has been submitted to the Administrator, no additional wastes may be placed into the landfill without filing a notification of modification as described under 40 CFR 60.7(a)(4).
(g)
Equipment removal report.
Each owner or operator of a controlled landfill must submit an equipment removal report to the Administrator 30 days prior to removal or cessation of operation of the control equipment.
(1) The equipment removal report must contain the following items:
(i) A copy of the closure report submitted in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section; and
(ii) A copy of the initial performance test report demonstrating that the 15-year minimum control period has expired, unless the report of the results of the performance test has been submitted to the EPA via the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX), or information that demonstrates that the gas collection and control system will be unable to operate for 15 years due to declining gas flows. In the equipment removal report, the process unit(s) tested, the pollutant(s) tested, and the date that such performance test was conducted may be submitted in lieu of the performance test report if the report has been previously submitted to the EPA's CDX; and
(iii) Dated copies of three successive NMOC emission rate reports demonstrating that the landfill is no longer producing 34 megagrams or greater of NMOC per year, unless the NMOC emission rate reports have been submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX. If the NMOC emission rate reports have been previously submitted to the EPA's CDX, a statement that the NMOC emission rate reports have been submitted electronically and the dates that the reports were submitted to the EPA's CDX may be submitted in the equipment removal report in lieu of the NMOC emission rate reports; or
(iv) For the closed landfill subcategory, dated copies of three successive NMOC emission rate reports demonstrating that the landfill is no longer producing 50 megagrams or greater of NMOC per year, unless the NMOC emission rate reports have been submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX. If the NMOC emission rate reports have been previously submitted to the EPA's CDX, a statement that the NMOC emission rate reports have been submitted electronically and the dates that the reports were submitted to the EPA's CDX may be submitted in the equipment removal report in lieu of the NMOC emission rate reports.
(2) The Administrator may request such additional information as may be necessary to verify that all of the conditions for removal in § 62.16714(f) have been met.

(1) The collection devices within the interior must be certified to achieve comprehensive control of surface gas emissions by a professional engineer. The following issues must be addressed in the design: Depths of refuse, refuse gas generation rates and flow characteristics, cover properties, gas system expandability, leachate and condensate management, accessibility, compatibility with filling operations, integration with closure end use, air intrusion control, corrosion resistance, fill settlement, resistance to the refuse decomposition heat, and ability to isolate individual components or sections for repair or troubleshooting without shutting down entire collection system.
(2) The sufficient density of gas collection devices determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must address landfill gas migration issues and augmentation of the collection system through the use of active or passive systems at the landfill perimeter or exterior.
(3) The placement of gas collection devices determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must control all gas producing areas, except as provided by paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) Any segregated area of asbestos or nondegradable material may be excluded from collection if documented as provided under § 62.16726(d). The documentation must provide the nature, date of deposition, location and amount of asbestos or nondegradable material deposited in the area, and must be provided to the Administrator upon request.
(ii) Any nonproductive area of the landfill may be excluded from control, provided that the total of all excluded areas can be shown to contribute less than 1 percent of the total amount of NMOC emissions from the landfill. The amount, location, and age of the material must be documented and provided to the Administrator upon request. A separate NMOC emissions estimate must be made for each section proposed for exclusion, and the sum of all such sections must be compared to the NMOC emissions estimate for the entire landfill.
(A) The NMOC emissions from each section proposed for exclusion must be computed using Equation 7:

(B) If the owner or operator is proposing to exclude, or cease gas collection and control from, nonproductive physically separated (
e.g.,
separately lined) closed areas that already have gas collection systems, NMOC emissions from each physically separated closed area must be computed using either Equation 3 in § 62.16718 or Equation 7 in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
(iii) The values for k and C
NMOC
determined in field testing must be used if field testing has been performed in determining the NMOC emission rate or the radii of influence (the distance from the well center to a point in the landfill where the pressure gradient applied by the blower or compressor approaches zero). If field testing has not been performed, the default values for k, Lo, and C
NMOC
provided in § 62.16718 or the alternative values from § 62.16718 must be used. The mass of nondegradable solid waste contained within the given section may be subtracted from the total mass of the section when estimating emissions provided the nature, location, age, and amount of the nondegradable material is documented as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
(b) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 62.16714(b) must construct the gas collection devices using the following equipment or procedures:
(1) The landfill gas extraction components must be constructed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe, fiberglass, stainless steel, or other nonporous corrosion resistant material of suitable dimensions to: Convey projected amounts of gases; withstand installation, static, and settlement forces; and withstand planned overburden or traffic loads. The collection system must extend as necessary to comply with emission and migration standards. Collection devices such as wells and horizontal collectors must be perforated to allow gas entry without head loss sufficient to impair performance across the intended extent of control. Perforations must be situated with regard to the need to prevent excessive air infiltration.
(2) Vertical wells must be placed so as not to endanger underlying liners and must address the occurrence of water within the landfill. Holes and trenches constructed for piped wells and horizontal collectors must be of sufficient cross-section so as to allow for their proper construction and completion including, for example, centering of pipes and placement of gravel backfill. Collection devices must be designed so as not to allow indirect short circuiting of air into the cover or refuse into the collection system or gas into the air. Any gravel used around pipe perforations should be of a dimension so as not to penetrate or block perforations.
(3) Collection devices may be connected to the collection header pipes below or above the landfill surface. The connector assembly must include a positive closing throttle valve, any necessary seals and couplings, access couplings and at least one sampling port. The collection devices must be constructed of PVC, HDPE, fiberglass, stainless steel, or other nonporous material of suitable thickness.
(c) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 62.16714(c) must convey the landfill gas to a control system in compliance with § 62.16714(c) through the collection header pipe(s). The gas mover equipment must be sized to handle the maximum gas generation flow rate expected over the intended use period of the gas moving equipment using the following procedures:
(1) For existing collection systems, the flow data must be used to project the maximum flow rate. If no flow data exist, the procedures in paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be used.
(2) For new collection systems, the maximum flow rate must be in accordance with § 62.16720(a)(1).
