refers to title 40, part 52, section 01.

# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# INQUIRIES

§ 52.02
Introduction.
(a) This part sets forth the Administrator's approval and disapproval of State plans and the Administrator's promulgation of such plans or portions thereof. Approval of a plan or any portion thereof is based upon a determination by the Administrator that such plan or portion meets the requirements of section 110 of the Act and the provisions of part 51 of this chapter.
(b) Any plan or portion thereof promulgated by the Administrator substitutes for a State plan or portion thereof disapproved by the Administrator or not submitted by a State, or supplements a State plan or portion thereof. The promulgated provisions, together with any portions of a State plan approved by the Administrator, constitute the applicable plan for purposes of the Act.
(c) Where nonregulatory provisions of a plan are disapproved, the disapproval is noted in this part and a detailed evaluation is provided to the State, but no substitute provisions are promulgated by the Administrator.
(d) All approved plans and plan revisions listed in subparts B through DDD and FFF of this part and on file at the Office of the Federal Register are approved for incorporation by reference by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Notice of amendments to the plans will be published in the
Federal Register.
The plans and plan revisions are available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:

[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 37 FR 15080, July 27, 1972; 47 FR 38886, Sept. 3, 1982; 61 FR 16060, Apr. 11, 1996; 72 FR 38793, July 16, 2007; 76 FR 49671, Aug. 11, 2011; 78 FR 37975, June 25, 2013; 79 FR 22035, Apr. 21, 2014; 84 FR 44228, Aug. 23, 2019]
§ 52.04
Classification of regions.
Each subpart sets forth the priority classification, by pollutant, for each region in the State. Each plan for each region was evaluated according to the requirements of part 51 of this chapter applicable to regions of that priority.
§ 52.05
Public availability of emission data.
Each subpart sets forth the Administrator's disapproval of plan procedures for making emission data available to the public after correlation with applicable emission limitations, and includes the promulgation of requirements that sources report emission data to the Administrator for correlation and public disclosure.
§ 52.06
Legal authority.
(a) The Administrator's determination of the absence or inadequacy of legal authority required to be included in the plan is set forth in each subpart. This includes the legal authority of local agencies and State governmental agencies other than an air pollution control agency if such other agencies are assigned responsibility for carrying out a plan or portion thereof.
(b) No legal authority as such is promulgated by the Administrator. Where required regulatory provisions are not included in the plan by the State because of inadequate legal authority, substitute provisions are promulgated by the Administrator.
[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 33922, June 29, 1995]
§ 52.07
Control strategies.
(a) Each subpart specifies in what respects the control strategies are approved or disapproved. Where emission limitations with a future effective date are employed to carry out a control strategy, approval of the control strategy and the implementing regulations does not supersede the requirements of subpart N of this chapter relating to compliance schedules for individual sources or categories of sources. Compliance schedules for individual sources or categories of sources must require such sources to comply with applicable requirements of the plan as expeditiously as practicable, where the requirement is part of a control strategy designed to attain a primary standard, or within a reasonable time, where the requirement is part of a control strategy designed to attain a secondary standard. All sources must be required to comply with applicable requirements of the plan no later than the date specified in this part for attainment of the national standard which the requirement is intended to implement.
(b) A control strategy may be disapproved as inadequate because it is not sufficiently comprehensive, although all regulations provided to carry out the strategy may themselves be approved. In this case, regulations
for carrying out necessary additional measures are promulgated in the subpart.
(c) Where a control strategy is adequate to attain and maintain a national standard but one or more of the regulations to carry it out is not adopted or not enforceable by the State, the control strategy is approved and the necessary regulations are promulgated by the Administrator.
(d) Where a control strategy is adequate to attain and maintain air quality better than that provided for by a national standard but one or more of the regulations to carry it out is not adopted or not enforceable by the State, the control strategy is approved and substitute regulations necessary to attain and maintain the national standard are promulgated.
[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 37 FR 19807, Sept. 22, 1972; 51 FR 40676, Nov. 7, 1986]
§ 52.08
Rules and regulations.
Each subpart identifies the regulations, including emission limitations, which are disapproved by the Administrator, and includes the regulations which the Administrator promulgates.
§ 52.09
Compliance schedules.
(a) In each subpart, compliance schedules disapproved by the Administrator are identified, and compliance schedules promulgated by the Administrator are set forth.
(b) Individual source compliance schedules submitted with certain plans have not yet been evaluated, and are not approved or disapproved.
(c) The Administrator's approval or promulgation of any compliance schedule shall not affect the responsibility of the owner or operator to comply with any applicable emission limitation on and after the date for final compliance specified in the applicable schedule.
[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 38 FR 30877, Nov. 8, 1973]
§ 52.10
Review of new sources and modifications.
In any plan where the review procedure for new sources and source modifications does not meet the requirements of subpart I of this chapter, provisions are promulgated which enable the Administrator to obtain the necessary information and to prevent construction or modification.
[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 51 FR 40677, Nov. 7, 1986]
§ 52.11
Prevention of air pollution emergency episodes.
(a) Each subpart identifies portions of the air pollution emergency episode contingency plan which are disapproved, and sets forth the Administrator's promulgation of substitute provisions.
(b) No provisions are promulgated to replace any disapproved air quality monitoring or communications portions of a contingency plan, but detailed critiques of such portions are provided to the State.
(c) Where a State plan does not provide for public announcement regarding air pollution emergency episodes or where the State fails to give any such public announcement, the Administrator will issue a public announcement that an episode stage has been reached. When making such an announcement, the Administrator will be guided by the suggested episode criteria and emission control actions suggested in Appendix L of part 51 of this chapter or those in the approved plan.
[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 37 FR 19807, Sept. 22, 1972]
§ 52.12
Source surveillance.
(a) Each subpart identifies the plan provisions for source surveillance which are disapproved, and sets forth the Administrator's promulgation of necessary provisions for requiring sources to maintain records, make reports, and submit information.
(b) No provisions are promulgated for any disapproved State or local agency procedures for testing, inspection, investigation, or detection, but detailed critiques of such portions are provided to the State.
(c) For purposes of Federal enforcement, the following test procedures and methods shall be used, provided that for the purpose of establishing whether or not a person has violated or is in violation of any provision of the
plan, nothing in this part shall preclude the use, including the exclusive use, of any credible evidence or information, relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test procedures or methods had been performed:
(1) Sources subject to plan provisions which do not specify a test procedure and sources subject to provisions promulgated by the Administrator will be tested by means of the appropriate procedures and methods prescribed in part 60 of this chapter unless otherwise specified in this part.
(2) Sources subject to approved provisions of a plan wherein a test procedure is specified will be tested by the specified procedure.
[37 FR 10846, May 31, 1972, as amended at 40 FR 26032, June 20, 1975; 62 FR 8328, Feb. 24, 1997]
§ 52.13
Air quality surveillance; resources; intergovernmental cooperation.
Disapproved portions of the plan related to the air quality surveillance system, resources, and intergovernmental cooperation are identified in each subpart, and detailed critiques of such portions are provided to the State. No provisions are promulgated by the Administrator.
§ 52.14
State ambient air quality standards.
Any ambient air quality standard submitted with a plan which is less stringent than a national standard is not considered part of the plan.
§ 52.15
Public availability of plans.
Each State shall make available for public inspection at least one copy of the plan in at least one city in each region to which such plan is applicable. All such copies shall be kept current.
§ 52.16
Submission to Administrator.
(a) All requests, reports, applications, submissions, and other communications to the Administrator pursuant to this part shall be submitted in duplicate and addressed to the appropriate Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency. For any submission pursuant to this part that is also a submission of a plan or plan revision pursuant to 40 CFR part 51, the submission shall conform to the requirements of appendix V to 40 CFR part 51, rather than the requirements of this paragraph.

§ 52.20
Attainment dates for national standards.
Each subpart contains a section which specifies the latest dates by which national standards are to be attained in each region in the State. An attainment date which only refers to a month and a year (such as July 1975) shall be construed to mean the last day of the month in question. However, the specification of attainment dates for national standards does not relieve any State from the provisions of subpart N of this chapter which require all sources and categories of sources to comply with applicable requirements of the plan—
(a) As expeditiously as practicable where the requirement is part of a control strategy designed to attain a primary standard, and
(b) Within a reasonable time where the requirement is part of a control strategy designed to attain a secondary standard.

§ 52.21
Prevention of significant deterioration of air quality.
(a)(1)
Plan disapproval.
The provisions of this section are applicable to any State implementation plan which has been disapproved with respect to prevention of significant deterioration of air quality in any portion of any State where the existing air quality is better than the national ambient air quality standards. Specific disapprovals are listed where applicable, in subparts B through DDD and FFF of this part. The provisions of this section have been incorporated by reference into the applicable implementation plans for various States, as provided in subparts B through DDD and FFF of this part. Where this section is so incorporated, the provisions shall also be applicable to all lands owned by the Federal Government and Indian Reservations located in such State. No disapproval with respect to a State's failure to prevent significant deterioration of air quality shall invalidate or otherwise affect the obligations of States, emission sources, or other persons with respect to all portions of plans approved or promulgated under this part.
(2)
Applicability procedures.
(i) The requirements of this section apply to the construction of any new major stationary source (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) or any project at an existing major stationary source in an area designated as attainment or unclassifiable under sections 107(d)(1)(A)(ii) or (iii) of the Act.
(ii) The requirements of paragraphs (j) through (r) of this section apply to the construction of any new major stationary source or the major modification of any existing major stationary source, except as this section otherwise provides.
(iii) No new major stationary source or major modification to which the requirements of paragraphs (j) through (r)(5) of this section apply shall begin actual construction without a permit that states that the major stationary source or major modification will meet those requirements. The Administrator has authority to issue any such permit.
(iv) The requirements of the program will be applied in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(
a
) through (
f
) of this section.
(A) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section, and consistent with the definition of major modification contained in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a project is a major modification for a regulated NSR pollutant if it causes two types of emissions increases—a significant
emissions increase (as defined in paragraph (b)(40) section) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs (b)(3) and (23) of this section). The project is not a major modification if it does not cause a significant emissions increase. If the project causes a significant emissions increase, then the project is a major modification only if it also results in a significant net emissions increase.
(B) The procedure for calculating (before beginning actual construction) whether a significant emissions increase (i.e., the first step of the process) will occur depends upon the type of emissions units being modified, according to paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(
c
) through (
f
) of this section. The procedure for calculating (before beginning actual construction) whether a significant net emissions increase will occur at the major stationary source (i.e., the second step of the process) is contained in the definition in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Regardless of any such preconstruction projections, a major modification results if the project causes a significant emissions increase and a significant net emissions increase.
(C)
Actual-to-projected-actual applicability test for projects that only involve existing emissions units.
A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the projected actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(41) of this section) and the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraphs (b)(48)(i) and (ii) of this section), for each existing emissions unit, equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section).
(D)
Actual-to-potential test for projects that only involve construction of a new emissions unit(s).
A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the potential to emit (as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section) from each new emissions unit following completion of the project and the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(48)(iii) of this section) of these units before the project equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section).
(E) [Reserved]
(F)
Hybrid test for projects that involve multiple types of emissions units.
A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference for all emissions units, using the method specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(
c
) and (
d
) of this section as applicable with respect to each emissions unit, equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section).
(G) The “sum of the difference” as used in paragraphs (
c
), (
d
) and (
f
) of this section shall include both increases and decreases in emissions calculated in accordance with those paragraphs.
(v) For any major stationary source for a PAL for a regulated NSR pollutant, the major stationary source shall comply with the requirements under paragraph (aa) of this section.
(b)

(B) The date that the increase from the particular change occurs.
(iii) An increase or decrease in actual emissions is creditable only if:
(A) The Administrator or other reviewing authority has not relied on it in issuing a permit for the source under this section, which permit is in effect when the increase in actual emissions from the particular change occurs; and
(B) [Reserved]
(C) As it pertains to an increase or decrease in fugitive emissions (to the extent quantifiable), it occurs at an emissions unit that is part of one of the source categories listed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section or it occurs at an emission unit that is located
at a major stationary source that belongs to one of the listed source categories.
(iv) An increase or decrease in actual emissions of sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, or nitrogen oxides that occurs before the applicable minor source baseline date is creditable only if it is required to be considered in calculating the amount of maximum allowable increases remaining available.
(v) An increase in actual emissions is creditable only to the extent that the new level of actual emissions exceeds the old level.
(vi) A decrease in actual emissions is creditable only to the extent that:

Any replacement unit that requires shakedown becomes operational only after a reasonable shakedown period, not to exceed 180 days.
(ix) Paragraph (b)(21)(ii) of this section shall not apply for determining creditable increases and decreases.
(4)
Potential to emit
means the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the source to emit a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, shall be treated as part of its design if the limitation or the effect it would have on emissions is federally enforceable. Secondary emissions do not count in determining the potential to emit of a stationary source.
(5)
Stationary source
means any building, structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit a regulated NSR pollutant.
(6)(i)
Building, structure, facility, or installation
means all of the pollutant-emitting activities which belong to the same industrial grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control) except the activities of any vessel. Pollutant-emitting activities shall be considered as part of the same industrial grouping if they belong to the same “Major Group” (
i.e.,
which have the same first two digit code) as described in the
Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1972,
as amended by the 1977 Supplement (U.S. Government Printing Office stock numbers 4101-0066 and 003-005-00716-0, respectively).
(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section,
building, structure, facility, or installation
means, for onshore activities under Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Major Group 13: Oil and Gas Extraction, all of the pollutant-emitting activities included in Major Group 13 that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control). Pollutant emitting activities shall be considered adjacent if they are located on the same surface site; or if they are located on surface sites that are located within
1/4
mile of one another (measured from the center of the equipment on the surface site) and they share equipment. Shared equipment includes, but is not limited to, produced fluids storage tanks, phase separators, natural gas dehydrators or emissions control devices. Surface site, as used in this paragraph (b)(6)(ii), has the same meaning as in 40 CFR 63.761.
(7)
Emissions unit
means any part of a stationary source that emits or would have the potential to emit any regulated NSR pollutant and includes an electric utility steam generating unit as defined in paragraph (b)(31) of this section. For purposes of this section, there are two types of emissions units as described in paragraphs (b)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) A new emissions unit is any emissions unit that is (or will be) newly constructed and that has existed for less than 2 years from the date such emissions unit first operated.
(ii) An existing emissions unit is any emissions unit that does not meet the requirements in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section. A replacement unit, as defined in paragraph (b)(33) of this section, is an existing emissions unit.
(8)
Construction
means any physical change or change in the method of operation (including fabrication, erection, installation, demolition, or modification of an emissions unit) that would result in a change in emissions.
(9)
Commence
as applied to construction of a major stationary source or major modification means that the owner or operator has all necessary preconstruction approvals or permits and either has:
(i) Begun, or caused to begin, a continuous program of actual on-site construction of the source, to be completed within a reasonable time; or
(ii) Entered into binding agreements or contractual obligations, which cannot be cancelled or modified without substantial loss to the owner or operator, to undertake a program of actual construction of the source to be completed within a reasonable time.
(10)
Necessary preconstruction approvals or permits
means those permits or approvals required under Federal air quality control laws and regulations and those air quality control laws and regulations which are part of the applicable State Implementation Plan.
(11)
Begin actual construction
means, in general, initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature. Such activities include, but are not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, laying underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures. With respect to a change in method of operations, this term refers to those on-site activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation of the change.
(12)
Best available control technology
means an emissions limitation (including a visible emission standard) based on the maximum degree of reduction for each pollutant subject to regulation under the Act which would be emitted from any proposed major stationary source or major modification which the Administrator, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such source or modification through application of production processes or available methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of such pollutant. In no event shall application of best available control technology result in emissions of any pollutant which would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard under 40 CFR part 60, 61, or 63. If the Administrator determines that technological or economic limitations on the application of measurement methodology to a particular emissions unit would make the imposition of an emissions standard infeasible, a design, equipment, work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, may be prescribed instead to satisfy the requirement for the application of best available control technology. Such standard shall, to the degree possible, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation of such design, equipment, work practice or operation, and shall provide for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results.
(13)(i)
Baseline concentration
means that ambient concentration level that exists in the baseline area at the time of the applicable minor source baseline date. A baseline concentration is determined for each pollutant for which a minor source baseline date is established and shall include:
(A) The actual emissions, as defined in paragraph (b)(21) of this section, representative of sources in existence on the applicable minor source baseline date, except as provided in paragraph (b)(13)(ii) of this section; and

(ii) The following will not be included in the baseline concentration and will
affect the applicable maximum allowable increase(s):
(A) Actual emissions, as defined in paragraph (b)(21) of this section, from any major stationary source on which construction commenced after the major source baseline date; and
(B) Actual emissions increases and decreases, as defined in paragraph (b)(21) of this section, at any stationary source occurring after the minor source baseline date.

(B) In the case of a major stationary source, the pollutant would be emitted in significant amounts, or, in the case of a major modification, there would be a significant net emissions increase of the pollutant.
(iv) Any minor source baseline date established originally for the TSP increments shall remain in effect and shall apply for purposes of determining the amount of available PM
10
increments, except that the Administrator shall rescind a minor source baseline date where it can be shown, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that the emissions increase from the major stationary source, or net emissions increase from the major modification, responsible for triggering that date did not result in a significant amount of PM
10
emissions.
(15)(i)
Baseline area
means any intrastate area (and every part thereof) designated as attainment or unclassifiable under section 107(d)(1)(A)(ii) or (iii) of the Act in which the major source or major modification establishing the minor source baseline date would construct or would have an air quality impact for the pollutant for which the baseline date is established, as follows: equal to or greater than 1 µg/m
3

2
, NO
2
, or PM
10
; or equal or greater than 0.3 µg/m
3
(annual average) for PM
2.5
.

(A) Establishes a minor source baseline date; or
(B) Is subject to 40 CFR 52.21 and would be constructed in the same state as the state proposing the redesignation.
(iii) Any baseline area established originally for the TSP increments shall remain in effect and shall apply for purposes of determining the amount of available PM
10
increments, except that such baseline area shall not remain in effect if the Administrator rescinds the corresponding minor source baseline date in accordance with paragraph (b)(14)(iv) of this section.
(16)
Allowable emissions
means the emissions rate of a stationary source calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the source (unless the source is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict the operating rate, or hours of operation, or both) and the most stringent of the following:

(18)
Secondary emissions
means emissions which would occur as a result of the construction or operation of a major stationary source or major modification, but do not come from the major stationary source or major modification itself. Secondary emissions include emissions from any offsite support facility which would not be constructed or increase its emissions except as a result of the construction or operation of the major stationary source or major modification. Secondary emissions do not include any emissions which come directly from a mobile source, such as emissions from the tailpipe of a motor vehicle, from a train, or from a vessel.

(20)
Fugitive emissions
means those emissions which could not reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally equivalent opening.
(21)(i)
Actual emissions
means the actual rate of emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant from an emissions unit, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (b)(21)(ii) through (iv) of this section, except that this definition shall not apply for calculating whether a significant emissions increase has occurred, or for establishing a PAL under paragraph (aa) of this section. Instead, paragraphs (b)(41) and (b)(48) of this section shall apply for those purposes.
(ii) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall equal the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during a consecutive 24-month period which precedes the particular date and which is representative of normal source operation. The Administrator shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. Actual emissions shall be calculated using the unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the selected time period.
(iii) The Administrator may presume that source-specific allowable emissions for the unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the unit.
(iv) For any emissions unit that has not begun normal operations on the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date.

For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO
2
e, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant and “significant” is defined as 75,000 tpy CO
2
e instead of applying the value in paragraph (b)(23)(ii) of this section.
(iv) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:
(A) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO

(6)-(12) [Reserved]
(j)
Control technology review.
(1) A major stationary source or major modification shall meet each applicable emissions limitation under the State Implementation Plan and each applicable emissions standard and standard of performance under 40 CFR part 60, 61, or 63.
(2) A new major stationary source shall apply best available control technology for each regulated NSR pollutant that it would have the potential to emit in significant amounts.
(3) A major modification shall apply best available control technology for each regulated NSR pollutant for which it would result in a significant net emissions increase at the source. This requirement applies to each proposed emissions unit at which a net emissions increase in the pollutant would occur as a result of a physical change or change in the method of operation in the unit.
(4) For phased construction projects, the determination of best available control technology shall be reviewed and modified as appropriate at the latest reasonable time which occurs no later than 18 months prior to commencement of construction of each independent phase of the project. At such time, the owner or operator of the applicable stationary source may be required to demonstrate the adequacy of any previous determination of best available control technology for the source.

Source impact analysis
—(1)
Required demonstration.
The owner or operator of the proposed source or modification shall demonstrate that allowable emission increases from the proposed source or modification, in conjunction with all other applicable emissions increases or reductions (including secondary emissions), would not cause or contribute to air pollution in violation of:
(i) Any national ambient air quality standard in any air quality control region; or
(ii) Any applicable maximum allowable increase over the baseline concentration in any area.
(2) [Reserved]
(l)
Air quality models.
(1) All estimates of ambient concentrations required under this paragraph shall be based on
applicable air quality models, data bases, and other requirements specified in appendix W of part 51 of this chapter (Guideline on Air Quality Models).
(2) Where an air quality model specified in appendix W of part 51 of this chapter (Guideline on Air Quality Models) is inappropriate, the model may be modified or another model substituted. Such a modification or substitution of a model may be made on a case-by-case basis or, where appropriate, on a generic basis for a specific state program. Written approval of the Administrator must be obtained for any modification or substitution. In addition, use of a modified or substituted model must be subject to notice and opportunity for public comment under procedures developed in accordance with paragraph (q) of this section.
(m)
Air quality analysis
—(1)
Preapplication analysis.
(i) Any application for a permit under this section shall contain an analysis of ambient air quality in the area that the major stationary source or major modification would affect for each of the following pollutants:
(A) For the source, each pollutant that it would have the potential to emit in a significant amount;
(B) For the modification, each pollutant for which it would result in a significant net emissions increase.
(ii) With respect to any such pollutant for which no National Ambient Air Quality Standard exists, the analysis shall contain such air quality monitoring data as the Administrator determines is necessary to assess ambient air quality for that pollutant in any area that the emissions of that pollutant would affect.
(iii) With respect to any such pollutant (other than nonmethane hydrocarbons) for which such a standard does exist, the analysis shall contain continuous air quality monitoring data gathered for purposes of determining whether emissions of that pollutant would cause or contribute to a violation of the standard or any maximum allowable increase.
(iv) In general, the continuous air quality monitoring data that is required shall have been gathered over a period of at least one year and shall represent at least the year preceding receipt of the application, except that, if the Administrator determines that a complete and adequate analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data gathered over a period shorter than one year (but not to be less than four months), the data that is required shall have been gathered over at least that shorter period.
(v) [Reserved]
(vi) The owner or operator of a proposed stationary source or modification of volatile organic compounds who satisfies all conditions of 40 CFR part 51 Appendix S, section IV may provide post-approval monitoring data for ozone in lieu of providing preconstruction data as required under paragraph (m)(1) of this section.
(vii)-(viii) [Reserved]
(2) Post-construction monitoring. The owner or operator of a major stationary source or major modification shall, after construction of the stationary source or modification, conduct such ambient monitoring as the Administrator determines is necessary to determine the effect emissions from the stationary source or modification may have, or are having, on air quality in any area.
(3) Operations of monitoring stations. The owner or operator of a major stationary source or major modification shall meet the requirements of Appendix B to part 58 of this chapter during the operation of monitoring stations for purposes of satisfying paragraph (m) of this section.
(n)
Source information.
The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification shall submit all information necessary to perform any analysis or make any determination required under this section.
(1) With respect to a source or modification to which paragraphs (j), (k), (m), and (o) of this section apply, such information shall include:
(i) A description of the nature, location, design capacity, and typical operating schedule of the source or modification, including specifications and drawings showing its design and plant layout;
(ii) A detailed schedule for construction of the source or modification;
(iii) A detailed description as to what system of continuous emission reduction is planned for the source or modification, emission estimates, and any other information necessary to determine that best available control technology would be applied.
(2) Upon request of the Administrator, the owner or operator shall also provide information on:
(i) The air quality impact of the source or modification, including meteorological and topographical data necessary to estimate such impact; and
(ii) The air quality impacts, and the nature and extent of any or all general commercial, residential, industrial, and other growth which has occurred since August 7, 1977, in the area the source or modification would affect.
(o)
Additional impact analyses.
(1) The owner or operator shall provide an analysis of the impairment to visibility, soils and vegetation that would occur as a result of the source or modification and general commercial, residential, industrial and other growth associated with the source or modification. The owner or operator need not provide an analysis of the impact on vegetation having no significant commercial or recreational value.
(2) The owner or operator shall provide an analysis of the air quality impact projected for the area as a result of general commercial, residential, industrial and other growth associated with the source or modification.
(3)
Visibility monitoring.
The Administrator may require monitoring of visibility in any Federal class I area near the proposed new stationary source for major modification for such purposes and by such means as the Administrator deems necessary and appropriate.
(p)
Sources impacting Federal Class I areas—additional requirements
—(1)
Notice to Federal land managers.
The Administrator shall provide written notice of any permit application for a proposed major stationary source or major modification, the emissions from which may affect a Class I area, to the Federal land manager and the Federal official charged with direct responsibility for management of any lands within any such area. Such notification shall include a copy of all information relevant to the permit application and shall be given within 30 days of receipt and at least 60 days prior to any public hearing on the application for a permit to construct. Such notification shall include an analysis of the proposed source's anticipated impacts on visibility in the Federal Class I area. The Administrator shall also provide the Federal land manager and such Federal officials with a copy of the preliminary determination required under paragraph (q) of this section, and shall make available to them any materials used in making that determination, promptly after the Administrator makes such determination. Finally, the Administrator shall also notify all affected Federal land managers within 30 days of receipt of any advance notification of any such permit application.
(2)
Federal Land Manager.
The Federal Land Manager and the Federal official charged with direct responsibility for management of such lands have an affirmative responsibility to protect the air quality related values (including visibility) of such lands and to consider, in consultation with the Administrator, whether a proposed source or modification will have an adverse impact on such values.
(3)
Visibility analysis.
The Administrator shall consider any analysis performed by the Federal land manager, provided within 30 days of the notification required by paragraph (p)(1) of this section, that shows that a proposed new major stationary source or major modification may have an adverse impact on visibility in any Federal Class I area. Where the Administrator finds that such an analysis does not demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that an adverse impact on visibility will result in the Federal Class I area, the Administrator must, in the notice of public hearing on the permit application, either explain his decision or give notice as to where the explanation can be obtained.
(4)
Denial—impact on air quality related values.
The Federal Land Manager of any such lands may demonstrate to the Administrator that the emissions from a proposed source or modification would have an adverse impact on the air quality-related values (including
visibility) of those lands, notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting from emissions from such source or modification would not cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the maximum allowable increases for a Class I area. If the Administrator concurs with such demonstration, then he shall not issue the permit.
(5)
Class I variances.
The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification may demonstrate to the Federal Land Manager that the emissions from such source or modification would have no adverse impact on the air quality related values of any such lands (including visibility), notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting from emissions from such source or modification would cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the maximum allowable increases for a Class I area. If the Federal Land Manager concurs with such demonstration and he so certifies, the State may authorize the Administrator, provided that the applicable requirements of this section are otherwise met, to issue the permit with such emission limitations as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulfur dioxide, PM
2.5,
PM

Sulfur dioxide variance by Governor with Federal Land Manager's concurrence.
The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification which cannot be approved under paragraph (p)(5) of this section may demonstrate to the Governor that the source cannot be constructed by reason of any maximum allowable increase for sulfur dioxide for a period of 24 hours or less applicable to any Class I area and, in the case of Federal mandatory Class I areas, that a variance under this clause would not adversely affect the air quality related values of the area (including visibility). The Governor, after consideration of the Federal Land Manager's recommendation (if any) and subject to his concurrence, may, after notice and public hearing, grant a variance from such maximum allowable increase. If such variance is granted, the Administrator shall issue a permit to such source or modification pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (p)(8) of this section provided that the applicable requirements of this section are otherwise met.
(7)
Variance by the Governor with the President's concurrence.
In any case where the Governor recommends a variance with which the Federal Land Manager does not concur, the recommendations of the Governor and the Federal Land Manager shall be transmitted to the President. The President may approve the Governor's recommendation if he finds that the variance is in the national interest. If the variance is approved, the Administrator shall issue a permit pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (p)(8) of this section provided that the applicable requirements of this section are otherwise met.
(8)
Emission limitations for Presidential or gubernatorial variance.
In the case of a permit issued pursuant to paragraph (p)(6) or (7) of this section, the source or modification shall comply with such emission limitations as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulfur dioxide from the source or modification would not (during any day on which the otherwise applicable maximum allowable increases are exceeded) cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the following maximum allowable increases over the baseline concentration and to assure that such emissions would not cause or contribute to concentrations which exceed the otherwise applicable maximum allowable increases for periods of exposure of 24 hours or less for more than 18 days, not necessarily consecutive, during any annual period:
Maximum Allowable Increase

(q)
Public participation.
The administrator shall follow the applicable procedures of 40 CFR part 124 in processing applications under this section.
(r)
Source obligation.
(1) Any owner or operator who constructs or operates a source or modification not in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this section or with the terms of any approval to construct, or any owner or operator of a source or modification subject to this section who commences construction after the effective date of these regulations without applying for and receiving approval hereunder, shall be subject to appropriate enforcement action.
(2) Approval to construct shall become invalid if construction is not commenced within 18 months after receipt of such approval, if construction is discontinued for a period of 18 months or more, or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The Administrator may extend the 18-month period upon a satisfactory showing that an extension is justified. This provision does not apply to the time period between construction of the approved phases of a phased construction project; each phase must commence construction within 18 months of the projected and approved commencement date.
(3) Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator of the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of the State implementation plan and any other requirements under local, State, or Federal law.
(4) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a relaxation in any enforceable limitation which was established after August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or modification otherwise to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then the requirements of paragraphs (j) through (s) of this section shall apply to the source or modification as though construction had not yet commenced on the source or modification.
(5) [Reserved]
(6) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (r)(6)(vi)(
b
) of this section, the provisions of this paragraph (r)(6) apply with respect to any regulated NSR pollutant emitted from projects at existing emissions units at a major stationary source (other than projects at a source with a PAL) in circumstances where there is a reasonable possibility, within the meaning of paragraph (r)(6)(vi) of this section, that a project that is not a part of a major modification may result in a significant emissions increase of such pollutant, and the owner or operator elects to use the method specified in paragraphs (b)(41)(ii)(
a
) through (
c
) of this section for calculating projected actual emissions.
(i) Before beginning actual construction of the project, the owner or operator shall document and maintain a record of the following information:
(A) A description of the project;
(B) Identification of the emissions unit(s) whose emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant could be affected by the project; and
(C) A description of the applicability test used to determine that the project is not a major modification for any regulated NSR pollutant, including the baseline actual emissions, the projected actual emissions, the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (b)(41)(ii)(
c
) of this section and an explanation for why such amount was excluded, and any netting calculations, if applicable.
(ii) If the emissions unit is an existing electric utility steam generating unit, before beginning actual construction, the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph (r)(6)(i) of this section to the Administrator. Nothing in this paragraph (r)(6)(ii) shall be construed to require the owner or operator of such a unit to obtain any determination from the Administrator before beginning actual construction.
(iii) The owner or operator shall monitor the emissions of any regulated
NSR pollutant that could increase as a result of the project and that is emitted by any emissions unit identified in paragraph (r)(6)(i)(
b
) of this section; and calculate and maintain a record of the annual emissions, in tons per year on a calendar year basis, for a period of 5 years following resumption of regular operations after the change, or for a period of 10 years following resumption of regular operations after the change if the project increases the design capacity or potential to emit that regulated NSR pollutant at such emissions unit.
(iv) If the unit is an existing electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Administrator within 60 days after the end of each year during which records must be generated under paragraph (r)(6)(iii) of this section setting out the unit's annual emissions during the calendar year that preceded submission of the report.
(v) If the unit is an existing unit other than an electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Administrator if the annual emissions, in tons per year, from the project identified in paragraph (r)(6)(i) of this section, exceed the baseline actual emissions (as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (r)(6)(i)(
c
) of this section), by a significant amount (as defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section) for that regulated NSR pollutant, and if such emissions differ from the preconstruction projection as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (r)(6)(i)(
c
) of this section. Such report shall be submitted to the Administrator within 60 days after the end of such year. The report shall contain the following:
(A) The name, address and telephone number of the major stationary source;
(B) The annual emissions as calculated pursuant to paragraph (r)(6)(iii) of this section; and
(C) Any other information that the owner or operator wishes to include in the report (e.g., an explanation as to why the emissions differ from the preconstruction projection).
(vi) A “reasonable possibility” under paragraph (r)(6) of this section occurs when the owner or operator calculates the project to result in either:
(A) A projected actual emissions increase of at least 50 percent of the amount that is a “significant emissions increase,” as defined under paragraph (b)(40) of this section (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant; or
(B) A projected actual emissions increase that, added to the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (b)(41)(ii)(
c
) of this section, sums to at least 50 percent of the amount that is a “significant emissions increase,” as defined under paragraph (b)(40) of this section (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant. For a project for which a reasonable possibility occurs only within the meaning of paragraph (r)(6)(vi)(
b
) of this section, and not also within the meaning of paragraph (r)(6)(vi)(
a
) of this section, then provisions (r)(6)(ii) through (v) do not apply to the project.
(7) The owner or operator of the source shall make the information required to be documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (r)(6) of this section available for review upon a request for inspection by the Administrator or the general public pursuant to the requirements contained in § 70.4(b)(3)(viii) of this chapter.
(s)
Environmental impact statements.
Whenever any proposed source or modification is subject to action by a Federal Agency which might necessitate preparation of an environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321), review by the Administrator conducted pursuant to this section shall be coordinated with the broad environmental reviews under that Act and under section 309 of the Clean Air Act to the maximum extent feasible and reasonable.
(t)
Disputed permits or redesignations.
If any State affected by the redesignation of an area by an Indian Governing Body, or any Indian Governing Body of a tribe affected by the redesignation of an area by a State, disagrees with such
redesignation, or if a permit is proposed to be issued for any major stationary source or major modification proposed for construction in any State which the Governor of an affected State or Indian Governing Body of an affected tribe determines will cause or contribute to a cumulative change in air quality in excess of that allowed in this part within the affected State or Indian Reservation, the Governor or Indian Governing Body may request the Administrator to enter into negotiations with the parties involved to resolve such dispute. If requested by any State or Indian Governing Body involved, the Administrator shall make a recommendation to resolve the dispute and protect the air quality related values of the lands involved. If the parties involved do not reach agreement, the Administrator shall resolve the dispute and his determination, or the results of agreements reached through other means, shall become part of the applicable State implementation plan and shall be enforceable as part of such plan. In resolving such disputes relating to area redesignation, the Administrator shall consider the extent to which the lands involved are of sufficient size to allow effective air quality management or have air quality related values of such an area.
(u)
Delegation of authority.
(1) The Administrator shall have the authority to delegate his responsibility for conducting source review pursuant to this section, in accordance with paragraph (u)(2) of this section.
(2) Where the Administrator delegates the responsibility for conducting source review under this section to any agency other than a Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, the following provisions shall apply:
(i) Where the delegate agency is not an air pollution control agency, it shall consult with the appropriate state, tribe, and local air pollution control agency prior to making any determination under this section. Similarly, where the delegate agency does not have continuing responsibility for managing land use, it shall consult with the appropriate state, tribe, and local agency primarily responsible for managing land use prior to making any determination under this section.
(ii) The delegate agency shall send a copy of any public comment notice required under paragraph (q) of this section to the Administrator through the appropriate Regional Office.
(3) In the case of a source or modification which proposes to construct in a Class III area, emissions from which would cause or contribute to air quality exceeding the maximum allowable increase applicable if the area were designated a Class II area, and where no standard under section 111 of the Act has been promulgated for such source category, the Administrator must approve the determination of best available control technology as set forth in the permit.
(v)
Innovative control technology.
(1) An owner or operator of a proposed major stationary source or major modification may request the Administrator in writing no later than the close of the comment period under 40 CFR 124.10 to approve a system of innovative control technology.
(2) The Administrator shall, with the consent of the governor(s) of the affected state(s), determine that the source or modification may employ a system of innovative control technology, if:
(i) The proposed control system would not cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation or function;
(ii) The owner or operator agrees to achieve a level of continuous emissions reduction equivalent to that which would have been required under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, by a date specified by the Administrator. Such date shall not be later than 4 years from the time of startup or 7 years from permit issuance;
(iii) The source or modification would meet the requirements of paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section, based on the emissions rate that the stationary source employing the system of innovative control technology would be required to meet on the date specified by the Administrator;
(iv) The source or modification would not before the date specified by the Administrator:
(A) Cause or contribute to a violation of an applicable national ambient air quality standard; or
(B) Impact any area where an applicable increment is known to be violated; and
(v) All other applicable requirements including those for public participation have been met.
(vi) The provisions of paragraph (p) of this section (relating to Class I areas) have been satisfied with respect to all periods during the life of the source or modification.
(3) The Administrator shall withdraw any approval to employ a system of innovative control technology made under this section, if:
(i) The proposed system fails by the specified date to achieve the required continuous emissions reduction rate; or
(ii) The proposed system fails before the specified date so as to contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety; or
(iii) The Administrator decides at any time that the proposed system is unlikely to achieve the required level of control or to protect the public health, welfare, or safety.
(4) If a source or modification fails to meet the required level of continuous emission reduction within the specified time period or the approval is withdrawn in accordance with paragraph (v)(3) of this section, the Administrator may allow the source or modification up to an additional 3 years to meet the requirement for the application of best available control technology through use of a demonstrated system of control.
(w)
Permit rescission.
(1) Any permit issued under this section or a prior version of this section shall remain in effect, unless and until it expires under paragraph (r)(2) of this section or is rescinded under this paragraph (w).
(2) An owner or operator of a stationary source or modification who holds a permit issued under this section for the construction of a new source or modification that meets the requirement in paragraph (w)(3) of this section may request that the Administrator rescind the permit or a particular portion of the permit.
(3) The Administrator may grant an application for rescission if the application shows that this section would not apply to the source or modification.
(4) If the Administrator rescinds a permit under this paragraph, the Administrator shall post a notice of the rescission determination on a public Web site identified by the Administrator within 60 days of the rescission.
(x)-(z) [Reserved]
(aa)
Actuals PALs.
The provisions in paragraphs (aa)(1) through (15) of this section govern actuals PALs.
(1)
Applicability.
(i) The Administrator may approve the use of an actuals PAL, including for GHGs on either a mass basis or a CO
2
e basis, for any existing major stationary source or any existing GHG-only source if the PAL meets the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(1) through (15) of this section. The term “PAL” shall mean “actuals PAL” throughout paragraph (aa) of this section.
(ii) Any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source or a GHG-only source that maintains its total source-wide emissions below the PAL level, meets the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(1) through (15) of this section, and complies with the PAL permit:
(A) Is not a major modification for the PAL pollutant;
(B) Does not have to be approved through the PSD program;
(C) Is not subject to the provisions in paragraph (r)(4) of this section (restrictions on relaxing enforceable emission limitations that the major stationary source used to avoid applicability of the major NSR program); and
(D) Does not make GHGs subject to regulation as defined by paragraph (b)(49) of this section.
(iii) Except as provided under paragraph (aa)(1)(ii)(
c
) of this section, a major stationary source or a GHG-only source shall continue to comply with all applicable Federal or State requirements, emission limitations, and work practice requirements that were established prior to the effective date of the PAL.
(2)
Definitions.
For the purposes of this section, the definitions in paragraphs (aa)(2)(i) through (xi) of this
section apply. When a term is not defined in these paragraphs, it shall have the meaning given in paragraph (b) of this section or in the Act.
(i)
Actuals PAL
for a major stationary source means a PAL based on the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(48) of this section) of all emissions units (as defined in paragraph (b)(7) of this section) at the source, that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant. For a GHG-only source,
actuals PAL
means a PAL based on the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(xiii) of this section) of all emissions units (as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(xiv) of this section) at the source, that emit or have the potential to emit GHGs.
(ii)
Allowable emissions
means “allowable emissions” as defined in paragraph (b)(16) of this section, except as this definition is modified according to paragraphs (aa)(2)(ii)(
a
) and (
b
) of this section.
(A) The allowable emissions for any emissions unit shall be calculated considering any emission limitations that are enforceable as a practical matter on the emissions unit's potential to emit.
(B) An emissions unit's potential to emit shall be determined using the definition in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, except that the words “or enforceable as a practical matter” should be added after “federally enforceable.”
(iii)
Small emissions unit
means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount less than the significant level for that PAL pollutant, as defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section or in the Act, whichever is lower. For a GHG PAL issued on a CO
2
e basis,
small emissions unit
means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit less than the amount of GHGs on a CO
2
e basis defined as “significant” for the purposes of paragraph (b)(49)(iii) of this section at the time the PAL permit is being issued.
(iv)
Major emissions unit
means:
(A) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit 100 tons per year or more of the PAL pollutant in an attainment area; or
(B) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the major source threshold for the PAL pollutant as defined by the Act for nonattainment areas. For example, in accordance with the definition of major stationary source in section 182(c) of the Act, an emissions unit would be a major emissions unit for VOC if the emissions unit is located in a serious ozone nonattainment area and it emits or has the potential to emit 50 or more tons of VOC per year.
(C) For a GHG PAL issued on a CO
2
e basis, any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit equal to or greater than the amount of GHGs on a CO
2
e basis that would be sufficient for a new source to trigger permitting requirements under paragraph (b)(49) of this section at the time the PAL permit is being issued.
(v)
Plantwide applicability limitation (PAL)
means an emission limitation expressed on a mass basis in tons per year, or expressed in tons per year CO
2
e for a CO
2
e-based GHG emission limitation, for a pollutant at a major stationary source or GHG-only source, that is enforceable as a practical matter and established source-wide in accordance with paragraphs (aa)(1) through (15) of this section.
(vi)
PAL effective date
generally means the date of issuance of the PAL permit. However, the PAL effective date for an increased PAL is the date any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant.
(vii)
PAL effective period
means the period beginning with the PAL effective date and ending 10 years later.
(viii)
PAL major modification
means, notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(49) of this section (the definitions for major modification, net emissions increase, and subject to regulation), any physical change in or change in the method of operation of the PAL source that causes it to emit the PAL pollutant at a level equal to or greater than the PAL.
(ix)
PAL permit
means the major NSR permit, the minor NSR permit, or the State operating permit under a program that is approved into the State Implementation Plan, or the title V permit issued by the Administrator
that establishes a PAL for a major stationary source or a GHG-only source.
(x)
PAL pollutant
means the pollutant for which a PAL is established at a major stationary source or a GHG-only source. For a GHG-only source, the only available PAL pollutant is greenhouse gases.
(xi)
Significant emissions unit
means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit a PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the significant level (as defined in paragraph (b)(23) of this section or in the Act, whichever is lower) for that PAL pollutant, but less than the amount that would qualify the unit as a major emissions unit as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(iv) of this section. For a GHG PAL issued on a CO
2
e basis,
significant emissions unit
means any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit GHGs on a CO
2
e basis in amounts equal to or greater than the amount that would qualify the unit as small emissions unit as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(iii) of this section, but less than the amount that would qualify the unit as a major emissions unit as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(iv)(
c
) of this section.
(xii)
GHG-only source
means any existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit GHGs in the amount equal to or greater than the amount of GHGs on a mass basis that would be sufficient for a new source to trigger permitting requirements for GHGs under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the amount of GHGs on a CO
2
e basis that would be sufficient for a new source to trigger permitting requirements for GHGs under paragraph (b)(49) of this section at the time the PAL permit is being issued, but does not emit or have the potential to emit any other non-GHG regulated NSR pollutant at or above the applicable major source threshold. A GHG-only source may only obtain a PAL for GHG emissions under paragraph (aa) of this section.
(xiii)
Baseline actual emissions
for a GHG PAL means the average rate, in tons per year CO
2
e or tons per year GHG, as applicable, at which the emissions unit actually emitted GHGs during any consecutive 24-month period selected by the owner or operator within the 10-year period immediately preceding either the date the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project, or the date a complete permit application is received by the Administrator for a permit required under this section or by the permitting authority for a permit required by a plan, whichever is earlier. For any existing electric utility steam generating unit,
baseline actual emissions
for a GHG PAL means the average rate, in tons per year CO
2
e or tons per year GHG, as applicable, at which the emissions unit actually emitted the GHGs during any consecutive 24-month period selected by the owner or operator within the 5-year period immediately preceding either the date the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project, except that the Administrator shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation.
(A) The average rate shall include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions.
(B) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non-compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above an emission limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive 24-month period.
(C) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any emissions that would have exceeded an emission limitation with which the stationary source must currently comply, had such stationary source been required to comply with such limitations during the consecutive 24-month period.
(D) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive 24-month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual GHG emissions and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraphs (aa)(2)(xiii)(
b
) and (
c
) of this section.
(xiv)
Emissions unit
with respect to GHGs means any part of a stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit GHGs. For purposes of this section, there are two types of emissions units as described in the following:
(A) A new emissions unit is any emissions unit that is (or will be) newly
constructed and that has existed for less than 2 years from the date such emissions unit first operated.
(B) An existing emissions unit is any emissions unit that does not meet the requirements in paragraph (aa)(2)(xiv)(
a
) of this section.
(xv)
Minor source
means any stationary source that does not meet the definition of major stationary source in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for any pollutant at the time the PAL is issued.
(3)
Permit application requirements.
As part of a permit application requesting a PAL, the owner or operator of a major stationary source or a GHG-only source shall submit the following information to the Administrator for approval:
(i) A list of all emissions units at the source designated as small, significant or major based on their potential to emit. In addition, the owner or operator of the source shall indicate which, if any, Federal or State applicable requirements, emission limitations, or work practices apply to each unit.
(ii) Calculations of the baseline actual emissions (with supporting documentation). Baseline actual emissions are to include emissions associated not only with operation of the unit, but also emissions associated with startup, shutdown, and malfunction.
(iii) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator proposes to use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a 12-month rolling total for each month as required by paragraph (aa)(13)(i) of this section.
(iv) As part of a permit application requesting a GHG PAL, the owner or operator of a major stationary source or a GHG-only source shall submit a statement by the source owner or operator that clarifies whether the source is an existing major source as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(
a
) and (
b
) of this section or a GHG-only source as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(xii) of this section.
(4)
General requirements for establishing PALs.
(i) The Administrator is allowed to establish a PAL at a major stationary source or a GHG-only source, provided that at a minimum, the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(4)(i)(
a
) through (
g
) of this section are met.
(A) The PAL shall impose an annual emission limitation expressed on a mass basis in tons per year, or expressed in tons per year CO
2
e, that is enforceable as a practical matter, for the entire major stationary source or GHG-only source. For each month during the PAL effective period after the first 12 months of establishing a PAL, the major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the monthly emissions from each emissions unit under the PAL for the previous 12 consecutive months is less than the PAL (a 12-month average, rolled monthly). For each month during the first 11 months from the PAL effective date, the major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the preceding monthly emissions from the PAL effective date for each emissions unit under the PAL is less than the PAL.
(B) The PAL shall be established in a PAL permit that meets the public participation requirements in paragraph (aa)(5) of this section.
(C) The PAL permit shall contain all the requirements of paragraph (aa)(7) of this section.
(D) The PAL shall include fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, from all emissions units that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant at the major stationary source or GHG-only source.
(E) Each PAL shall regulate emissions of only one pollutant.
(F) Each PAL shall have a PAL effective period of 10 years.
(G) The owner or operator of the major stationary source or GHG-only source with a PAL shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements provided in paragraphs (aa)(12) through (14) of this section for each emissions unit under the PAL through the PAL effective period.
(ii) At no time (during or after the PAL effective period) are emissions reductions of a PAL pollutant that occur
during the PAL effective period creditable as decreases for purposes of offsets under § 51.165(a)(3)(ii) of this chapter unless the level of the PAL is reduced by the amount of such emissions reductions and such reductions would be creditable in the absence of the PAL.
(5)
Public participation requirements for PALs.
PALs for existing major stationary sources or GHG-only sources shall be established, renewed, or increased through a procedure that is consistent with §§ 51.160 and 51.161 of this chapter. This includes the requirement that the Administrator provide the public with notice of the proposed approval of a PAL permit and at least a 30-day period for submittal of public comment. The Administrator must address all material comments before taking final action on the permit.
(6)
Setting the 10-year actuals PAL level.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (aa)(6)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the plan shall provide that the actuals PAL level for a major stationary source or a GHG-only source shall be established as the sum of the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(48) of this section or, for GHGs, paragraph (aa)(2)(xiii) of this section) of the PAL pollutant for each emissions unit at the source; plus an amount equal to the applicable significant level for the PAL pollutant under paragraph (b)(23) of this section or under the Act, whichever is lower. When establishing the actuals PAL level, for a PAL pollutant, only one consecutive 24-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for all existing emissions units. However, a different consecutive 24-month period may be used for each different PAL pollutant. Emissions associated with units that were permanently shut down after this 24-month period must be subtracted from the PAL level. The reviewing authority shall specify a reduced PAL level(s) (in tons/yr) in the PAL permit to become effective on the future compliance date(s) of any applicable Federal or State regulatory requirement(s) that the reviewing authority is aware of prior to issuance of the PAL permit. For instance, if the source owner or operator will be required to reduce emissions from industrial boilers in half from baseline emissions of 60 ppm NO
X
to a new rule limit of 30 ppm, then the permit shall contain a future effective PAL level that is equal to the current PAL level reduced by half of the original baseline emissions of such unit(s).
(ii) For newly constructed units (which do not include modifications to existing units) on which actual construction began after the 24-month period, in lieu of adding the baseline actual emissions as specified in paragraph (aa)(6)(i) of this section, the emissions must be added to the PAL level in an amount equal to the potential to emit of the units.
(iii) For CO
2
e based GHG PAL, the actuals PAL level shall be established as the sum of the GHGs baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(xiii) of this section) of GHGs for each emissions unit at the source, plus an amount equal to the amount defined as “significant” on a CO
2
e basis for the purposes of paragraph (b)(49)(iii) at the time the PAL permit is being issued. When establishing the actuals PAL level for a CO
2
e-based PAL, only one consecutive 24-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for all existing emissions units. Emissions associated with units that were permanently shut down after this 24-month period must be subtracted from the PAL level. The reviewing authority shall specify a reduced PAL level (in tons per year CO
2
e) in the PAL permit to become effective on the future compliance date(s) of any applicable Federal or state regulatory requirement(s) that the reviewing authority is aware of prior to issuance of the PAL permit.
(7)
Contents of the PAL permit.
The PAL permit must contain, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (aa)(7)(i) through (xi) of this section.
(i) The PAL pollutant and the applicable source-wide emission limitation in tons per year or tons per year CO
2
e.
(ii) The PAL permit effective date and the expiration date of the PAL (PAL effective period).
(iii) Specification in the PAL permit that if a major stationary source or a GHG-only source owner or operator applies to renew a PAL in accordance with paragraph (aa)(10) of this section
before the end of the PAL effective period, then the PAL shall not expire at the end of the PAL effective period. It shall remain in effect until a revised PAL permit is issued by a reviewing authority.
(iv) A requirement that emission calculations for compliance purposes must include emissions from startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions.
(v) A requirement that, once the PAL expires, the major stationary source or GHG-only source is subject to the requirements of paragraph (aa)(9) of this section.
(vi) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator shall use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a 12-month rolling total as required by paragraph (aa)(13)(i) of this section.
(vii) A requirement that the major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator monitor all emissions units in accordance with the provisions under paragraph (aa)(12) of this section.
(viii) A requirement to retain the records required under paragraph (aa)(13) of this section on site. Such records may be retained in an electronic format.
(ix) A requirement to submit the reports required under paragraph (aa)(14) of this section by the required deadlines.
(x) Any other requirements that the Administrator deems necessary to implement and enforce the PAL.
(xi) A permit for a GHG PAL issued to a GHG-only source shall also include a statement denoting that GHG emissions at the source will not be subject to regulation under paragraph (b)(49) of this section as long as the source complies with the PAL.
(8)
PAL effective period and reopening of the PAL permit.
The requirements in paragraphs (aa)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section apply to actuals PALs.
(i)
PAL effective period.
The Administrator shall specify a PAL effective period of 10 years.
(ii)
Reopening of the PAL permit.
(A) During the PAL effective period, the Administrator must reopen the PAL permit to:
(
1
) Correct typographical/calculation errors made in setting the PAL or reflect a more accurate determination of emissions used to establish the PAL;
(
2
) Reduce the PAL if the owner or operator of the major stationary source creates creditable emissions reductions for use as offsets under § 51.165(a)(3)(ii) of this chapter; and
(
3
) Revise the PAL to reflect an increase in the PAL as provided under paragraph (aa)(11) of this section.
(B) The Administrator shall have discretion to reopen the PAL permit for the following:
(
1
) Reduce the PAL to reflect newly applicable Federal requirements (for example, NSPS) with compliance dates after the PAL effective date;
(
2
) Reduce the PAL consistent with any other requirement, that is enforceable as a practical matter, and that the State may impose on the major stationary source or GHG-only source under the State Implementation Plan; and
(
3
) Reduce the PAL if the reviewing authority determines that a reduction is necessary to avoid causing or contributing to a NAAQS or PSD increment violation, or to an adverse impact on an air quality related value that has been identified for a Federal Class I area by a Federal Land Manager and for which information is available to the general public.
(C) Except for the permit reopening in paragraph (aa)(8)(ii)(
a
)(
1
) of this section for the correction of typographical/calculation errors that do not increase the PAL level, all other reopenings shall be carried out in accordance with the public participation requirements of paragraph (aa)(5) of this section.
(9)
Expiration of a PAL.
Any PAL that is not renewed in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (aa)(10) of this section shall expire at the end of the PAL effective period, and the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(9)(i) through (v) of this section shall apply.
(i) Each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units) that existed under the PAL shall comply with an allowable emission limitation under a revised permit established according to the procedures in paragraphs (aa)(9)(i)(
a
) and (
b
) of this section.
(A) Within the time frame specified for PAL renewals in paragraph (aa)(10)(ii) of this section, the major stationary source or GHG-only source shall submit a proposed allowable emission limitation for each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units, if such a distribution is more appropriate as decided by the Administrator) by distributing the PAL allowable emissions for the major stationary source or GHG-only source among each of the emissions units that existed under the PAL. If the PAL had not yet been adjusted for an applicable requirement that became effective during the PAL effective period, as required under paragraph (aa)(10)(v) of this section, such distribution shall be made as if the PAL had been adjusted.
(B) The Administrator shall decide whether and how the PAL allowable emissions will be distributed and issue a revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as the Administrator determines is appropriate.
(ii) Each emissions unit(s) shall comply with the allowable emission limitation on a 12-month rolling basis. The Administrator may approve the use of monitoring systems (source testing, emission factors, etc.) other than CEMS, CERMS, PEMS, or CPMS to demonstrate compliance with the allowable emission limitation.
(iii) Until the Administrator issues the revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as required under paragraph (aa)(9)(i)(
b
) of this section, the source shall continue to comply with a source-wide, multi-unit emissions cap equivalent to the level of the PAL emission limitation.
(iv) Any physical change or change in the method of operation at the major stationary source or GHG-only source will be subject to major NSR requirements if such change meets the definition of major modification in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(v) The major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator shall continue to comply with any State or Federal applicable requirements (BACT, RACT, NSPS, etc.) that may have applied either during the PAL effective period or prior to the PAL effective period except for those emission limitations that had been established pursuant to paragraph (r)(4) of this section, but were eliminated by the PAL in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (aa)(1)(ii)(
c
) of this section.
(10)
Renewal of a PAL.
(i) The Administrator shall follow the procedures specified in paragraph (aa)(5) of this section in approving any request to renew a PAL for a major stationary source or a GHG-only source, and shall provide both the proposed PAL level and a written rationale for the proposed PAL level to the public for review and comment. During such public review, any person may propose a PAL level for the source for consideration by the Administrator.
(ii)
Application deadline.
A major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator shall submit a timely application to the Administrator to request renewal of a PAL. A timely application is one that is submitted at least 6 months prior to, but not earlier than 18 months from, the date of permit expiration. This deadline for application submittal is to ensure that the permit will not expire before the permit is renewed. If the owner or operator of a major stationary source or GHG-only source submits a complete application to renew the PAL within this time period, then the PAL shall continue to be effective until the revised permit with the renewed PAL is issued.
(iii)
Application requirements.
The application to renew a PAL permit shall contain the information required in paragraphs (aa)(10)(iii)(
a
) through (
d
) of this section.
(A) The information required in paragraphs (aa)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(B) A proposed PAL level.
(C) The sum of the potential to emit of all emissions units under the PAL (with supporting documentation).
(D) Any other information the owner or operator wishes the Administrator to consider in determining the appropriate level for renewing the PAL.
(iv)
PAL adjustment.
In determining whether and how to adjust the PAL, the Administrator shall consider the
options outlined in paragraphs (aa)(10)(iv)(
a
) and (
b
) of this section. However, in no case may any such adjustment fail to comply with paragraph (aa)(10)(iv)(
c
) of this section.
(A) If the emissions level calculated in accordance with paragraph (aa)(6) of this section is equal to or greater than 80 percent of the PAL level, the Administrator may renew the PAL at the same level without considering the factors set forth in paragraph (aa)(10)(iv)(
b
) of this section; or
(B) The Administrator may set the PAL at a level that he or she determines to be more representative of the source's baseline actual emissions, or that he or she determines to be more appropriate considering air quality needs, advances in control technology, anticipated economic growth in the area, desire to reward or encourage the source's voluntary emissions reductions, or other factors as specifically identified by the Administrator in his or her written rationale.
(C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (aa)(10)(iv)(a) and (b) of this section:
(
1
) If the potential to emit of the major stationary source or GHG-only source is less than the PAL, the Administrator shall adjust the PAL to a level no greater than the potential to emit of the source; and
(
2
) The Administrator shall not approve a renewed PAL level higher than the current PAL, unless the major stationary source or GHG-only source has complied with the provisions of paragraph (aa)(11) of this section (increasing a PAL).
(v) If the compliance date for a State or Federal requirement that applies to the PAL source occurs during the PAL effective period, and if the Administrator has not already adjusted for such requirement, the PAL shall be adjusted at the time of PAL permit renewal or title V permit renewal, whichever occurs first.
(11)
Increasing a PAL during the PAL effective period.
(i) The Administrator may increase a PAL emission limitation only if the major stationary source or GHG-only source complies with the provisions in paragraphs (aa)(11)(i)(
a
) through (
d
) of this section.
(A) The owner or operator of the major stationary source or GHG-only source shall submit a complete application to request an increase in the PAL limit for a PAL major modification. Such application shall identify the emissions unit(s) contributing to the increase in emissions so as to cause the major stationary or GHG-only source's emissions to equal or exceed its PAL.
(B) As part of this application, the major stationary source or GHG-only source owner or operator shall demonstrate that the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units assuming application of BACT equivalent controls, plus the sum of the allowable emissions of the new or modified emissions unit(s) exceeds the PAL. The level of control that would result from BACT equivalent controls on each significant or major emissions unit shall be determined by conducting a new BACT analysis at the time the application is submitted, unless the emissions unit is currently required to comply with a BACT or LAER requirement that was established within the preceding 10 years. In such a case, the assumed control level for that emissions unit shall be equal to the level of BACT or LAER with which that emissions unit must currently comply.
(C) The owner or operator obtains a major NSR permit for all emissions unit(s) identified in paragraph (aa)(11)(i)(
a
) of this section, regardless of the magnitude of the emissions increase resulting from them (that is, no significant levels apply). These emissions unit(s) shall comply with any emissions requirements resulting from the major NSR process (for example, BACT), even though they have also become subject to the PAL or continue to be subject to the PAL.
(D) The PAL permit shall require that the increased PAL level shall be effective on the day any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant.
(ii) The Administrator shall calculate the new PAL as the sum of the allowable emissions for each modified or new emissions unit, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units
(assuming application of BACT equivalent controls as determined in accordance with paragraph (aa)(11)(i)(
b
)), plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units.
(iii) The PAL permit shall be revised to reflect the increased PAL level pursuant to the public notice requirements of paragraph (aa)(5) of this section.
(12)
Monitoring requirements for PALs.
(i)
General requirements.
(A) Each PAL permit must contain enforceable requirements for the monitoring system that accurately determines plantwide emissions of the PAL pollutant in terms of mass per unit of time or CO
2
e per unit of time. Any monitoring system authorized for use in the PAL permit must be based on sound science and meet generally acceptable scientific procedures for data quality and manipulation. Additionally, the information generated by such system must meet minimum legal requirements for admissibility in a judicial proceeding to enforce the PAL permit.
(B) The PAL monitoring system must employ one or more of the four general monitoring approaches meeting the minimum requirements set forth in paragraphs (aa)(12)(ii)(
a
) through (
d
) of this section and must be approved by the Administrator.
(C) Notwithstanding paragraph (aa)(12)(i)(
b
) of this section, you may also employ an alternative monitoring approach that meets paragraph (aa)(12)(i)(
a
) of this section if approved by the Administrator.
(D) Failure to use a monitoring system that meets the requirements of this section renders the PAL invalid.
(ii) Minimum performance requirements for approved monitoring approaches. The following are acceptable general monitoring approaches when conducted in accordance with the minimum requirements in paragraphs (aa)(12)(iii) through (ix) of this section:
(A) Mass balance calculations for activities using coatings or solvents;
(B) CEMS;
(C) CPMS or PEMS; and
(D) Emission factors.
(iii)
Mass balance calculations.
An owner or operator using mass balance calculations to monitor PAL pollutant emissions from activities using coating or solvents shall meet the following requirements:
(A) Provide a demonstrated means of validating the published content of the PAL pollutant that is contained in or created by all materials used in or at the emissions unit;
(B) Assume that the emissions unit emits all of the PAL pollutant that is contained in or created by any raw material or fuel used in or at the emissions unit, if it cannot otherwise be accounted for in the process; and
(C) Where the vendor of a material or fuel, which is used in or at the emissions unit, publishes a range of pollutant content from such material, the owner or operator must use the highest value of the range to calculate the PAL pollutant emissions unless the Administrator determines there is site-specific data or a site-specific monitoring program to support another content within the range.
(iv)
CEMS.
An owner or operator using CEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements:
(A) CEMS must comply with applicable Performance Specifications found in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B; and
(B) CEMS must sample, analyze and record data at least every 15 minutes while the emissions unit is operating.
(v)
CPMS or PEMS.
An owner or operator using CPMS or PEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements:
(A) The CPMS or the PEMS must be based on current site-specific data demonstrating a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions across the range of operation of the emissions unit; and
(B) Each CPMS or PEMS must sample, analyze, and record data at least every 15 minutes, or at another less frequent interval approved by the Administrator, while the emissions unit is operating.
(vi)
Emission factors.
An owner or operator using emission factors to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements:
(A) All emission factors shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to account for the degree of uncertainty or limitations in the factors' development;
(B) The emissions unit shall operate within the designated range of use for the emission factor, if applicable; and
(C) If technically practicable, the owner or operator of a significant emissions unit that relies on an emission factor to calculate PAL pollutant emissions shall conduct validation testing to determine a site-specific emission factor within 6 months of PAL permit issuance, unless the Administrator determines that testing is not required.
(vii) A source owner or operator must record and report maximum potential emissions without considering enforceable emission limitations or operational restrictions for an emissions unit during any period of time that there is no monitoring data, unless another method for determining emissions during such periods is specified in the PAL permit.
(viii) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(12)(iii) through (vii) of this section, where an owner or operator of an emissions unit cannot demonstrate a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions rate at all operating points of the emissions unit, the Administrator shall, at the time of permit issuance:
(A) Establish default value(s) for determining compliance with the PAL based on the highest potential emissions reasonably estimated at such operating point(s); or
(B) Determine that operation of the emissions unit during operating conditions when there is no correlation between monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions is a violation of the PAL.
(ix)
Re-validation.
All data used to establish the PAL pollutant must be re-validated through performance testing or other scientifically valid means approved by the Administrator. Such testing must occur at least once every 5 years after issuance of the PAL.
(13)
Recordkeeping requirements.
(i) The PAL permit shall require an owner or operator to retain a copy of all records necessary to determine compliance with any requirement of paragraph (aa) of this section and of the PAL, including a determination of each emissions unit's 12-month rolling total emissions, for 5 years from the date of such record.
(ii) The PAL permit shall require an owner or operator to retain a copy of the following records for the duration of the PAL effective period plus 5 years:
(A) A copy of the PAL permit application and any applications for revisions to the PAL; and

§ 52.24
Statutory restriction on new sources.
(a) Any area designated nonattainment pursuant to section 107(d) of the Act to which, immediately prior to the enactment of the Amendments to the
Act of 1990 (November 15, 1990), a prohibition of construction or modification of major stationary sources was applied, shall retain that prohibition if such prohibition was applied by virtue of a finding of the Administrator that the State containing such an area:
(1) Failed to submit an implementation plan meeting the requirements of an approvable new source review permitting program; or
(2) Failed to submit an implementation plan that provided for timely attainment of the national ambient air quality standard for sulfur dioxide by December 31, 1982. This prohibition shall apply until the Administrator approves a plan for such area as meeting the applicable requirements of part D of title I of the Act as amended (NSR permitting requirements) or subpart 5 of part D of title I of the Act as amended (relating to attainment of the national ambient air quality standards for sulfur dioxide), as applicable.
(b) Permits to construct and operate as required by permit programs under section 172(c)(5) of the Act may not be issued for new or modified major stationary sources proposing to locate in nonattainment areas or areas in a transport region where the Administrator has determined that the applicable implementation plan is not being adequately implemented for the nonattainment area or transport region in which the proposed source is to be constructed or modified in accordance with the requirements of part D of title I of the Act.
(c) Whenever, on the basis of any information, the Administrator finds that a State is not in compliance with any requirement or prohibition of the Act relating to the construction of new sources or the modification of existing sources, the Administrator may issue an order under section 113(a)(5) of the Act prohibiting the construction or modification of any major stationary source in any area to which such requirement applies.
(d) The restrictions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply only to major stationary sources of emissions that cause or contribute to concentrations of the pollutant (or precursors, as applicable) for which the transport region or nonattainment area was designated such, and for which the applicable implementation plan is not being carried out in accordance with, or does not meet, the requirements of part D of title I of the Act.
(e) For any transport region or any area designated as nonattainment for any national ambient air quality standard, the restrictions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall apply to any major stationary source or major modification that would be major for the pollutant (or precursors, where applicable) for which the area is designated nonattainment or a transport region, if the stationary source or major modification would be constructed anywhere in the designated nonattainment area or transport region.
(f) The provisions in § 51.165 of this chapter shall apply in interpreting the terms under this section.
(g) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a relaxation in any enforceable limitation which was established after August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or modification otherwise to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then:
(1) If the construction moratorium imposed pursuant to this section is still in effect for the nonattainment area or transport region in which the source or modification is located, then the permit may not be so revised; or
(2) If the construction moratorium is no longer in effect in that area, then the requirements of § 51.165 of this chapter shall apply to the source or modification as though construction had not yet commenced on the source or modification.
(h) This section does not apply to major stationary sources or major modifications locating in a clearly defined part of a nonattainment area or transport region (such as a political subdivision of a State), where EPA finds that a plan which meets the requirements of part D of title I of the Act is in effect and is being implemented in that part.
(i)-(j) [Reserved]
(k) For an area designated as nonattainment after July 1, 1979, the Emission Offset Interpretative Ruling, 40 CFR part 51, appendix S shall govern permits to construct and operate applied for during the period between the date of designation as nonattainment and the date the NSR permit program meeting the requirements of part D is approved. The Emission Offset Interpretative Ruling, 40 CFR part 51, appendix S, shall also govern permits to construct and operate applied for in any area designated under section 107(d) of the CAA as attainment or unclassifiable for ozone that is located in an ozone transport region prior to the date the NSR permitting program meeting the requirements of part D is approved.

Specific disapprovals are listed where applicable in Subparts B through DDD of this part. The provisions of this section have been incorporated by reference into the applicable implementation plans for various States, as provided in Subparts B through DDD of this part.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, all terms shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Clean Air Act, in the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) program approved as part of the applicable SIP pursuant to 40 CFR 51.24 for the State, or in the protection of visibility program (40 CFR 51.301), all as in effect on July 12, 1985.
(c)
Federal visibility analysis.
Any person shall have the right, in connection with any application for a permit to construct a major stationary source or major modification, to request that the administrator take responsibility from the State for conducting the required review of a proposed source's impact on visibility in any Federal Class I area. If requested, the Administrator shall take such responsibility and conduct such review pursuant to paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) of this section in any case where the State fails to provide all of the procedural steps listed in paragraph (d) of this section. A request pursuant to this paragraph must be made within 60 days of the notice soliciting public comment on a permit, unless such notice is not properly given. The Administrator will not entertain requests challenging the substance of any state action concerning visibility where the State has provided all of the procedural steps listed in paragraph (d) of this section.
(d)
Procedural steps in visibility review.
(1) The reviewing authority must provide written notification to all affected Federal land managers of any permit application for any proposed new major stationary source or major modification that may affect visibility in any Federal Class I area. Such notification shall include a copy of all information relevant to the permit application and shall be given within 30 days of receipt and at least 60 days prior to any public hearing on the application for a permit to construct. Such notification shall include the proposed source's anticipated impacts on visibility in any Federal Class I area as provided by the applicant. Notification must also be given to all affected Federal land managers within 30 days of receipt of any advance notification of any such permit application.
(2) The reviewing authority must consider any analysis performed by the Federal land managers, provided within 30 days of the notification required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, that shows that such proposed new major stationary source or major modification may have:
(i) An adverse impact on visibility in any Federal Class I area, or
(ii) An adverse impact on visibility in an integral vista codified in part 81 of this title.
(3) Where the reviewing authority finds that such an analysis does not demonstrate that the effect in paragraphs (d)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section will occur, either an explanation of its decision or notification as to where the explanation can be obtained must be included in the notice of public hearing.
(4) Where the reviewing authority finds that such an analysis does demonstrate that the effect in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section will occur, the permit shall not be issued.
(5) Where the reviewing authority finds that such an analysis does demonstrate that the effect in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section will occur, the reviewing authority may issue a permit if the emissions from the source or modification will be consistent with reasonable progress toward the national goal. In making this decision, the reviewing authority may take into account the costs of compliance, the time necessary for compliance, the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance, and the useful life of the source.
(e)
Federal land manager notification.
The Administrator shall provide all of the procedural steps listed in paragraph (d) of this section in conducting reviews pursuant to this section.
(f)
Monitoring.
The Administrator may require monitoring of visibility in any Federal Class I area near the proposed new stationary source or major modification for such purposes and by such means as the Administrator deems necessary and appropriate.
(g)
Public participation.
The Administrator shall follow the applicable procedures at 40 CFR part 124 in conducting reviews under this section. The Administrator shall follow the procedures at 40 CFR 52.21(q) as in effect on August 7, 1980, to the extent that the procedures of 40 CFR part 124 do not apply.
(h)
Federal permit.
In any case where the Administrator has made a finding that a State consistently fails or is unable to provide the procedural steps listed in paragraph (d) of this section, the Administrator shall require all prospective permit applicants in such State to apply directly to the Administrator, and the Administrator shall conduct a visibility review pursuant to this section for all permit applications.

Such notification shall include a copy of all information relevant to the permit application and shall be given within 30 days of receipt and at least 60 days prior to any public hearing on the application for a permit to construct. Such notification shall include an analysis of the proposed source's anticipated impacts on visibility in any visibility protection area. The Administrator shall also notify all affected FLM's within 30 days of receipt of any advance notification of any such permit application.
(3) The Administrator shall consider any analysis performed by the Federal land manager, provided within 30 days of the notification required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section, that such proposed new major stationary source or major modification may have an adverse impact on visibility in any visibility protection area. Where the Administrator finds that such an analysis does not demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that an adverse impact on visibility will result in the visibility protection area, the Administrator must, in the notice of public hearing, either explain his decision or give notice as to where the explanation can be obtained.
(f)
Public participation.
The Administrator shall follow the applicable procedures of 40 CFR part 124 in processing applications under this section. The Administrator shall follow the procedures at 40 CFR 52.21(q) as in effect on August 7, 1980, to the extent that the procedures of 40 CFR part 124 do not apply.
(g)
National visibility goal.
The Administrator shall only issue permits to those sources whose emissions will be consistent with making reasonable progress toward the national goal of preventing any future, and remedying any existing, impairment of visibility in visibility protection areas which impairment results from man-made air pollution. In making the decision to issue a permit, the Administrator may take into account the costs of compliance, the time necessary for compliance, the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance, and the useful life of the source.
(h)
Monitoring.
The Administrator may require monitoring of visibility in any visibility protection area near the proposed new stationary source or major modification for such purposes and by such means as the Administrator deems necessary and appropriate.
(i)
Delegation of authority.
(1) The Administrator shall have the authority to delegate the responsibility for conducting source review pursuant to this section to any agency in accordance with paragraphs (i)(2) and (3) of this section.
(2) Where the Administrator delegates the responsibility for conducting source review under this section to any agency other than a Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, the following provisions shall apply:
(i) Where the delegate agency is not an air pollution control agency it shall consult with the appropriate State and local air pollution control agency prior
to making any determination under this section.

such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator issues such proposed or final disapproval.
(3)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has conditionally-approved the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the conditional approval converts to a disapproval or the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove in whole or in part the revised SIP the State submits to fulfill the commitment in the conditionally-approved plan. If the conditional approval so becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of the date the approval becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is applicable, or 18 months following the finding that started the sanctions clock. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies, unless the Administrator determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected.
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and after 18 but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator has conditionally approved the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the conditional approval converts to a disapproval or the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove in whole or in part the revised SIP the State submits to fulfill the commitment in the conditionally-approved plan. If the conditional approval so becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the approval becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is applicable. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected area, unless the Administrator determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected, or immediately if the conditional approval becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is applicable, more than 6 months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency prompting the finding and after 24 months from the finding the Administrator has conditionally approved the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until the conditional approval converts to a
disapproval or the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove in whole or in part the revised SIP the State submits to fulfill its commitment in the conditionally-approved plan. If the conditional approval so becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the conditional approval becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is applicable.
(4)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has proposed to find that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the approved plan and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not been corrected, or 18 months following the finding that started the sanctions clock. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applies, unless the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected.
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if after 18 months but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed to find that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the approved plan and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not been corrected. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected area, unless the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected, or immediately if EPA's proposed or final action finding the deficiency has not been corrected occurs more than 6 months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if after 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed to find that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be
stayed unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the approved plan, and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has not been corrected.
(5) Any sanction clock started by a finding under paragraph (c) of this section will be permanently stopped and sanctions applied, stayed or deferred will be permanently lifted upon a final EPA finding that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. For a sanctions clock and applied sanctions based on a finding under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3)(i) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur by letter from the Administrator to the State governor. For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a finding under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur through a final notice in the
Federal Register
fully approving the revised SIP. For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a finding under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur through a final notice in the
Federal Register
finding that the State is implementing the approved SIP.
(6) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, nothing in this section will prohibit the Administrator from determining through notice-and-comment rulemaking that in specific circumstances the highway sanction, rather than the offset sanction, shall apply 18 months after the Administrator makes one of the findings under paragraph (c) of this section, and that the offset sanction, rather than the highway sanction, shall apply 6 months from the date the highway sanction applies.
(e)

(i) As further set forth in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii)-(e)(1)(vi) of this section, the State shall apply the emissions offset requirement in the timeframe prescribed under paragraph (d) of this section on those affected areas subject under paragraph (d) of this section to the offset sanction. The State shall apply the emission offset requirements in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 7503 and 7509(b)(2), at a ratio of at least two units of emission reductions for each unit of increased emissions of the pollutant(s) and its (their) precursors for which the finding(s) under paragraph (c) of this section is (are) made. If the deficiency prompting the finding under paragraph (c) of this section is not specific to one or more particular pollutants and their precursors, the 2-to-1 ratio shall apply to all pollutants (and their precursors) for which an affected area within the State listed in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section is required to meet the offset requirements of 42 U.S.C. 7503.
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, when a finding is made with respect to a requirement for the criteria pollutant ozone or when the finding is not pollutant-specific, the State shall not apply the emissions offset requirements at a ratio of at least 2-to-1 for emission reductions to increased emissions for nitrogen oxides where, under 42 U.S.C. 7511a(f), the Administrator has approved an NO
X
exemption for the affected area from the Act's new source review requirements under 42 U.S.C. 7501-7515 for NO
X
or where the affected area is not otherwise subject to the Act's new source review requirements for emission offsets under 42 U.S.C. 7501-7515 for NO
X
.
(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, when a finding under paragraph (c) of this section is made with respect to PM-10, or the finding is not pollutant-specific, the State shall not apply the emissions offset requirements, at a ratio of at least 2-to-1 for emission reductions to increased emissions to PM-10 precursors if the Administrator has determined
under 42 U.S.C. 7513a(e) that major stationary sources of PM-10 precursors do not contribute significantly to PM-10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the affected area.
(iv) For purposes of applying the emissions offset requirement set forth in 42 U.S.C. 7503, at the 2-to-1 ratio required under this section, the State shall comply with the provisions of a State-adopted new source review (NSR) program that EPA has approved under 42 U.S.C. 7410(k)(3) as meeting the nonattainment area NSR requirements of 42 U.S.C. 7501-7515, as amended by the 1990 Amendments, or, if no plan has been so approved, the State shall comply directly with the nonattainment area NSR requirements specified in 42 U.S.C. 7501-7515, as amended by the 1990 Amendments, or cease issuing permits to construct and operate major new or modified sources as defined in those requirements. For purposes of applying the offset requirement under 42 U.S.C. 7503 where EPA has not fully approved a State's NSR program as meeting the requirements of part D, the specifications of those provisions shall supersede any State requirement that is less stringent or inconsistent.
(v) For purposes of applying the emissions offset requirement set forth in 42 U.S.C. 7503, any permit required pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 7503 and issued on or after the date the offset sanction applies under paragraph (d) of this section shall be subject to the enhanced 2-to-1 ratio under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.
(2)
Highway funding sanction.
The highway sanction shall apply, as provided in 42 U.S.C. 7509(b)(1), in the timeframe prescribed under paragraph (d) of this section on those affected areas subject under paragraph (d) of this section to the highway sanction, but shall apply only to those portions of affected areas that are designated nonattainment under 40 CFR part 81.

§ 52.40
What are the requirements of the Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) relating to ozone season emissions of nitrogen oxides from sources not subject to the CSAPR ozone season trading program?
(a)
Purpose.
This section establishes Federal Implementation Plan requirements for new and existing units in the industries specified in paragraph (b) of this section to eliminate significant contribution to nonattainment, or interference with maintenance, of the 2015 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards in other states pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).
(b)
Definitions.
The terms used in this section and §§ 52.41 through § 52.46 are defined as follows:
Calendar year
means the period between January 1 and December 31, inclusive, for a given year.
Existing affected unit
means any affected unit for which construction commenced before August 4, 2023.
New affected unit
means any affected unit for which construction commenced on or after August 4, 2023.
Operator
means any person who operates, controls, or supervises an affected unit and shall include, but not be limited to, any holding company, utility system, or plant manager of such affected unit.
Owner
means any holder of any portion of the legal or equitable title in an affected unit.
Potential to emit
means the maximum capacity of a unit to emit a pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of the unit to emit a pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, shall be treated as part of its design only if the limitation or the effect it would have on emissions is federally enforceable. Secondary emissions do not count in determining the potential to emit of a unit.
Rolling average
means the weighted average of all data, meeting quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) requirements in this part or otherwise normalized, collected during the applicable averaging period. The period of a rolling average stipulates the frequency of data averaging and reporting. To demonstrate compliance with an operating parameter a 30-day rolling average period requires calculation of a new average value each operating day and shall include the average of all the hourly averages of the specific operating parameter. For demonstration of compliance with an emissions limit based on pollutant concentration, a 30-day rolling average is comprised of the average of all the hourly average concentrations over the previous 30 operating days. For demonstration of compliance with an emissions limit based on lbs-pollutant per production unit, the 30-day rolling average is calculated by summing the hourly mass emissions over the previous 30 operating days, then dividing that sum by the total production during the same period.
(c)
General requirements.
(1) The NO
X
emissions limitations or emissions control requirements and associated compliance requirements for the following listed source categories not subject to the CSAPR ozone season trading program constitute the Federal Implementation Plan provisions that relate to emissions of NO
X
during the ozone season (defined as May 1 through September 30 of a calendar year): §§ 52.41 for engines in the Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas Industry, 52.42 for kilns in the Cement and Concrete Product Manufacturing Industry, 52.43 for reheat furnaces in the Iron and Steel Mills and Ferroalloy Manufacturing Industry, 52.44 for furnaces in the Glass and Glass Product Manufacturing Industry, 52.45 for boilers in the Iron and Steel Mills and Ferroalloy Manufacturing, Metal Ore Mining, Basic Chemical Manufacturing, Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing, and Pulp, Paper, and Paperboard Mills industries, and 52.46 for Municipal Waste Combustors.
(2) The provisions of this section or § 52.41, § 52.42, § 52.43, § 52.44, § 52.45, or § 52.46 apply to affected units located in each of the following States, including Indian country located within the borders of such States, beginning in the 2026 ozone season and in each subsequent ozone season: Arkansas, California, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.
(3) The testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this section or § 52.41, § 52.42, § 52.43, § 52.44, § 52.45, or § 52.46 only apply during the ozone season, except as otherwise specified in these sections. Additionally, if an owner or operator of an affected unit chooses to conduct a performance or compliance test outside of the ozone season, all recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements associated with that test shall apply, without regard to whether they occur during the ozone season.
(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the effectiveness of paragraphs (a) and (b), (c)(1) through (3), and (d) through (g) of this section and §§ 52.41 through 52.46 is stayed for sources located in Arkansas, California, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia, including Indian country located within the borders of such States.
(d)
Requests for extension of compliance.
(1) The owner or operator of an existing affected unit under § 52.41, § 52.42, § 52.43, § 52.44, § 52.45, or § 52.46 that cannot comply with the applicable requirements in those sections by May 1, 2026, due to circumstances entirely beyond the owner or operator's control, may request an initial compliance extension to a date certain no later than May 1, 2027. The extension request must contain a demonstration of necessity consistent with the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(2) If, after the EPA has granted a request for an initial compliance extension, the source remains unable to comply with the applicable requirements in § 52.41, § 52.42, § 52.43, § 52.44, § 52.45, or § 52.46 by the extended compliance date due to circumstances entirely beyond the owner or operator's control, the owner or operator may apply for a second compliance extension to a date certain no later than May 1, 2029. The extension request must contain an updated demonstration of necessity consistent with the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(3) Each request for a compliance extension shall demonstrate that the owner or operator has taken all steps possible to install the controls necessary for compliance with the applicable requirements in § 52.41, § 52.42, § 52.43, § 52.44, § 52.45, or § 52.46 by the applicable compliance date and shall:
(i) Identify each affected unit for which the owner or operator is seeking the compliance extension;
(ii) Identify and describe the controls to be installed at each affected unit to comply with the applicable requirements in § 52.41, § 52.42, § 52.43, § 52.44, § 52.45, or § 52.46;
(iii) Identify the circumstances entirely beyond the owner or operator's control that necessitate additional time to install the identified controls;
(iv) Identify the date(s) by which on-site construction, installation of control equipment, and/or process changes will be initiated;
(v) Identify the owner or operator's proposed compliance date. A request for an initial compliance extension under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must specify a proposed compliance date no later than May 1, 2027, and state whether the owner or operator anticipates a need to request a second compliance extension. A request for a second compliance extension under paragraph (d)(2) of this section must specify a proposed compliance date no later than May 1, 2029, and identify additional actions taken by the owner or operator to ensure that the affected unit(s) will be in compliance with the applicable requirements in this section by that proposed compliance date;
(vi) Include all information obtained from control technology vendors demonstrating that the identified controls cannot be installed by the applicable compliance date;
(vii) Include any and all contract(s) entered into for the installation of the identified controls or an explanation as to why no contract is necessary or obtainable; and
(viii) Include any permit(s) obtained for the installation of the identified controls or, where a required permit
has not yet been issued, a copy of the permit application submitted to the permitting authority and a statement from the permitting authority identifying its anticipated timeframe for issuance of such permit(s).
(4) Each request for a compliance extension shall be submitted via the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) or analogous electronic submission system provided by the EPA no later than 180 days prior to the applicable compliance date. Until an extension has been granted by the Administrator under this section, the owner or operator of an affected unit shall comply with all applicable requirements of this section and shall remain subject to the May 1, 2026 compliance date or the initial extended compliance date, as applicable. A denial will be effective as of the date of denial.
(5) The owner or operator of an affected unit who has requested a compliance extension under this paragraph (d)(5) and is required to have a title V permit shall apply to have the relevant title V permit revised to incorporate the conditions of the extension of compliance. The conditions of a compliance extension granted under this paragraph (d)(5) will be incorporated into the affected unit's title V permit according to the provisions of an EPA-approved state operating permit program or the Federal title V regulations in 40 CFR part 71, whichever apply.
(6) Based on the information provided in any request made under paragraph (d) of this section or other information, the Administrator may grant an extension of time to comply with applicable requirements in § 52.41, § 52.42, § 52.43, § 52.44, § 52.45, or § 52.46 consistent with the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section. The decision to grant an extension will be provided by notification via the CEDRI or analogous electronic submission system provided by the EPA and publicly available, and will identify each affected unit covered by the extension; specify the termination date of the extension; and specify any additional conditions that the Administrator deems necessary to ensure timely installation of the necessary controls (
e.g.,
the date(s) by which on-site construction, installation of control equipment, and/or process changes will be initiated).
(7) The Administrator will provide notification via the CEDRI or analogous electronic submission system provided by the EPA to the owner or operator of an affected unit who has requested a compliance extension under this paragraph (d)(7) whether the submitted request is complete, that is, whether the request contains sufficient information to make a determination, within 60 calendar days after receipt of the original request and within 60 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information.
(8) The Administrator will provide notification via the CEDRI or analogous electronic submission system provided by the EPA, which shall be publicly available, to the owner or operator of a decision to grant or intention to deny a request for a compliance extension within 60 calendar days after providing written notification pursuant to paragraph (d)(7) of this section that the submitted request is complete.
(9) Before denying any request for an extension of compliance, the Administrator will provide notification via the CEDRI or analogous electronic submission system provided by the EPA to the owner or operator in writing of the Administrator's intention to issue the denial, together with:
(i) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended denial is based; and
(ii) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present via the CEDRI or analogous electronic submission system provided by the EPA, within 15 calendar days after he/she is notified of the intended denial, additional information or arguments to the Administrator before further action on the request.
(10) The Administrator's final decision to deny any request for an extension will be provided via the CEDRI or analogous electronic submission system provided by the EPA and publicly available, and will set forth the specific grounds on which the denial is based. The final decision will be made within 60 calendar days after presentation of additional information or argument (if the request is complete), or
within 60 calendar days after the deadline for the submission of additional information or argument under paragraph (d)(9)(ii) of this section, if no such submission is made.
(11) The granting of an extension under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under section 114 of the Clean Air Act (CAA or the Act).
(e)
Requests for case-by-case emissions limits.
(1) The owner or operator of an existing affected unit under § 52.41, § 52.42, § 52.43, § 52.44, § 52.45, or § 52.46 that cannot comply with the applicable requirements in those sections due to technical impossibility or extreme economic hardship may submit to the Administrator, by August 5, 2024, a request for approval of a case-by-case emissions limit. The request shall contain information sufficient for the Administrator to confirm that the affected unit is unable to comply with the applicable emissions limit, due to technical impossibility or extreme economic hardship, and to establish an appropriate alternative case-by-case emissions limit for the affected unit. Until a case-by-case emissions limit has been approved by the Administrator under this section, the owner or operator shall remain subject to all applicable requirements in § 52.41, § 52.42, § 52.43, § 52.44, § 52.45, or § 52.46. A denial will be effective as of the date of denial.
(2) Each request for a case-by-case emissions limit shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(i) A demonstration that the affected unit cannot achieve the applicable emissions limit with available control technology due to technical impossibility or extreme economic hardship.
(A) A demonstration of technical impossibility shall include:
(
1
) Uncontrolled NO
X
emissions for the affected unit established with a CEMS, or stack tests obtained during steady state operation in accordance with the applicable reference test methods of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-4, any alternative test method approved by the EPA as of June 5, 2023, under 40 CFR 59.104(f), 60.8(b)(3), 61.13(h)(1)(ii), 63.7(e)(2)(ii)(2), or 65.158(a)(2) and available at the EPA's website (

(8) The Administrator's final decision to deny any request for a case-by-case emissions limit will be provided by notification via the CEDRI or analogous electronic submission system provided by the EPAand publicly available, and will set forth the specific grounds on which the denial is based. The final decision will be made within 60 calendar days after presentation of additional information or argument (if the request is complete), or within 60 calendar days after the deadline for the submission of additional information or argument under paragraph (e)(7)(ii) of this section, if no such submission is made.
(9) The approval of a case-by-case emissions limit under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under section 114 of the Act.
(f)
Recordkeeping requirements.
(1) The owner or operator of an affected unit subject to the provisions of this section or § 52.41, § 52.42, § 52.43, § 52.44, § 52.45, or § 52.46 shall maintain files of all information (including all reports and notifications) required by these sections recorded in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious inspection and review. The files shall be retained for at least 5 years following the date of each occurrence, measurement, maintenance, corrective action, report, or record. At minimum, the most recent 2 years of data shall be retained on site. The remaining 3 years of data may be retained off site. Such files may be maintained on microfilm, on a computer, on computer floppy disks, on magnetic tape disks, or on microfiche.
(2) Any records required to be maintained by § 52.41, § 52.42, § 52.43, § 52.44, § 52.45, or § 52.46 that are submitted
electronically via the EPA's Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) may be maintained in electronic format. This ability to maintain electronic copies does not affect the requirement for facilities to make records, data, and reports available upon request to the EPA as part of an on-site compliance evaluation.
(g)
CEDRI reporting requirements.
(1) You shall submit the results of the performance test following the procedures specified in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section:
(i) Data collected using test methods supported by the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) as listed on the EPA's ERT website (
https://www.epa.gov/electronic-reporting-air-emissions/electronic-reporting-tool-ert
) at the time of the test. Submit the results of the performance test to the EPA via the CEDRI or analogous electronic reporting approach provided by the EPA to report data required by § 52.41, § 52.42, § 52.43, § 52.44, § 52.45, or § 52.46, which can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (
https://cdx.epa.gov/
). The data must be submitted in a file format generated using the EPA's ERT. Alternatively, you may submit an electronic file consistent with the extensible markup language (XML) schema listed on the EPA's ERT website.
(ii) Data collected using test methods that are not supported by the EPA's ERT as listed on the EPA's ERT website at the time of the test. The results of the performance test must be included as an attachment in the ERT or an alternate electronic file consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT website. Submit the ERT generated package or alternative file to the EPA via CEDRI.
(iii)(A) The EPA will make all the information submitted through CEDRI available to the public without further notice to you. Do not use CEDRI to submit information you claim as confidential business information (CBI). Although we do not expect persons to assert a claim of CBI, if you wish to assert a CBI claim for some of the information submitted under paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section, you should submit a complete file, including information claimed to be CBI, to the EPA.
(B) The file must be generated using the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT website.
(C) Clearly mark the part or all of the information that you claim to be CBI. Information not marked as CBI may be authorized for public release without prior notice. Information marked as CBI will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2.
(D) The preferred method to receive CBI is for it to be transmitted electronically using email attachments, File Transfer Protocol, or other online file sharing services. Electronic submissions must be transmitted directly to the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) CBI Office at the email address
oaqpscbi@epa.gov
, and as described in this paragraph (g), should include clear CBI markings and be flagged to the attention of Lead of 2015 Ozone Transport FIP. If assistance is needed with submitting large electronic files that exceed the file size limit for email attachments, and if you do not have your own file sharing service, please email
oaqpscbi@epa.gov
to request a file transfer link.
(E) If you cannot transmit the file electronically, you may send CBI information through the postal service to the following address: OAQPS Document Control Officer (C404-02), OAQPS, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, Attention Lead of 2015 Ozone Transport FIP. The mailed CBI material should be double wrapped and clearly marked. Any CBI markings should not show through the outer envelope.
(F) All CBI claims must be asserted at the time of submission. Anything submitted using CEDRI cannot later be claimed CBI. Furthermore, under CAA section 114(c), emissions data is not entitled to confidential treatment, and the EPA is required to make emissions data available to the public. Thus, emissions data will not be protected as CBI and will be made publicly available.
(G) You must submit the same file submitted to the CBI office with the CBI omitted to the EPA via the EPA's
CDX as described in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section.
(2) Annual reports must be submitted via CEDRI or analogous electronic reporting approach provided by the EPA to report data required by § 52.41, § 52.42, § 52.43, § 52.44, § 52.45, or § 52.46.
(3) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with that reporting requirement. To assert a claim of EPA system outage, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) through (vii) of this section.
(i) You must have been or will be precluded from accessing CEDRI and submitting a required report within the time prescribed due to an outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems.
(ii) The outage must have occurred within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date that the submission is due.
(iii) The outage may be planned or unplanned.
(iv) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.
(v) You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying:
(A) The date(s) and time(s) when CDX or CEDRI was accessed and the system was unavailable;
(B) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to EPA system outage;
(C) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(D) The date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.
(vi) The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(vii) In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved.
(4) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX, you may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely comply with that reporting requirement. To assert a claim of force majeure, you must meet the requirements outlined in paragraphs (g)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.
(i) You may submit a claim if a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date the submission is due. For the purposes of this section, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected unit, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected unit that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (
e.g.,
hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected unit (
e.g.,
large scale power outage).
(ii) You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or has caused a delay in reporting.
(iii) You must provide to the Administrator:
(A) A written description of the force majeure event;
(B) A rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event;
(C) A description of measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and
(D) The date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported.
(iv) The decision to accept the claim of force majeure and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(v) In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the force majeure event occurs.

§ 52.41
What are the requirements of the Federal Implementation Plans (FIPs) relating to ozone season emissions of nitrogen oxides from the Pipeline Transportation of Natural Gas Industry?
(a)
Definitions.
All terms not defined in this paragraph (a) shall have the meaning given to them in the Act and in subpart A of 40 CFR part 60.
Affected unit
means an engine meeting the applicability criteria of this section.
Cap
means the total amount of NO
X
emissions, in tons per day on a 30-day rolling average basis, that is collectively allowed from all of the affected units covered by a Facility-Wide Averaging Plan and is calculated as the sum each affected unit's NO
X
emissions at the emissions limit applicable to such unit under paragraph (c) of this section, converted to tons per day in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
Emergency engine
means any stationary reciprocating internal combustion engine (RICE) that meets all of the criteria in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this definition. All emergency stationary RICE must comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in order to be considered emergency engines. If the engine does not comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (b)(1), it is not considered an emergency engine under this section.
(i) The stationary engine is operated to provide electrical power or mechanical work during an emergency situation. Examples include stationary RICE used to produce power for critical networks or equipment (including power supplied to portions of a facility) when electric power from the local utility (or the normal power source, if the facility runs on its own power production) is interrupted, or stationary RICE used to pump water in the case of fire or flood, etc.
(ii) The stationary RICE is operated under limited circumstances for purposes other than those identified in paragraph (i) of this definition, as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
Facility
means all of the pollutant-emitting activities which belong to the same industrial grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control).

(A) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a permanent weigh scale system to record weight rates of the amount of clinker produced in tons of mass per hour. The system of measuring hourly clinker production must be maintained within ±5 percent accuracy; or
(B) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a permanent weigh scale system to measure and record weight rates of the amount of feed to the kiln in tons of mass per hour. The system of measuring feed must be maintained within ±5 percent accuracy. Calculate your hourly clinker production rate using a kiln specific feed-to-clinker ratio based on reconciled clinker production rates determined for accounting purposes and recorded feed rates. This ratio should be updated monthly. Note that if this ratio changes at clinker reconciliation, you must use the new ratio going forward, but you do not have to retroactively change clinker production rates previously estimated.

(B) [Reserved]
(4) If you are the owner or operator of an affected unit, you shall calculate municipal waste combustor unit capacity using the following procedures:
(i) For municipal waste combustor units capable of combusting municipal solid waste continuously for a 24-hour period, municipal waste combustor unit capacity shall be calculated based on 24 hours of operation at the maximum charging rate. The maximum charging rate shall be determined as specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(i)(A) and (B) of this section as applicable.
(A) For combustors that are designed based on heat capacity, the maximum charging rate shall be calculated based on the maximum design heat input capacity of the unit and a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram for combustors firing refuse-derived fuel and a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram for combustors firing municipal solid waste that is not refuse-derived fuel.
(B) For combustors that are not designed based on heat capacity, the maximum charging rate shall be the maximum design charging rate.
(ii) For batch feed municipal waste combustor units, municipal waste combustor unit capacity shall be calculated as the maximum design amount of municipal solid waste that can be charged per batch multiplied by the maximum number of batches that could be processed in a 24-hour period. The maximum number of batches that could be processed in a 24-hour period is calculated as 24 hours divided by the design number of hours required to process one batch of municipal solid waste, and may include fractional batches (
e.g.,
if one batch requires 16 hours, then 24/16, or 1.5 batches, could be combusted in a 24-hour period). For batch combustors that are designed based on heat capacity, the design heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram for combustors firing refuse-derived fuel and a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram for combustors firing municipal solid waste that is not refuse-derived fuel shall be used in calculating the municipal waste combustor unit capacity in megagrams per day of municipal solid waste.
(f)
Recordkeeping requirements.
If you are the owner or operator of an affected unit, you shall maintain records of the following information, as applicable, for each affected unit consistent with the requirements of § 52.40(g).
(1) The calendar date of each record.
(2) The emissions concentrations and parameters measured using continuous monitoring systems.
(i) All 1-hour average NO
X
emissions concentrations.
(ii) The average concentrations and percent reductions, as applicable, including all 24-hour daily arithmetic average NO
X
emissions concentrations.
(3) Identification of the calendar dates and times (hours) for which valid hourly NO
X
emissions, including reasons for not obtaining the data and a description of corrective actions taken.
(4) Identification of each occurrence that NO
X
emissions data, or operational data (
i.e.,
unit load) have been excluded from the calculation of average emissions concentrations or parameters, and the reasons for excluding the data.
(5) The results of daily drift tests and quarterly accuracy determinations for CEMS, as required under 40 CFR part 60, appendix F, Procedure 1.
(6) The following records:
(i) Records showing the names of the municipal waste combustor chief facility operator, shift supervisors, and control room operators who have been provisionally certified by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers or an equivalent State-approved certification program as required by 40 CFR 60.54b(a) including the dates of initial and renewal certifications and documentation of current certification;
(ii) Records showing the names of the municipal waste combustor chief facility operator, shift supervisors, and control room operators who have been fully certified by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers or an equivalent State-approved certification program as required by 40 CFR 60.54b(b) including the dates of initial and renewal certifications and documentation of current certification;
(iii) Records showing the names of the municipal waste combustor chief facility operator, shift supervisors, and control room operators who have completed the EPA municipal waste combustor operator training course or a State-approved equivalent course as required by 40 CFR 60.54b(d) including documentation of training completion; and
(iv) Records of when a certified operator is temporarily off site. Include two main items:
(A) If the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are off site for more than 12 hours, but for 2 weeks or less, and no other certified operator is on site, record the dates that the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor were off site.
(B) When all certified chief facility operators and certified shift supervisors are off site for more than 2 weeks and no other certified operator is on site, keep records of four items:
(
1
) Time of day that all certified persons are off site.
(
2
) The conditions that cause those people to be off site.
(
3
) The corrective actions taken by the owner or operator of the affected unit to ensure a certified chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor is on site as soon as practicable.
(
4
) Copies of the reports submitted every 4 weeks that summarize the actions taken by the owner or operator of the affected unit to ensure that a certified chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor will be on site as soon as practicable.
(7) Records showing the names of persons who have completed a review of the operating manual as required by 40 CFR 60.54b(f) including the date of the initial review and subsequent annual reviews.
(8) Records of steps taken to minimize emissions during startup and shutdown as required by paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
(g)
Reporting requirements.
(1) If you are the owner or operator of an affected unit, you must submit the results of the performance test or performance evaluation of the CEMS following the procedures specified in § 52.40(g) within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test required by this section.
(2) If you are the owner or operator of an affected unit, you shall submit an annual report in PDF format to the EPA by January 30th of each year via CEDRI or analogous electronic reporting approach provided by the EPA to report data required by this section.
Annual reports shall be submitted following the procedures in § 52.40(g). The report shall include all information required by paragraph (e) of this section, including CEMS data to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emissions limits under paragraph (c) of this section.

(b) [Reserved]
[88 FR 9381, Feb. 13, 2023]
§ 52.57
Control strategy: Sulfur oxides.
(a) The requirements of Subpart G of this chapter are not met since the Alabama plan does not provide for attainment and maintenance of the national standards for sulfur oxides in the vicinity of the Widows Creek Power Plant in Jackson County, Alabama. Therefore, Part 5.1, Fuel Combustion, of Chapter 5, Control of Sulfur Compound Emissions, of the rules and regulations of the State of Alabama, as adopted by the Alabama Air Pollution Control Commission on May 29, 1973, and amended on March 25, 1975, which is part of the revised sulfur oxide control strategy, is disapproved as it applies to the Widows Creek Plant. Part 5.1 of the Alabama rules and regulations as adopted on January 18, 1972, remains the implementation plan regulation applicable to that source.
(b) [Reserved]
[41 FR 42674, Sept. 28, 1976, as amended at 51 FR 40676, Nov. 7, 1986]
§ 52.58
Control strategy: Lead.
The lead plan submitted by the State on March 24, 1982, is disapproved because it fails to provide for the attainment of the lead standard throughout Alabama. The lead plan submitted by the State on October 7, 1985, and November 13, 1986, for Jefferson County is conditionally approved on the condition that the State by October 1, 1987, determine what additional control measures may be necessary, if any, to assure attainment and maintenance as expeditiously as practicable but no later than the applicable attainment deadline and submit those measures to EPA for approval, together with an appropriate demonstration of attainment. The provisions in the regulation submitted on October 7, 1985, that give the Jefferson County Health Officer discretion to vary the requirements of the regulation are approved as limits on that discretion, but any variances that may result from those provisions are not approved in advance and hence change the applicable implementation plan only when approved by EPA on a case-by-case basis.

§ 52.72
Approval status.
With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Alaska's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards. The State included in the plan a regulation prohibiting idling of unattended motor vehicles. However, the plan stated that this regulation was included for informational purposes only, and was not to be considered part of the control strategy to implement the national standards for carbon monoxide. Accordingly, this regulation is not considered a part of the applicable plan.

§ 52.125
Control strategy and regulations: Sulfur oxides.
(a)(1) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met since the control strategy does not analyze the impact of smelter fugitive emissions on ambient air quality (except at Hayden, Arizona) in the Central Arizona Intrastate, the Pima Intrastate, and the Southeast Arizona Intrastate (Cochise and Greenlee counties) Regions. Arizona must submit these smelter fugitive emissions control strategies to EPA by August 1, 1984. In addition, the requirements of § 51.281 of this chapter are not met since the plan does not require permanent control of fugitive smelter emissions necessary to attain and maintain the national standards for sulfur oxides. The control strategy for Hayden shows that these controls are required to attain and maintain the national standards, and the fugitive control strategy analyses required above may show that they are required for some or all of the other smelter towns in Arizona. Arizona must submit all fugitive emissions control regulations necessary to attain and maintain the national standards for sulfur oxides to EPA by August 1, 1984. Therefore, the control strategies and regulations for the six smelter areas in the Central Arizona Intrastate, the Pima Intrastate and the Southeast Arizona Intrastate (Cochise and Greenlee counties) Regions are incomplete due to Arizona's failure to address the fugitive emissions problems at copper smelters.
(2) Regulation 7-1-4.1 (copper smelters) of the Arizona Rules and Regulations for Air Pollution Control, as it pertains to existing copper smelters, is disapproved for the Central Arizona Intrastate, Pima Intrastate and Southeast Arizona Intrastate (Cochise and Greenlee counties) Regions.
(b) The requirements of subpart G and § 51.281 of this chapter are not met since the plan does not provide the degree of control necessary to attain and maintain the national standards for sulfur oxides in the Northern Arizona Intrastate Region. Therefore, Regulation 7-1-4.2(C) (fuel burning installations) of the Arizona Rules and Regulations for Air Pollution Control, as it pertains to existing sources, is disapproved in the Northern Arizona Intrastate Region for steam power generating installations having a total rated capacity equal to or greater than 6,500 million B.t.u. per hour.
(c)
Replacement regulation for Regulation 7-1-4.2(C) (Fossil fuel-fired steam generators in the Northern Arizona Intrastate Region).
(1) This paragraph is applicable to the fossil fuel-fired steam generating equipment designated as Units 1, 2, and 3 at the Navajo Power Plant in the Northern Arizona Intrastate Region (§ 81.270 of this chapter).
(2) No owner or operator of the fossil fuel-fired steam generating equipment to which this paragraph is applicable shall discharge or cause the discharge of sulfur oxides into the atmosphere in excess of the amount prescribed by the following equations:
E = 12,245 S or e = 1,540 S
Where:
E = Allowable sulfur oxides emissions (lb./hr.) from all affected units.
e = Allowable sulfur oxides emissions (gm./sec.) from all affected units.
S = Sulfur content, in percent by weight, prior to any pretreatment of the fuel being burned.
(3) For the purposes of this paragraph:
(i) E shall not exceed 21,270 lb./hr. (2,680 gm./sec.).
(ii) If the sum of sulfur oxides emissions from Units 1, 2, and 3 would be less than 3,780 lb./hr.

(iii) The applicability of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section may be determined through a sulfur balance utilizing the analyzed sulfur content of the fuel being burned and the total rate of fuel consumption in all affected units.
(4)(i) No owner or operator of the fossil fuel-fired steam generating equipment subject to this paragraph shall discharge or cause the discharge of sulfur oxides into the atmosphere from any affected unit in excess of the amount prescribed by the following equations, except as provided in paragraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph (c).

(d)-(e) [Reserved]
(f)(1) Paragraphs B through E of regulation 7-1-4.2 (R9-3-402) (Sulfur Emissions: Fuel Burning Installations) of the Arizona Air Pollution Control Regulations are disapproved because they could allow existing oil fired facilities to use dispersion dependent techniques alone as a means of attaining and maintaining the national ambient air quality standards. The regulation does not assure the attainment and maintenance of the national standards in a manner which is consistent with the intent of sections 110(a)(2)(B) and 123(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act.
(2) The approval of paragraphs A and F of regulation 7-1-4.2 as to coal fired facilities does not apply to the Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District-Navajo Generating Station.
(3) Paragraphs B through E of regulation 8-1-4.2 (Sulfur Emissions—Fuel Burning Installations) of the Yuma County Air Pollution Control Regulations are disapproved because they could allow existing facilities to use dispersion dependent techniques alone as a means of attaining and maintaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. This regulation does not assure the attainment and maintenance
of the national standards in a manner which is consistent with the intent of sections 110(a)(2)(B)and 123(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act.
(g) Section 3, Regulation 3 (Sulfur from Primary Copper Smelters) of the Mohave County Health Department Air Pollution Control Regulations and Regulation 7-3-2.1 (Copper Smelters) of the Pinal-Gila Counties Air Quality Control District are disapproved since Section 36-1706 of the Arizona Revised Statutes grants exclusive jurisdiction to the Arizona Department of Health Services and the State Hearing Board over all existing copper smelters.
(1) The requirements of § 51.13 of this chapter are not met since the plan does not demonstrate that the emission limitations applicable to existing fuel burning equipment producing electrical energy will provide for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards in the Pima Intrastate Region (§ 81.269 of this chapter).
(2) Regulation II: Rule 7A—paragraphs 2 through 5, Emission Limitations Fuel Burning Equipment—Sulfur Dioxide, of the Rules and Regulations of the Pima County Air Pollution Control District are disapproved because they could allow existing facilities to use dispersion dependent techniques along as a means of attaining and maintaining the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The regulation does not assure the attainment and maintenance of the national standards in a manner which is consistent with the intent of section 110(a)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act.
(h) Effective March 2, 2022, the EPA has determined that the Hayden and Miami nonattainment areas failed to attain the 2010 1-hour primary sulfur dioxide (SO
2
) national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date of October 4, 2018. This determination triggers the requirements of CAA section 179(d) for the State of Arizona to submit a revision to the Arizona SIP for the Hayden and Miami nonattainment areas to the EPA by January 31, 2023. The SIP revision must, among other elements, provide for attainment of the 1-hour primary SO

amount specified in § 60.62 of this chapter.
(4) Compliance with this paragraph shall be in accordance with the provisions of § 52.134(a).
(5) The test methods and procedures used to determine compliance with this paragraph are set forth below. The methods referenced are contained in the appendix to part 60 of this chapter. Equivalent methods and procedures may be used if approved by the Administrator.
(i) For each sampling repetition, the average concentration of particulate matter shall be determined by using method 5. Traversing during sampling by method 5 shall be according to method 1. The minimum sampling time shall be 2 hours and the minimum sampling volume shall be 60 ft

(iii) All tests shall be conducted while the source is operating at the maximum production or combustion rate at which such source will be operated. During the tests, the source shall burn fuels or combinations of fuels, use raw materials, and maintain process conditions representative of normal operation, and shall operate under such other relevant conditions as the Administrator shall specify.
(c) The requirements of § 51.281 of this chapter are not met since the plan does not contain regulations for Mohave and Yuma Counties in the Mohave-Yuma Intrastate Region or Pinal-Gila Counties in the Central Arizona Intrastate Region which provide enforceable and reproducible test procedures for the determination of compliance with the emission standards. Therefore paragraph C of section 3, regulation 2 (Particulates: Other Sources) of the Mohave County Air Pollution Control Regulations, paragraph B of regulation 8-1-3.6 (Particulates—Process Industries) of the Yuma County Air Pollution Control Regulations, and paragraph C of regulation 7-3-1.4 (Particulate Emissions—Incineration) and paragraph F of regulation 7-3-1.7 (Particulate Emissions—Fuel Burning Equipment) of the Rules and Regulations for Pinal-Gila Counties Air Quality Control District are disapproved.

10
nonattainment area (NAA) to the EPA by November 17, 2023. The SIP revision must, among other elements, provide for attainment of the 24-hour PM
10
NAAQS in the Yuma NAA as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 2027.
(e) Effective August 21, 2023, the EPA has determined that the West Pinal Serious PM
10
nonattainment area failed to attain the 1987 24-hour PM
10
NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of December 31, 2022. This determination triggers the requirements of CAA sections 179(d) and 189(d) for the State of Arizona to submit a revision to the Arizona SIP for West Pinal to the EPA by December 31, 2023. The SIP revision must, among other elements, demonstrate expeditious attainment of the 1987 PM
10
NAAQS within the time period provided under CAA section 179(d) and provide for an annual reduction in the emissions of direct PM
10
or a PM
10
plan precursor pollutant within the area of not less than five percent until attainment.

# Appendix A to § 52.128—Test Methods To Determine Whether A Surface Is Stabilized

# I. Unpaved Roads and Unpaved Parking Lots

# A. Opacity Observations
Conduct opacity observations in accordance with Reference Method 9 (40 CFR Part 60, appendix A) and Methods 203A and 203C of this appendix, with opacity readings taken at five second observation intervals and two consecutive readings per plume beginning with the first reading at zero seconds, in accordance with Method 203C, sections 2.3.2. and 2.4.2 of this appendix. Conduct visible opacity tests only on dry unpaved surfaces (i.e. when the surface is not damp to the touch) and on days when average wind speeds do not exceed 15 miles per hour (mph).

# (i) Method 203A—Visual Determination of Opacity of Emissions From Stationary Sources for Time-Arranged Regulations
Method 203A is virtually identical to EPA's Method 9 (40 CFR Part 60 Appendix A) except for the data-reduction procedures, which provide for averaging times other than 6 minutes. That is, using Method 203A with a 6-minute averaging time would be the same as
following EPA Method 9 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A). Additionally, Method 203A provides procedures for fugitive dust applications. The certification procedures provided in section 3 are virtually identical to Method 9 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A) and are provided here, in full, for clarity and convenience.

# 1. Applicability and Principle
1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of the opacity of emissions from sources of visible emissions for time-averaged regulations. A time-averaged regulation is any regulation that requires averaging visible emission data to determine the opacity of visible emissions over a specific time period.
1.2 Principle. The opacity of emissions from sources of visible emissions is determined visually by an observer qualified according to the procedures of section 3.

# 2. Procedures
An observer qualified in accordance with section 3 of this method shall use the following procedures for visually determining the opacity of emissions.
2.1 Procedures for Emissions from Stationary Sources. These procedures are not applicable to this section.
2.2 Procedures for Fugitive Process Dust Emissions. These procedures are applicable for the determination of the opacity of fugitive emissions by a qualified observer. The qualified field observer should do the following:
2.2.1 Position. Stand at a position at least 5 meters from the fugitive dust source in order to provide a clear view of the emissions with the sun oriented in the 140-degree sector to the back. Consistent as much as possible with maintaining the above requirements, make opacity observations from a position such that the line of vision is approximately perpendicular to the plume and wind direction. As much as possible, if multiple plumes are involved, do not include more than one plume in the line of sight at one time.
2.2.2 Field Records. Record the name of the plant or site, fugitive source location, source type [pile, stack industrial process unit, incinerator, open burning operation activity, material handling (transfer, loading, sorting, etc.)], method of control used, if any, observer's name, certification data and affiliation, and a sketch of the observer's position relative to the fugitive source. Also, record the time, estimated distance to the fugitive source location, approximate wind direction, estimated wind speed, description of the sky condition (presence and color of clouds), observer's position relative to the fugitive source, and color of the plume and type of background on the visible emission observation form when opacity readings are initiated and completed.
2.2.3 Observations. Make opacity observations, to the extent possible, using a contrasting background that is perpendicular to the line of vision. For roads, storage piles, and parking lots, make opacity observations approximately 1 meter above the surface from which the plume is generated. For other fugitive sources, make opacity observations at the point of greatest opacity in that portion of the plume where condensed water vapor is not present. For intermittent sources, the initial observation should begin immediately after a plume has been created above the surface involved. Do not look continuously at the plume but, instead, observe the plume momentarily at 15-second intervals.
2.3 Recording Observations. Record the opacity observations to the nearest 5 percent every 15 seconds on an observational record sheet. Each momentary observation recorded represents the average opacity of emissions for a 15-second period.
2.4 Data Reduction for Time-Averaged Regulations. A set of observations is composed of an appropriate number of consecutive observations determined by the averaging time specified. Divide the recorded observations into sets of appropriate time lengths for the specified averaging time. Sets must consist of consecutive observations; however, observations immediately preceding and following interrupted observations shall be deemed consecutive. Sets need not be consecutive in time and in no case shall two sets overlap, resulting in multiple violations. For each set of observations, calculate the appropriate average opacity.

# 3. Qualification and Testing
3.1 Certification Requirements. To receive certification as a qualified observer, a candidate must be tested and demonstrate the ability to assign opacity readings in 5 percent increments to 25 different black plumes and 25 different white plumes, with an error not to exceed 15 percent opacity on any one reading and an average error not to exceed 7.5 percent opacity in each category. Candidates shall be tested according to the procedures described in paragraph 3.2. Any smoke generator used pursuant to paragraph 3.2 shall be equipped with a smoke meter which meets the requirements of paragraph 3.3. Certification tests that do not meet the requirements of paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 are not valid.
The certification shall be valid for a period of 6 months, and after each 6-month period, the qualification procedures must be repeated by an observer in order to retain certification.
3.2 Certification Procedure. The certification test consists of showing the candidate a complete run of 50 plumes, 25 black plumes
and 25 white plumes, generated by a smoke generator. Plumes shall be presented in random order within each set of 25 black and 25 white plumes. The candidate assigns an opacity value to each plume and records the observation on a suitable form. At the completion of each run of 50 readings, the score of the candidate is determined. If a candidate fails to qualify, the complete run of 50 readings must be repeated in any retest. The smoke test may be administered as part of a smoke school or training program, and may be preceded by training or familiarization runs of the smoke generator during which candidates are shown black and white plumes of known opacity.
3.3 Smoke Generator Specifications. Any smoke generator used for the purpose of paragraph 3.2 shall be equipped with a smoke meter installed to measure opacity across the diameter of the smoke generator stack. The smoke meter output shall display in-stack opacity, based upon a path length equal to the stack exit diameter on a full 0 to 100 percent chart recorder scale. The smoke meter optical design and performance shall meet the specifications shown in Table A. The smoke meter shall be calibrated as prescribed in paragraph 3.3.1 prior to conducting each smoke reading test. At the completion of each test, the zero and span drift, shall be checked, and if the drift exceeds ±1 percent opacity, the condition shall be corrected prior to conducting any subsequent test runs. The smoke meter shall be demonstrated at the time of installation to meet the specifications listed in Table A. This demonstration shall be repeated following any subsequent repair or replacement of the photocell or associated electronic circuitry including the chart recorder or output meter, or every 6 months, whichever occurs first.
3.3.1 Calibration. The smoke meter is calibrated after allowing a minimum of 30 minutes warm-up by alternately producing simulated opacity of 0 percent and 100 percent. When stable response at 0 percent or 100 percent is noted, the smoke meter is adjusted to produce an output of 0 percent or 100 percent, as appropriate. This calibration shall be repeated until stable 0 percent and 100 percent readings are produced without adjustment. Simulated 0 percent and 100 percent opacity values may be produced by alternately switching the power to the light source on and off while the smoke generator is not producing smoke.
3.3.2 Smoke Meter Evaluation. The smoke meter design and performance are to be evaluated as follows:
3.3.2.1 Light Source. Verify from manufacturer's data and from voltage measurements made at the lamp, as installed, that the lamp is operated within ±5 percent of the nominal rated voltage.
3.3.2.2 Spectral Response of Photocell. Verify from manufacturer's data that the photocell has a photopic response; i.e., the spectral sensitivity of the cell shall closely approximate the standard spectral-luminosity curve for photopic vision which is referenced in (b) of Table A.
3.3.2.3 Angle of View. Check construction geometry to ensure that the total angle of view of the smoke plume, as seen by the photocell, does not exceed 15 degrees. Calculate the total angle of view as follows:
φ
v
= 2 tan
−1
d/2L
Where:
φ
v
= total angle of view;
d = the photocell diameter + the diameter of the limiting aperture; and
L = distance from the photocell to the limiting aperture.
The limiting aperture is the point in the path between the photocell and the smoke plume where the angle of view is most restricted. In smoke generator smoke meters, this is normally an orifice plate.
3.3.2.4 Angle of Projection. Check construction geometry to ensure that the total angle of projection of the lamp on the smoke plume does not exceed 15 degrees. Calculate the total angle of projection as follows:
φ
p
= 2 tan
−1
d/2L
Where:
φ
p
= total angle of projection;
d = the sum of the length of the lamp filament + the diameter of the limiting aperture; and
L = the distance from the lamp to the limiting aperture.
3.3.2.5 Calibration Error. Using neutral-density filters of known opacity, check the error between the actual response and the theoretical linear response of the smoke meter. This check is accomplished by first calibrating the smoke meter according to 3.3.1 and then inserting a series of three neutral-density filters of nominal opacity of 20, 50, and 75 percent in the smoke meter path length. Use filters calibrated within ±2 percent. Care should be taken when inserting the filters to prevent stray light from affecting the meter. Make a total of five nonconsecutive readings for each filter. The maximum opacity error on any one reading shall be ±3 percent.
3.3.2.6 Zero and Span Drift. Determine the zero and span drift by calibrating and operating the smoke generator in a normal manner over a 1-hour period. The drift is measured by checking the zero and span at the end of this period.
3.3.2.7 Response Time. Determine the response time by producing the series of five simulated 0 percent and 100 percent opacity values and observing the time required to reach stable response. Opacity values of 0
percent and 100 percent may be simulated by alternately switching the power to the light source off and on while the smoke generator is not operating.

# (ii) Method 203C—Visual Determination of Opacity of Emissions From Stationary Sources for Instantaneous Limitation Regulations
Method 203C is virtually identical to EPA's Method 9 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A), except for the data-reduction procedures which have been modified for application to instantaneous limitation regulations. Additionally, Method 203C provides procedures for fugitive dust applications which were unavailable when Method 9 was promulgated. The certification procedures in section 3 are identical to Method 9. These certification procedures are provided in Method 203A as well, and, therefore, have not been repeated in this method.

# 1. Applicability and Principle
1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of the opacity of emissions from sources of visible emissions for instantaneous limitations. An instantaneous limitation regulation is an opacity limit which is never to be exceeded.
1.2 Principle. The opacity of emissions from sources of visible emissions is determined visually by a qualified observer.

# 2. Procedures
The observer qualified in accordance with section 3 of this method shall use the following procedures for visually determining the opacity of emissions.
2.1 Procedures for Emissions From Stationary Sources. Same as 2.1, Method 203A.
2.1.1 Position. Same as 2.1.1, Method 203A.
2.1.2 Field Records. Same as 2.1.2, Method 203A.
2.1.3 Observations. Make opacity observations at the point of greatest opacity in that portion of the plume where condensed water vapor is not present.
Do not look continuously at the plume. Instead, observe the plume momentarily at the interval specified in the subject regulation. Unless otherwise specified, a 15-second observation interval is assumed.
2.1.3.1 Attached Steam Plumes. Same as 2.1.3.1, Method 203A.
2.1.3.2 Detached Steam Plumes. Same as 2.1.3.2, Method 203A.
2.2 Procedures for Fugitive Process Dust Emissions.
2.2.1 Position. Same as section 2.2.1, Method 203A.
2.2.2 Field Records. Same as section 2.2.2, Method 203A.
2.2.3 Observations.
2.2.3.1 Observations for a 15-second Observation Interval Regulations. Same as section 2.2.3, Method 203A.
2.2.3.2 Observations for a 5-second Observation Interval Regulations. Same as section 2.2.3, Method 203A, except, observe the plume momentarily at 5-second intervals.
2.3 Recording Observations. Record opacity observations to the nearest 5 percent at the prescribed interval on an observational record sheet. Each momentary observation recorded represents the average of emissions for the prescribed period. If a 5-second observation period is not specified in the applicable regulation, a 15-second interval is assumed. The overall time for which recordings are made shall be of a length appropriate to the regulation for which opacity is being measured.
2.3.1 Recording Observations for 15-second Observation Interval Regulations. Record opacity observations to the nearest 5 percent at 15-second intervals on an observational record sheet. Each momentary observation recorded represents the average of emissions for a 15-second period.
2.3.2 Recording Observations for 5-second Observation Interval Regulations. Record opacity observations to the nearest 5 percent at 5-second intervals on an observational record sheet. Each momentary observation
recorded represents the average of emissions for 5-second period.
2.4 Data Reduction for Instantaneous Limitation Regulations. For an instantaneous limitation regulation, a 1-minute averaging time will be used. Divide the observations recorded on the record sheet into sets of consecutive observations. A set is composed of the consecutive observations made in 1 minute. Sets need not be consecutive in time, and in no case shall two sets overlap. Reduce opacity observations by dividing the sum of all observations recorded in a set by the number of observations recorded in each set.
2.4.1 Data Reduction for 15-second Observation Intervals. Reduce opacity observations by averaging four consecutive observations recorded at 15-second intervals. Divide the observations recorded on the record sheet into sets of four consecutive observations. For each set of four observations, calculate the average by summing the opacity of the four observations and dividing this sum by four.
2.4.2 Data Reduction for 5-second Observation Intervals. Reduce opacity observations by averaging 12 consecutive observations recorded at 5-second intervals. Divide the observations recorded on the record sheet into sets of 12 consecutive observations. For each set of 12 observations, calculate the average by summing the opacity of the 12 observations and dividing this sum by 12.

# B. Silt Content
Conduct the following test method to determine the silt loading and silt content of unpaved road and unpaved parking lot surfaces.
(i) Collect a sample of loose surface material from an area 30 cm by 30 cm (1 foot by 1 foot) in size to a depth of approximately 1 cm or until a hard subsurface is reached, whichever occurs first. Use a brush and dustpan or other similar device. Collect the sample from a routinely-traveled portion of the surface which receives a preponderance of vehicle traffic, i.e. as commonly evidenced by tire tracks. Conduct sweeping slowly so that fine surface material is not released into the air. Only collect samples from surfaces that are not wet or damp due to precipitation or dew.
(ii) Obtain a shallow, lightweight container and a scale with readings in half ounce increments or less. Place the scale on a level surface and zero it with the weight of the empty container. Transfer the entire sample collected to the container, minimizing escape of particles into the air. Weigh the sample and record its weight.
(iii) Obtain and stack a set of sieves with the following openings: 4 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.25 mm. Place the sieves in order according to size openings beginning with the largest size opening at the top. Place a collector pan underneath the bottom (0.25 mm) sieve. Pour the entire sample into the top sieve, minimizing escape of particles into the air by positioning the sieve/collector pan unit in an enclosed or wind barricaded area. Cover the sieve/collector pan unit with a lid. Shake the covered sieve/collector pan unit vigorously for a period of at least one (1) minute in both the horizontal and vertical planes. Remove the lid from the sieve/collector pan unit and disassemble each sieve separately beginning with the largest sieve. As each sieve is removed, examine it for a complete separation of material in order to ensure that all material has been sifted to the finest sieve through which it can pass. If not, reassemble and cover the sieve/collector pan unit and shake it for period of at least one (1) minute. After disassembling the sieve/collector pan unit, transfer the material which is captured in the collector pan into the lightweight container originally used to collect and weigh the sample. Minimize escape of particles into the air when transferring the material into the container. Weigh the container with the material from the collector pan and record its weight. Multiply the resulting weight by 0.38 if the source is an unpaved road or by 0.55 if the source is an unpaved parking lot to estimate silt loading. Divide by the total sample weight and multiply by 100 to arrive at the percent silt content.
(iv) As an alternative to conducting the procedure described above in section I.B.(ii) and section I.B.(iii) of this appendix, the sample (collected according to section I.B.(i) of this appendix) may be taken to an independent testing laboratory or engineering facility for silt loading (
e.g.
net weight
200 mesh) and silt content analysis according to the following test method from “Procedures For Laboratory Analysis Of Surface/Bulk Dust Loading Samples”, (Fifth Edition, Volume I, Appendix C.2.3 “Silt Analysis”, 1995), AP-42, Office of Air Quality Planning
Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.
1. Objective—Several open dust emission factors have been found to be correlated with the silt content(
200 mesh) of the material being disturbed. The basic procedure for silt content determination is mechanical, dry sieving. For sources other than paved roads, the same sample which was oven-dried to determine moisture content is then mechanically sieved.
2.1 Procedure—Select the appropriate 20-cm (8-in.) diameter, 5-cm (2-in.) deep sieve sizes.
Recommended U. S. Standard Series sizes are
3/8
in., No. 4, No. 40, No. 100, No. 140, No. 200, and a pan. Comparable Tyler Series sizes can also be used. The No. 20 and the No. 200 are mandatory. The others can be varied if the recommended sieves are not available, or if buildup on 1 particulate sieve during sieving indicates that an intermediate sieve should be inserted.
2.2 Obtain a mechanical sieving device, such as a vibratory shaker or a Roto-Tap
δ

without the tapping function.

CFR part 60, App. A, Meth. 5, 2.1.2, footnote 2.
2.3 Clean the sieves with compressed air and/or a soft brush. Any material lodged in the sieve openings or adhering to the sides of the sieve should be removed, without handling the screen roughly, if possible.
2.4 Obtain a scale (capacity of at least 1600 grams [g] or 3.5 lb) and record make, capacity, smallest division, date of last calibration, and accuracy. (See Figure A)
2.5 Weigh the sieves and pan to determine tare weights. Check the zero before every weighing. Record the weights.
2.6 After nesting the sieves in decreasing order of size, and with pan at the bottom, dump dried laboratory sample (preferably immediately after moisture analysis) into the top sieve. The sample should weigh between ¢ 400 and 1600 g (¢ 0.9 and 3.5 lb). This amount will vary for finely textured materials, and 100 to 300 g may be sufficient when 90% of the sample passes a No. 8 (2.36 mm) sieve. Brush any fine material adhering to the sides of the container into the top sieve and cover the top sieve with a special lid normally purchased with the pan.
2.7 Place nested sieves into the mechanical sieving device and sieve for 10 minutes (min). Remove pan containing minus No. 200 and weigh. Repeat the sieving at 10-min intervals until the difference between 2 successive pan sample weighings (with the pan tare weight subtracted) is less than 3.0%. Do not sieve longer than 40 min.
2.8 Weigh each sieve and its contents and record the weight. Check the zero before every weighing.
2.9 Collect the laboratory sample. Place the sample in a separate container if further analysis is expected.
2.10 Calculate the percent of mass less than the 200 mesh screen (75 micrometers [µm]). This is the silt content.

(v) The silt loading and percent silt content for any given unpaved road surface or unpaved parking lot surface shall be based on the average of at least three (3) samples that are representative of routinely-traveled portions of the road or parking lot surface. In order to simplify the sieve test procedures in section I.B.(ii) and section I.B.(iii) of this appendix, the three samples may be combined as long as all material is sifted to the finest sieve through which it can pass, each sample weighs within 1 ounce of the other two samples, and the combined weight of the samples and unit area from which they were collected is calculated and recorded accurately.

# II. Vacant Lots
The following test methods shall be used for determining whether a vacant lot, or portion thereof, has a stabilized surface.
Should a disturbed vacant lot contain more than one type of disturbance, soil, vegetation or other characteristics which are visibly distinguishable, test each representative surface for stability separately in random areas according to the test methods in section II. of this appendix and include or eliminate it from the total size assessment of disturbed surface area(s) depending upon test method results. A vacant lot surface shall be considered stabilized if any of the test methods in section II. of this appendix indicate that the surface is stabilized such that the conditions defined in paragraph (b)(16)(ii) of this section are met:

# 1. Visible Crust Determination
(i) Where a visible crust exists, drop a steel ball with a diameter of 15.9 millimeters (0.625 inches) and a mass ranging from 16 to 17 grams from a distance of 30 centimeters (one foot) directly above (at a 90 degree angle perpendicular to) the soil surface. If blowsand is present, clear the blowsand from the surfaces on which the visible crust test method is conducted. Blowsand is defined as thin deposits of loose uncombined grains covering less than 50 percent of a vacant lot which have not originated from the representative vacant lot surface being tested. If material covers a visible crust which is not blowsand, apply the test method in section II.2 of this appendix to the loose material to determine whether the surface is stabilized.
(ii) A sufficient crust is defined under the following conditions: once a ball has been dropped according to section II.1.(i) of this appendix, the ball does not sink into the surface so that it is partially or fully surrounded by loose grains and, upon removing the ball, the surface upon which it fell has not been pulverized so that loose grains are visible.
(iii) Conduct three tests, dropping the ball once per test, within a survey area the size of one foot by one foot. The survey area shall be considered sufficiently crusted if at least two out of three tests meet the definition in section II.1.(ii) of this appendix. Select at least two other survey areas that represent the disturbed surface area and repeat this procedure. Whether a sufficient crust covers the disturbed surface area shall be based on a determination that all of the survey areas tested are sufficiently crusted.
(iv) At any given site, the existence of a sufficient crust covering one portion of a disturbed surface may not represent the existence or protectiveness of a crust on another disturbed surface(s). Repeat the visible crust test as often as necessary on each representative disturbed surface area for an accurate assessment of all disturbed surfaces at a given site.

# 2. Determination of Threshold Friction Velocity (TFV)
For disturbed surface areas that are not crusted or vegetated, determine threshold friction velocity (TFV) according to the following sieving field procedure (based on a 1952 laboratory procedure published by W. S. Chepil).
(i) Obtain and stack a set of sieves with the following openings: 4 millimeters (mm), 2 mm, 1 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.25 mm. Place the sieves in order according to size openings beginning with the largest size opening at the top. Place a collector pan underneath the bottom (0.25 mm) sieve. Collect a sample of loose surface material from an area at least 30 cm by 30 cm in size to a depth of approximately 1 cm using a brush and dustpan or other similar device. Only collect soil samples from dry surfaces (i.e. when the surface is not damp to the touch). Remove any rocks larger than 1 cm in diameter from the sample. Pour the sample into the top sieve (4 mm opening) and cover the sieve/collector pan unit with a lid. Minimize escape of particles into the air when transferring surface soil into the sieve/collector pan unit. Move the covered sieve/collector pan unit by hand using a broad, circular arm motion in the horizontal plane. Complete twenty circular arm movements, ten clockwise and ten counterclockwise, at a speed just necessary to achieve some relative horizontal motion between the sieves and the particles. Remove the lid from the sieve/collector pan unit and disassemble each sieve separately beginning with the largest sieve. As each sieve is removed, examine it for loose particles. If loose particles have not been sifted to the finest sieve through which they can pass, reassemble and cover the sieve/collector pan unit and gently rotate it an additional ten times. After disassembling the sieve/collector pan unit, slightly tilt and gently tap
each sieve and the collector pan so that material aligns along one side. In doing so, minimize escape of particles into the air. Line up the sieves and collector pan in a row and visibly inspect the relative quantities of catch in order to determine which sieve (or whether the collector pan) contains the greatest volume of material. If a visual determination of relative volumes of catch among sieves is difficult, use a graduated cylinder to measure the volume. Estimate TFV for the sieve catch with the greatest volume using Table 1, which provides a correlation between sieve opening size and TFV.

Collect at least three (3) soil samples which are representative of the disturbed surface area, repeat the above TFV test method for each sample and average the resulting TFVs together to determine the TFV uncorrected for non-erodible elements.
(ii) Non-erodible elements are distinct elements on the disturbed surface area that are larger than one (1) cm in diameter, remain firmly in place during a wind episode and inhibit soil loss by consuming part of the shear stress of the wind. Non-erodible elements include stones and bulk surface material but do not include flat or standing vegetation. For surfaces with non-erodible elements, determine corrections to the TFV by identifying the fraction of the survey area, as viewed from directly overhead, that is occupied by non-erodible elements using the following procedure. Select a survey area of one (1) meter by 1 meter. Where many non-erodible elements lie on the disturbed surface area, separate them into groups according to size. For each group, calculate the overhead area for the non-erodible elements according to the following equations:
(Average length) × (Average width) = Average Dimensions
Eq. 1
(Average Dimensions) × (Number of Elements) = Overhead Area
Eq. 2
Overhead Area of Group 1 + Overhead Area of Group 2 (etc.) = Total Overhead Area
Eq. 3
Total Overhead Area/2 = Total Frontal Area
Eq. 4
(Total Frontal Area/Survey Area) × 100 = Percent Cover of Non-erodible Elements
Eq. 5
(Ensure consistent units of measurement, e.g. square meters or square inches when calculating percent cover.)
Repeat this procedure on an additional two (2) distinct survey areas representing a disturbed surface and average the results. Use Table 2 to identify the correction factor for the percent cover of non-erodible elements. Multiply the TFV by the corresponding correction factor to calculate the TFV corrected for non-erodible elements.

# 3. Determination of Flat Vegetation Cover
Flat vegetation includes attached (rooted) vegetation or unattached vegetative debris lying on the surface with a predominant horizontal orientation that is not subject to movement by wind. Flat vegetation which is dead but firmly attached shall be considered equally protective as live vegetation. Stones or other aggregate larger than one centimeter in diameter shall be considered protective cover in the course of conducting the line transect method. Where flat vegetation exists, conduct the following line transect method.
(i) Stretch a one-hundred (100) foot measuring tape across a disturbed surface area. Firmly anchor both ends of the measuring tape into the surface using a tool such as a screwdriver with the tape stretched taut and close to the soil surface. If vegetation exists in regular rows, place the tape diagonally (at approximately a 45 degree angle) away from a parallel or perpendicular position to the vegetated rows. Pinpoint an area the size of a
3/32
inch diameter brazing rod or wooden dowel centered above each one-foot interval mark along one edge of the tape. Count the number of times that flat vegetation lies directly underneath the pinpointed area at one-foot intervals. Consistently observe the underlying surface from a 90 degree angle directly above each pinpoint on one side of the tape. Do not count the underlying surface as vegetated if any portion of the pinpoint extends beyond the edge of the vegetation underneath in any direction. If clumps of vegetation or vegetative debris lie underneath the pinpointed area, count the surface as vegetated unless bare soil is visible directly below the pinpointed area. When 100 observations have been made, add together the number of times a surface was counted as vegetated. This total represents the percent of flat vegetation cover (e.g. if 35 positive
counts were made, then vegetation cover is 35 percent). If the disturbed surface area is too small for 100 observations, make as many observations as possible. Then multiply the count of vegetated surface areas by the appropriate conversion factor to obtain percent cover. For example, if vegetation was counted 20 times within a total of 50 observations, divide 20 by 50 and multiply by 100 to obtain a flat vegetation cover of 40 percent.
(ii) Conduct the above line transect test method an additional two (2) times on areas representative of the disturbed surface and average results.

# 4. Determination of Standing Vegetation Cover
Standing vegetation includes vegetation that is attached (rooted) with a predominant vertical orientation. Standing vegetation which is dead but firmly rooted shall be considered equally protective as live vegetation. Conduct the following standing vegetation test method to determine if 30 percent cover or more exists. If the resulting percent cover is less than 30 percent but equal to or greater than 10 percent, then conduct the Threshold Friction Velocity test in section II.2 of this appendix in order to determine whether the disturbed surface area is stabilized according to paragraph (b)(16)(ii)(E) of this section.
(i) For standing vegetation that consists of large, separate vegetative structures (for example, shrubs and sagebrush), select a survey area representing the disturbed surface that is the shape of a square with sides equal to at least ten (10) times the average height of the vegetative structures. For smaller standing vegetation, select a survey area of three (3) feet by 3 feet.
(ii) Count the number of standing vegetative structures within the survey area. Count vegetation which grows in clumps as a single unit. Where different types of vegetation exists and/or vegetation of different height and width exists, separate the vegetative structures with similar dimensions into groups. Count the number of vegetative structures in each group within the survey area. Select an individual structure within each group that represents the average height and width of the vegetation in the group. If the structure is dense (i.e. when looking at it vertically from base to top there is little or zero open air space within its perimeter), calculate and record its frontal silhouette area according to Equation 6 of this appendix. Also use Equation 6 if the survey area is larger than nine square feet, estimating the average height and width of the vegetation. Otherwise, use the procedure in section II.4.(iii) of this appendix to calculate the Frontal Silhouette Area. Then calculate the percent cover of standing vegetation according to Equations 7, 8 and 9 of this appendix. (Ensure consistent units of measurement, e.g. square feet or square inches when calculating percent cover.)
(iii) Vegetative Density Factor. Cut a single, representative piece of vegetation (or consolidated vegetative structure) to within 1 cm of surface soil. Using a white paper grid or transparent grid over white paper, lay the vegetation flat on top of the grid (but do not apply pressure to flatten the structure). Grid boxes of one inch or one half inch squares are sufficient for most vegetation when conducting this procedure. Using a marker or pencil, outline the shape of the vegetation along its outer perimeter according to Figure B, C or D of this appendix, as appropriate. (
Note:
Figure C differs from Figure D primarily in that the width of vegetation in Figure C is narrow at its base and gradually broadens to its tallest height. In Figure D, the width of the vegetation generally becomes narrower from its midpoint to its tallest height.) Remove the vegetation and count and record the total number of gridline intersections within the outlined area, but do not count gridline intersections that connect with the outlined shape. There must be at least 10 gridline intersections within the outlined area and preferably more than 20, otherwise, use smaller grid boxes. Draw small circles (no greater than a
3/32
inch diameter) at each gridline intersection counted within the outlined area. Replace the vegetation on the grid within its outlined shape. From a distance of approximately two feet directly above the grid, observe each circled gridline intersection. Count and record the number of circled gridline intersections that are not covered by any piece of the vegetation. To calculate percent vegetative density, use Equations 10 and 11 of this appendix. If percent vegetative density is equal to or greater than 30, use the equation (Eq. 14, 15 or 16) that matches the outline used to trace the vegetation (Figure B, C or D) to calculate its Frontal Silhouette Area. If percent vegetative density is less than 30, use Equations 12 and 13 of this appendix to calculate the Frontal Silhouette Area.
(iv) Within a disturbed surface area that contains multiple types of vegetation with each vegetation type uniformly distributed, results of the percent cover associated with the individual vegetation types may be added together.
(v) Repeat this procedure on an additional two (2) distinct survey areas representing the disturbed surface and average the results.
Height × Width = Frontal Silhouette Area
Eq. 6
(Frontal Silhouette Area of Individual Vegetative Structure) × Number of Vegetation Structures Per Group = Group Frontal Silhouette Area of Group
Eq. 7
Frontal Silhouette Area of Group 1 + Frontal Silhouette Area of Group 2 (etc.) = Total Frontal Silhouette Area
Eq. 8
(Total Frontal Silhouette Area/Survey Area) × 100 = Percent Cover of Standing Vegetation
Eq. 9
[(Number of circled gridlines within the outlined area counted that are not covered by vegetation / Total number of gridline intersections within the outlined area) × 100] = Percent Open Space
Eq. 10
100 = Percent Open Space = Percent Vegetative Density
Eq. 11
Percent Vegetative Density/100 = Vegetative Density

§ 52.130
Source surveillance.
(a) The requirements of § 51.211 of this chapter are not met since the plan does not contain legally enforceable procedures for requiring sources in the Northern Arizona, Mohave-Yuma, Central Arizona, and Southeast Arizona Intrastate Regions to maintain records of and periodically report on the nature and amounts of emissions.
(b) The requirements of § 51.213 of this chapter are not met because the plan does not provide procedures for obtaining and maintaining data on actual emission reductions achieved as a result of implementing transportation control measures.
(c)
Regulation for source recordkeeping and reporting.
(1) The owner or operator of any stationary source in the Northern Arizona, Mohave-Yuma, Central Arizona, or Southeast Arizona Intrastate Region (§§ 81.270, 81.268, 81.271, and 81.272 of this chapter) shall, upon notification from the Administrator, maintain records of the nature and amounts of emissions from such source or any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures.
(2) The information recorded shall be summarized and reported to the Administrator, and shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31, except that the initial reporting period shall commence on the date the Administrator issues notification of the recordkeeping requirements.
(3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of the summarizing reports submitted to the Administrator shall be retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which the pertinent report is submitted.
(4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and other control measures. All such emission data will be available during normal business hours at the regional office (region IX). The Administrator will designate one or more places in Arizona where such emission data and correlations will be available for public inspection.
(d) The requirements of § 51.214 of this chapter are not met since the plan does not contain legally enforceable procedures for requiring certain stationary sources subject to emission standards to install, calibrate, operate, and maintain equipment for continuously monitoring and recording emissions, and to provide other information as specified in Appendix P of part 51 of this chapter.
(e) The requirements of § 51.214 of this chapter are not met since the plan does not provide sufficient regulations to meet the minimum specifications of Appendix P in the Maricopa Intrastate Region. Additionally, Maricopa County Air Pollution Control Regulation IV, rule 41, paragraph B, sections 6.0-6.4 (Special Consideration) is disapproved since it does not contain the specific criteria for determining those physical limitations or extreme economic situations where alternative monitoring requirements would be applicable.

2.5
nonattainment area has attained the 2006 24-hour PM
2.5
NAAQS. This determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment for as long as this area continues to attain the 2006 24-
hour PM
2.5
NAAQS. If EPA determines, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, that this area no longer meets the 2006 PM
2.5
NAAQS, the corresponding determination of attainment for that area shall be withdrawn.
(b)
Determination of Attainment:
Effective October 4, 2013, EPA has determined that, based on 2010 to 2012 ambient air quality data, the West Central Pinal PM
2.5
nonattainment area has attained the 2006 24-hour PM
2.5
NAAQS. This determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment for as long as this area continues to attain the 2006 24-hour PM

NAAQS. If EPA determines, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, that this area no longer meets the 2006 PM
2.5
NAAQS, the corresponding determination of attainment for that area shall be withdrawn.
(c)
Determination of attainment.
Effective June 9, 2017, the EPA has determined that, based on 2013 to 2015 ambient air quality data, the Nogales, AZ PM
2.5
nonattainment area has attained the 2006 24-hour PM
2.5
NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of December 31, 2015. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 188(b)(2) to determine whether the area attained the standard. The EPA also has determined that the Nogales, AZ nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 188(b)(2).
(d)
Determination of attainment.
Effective November 4, 2019, the EPA has determined that, based on 2015 to 2017 ambient air quality data, the West Central Pinal County, AZ PM
2.5
nonattainment area has attained the 2006 24-hour PM
2.5
NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of December 31, 2017. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 188(b)(2) to determine whether the area attained the standard. The EPA also has determined that the West Central Pinal County, AZ nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 188(b)(2).

§ 52.133
Rules and regulations.
(a) Regulation 7-1-1.4(A) (Exceptions) of the Arizona Rules and Regulations for Air Pollution Control, regulations 12-3-2 (Emission Standards) of the Coconino County Rules and Regulations for Air Pollution Control, section 3, regulation 5 (Exceptions) of the Mohave County Air Pollution Control Regulations, regulation 8-1-1.6 (Exceptions) of the Yuma County Air Pollution Control Regulations, and regulation 7-1-2.8 (Exceptions) of the Rules and Regulations for Pinal-Gila Counties Air Quality Control District all provide for an exemption from enforcement action if the violation is attributable to certain events. These events are too broad in scope and the source can obtain the exemption merely by reporting the occurrence. Therefore, the above regulations are disapproved since these regulations make all approved emission limiting regulations potentially unenforceable.
(b) Paragraph E of regulation 7-1-1.3 (R9-3-103) (Air Pollution Prohibited) prohibits any person from causing ground level concentrations to exceed ambient standards outside the boundaries of this operation. This regulation could allow violations of ambient air quality standards to occur in areas to which the public has access, contrary to the requirements of section 110(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act. Therefore, paragraph E of regulation 7-1-1.3 (R9-3-103) of the Arizona Rules and Regulations for Air Pollution Control is disapproved.
(c) The requirements of subpart G and § 51.281 of this chapter are not met since the plan does not provide any enforceable regulations and a demonstration that such regulations will cause the attainment and maintenance of national ambient air quality standards in Graham and Greenlee Counties.
(d) Section 3, regulation 4 (Ground Level Concentrations) of the Mohave
County Air Pollution Control Regulations, paragraph E of regulation 8-1-1.3 (Air Pollution Prohibited) of the Yuma County Air Pollution Control Regulations, and paragraph C of regulation 7-1-1.3 (Air Pollution Prohibited) of the Rules and Regulations for Pinal-Gila Counties Air Quality Control District prohibits any person from causing ground level concentrations to exceed ambient standards outside the boundaries of his operation. These regulations could allow violations of ambient air quality standards to occur in areas to which the general public has access, contrary to the requirements of section 110(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act. Therefore, these regulations are disapproved.
(e) Rule R18-2-702 of the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality Rules and Regulations sets an opacity standard for emissions from stationary sources of PM-10. The standard does not fulfill the RACM/RACT requirements of section 189(a) of the CAA. The rule also does not comply with enforceability requirements of section 110(a) and SIP relaxation requirements of sections 110(l) and 193. Therefore, Rule R18-2-702 submitted on July 15, 1998 is disapproved.
(f) Rules 1-3-130 and 3-1-020 submitted on November 27, 1995 of the Pinal County Air Quality Control District regulations have limited enforceability because they reference rules not contained in the Arizona State Implementation Plan. Therefore, these rules are removed from the Arizona State Implementation Plan.
(g) Rules 1-2-110, 1-3-130, 3-1-020, and 4-1-010 submitted on October 7, 1998 of the Pinal County Air Quality Control District regulations have limited enforceability because they reference rules not contained in the Arizona State Implementation Plan. Therefore, these rules are disapproved.

Any owner or operator of a stationary source subject to § 52.126(b) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section may, no later than 120 days following the effective date of this paragraph, submit to the Administrator for approval a proposed compliance schedule that demonstrates compliance with § 52.126(b) as expeditiously as practicable but not later than July 31, 1975.
(i) The compliance schedule shall provide for periodic increments of progress toward compliance. The dates for achievement of such increments shall be specified. Increments of progress shall include, but not be limited to: Submittal of the final control plan to the Administrator; letting of necessary contracts for construction or process change, or issuance of orders for the purchase of component parts to accomplish emission control equipment or process modification; completion of onsite construction or installation of emission control equipment or process modification; and final compliance.
(ii) Any compliance schedule for the stationary source subject to § 52.125(c) which extends beyond July 31, 1975, shall apply any reasonable interim measures of control designed to reduce the impact of such source on public health.
(3) Any owner or operator who submits a compliance schedule pursuant to this paragraph shall, within 5 days after the deadline for each increment of progress, certify to the Administrator whether or not the required increment of the approved compliance schedule has been met.

emissions, the owner/operator shall include the following information: the range of reagent injection rates evaluated (expressed as a molar ratio of reagent to average NO
X
concentration), reagent injection rate, average NO
X
concentration, lime production rate, kiln flue gas temperature, and the presence of any detached plumes from the kiln exhaust.
(iii) The owner/operator shall submit a report that lists the daily rolling 30-kiln operating day emission rates for NO
X
and SO
2
, calculated in accordance with paragraphs (i)(6)(iii) and (iv) of this section.
(iv) The owner/operator shall submit a report that lists the monthly rolling 12-month emission rates for NO
X
and SO
2
, calculated in accordance with paragraphs (i)(6)(v) and (vi) of this section.
(v) The owner/operator shall submit excess emissions reports for NO
X
and SO
2
limits. Excess emissions means emissions that exceed any of the emissions limits specified in paragraph (i)(3) of this section. The reports shall include the magnitude, date(s), and duration of each period of excess emissions; specific identification of each period of excess emissions that occurs during startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions of the kiln; the nature and cause of any malfunction (if known); and the corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted.
(vi) The owner/operator shall submit a summary of CEMS operation, to include dates and duration of each period during which the CEMS was inoperative (except for zero and span adjustments and calibration checks), reason(s) why the CEMS was inoperative and steps taken to prevent recurrence, and any CEMS repairs or adjustments.
(vii) The owner/operator shall submit results of all CEMS performance tests required by 40 CFR part 60, Appendix F, Procedure 1 (Relative Accuracy Test Audits, Relative Accuracy Audits, and Cylinder Gas Audits).
(viiii) When no excess emissions have occurred or the CEMS has not been inoperative, repaired, or adjusted during the reporting period, the owner/operator shall state such information in the semiannual report.
(9)
Notifications.
All notifications required under this section shall be submitted by the owner/operator to the Director, Enforcement Division (Mail Code ENF-2-1), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California 94105-3901.
(i) The owner/operator shall submit notification of commencement of construction of any equipment which is being constructed to comply with the NO
X
emission limits in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.
(ii) The owner/operator shall submit semiannual progress reports on construction of any such equipment.
(iii) The owner/operator shall submit notification of initial startup of any such equipment.
(10)
Equipment operations.
(i) At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, the owner/operator shall, to the extent practicable, maintain and operate the kilns, including associated air pollution control equipment, in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Pollution control equipment shall be designed and capable of operating properly to minimize emissions during all expected operating conditions. Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Regional Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operating and maintenance procedures, and inspection of the kilns.
(ii) After completion of installation of ammonia injection on a kiln, the owner/operator shall inject sufficient ammonia to achieve compliance with the NO
X
emission limits from paragraph (i)(3) of this section for that kiln while preventing excessive ammonia emissions.
(11)
Enforcement.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this implementation plan, any credible evidence or information relevant as to whether the kiln would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed can be used to establish whether or not the owner/operator has violated or is in violation of any standard or applicable emission limit in the plan.
