Alternative recordkeeping requirements for separated yard waste, separated food waste, separated MSW, and biogenic waste oils/fats/greases.
(a)
Alternative recordkeeping.
In lieu of complying with the recordkeeping requirements in § 80.1454(j), a renewable fuel producer or biointermediate producer that produces renewable fuel or biointermediate from separated yard waste, separated food waste, separated MSW, or biogenic waste oils/fats/greases and uses a feedstock aggregator to supply these feedstocks may comply with the alternative recordkeeping requirements of this section.
(b)

The feedstock aggregator must register under 40 CFR 1090.805.

(2) The independent third-party auditor must conduct a site visit of each feedstock aggregator's establishment as specified in § 80.1471(f).
