• Any potential harm the expansion may have on any other credit union and its members is clearly outweighed by the probable beneficial effect of the expansion. With respect to a proposed expansion's effect on other credit unions, the requirements on overlapping fields of membership set forth in Section IV.E of this Chapter are also applicable; and
• If the formation of a separate credit union by such group is not practical and consistent with reasonable standards for the safe and sound operation of a credit union.
The Federal Credit Union Act presumes that a group of 3,000 or more primary potential members is able to form its own stand-alone credit union unless NCUA determines that it is infeasible to do so for reasons such as:
(i) The group lacks sufficient volunteer and other resources to support the efficient and effective operation of its own credit union;
(ii) the group does not meet criteria that the Board has determined to be an important indicator of success in establishing and managing a new credit union, including demographic characteristics such as the geographic location of members, the diversity of ages and income levels among members, and other factors that may affect such a credit union's financial viability and stability; or
(iii) the group would be unlikely to operate a safe and sound credit union.
As such, NCUA requires additional information when a multiple common bond credit union applies to add a group of 3,000 or more primary potential members. For groups between 3,000 and 4,999 potential members, NCUA requires documentation indicating the group has a lack of available subsidies, interest among the group's members, and sufficient resources. For such cases NCUA, in its discretion, will accept a written statement indicating these conditions exist as sufficient documentation the group cannot form its own credit union. Groups with 5,000 or more members will be subject to the standard document requirements as discussed later in this chapter, requiring a group to fully describe its inability to establish a new single common bond credit union.

# IV.B.3—Documentation Requirements
A multiple common bond credit union requesting a select group expansion must submit a formal written request, using the Application for Field of Membership Amendment (NCUA 4015-EZ, NCUA 4015-A or NCUA 4015) to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director. An authorized credit union representative must sign the request.
The NCUA 4015-EZ (for groups less than 3,000 potential members) must be accompanied by the following:
• A letter, or equivalent documentation, from the group requesting credit union service. This letter must indicate:
• That the group wants to be added to the applicant federal credit union's field of membership;
• The number of persons currently included within the group to be added and their locations; and
• The group's proximity to the credit union's nearest service facility.
• The most recent copy of the group's charter and bylaws or equivalent documentation (for associational groups).
The NCUA 4015-A (for groups between 3,000 and 4,999 primary potential members) must be accompanied by the following:
• A letter, or equivalent documentation, from the group requesting credit union service. This letter must indicate:
• That the group wants to be added to the federal credit union's field of membership;
• The number of persons currently included within the group to be added and their locations;
• The group's proximity to credit union's nearest service facility, and
• Why the formation of a separate credit union for the group is not practical or consistent with safety and soundness standards because of a lack of available subsidies, interest among the group's members, and sufficient resources.
The NCUA 4015 (for groups of 5,000 or more primary potential members) must be accompanied by the following:
• A letter, or equivalent documentation, from the group requesting credit union service. This letter must indicate:
• That the group wants to be added to the federal credit union's field of membership;
• Whether the group presently has other credit union service available;
• The number of persons currently included within the group to be added and their locations;
• The group's proximity to credit union's nearest service facility, and
• Why the formation of a separate credit union for the group is not practical or consistent with safety and soundness standards. A credit union need not address every item on the list, simply those issues that are relevant to its particular request:
Member location—whether the membership is widely dispersed or concentrated in a central location.
Demographics—the employee turnover rate, economic status of the group's members, and whether the group is more apt to consist of savers and/or borrowers.
Market competition—the availability of other financial services.
Desired services and products—the type of services the group desires in comparison to the type of services a new credit union could offer.
Sponsor subsidies—the availability of operating subsidies.
The desire of the sponsor—the extent of the sponsor's interest in supporting a credit union charter.
Employee interest—the extent of the employees' interest in obtaining a credit union charter.
Evidence of past failure—whether the group previously had its own credit union or previously filed for a credit union charter.
Administrative capacity to provide services—will the group have the management expertise to provide the services requested.
• If the group is eligible for membership in any other credit union, documentation must be provided to support inclusion of the group under the overlap standards set forth in Section IV.E of this Chapter; and
• The most recent copy of the group's charter and bylaws or equivalent documentation (for associational groups).

# IV.B.4—Restructuring
If a select group within a federal credit union's field of membership undergoes a substantial restructuring, a change to the credit union's field of membership may be required if the credit union is to continue to provide service to the select group. NCUA permits a multiple common bond credit union to maintain in its field of membership a sold, spun-off, or merged select group to which it has been providing service. This type of amendment to the credit union's charter is not considered an expansion; therefore, the criteria relating to adding new groups are not applicable.
When two groups merge and each is in the field of membership of a credit union, then both (or all affected) credit unions can serve the resulting merged group, subject to any existing geographic limitation and without regard to any overlap provisions. However, the credit unions cannot serve the other multiple groups that may be in the field of membership of the other credit union.

# IV.C—NCUA's Procedures for Amending the Field of Membership

# IV.C.1—General
All requests for approval to amend a federal credit union's charter must be submitted to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director.

# IV.C.2—Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director Decision
NCUA staff will review all amendment requests in order to ensure conformance to NCUA policy.
Before acting on a proposed amendment, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director may require an on-site review. In addition, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director may, after taking into account the significance of the proposed field of membership amendment, require the applicant to submit a business plan addressing specific issues.
The financial and operational condition of the requesting credit union will be considered in every instance. An expanded field of membership may provide the basis for reversing adverse trends. In such cases, an amendment to expand the field of membership may be granted notwithstanding the credit union's adverse trends. The applicant credit union must clearly establish that the approval of the expanded field of membership meets the requirements of Section IV.B.2 of this Chapter and will not increase the risk to the NCUSIF.

# IV.C.3—Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director Approval
If the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director approves the requested amendment, the credit union will be issued an amendment to Section 5 of its charter.

# IV.C.4—Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director Disapproval
When the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director disapproves any application, in whole or in part, to amend the field of membership under this chapter, the applicant will be informed in writing of the:
• Specific reasons for the action;
• Options to consider, if appropriate, for gaining approval; and
• Appeal procedure.

# IV.C.5—Appeal of Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director Decision
If the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director denies a field of membership expansion request, merger, or spin-off, that decision may be appealed to the NCUA Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart B to part 746 of this chapter.
Before appealing, the credit union may, within 30 days of the denial, provide supplemental information to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director for reconsideration. A request for reconsideration should contain new and material evidence addressing the reasons for the initial denial or explain extenuating circumstances that precluded the inclusion of existing material evidence or information that should have been filed with the request for reconsideration. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will have 30
days from the date of the receipt of the request for reconsideration to make a final decision. If the request is again denied, the applicant may proceed with the appeal process within 60 days of the date of the last denial. A petitioner may seek a second reconsideration based on new material evidence or information or extenuating circumstances that precluded the inclusion of such information in the previous request.

# IV.D—Mergers, Purchase and Assumptions, and Spin-Offs
In general, other than the addition of select groups, there are three additional ways a multiple common bond federal credit union can expand its field of membership:
• By taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a merger;
• By taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a purchase and assumption (P
A); or
• By taking a portion of another credit union's field of membership through a spin-off.

# IV.D.1—Voluntary Mergers

# a. All Select Groups in the Merging Credit Union's Field of Membership Have Less Than 3,000 Primary Potential Members
A voluntary merger of two or more federal credit unions is permissible as long as each select group in the merging credit union's field of membership has less than 3,000 primary potential members. While the merger requirements outlined in Section 205 of the Federal Credit Union Act must still be met, the requirements of Chapter 2, Section IV.B.2 of this manual are not applicable.

# b. One or More Select Groups in the Merging Credit Union's Field of Membership Has 3,000 or More Primary Potential Members
If the merging credit unions serve the same group, and the group consists of 3,000 or more primary potential members, then the ability to form a separate credit union analysis is not required for that group. If the merging credit union has any other groups consisting of 3,000 or more primary potential members, special requirements apply. NCUA will analyze each group of 3,000 or more primary potential members, except as noted above, to determine whether the formation of a separate credit union by such a group is practical. If the formation of a separate credit union by such a group is not practical because the group lacks sufficient volunteer and other resources to support the efficient and effective operations of a credit union or does not meet the economic advisable criteria outlined in Chapter 1, the group may be merged into a multiple common bond credit union. If the formation of a separate credit union is practical, the group must be spun-off before the merger can be approved.

# c. Merger of a Single Common Bond Credit Union Into a Multiple Common Bond Credit Union
A financially healthy single common bond credit union with a primary potential membership of 3,000 or more cannot merge into a multiple common bond credit union, absent supervisory reasons, unless the continuing credit union already serves the same group.

# d. Merger Approval
If the merger is approved, the qualifying groups within the merging credit union's field of membership will be transferred intact to the continuing credit union and can continue to be served.
Where the merging credit union is state-chartered, the field of membership rules applicable to a federal credit union apply.
Mergers must be approved by the applicable NCUA regional or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the merging credit union, and, as applicable, the state regulators.

# IV.D.2—Supervisory Mergers
The NCUA may approve the merger of any federally insured credit union when safety and soundness concerns are present without regard to the 3,000 numerical limitation. The credit union need not be insolvent or in danger of insolvency for NCUA to use this statutory authority. Examples constituting appropriate reasons for using this authority are: abandonment of the management and/or officials and an inability to find replacements, loss of sponsor support, serious and persistent record-keeping problems, sustained material decline in financial condition, or other serious or persistent circumstances.

# IV.D.3—Emergency Mergers
An emergency merger may be approved by NCUA without regard to common bond or other legal constraints. An emergency merger involves NCUA's direct intervention and approval. The credit union to be merged must either be insolvent or in danger of insolvency, as defined in the Glossary, and NCUA must determine that:
• An emergency requiring expeditious action exists;
• Other alternatives are not reasonably available; and
• The public interest would best be served by approving the merger.
If not corrected, conditions that could lead to insolvency include, but are not limited to:
• Abandonment by management;
• Loss of sponsor;
• Serious and persistent record-keeping problems; or
• Serious and persistent operational concerns.
In an emergency merger situation, NCUA will take an active role in finding a suitable merger partner (continuing credit union). NCUA is primarily concerned that the continuing credit union has the financial strength and management expertise to absorb the troubled credit union without adversely affecting its own financial condition and stability.
As a stipulated condition to an emergency merger, the field of membership of the merging credit union may be transferred intact to the continuing federal credit union without regard to any field of membership restrictions including numerical limitation requirements. Under this authority, any single occupational or associational common bond, multiple common bond, or community charter may merger into a multiple common bond credit union and that credit union can continue to serve the merging credit union's field of membership. Subsequent field of membership expansions of the continuing multiple common bond credit union must be consistent with multiple common bond policies.
Emergency mergers involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the merging credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators.

# IV.D.4—Purchase and Assumption (P

# A)
Another alternative for acquiring the field of membership of a failing credit union is through a consolidation known as a P
A. Generally, the requirements applicable to field of membership expansions found in this chapter apply to purchase and assumptions where the purchasing credit union is a federal charter.
A P
A has limited application because, in most cases, the failing credit union must be placed into involuntary liquidation. However, in the few instances where a P
A may occur, the assuming federal credit union, as with emergency mergers, may acquire the entire field of membership if the emergency criteria are satisfied. Specified loans, shares, and certain other designated assets and liabilities, without regard to field of membership restrictions, may also be acquired without changing the character of the continuing federal credit union for purposes of future field of membership amendments. Subsequent field of membership expansions must be consistent with multiple common bond policies.
P
As involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the purchased and/or assumed credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators.

# IV.D.5—Spin-Offs
A spin-off occurs when, by agreement of the parties, a portion of the field of membership, assets, liabilities, shares, and capital of a credit union are transferred to a new or existing credit union. A spin-off is unique in that usually one credit union has a field of membership expansion and the other loses a portion of its field of membership.
All common bond requirements apply regardless of whether the spun-off group becomes a new charter or goes to an existing federal charter.
The request for approval of a spun-off group must be supported with a plan that addresses, at a minimum:
• Why the spin-off is being requested;
• What part of the field of membership is to be spun off;
• Which assets, liabilities, shares, and capital are to be transferred;
• The financial impact the spin-off will have on the affected credit unions;
• The ability of the acquiring credit union to effectively serve the new members;
• The proposed spin-off date; and
• Disclosure to the members of the requirements set forth above.
The spin-off request must also include current financial statements from the affected credit unions and the proposed voting ballot.
For federal credit unions spinning off a group, membership notice and voting requirements and procedures are the same as for mergers (see part 708 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations), except that only the members directly affected by the spin-off—those whose shares are to be transferred—are permitted to vote. Members whose shares are not being transferred will not be afforded the opportunity to vote. All members of the group to be spun off (whether they voted in favor, against, or not at all) will be transferred if the spin-off is approved by the voting membership. Voting requirements for federally insured state credit unions are governed by state law.
Spin-offs involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by all regional directors and, if applicable, the Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the credit unions are headquartered and the state regulators, as applicable. Spin-offs in the same
region also require approval by the state regulator, as applicable.

# IV.E—Overlaps

# IV.E.1—General
An overlap exists when a group of persons is eligible for membership in two or more credit unions, including state charters. An overlap is permitted when the expansion's beneficial effect in meeting the convenience and needs of the members of the group proposed to be included in the field of membership outweighs any adverse effect on the overlapped credit union.
Credit unions must investigate the possibility of an overlap with federally insured credit unions prior to submitting an expansion request if the group has 5,000 or more primary potential members. If cases arise where the assurance given to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director concerning the unavailability of credit union service is inaccurate, the misinformation may be grounds for removal of the group from the federal credit union's charter.
When an overlap situation requiring analysis does arise, officials of the expanding credit union must ascertain the views of the overlapped credit union. If the overlapped credit union does not object, the applicant must submit a letter or other documentation to that effect. If the overlapped credit union does not respond, the expanding credit union must notify NCUA in writing of its attempt to obtain the overlapped credit union's comments.
NCUA will approve an overlap if the expansion's beneficial effect in meeting the convenience and needs of the members of the group outweighs any adverse effect on the overlapped credit union.
In reviewing the overlap, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will consider:
• The view of the overlapped credit union(s);
• Whether the overlap is incidental in nature—the group of persons in question is so small as to have no material effect on the original credit union;
• Whether there is limited participation by members or employees of the group in the original credit union after the expiration of a reasonable period of time;
• Whether the original credit union fails to provide requested service;
• Financial effect on the overlapped credit union;
• The desires of the group(s);
• The desire of the sponsor organization; and
• The best interests of the affected group and the credit union members involved.
Generally, if the overlapped credit union does not object, and NCUA determines that there is no safety and soundness problem, the overlap will be permitted.
Potential overlaps of a federally insured state credit union's field of membership by a federal credit union will generally be analyzed in the same way as if two federal credit unions were involved. Where a federally insured state credit union's field of membership is broadly stated, NCUA will exclude its field of membership from any overlap protection.
NCUA will permit multiple common bond federal credit unions to overlap community charters without performing an overlap analysis.

# IV.E.2—Overlap Issues as a Result of Organizational Restructuring
A federal credit union's field of membership will always be governed by the field of membership descriptions contained in Section 5 of its charter. Where a sponsor organization expands its operations internally, by acquisition or otherwise, the credit union may serve these new entrants to its field of membership if they are part of any select group listed in Section 5. Where acquisitions are made which add a new subsidiary, the group cannot be served until the subsidiary is included in the field of membership through a housekeeping amendment.
A federal credit union's field of membership will always be governed by the field of membership descriptions contained in Section 5 of its charter. Where a sponsor organization expands its operations internally, by acquisition or otherwise, the credit union may serve these new entrants to its field of membership if they are part of any select group listed in Section 5. Where acquisitions are made which add a new subsidiary, the group cannot be served until the subsidiary is included in the field of membership through a housekeeping amendment.
Overlaps may occur as a result of restructuring or merger of the parent organization. When such overlaps occur, each credit union must request a field of membership amendment to reflect the new groups each wishes to serve. The credit union can continue to serve any current group in its field of membership that is acquiring a new group or has been acquired by a new group.
The new group cannot be served by the credit union until the field of membership amendment is approved by NCUA.
Credit unions affected by organizational restructuring or merger should attempt to resolve overlap issues among themselves. Unless an agreement is reached limiting the overlap resulting from the corporate restructuring, NCUA will permit a complete overlap of the credit unions' fields of membership. When two groups merge, or one group is acquired by the other, and each is in the field of membership of a credit union, both (or all
affected) credit unions can serve the resulting merged or acquired group, subject to any existing geographic limitation and without regard to any overlap provisions. This is accomplished through a housekeeping amendment.
Credit unions must submit to NCUA documentation explaining the restructuring and provide information regarding the new organizational structure.

# IV.E.3—Exclusionary Clauses
An exclusionary clause is a limitation precluding the credit union from serving the primary members of a portion of a group otherwise included in its field of membership. NCUA no longer grants exclusionary clauses. Those granted prior to the adoption of this new Chartering and Field of Membership Manual will remain in effect unless the credit unions agree to remove them or one of the affected credit unions submits a housekeeping amendment to have it removed.

# IV.F—Charter Conversion
A multiple common bond federal credit union may apply to convert to a community charter provided the field of membership requirements of the community charter are met. Groups within the existing charter which cannot qualify in the new charter cannot be served except for members of record, or groups or communities obtained in an emergency merger or P
A. A credit union must notify all groups that will be removed from the field of membership as a result of conversion. Members of record can continue to be served. Also, in order to support a case for a conversion, the applicant federal credit union may be required to develop a detailed business plan as specified in Chapter 2, Section V.A.3.
A multiple common bond federal credit union may apply to convert to a single occupational or associational common bond charter provided the field of membership requirements of the new charter are met. Groups within the existing charter, which do not qualify in the new charter, cannot be served except for members of record, or groups or communities obtained in an emergency merger or P
A. A credit union must notify all groups that will be removed from the field of membership as a result of conversion.

# IV.G—Credit Union Requested Removal of Groups From the Field of Membership
A credit union may request removal of a group from its field of membership for various reasons. The most common reasons for this type of amendment are:
• The group is within the field of membership of two credit unions and one wishes to discontinue service;
• The federal credit union cannot continue to provide adequate service to the group;
• The group has ceased to exist;
• The group does not respond to repeated requests to contact the credit union or refuses to provide needed support;
• The group initiates action to be removed from the field of membership; or
• The federal credit union wishes to convert to a single common bond.
When a federal credit union requests an amendment to remove a group from its field of membership, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will determine why the credit union desires to remove the group. If the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director concurs with the request, membership will continue for those who are already members under the “once a member, always a member” provision of the Federal Credit Union Act.

# IV.H—NCUA Supervisory Action To Remove Groups From the Field of Membership
NCUA has in place quality control processes that protect the integrity of its field of membership requirements. As part of this obligation, NCUA's Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion will randomly select groups added through NCUA's Field of Membership Internet Application (FOMIA) system for quality assurance reviews even if the expansion application meets all the conditions for approval. Each FCU is responsible for obtaining certain documentation when seeking to add groups to its field of membership through FOMIA. In addition, as indicated in the FOMIA User Instruction Guide, available on NCUA's Web site, an FCU must permanently retain the documentation from the select group requesting service and the Confirmation Certificate generated at the time the FOMIA request is submitted to NCUA.
As part of the quality assurance process, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion reserves the right to request this documentation at any time. If the FCU fails to provide this documentation when the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion requests it, the director of the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion may consider removing the group from the FCU's field of membership and restricting the FCU from using the FOMIA system for future requests. Specifically, as part of the FOMIA quality assurance process, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion staff will do the following:
1. Within 10 days of receiving an application selected for a quality assurance review, notify the FCU of the documentation the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion requires. The FCU will have 15 days to provide the necessary documentation. the
Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion will respond to the FCU with a determination on the quality assurance review of the association within 15 days of receiving the requested information;
2. After receiving the additional documentation, if any concerns remain outstanding, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion will again correspond with the FCU and provide a 15-day time frame for correcting the concern. the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion will respond to the FCU with a determination on the quality assurance review of the association within 15 days of receiving the requested information; and
3. If the FCU does not provide the requested documentation, or cannot correct the concern, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will deny the application and notify the credit union of its appeal rights.

# IV.I—NCUA Investigation of Potential Field of Membership Violations
NCUA's Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion is responsible for investigating field of membership complaints from the public, and matters referred to it from the field. It also pursues corrective action as needed for FCUs with confirmed field of membership violations. Although circumstances can vary with each case, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion will generally adhere to the following process for investigating and addressing potential field of membership violations:
1. Initially correspond with management to outline concerns and request clarifying information within 60 days. the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion will also provide context as to the source of NCUA's concerns, such as the discovery of new information about a particular group or an examination finding brought to the attention of the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion;
2. If the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion does not receive the requested information within 60 days, it will notify the FCU and again request the required information be provided within 30 days;
3. After receiving the additional documentation, if any concerns remain outstanding, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion will again correspond with the FCU to provide a 60-day time frame for addressing the concern; and
4. If the FCU is unable to correct the concern, and after consultation with the Office of General Counsel and the appropriate Regional Office or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director, and in accordance with agency guidelines for administrative actions, the Director of the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion will remove the group from the FCU's field of membership pursuant to authority delegated by the NCUA Board. Removal of a group is treated the same as an initial denial under the Chartering Manual. In any adverse final determination on removal under the above delegations, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion will notify the FCU of its appeal rights.
NCUA considers the removal of an association from an FCU's field of membership as an action of last resort. If a group is removed, the FCU can no longer add new members from the group, but can continue serving those who are already members of the FCU under the “once a member, always a member” provision of the Federal Credit Union Act. Also, if the group subsequently qualifies due to changes to the group itself, management can submit a new application at that time.

# IV.J—Other Persons Eligible for Credit Union Membership
A number of persons, by virtue of their close relationship to a common bond group, may be included, at the charter applicant's option, in the field of membership. These include the following:
• Spouses of persons who died while within the field of membership of this credit union;
• Employees of this credit union;
• Persons retired as pensioners or annuitants from the above employment;
• Volunteers;
• Members of the immediate family or household;
• Honorably discharged veterans who served in any of the Armed Services of the United States in this charter;
• Organizations of such persons; and
• Corporate or other legal entities in this charter.
Immediate family is defined as spouse, child, sibling, parent, grandparent, or grandchild. This includes stepparents, stepchildren, stepsiblings, and adoptive relationships.
Household is defined as persons living in the same residence maintaining a single economic unit.
Membership eligibility is extended only to individuals who are members of an “immediate family or household” of a credit union member. It is not necessary for the primary member to join the credit union in order for the immediate family or household member of the primary member to join, provided the immediate family or household clause is included in the field of membership. However, it is necessary for the immediate family member or household member to first join in order for that person's immediate family member or household member to join the credit union. A credit union can adopt a more restrictive definition of immediate family or household.
Volunteers, by virtue of their close relationship with a sponsor group, may be included. Examples include volunteers working at a hospital or church.
Under the Federal Credit Union Act, once a person becomes a member of the credit union, such person may remain a member of the credit union until the person chooses to withdraw or is expelled from the membership of the credit union. This is commonly referred to as “once a member, always a member.” The “once a member, always a member” provision does not prevent a credit union from restricting services to members who are no longer within the field of membership

# V—Community Charter Requirements

# V.A.1—General
There are two types of community charters. One is based on a single, geographically well- defined local community or neighborhood; the other is a rural district. More than one credit union may serve the same community.
NCUA recognizes four types of affinity on which both a community charter and a rural district can be based—persons who live in, worship in, attend school in, or work in the community or rural district. Businesses and other legal entities within the community boundaries or rural district may also qualify for membership.
NCUA has established the following requirements for community charters:
• The geographic area's boundaries must be clearly defined; and
• The area is a well-defined local community or a rural district.

# V.A.2—Definition of Well-Defined Local Community and Rural District
In addition to the documentation requirements in Chapter 1 to charter a credit union, a community credit union applicant must provide additional documentation addressing the proposed area to be served and community service policies, as well as the business plan requirements set forth in this Chapter. An applicant must meet all of these requirements to obtain NCUA approval.
An applicant has the burden of demonstrating to NCUA that the proposed community area meets the statutory requirements of being: (1) Well-defined, and (2) a local community or rural district. The applicant also has the burden of demonstrating that with respect to the proposed community, it has the capacity to provide financial services to low- and moderate-income areas of the community. The agency will reject any application that fails to establish the criteria set forth above.
For an applicant seeking a community charter for a Statistical Area with multiple political jurisdictions with a population of 2.5 million people or more, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion (CURE) shall: (1) Publish a notice in the
Federal Register
seeking comment from interested parties about the proposed community and (2) conduct a public hearing about this application.
“Well-defined” means the proposed area has specific geographic boundaries. Geographic boundaries may include a city, township, county (single, multiple, or portions of a county) or a political equivalent, school districts, or a clearly identifiable neighborhood.
The well-defined local community requirement is met if:
• Single Political Jurisdiction—the area to be served is a recognized Single Political Jurisdiction,
i.e.,
a city, county, or their political equivalent, or any single portion thereof.
• Statistical Area—A statistical area is all or an individual portion of a Combined Statistical Area (CSA) or a Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA) designated by the U.S. Census Bureau, including a Metropolitan Statistical Area. To meet the well-defined local community requirement, the CSA or CBSA or a portion thereof, must be contiguous and have a population of 2.5 million or less people. An individual portion of a statistical area need not conform to internal boundaries within the area, such as metropolitan division boundaries within a Core-Based Statistical Area.
• Compelling Evidence of Common Interests or Interaction—In lieu of a statistical area as defined above, this option is available when a credit union seeks to initially charter a community credit union; to expand an existing community; or to convert to a community charter. Under this option, the credit union must demonstrate that the areas in question are contiguous and further demonstrate a sufficient level of common interests or interaction among area residents to qualify the area as a local community. For that purpose, an applicant must submit for NCUA approval a narrative, supported by appropriate documentation, establishing that the area's residents meet the requirements of a local community.
To assist a credit union in developing its narrative, Appendix 6 of this Manual identifies criteria a narrative should address, and which NCUA will consider in deciding a credit union's application to: Initially charter a community credit union; to expand an existing community, including by an adjacent area addition; or to convert to a community charter. In any case, the credit union must demonstrate, through its business and marketing plans, its ability and commitment to serve the entire community for which it seeks NCUA approval.
An area of any geographic size qualifies as a Rural District if:
• The proposed district has well-defined, contiguous geographic boundaries;
• The total population of the proposed district does not exceed 1,000,000;
• Either more than 50% of the proposed district's population resides in census blocks or other geographic units that are designated as rural by either the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or the United States Census Bureau, OR the district has a population density of 100 persons or fewer per square mile; and
• The boundaries of the well-defined rural district do not exceed the outer boundaries of the states that are
immediately contiguous
to the state in which the credit union maintains its headquarters (
i.e.,
not to exceed the outer perimeter of the layer of states immediately surrounding the headquarters state).
The common bond affinity groups that apply to well-defined local communities also apply to Rural Districts.
The requirements in Chapter 2, Sections V.A.4 through V.G also apply to a credit union that serves a rural district.

# V.A.3—Previously Approved Communities
If NCUA has determined that a specific geographic area is a well-defined local community, then a new applicant need not reestablish that fact as part of its application to serve the exact area. The new applicant must, however, note NCUA's previous determination as part of its overall application. An applicant applying for an area that is not exactly the same as a previously approved well defined local community must comply with the current criteria in place for determining a well-defined local community.

# V.A.4—Business Plan Requirements for a Community Credit Union
A community credit union is frequently more susceptible to competition from other local financial institutions and generally does not have substantial support from any single sponsoring company or association. As a result, a community credit union will often encounter financial and operational factors that differ from an occupational or associational charter. Its diverse membership may require special marketing programs targeted to different segments of the community. For example, the lack of payroll deduction creates special challenges in the development and promotion of savings programs and in the collection of loans. Accordingly, to support an application for a community charter, an applicant Federal credit union must develop a business plan incorporating the following data:
• Pro forma financial statements for a minimum of 24 months after the proposed conversion, including the underlying assumptions and rationale for projected member, share, loan, and asset growth;
• Anticipated financial impact on the credit union, including the need for additional employees and fixed assets, and the associated costs;
• A description of the current and proposed office/branch structure, including a general description of the location(s); parking availability, public transportation availability, drive-through service, lobby capacity, or any other service feature illustrating community access;
• A marketing plan addressing how the community will be served for the 24-month period after the proposed conversion to a community charter, including detailing: How the credit union will implement its business plan; the unique needs of the various demographic groups in the proposed community; how the credit union will market to each group, particularly underserved groups; which community-based organizations the credit union will target in its outreach efforts; the credit union's marketing budget projections dedicating greater resources to reaching new members; and the credit union's timetable for implementation, not just a calendar of events;
• Details, terms and conditions of the credit union's financial products, programs, and services to be provided to the entire community; and
• Maps showing the current and proposed service facilities, ATMs, political boundaries, major roads, and other pertinent information.
An existing Federal credit union may apply to convert to a community charter. Groups currently in the credit union's field of membership, but outside the new community credit union's boundaries, may not be included in the new community charter. Therefore, the credit union must notify groups that will be removed from the field of membership as a result of the conversion. Members of record can continue to be served.
Before approval of an application to convert to a community credit union, NCUA must be satisfied that the credit union will be viable and capable of providing services to its members.
Community credit unions will be expected to regularly review and to follow, to the fullest extent economically possible, the marketing and business plans submitted with their applications. Additionally, NCUA will follow-up with an FCU every year for three years after the FCU has been granted a new or expanded community charter, and at any other intervals NCUA believes appropriate, to determine if the FCU is satisfying the terms of its marketing and business plans.
An FCU failing to satisfy those terms will be subject to supervisory action. As part of this review process, the regional office or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director will report to the NCUA Board instances where an FCU is failing to
satisfy the terms of its marketing and business plan and indicate what supervisory actions the region or ONES intends to take.

# V.A.5—Community Boundaries
The geographic boundaries of a community Federal credit union are the areas defined in its charter. The boundaries can usually be defined using political borders, streets, rivers, railroad tracks, or other static geographical feature.
A community that is a recognized legal entity may be stated in the field of membership— for example, “Gus Township, Texas,” “Isabella City, Georgia,” or “Fairfax County, Virginia.”
A community that is an entire United States Census Bureau designated Core Based Statistical Area or Combined Statistical Area may be stated in the field of membership—for example, “Fort Wayne, IN Metropolitan Statistical Area,” “Albany, GA Metropolitan Statistical Area,” or “Syracuse-Auburn, NY Combined Statistical Area.”

# V.A.6—Special Community Charters
A community field of membership may include persons who work or attend school in a particular industrial park, shopping mall, office building or complex, or similar development. The proposed field of membership must have clearly defined geographic boundaries.

# V.A.7—Ample Community Fields of Membership
A community charter does not have to include all four affinities (
i.e.,
live, work, worship, or attend school in a community). Some examples of community fields of membership are:
• Persons who live, work, worship, or attend school in, and businesses located in the area of Johnson City, Tennessee, bounded by Fern Street on the north, Long Street on the east, Fourth Street on the south, and Elm Avenue on the west;
• Persons who live or work in Green County, Maine;
• Persons who live, worship, work (or regularly conduct business in), or attend school on the University of Dayton campus, in Dayton, Ohio;
• Persons who work for businesses located in Clifton Country Mall, in Clifton Park, New York;
• Persons who live, work, or worship in the Binghamton, New York, Core Based Statistical Area, consisting of Broome and Tioga Counties, New York (a qualifying Core Based Statistical Area in its entirety);
• Persons who live, work, worship, or attend school in the portion of the Oklahoma City, OK Metropolitan Statistical Area that includes Canadian and Oklahoma counties, Oklahoma (two contiguous counties in a portion of a qualifying Core Based Statistical Area that has seven counties in total); or
• Persons who live, work, worship, or attend school in Uinta County or Lincoln County, Wyoming, a rural district.
Some examples of insufficiently defined local communities, neighborhoods, or rural districts are:
• Persons who live or work within and businesses located within a ten-mile radius of Washington, DC (not a permitted community);
• Persons who live or work in the industrial section of New York, New York. (not well- defined nor a permitted community); or
• Persons who live or work in the greater Boston area. (not well-defined).
Some examples of unacceptable local communities, neighborhoods, or rural districts are:
• Persons who live or work in the State of California. (not a permitted community). Persons who live in the first congressional district of Florida. (not a permitted community).

# V.A.8—Community Selection Requirements and Review
The NCUA will not approve an application for a community charter consisting of all or a portion of a CSA or a CBSA, including an initial application, amendment, or expansion, unless the applicant demonstrates in its business and marketing plan that (1) the credit union will serve a community that is contiguous and (2) the credit union will provide financial services to low- and moderate-income and underserved people, and that the credit union has not selected its service area in order to exclude low- and moderate-income and underserved people or to engage in illegal discrimination. Upon receipt of this material, the NCUA will evaluate the business and marketing plan to ensure that low- and moderate-income and underserved people will be served and that the credit union has not selected the service area in order to exclude such people or to engage in illegal discrimination. This requirement is in addition to the requirement to document in the business and marketing plan the realistic assumptions that support the credit union's viability and its plan to serve its entire FOM.
The NCUA may conduct such further inquiry or evaluation as it deems appropriate, as authorized by 12 U.S.C. 1754 and consistent with the principles of this Manual, other federal laws, and public policy. If the NCUA determines that the credit union's submission is inaccurate or unsupported, it may deny that application on those grounds, regardless of whether the application satisfies the other criteria for initial chartering, amendment, or expansion.

# V.B—Field of Membership Amendments
A community credit union may amend its field of membership by adding additional affinities or removing exclusionary clauses. This can be accomplished with a housekeeping amendment.
A community credit union also may expand its geographic boundaries. Persons who live, work, worship, or attend school within the proposed well-defined local community, neighborhood or rural district must have common interests and/or interact. The credit union must follow the requirements of Section V.A.4 and Section V.A.8 of this chapter.
A community credit union that is based on a Single Political Jurisdiction, a Statistical Area (
e.g.,
Core Based Statistical Area or Combined Statistical Area) or a rural district may expand its geographic boundaries to add a bordering area, provided the area is well defined and the credit union demonstrates that persons who live, work, worship, or attend school within the proposed expanded community (
i.e.,
on both sides of the boundary separating the existing community and the bordering area) have common interests and/or interact. Such a credit union applying to expand its geographic boundaries to add a bordering area must follow a streamlined version of the business plan requirements of Section V.A.4 of this chapter and the expanded community would be subject to the corresponding population limit—2.5 million in the case of a Single Political Jurisdiction, or a Statistical Area and 1 million in the case of a rural district. The streamlined business plan requirements for adding a bordering area are:
• Anticipated marginal financial impact on the credit union of adding the proposed bordering area, including the need for additional employees and fixed assets, and the associated costs;
• A description of the current and, if applicable, proposed office/branch structure specific to serving the proposed bordering area;
• A marketing plan addressing how the new community will be served for the 24-month period after the proposed expansion of a community charter, including detailing how the credit union will address the unique needs of any demographic groups in the proposed bordering community not presently served by the credit union and how the credit union will market to any new groups; and
• Details, terms and conditions of any new financial products, programs, and services to be introduced as part of this expansion.

# V.C—NCUA Procedures for Amending the Field of Membership

# V.C.1—General
All requests for approval to amend a community credit union's charter must be submitted to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director. If a decision cannot be made within a reasonable period of time, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will notify the credit union.

# V.C.2—NCUA's Decision
The financial and operational condition of the requesting credit union will be considered in every instance. The economic advisability of expanding the field of membership of a credit union with financial or operational problems must be carefully considered.
In most cases, field of membership amendments will only be approved for credit unions that are operating satisfactorily. Generally, if a federal credit union is having difficulty providing service to its current membership, or is experiencing financial or other operational problems, it may have more difficulty serving an expanded field of membership.
Occasionally, however, an expanded field of membership may provide the basis for reversing current financial problems. In such cases, an amendment to expand the field of membership may be granted notwithstanding the credit union's financial or operational problems. The applicant credit union must clearly establish that the expanded field of membership is in the best interest of the members and will not increase the risk to the NCUSIF.

# V.C.3—NCUA Approval
If the requested amendment is approved by NCUA, the credit union will be issued an amendment to Section 5 of its charter.

# V.C.4—NCUA Disapproval
When NCUA disapproves any application to amend the field of membership, in whole or in part, under this chapter, the applicant will be informed in writing of the:
• Specific reasons for the action;
• If appropriate, options or suggestions that could be considered for gaining approval; and
• Appeal procedures.

# V.C.5—Appeal of Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director Decision
If the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director denies a field of membership expansion request, merger, or spin-off, that decision may be appealed to the NCUA Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart B to part 746 of this chapter.
Before appealing, the credit union may, within 30 days of the denial, provide supplemental information to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director for reconsideration. A request for reconsideration should contain new and material evidence addressing the reasons for the initial
denial or explain extenuating circumstances that precluded the inclusion of existing material evidence or information that should have been filed with the request for reconsideration. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will have 30 days from the date of the receipt of the request for reconsideration to make a final decision. If the request is again denied, the applicant may proceed with the appeal process within 60 days of the date of the last denial. A petitioner may seek a second reconsideration based on new material evidence or information or extenuating circumstances that precluded the inclusion of such information in the previous request.

# V.D—Mergers, Purchase and Assumptions, and Spin-Offs
There are three additional ways a community federal credit union can expand its field of membership:
• By taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a merger;
• By taking in the field of membership through a purchase and assumption (P
A); or
• By taking a portion of another credit union's field of membership through a spin-off.

# V.D.1—Mergers
Generally, the requirements applicable to field of membership expansions apply to mergers where the continuing credit union is a community federal charter.
Where both credit unions are community charters, the continuing credit union must meet the criteria for expanding the community boundaries. A community credit union cannot merge into a single occupational/associational, or multiple common bond credit union, except in an emergency merger. However, a single occupational or associational, or multiple common bond credit union can merge into a community charter as long as the merging credit union has a service facility within the community boundaries or a majority of the merging credit union's field of membership would qualify for membership in the community charter. While a community charter may take in an occupational, associational, or multiple common bond credit union in a merger, it will remain a community charter.
Groups within the merging credit union's field of membership located outside of the community boundaries may not continue to be served. The merging credit union must notify groups that will be removed from the field of membership as a result of the merger. However, the credit union may continue to serve members of record.
Where a state-chartered credit union is merging into a community federal credit union, the continuing federal credit union's field of membership will be worded in accordance with NCUA policy. Any subsequent field of membership expansions must comply with applicable amendment procedures.
Mergers must be approved by the NCUA regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the merging credit union, and, as applicable, the state regulators.

# V.D.2—Emergency Mergers
An emergency merger may be approved by NCUA without regard to common bond or other legal constraints. An emergency merger involves NCUA's direct intervention and approval. The credit union to be merged must either be insolvent or in danger of insolvency, as defined in the Glossary, and NCUA must determine that:
• An emergency requiring expeditious action exists;
• Other alternatives are not reasonably available; and
• The public interest would best be served by approving the merger.
If not corrected, conditions that could lead to insolvency include, but are not limited to:
• Abandonment by management;
• Loss of sponsor;
• Serious and persistent record-keeping problems; or
• Serious and persistent operational concerns.
In an emergency merger situation, NCUA will take an active role in finding a suitable merger partner (continuing credit union). NCUA is primarily concerned that the continuing credit union has the financial strength and management expertise to absorb the troubled credit union without adversely affecting its own financial condition and stability.
As a stipulated condition to an emergency merger, the field of membership of the merging credit union may be transferred intact to the continuing federal credit union without regard to any field of membership restrictions, including the service facility requirement. Under this authority, a federal credit union may take in any dissimilar field of membership.
Even though the merging credit union is a single common bond credit union or multiple common bond credit union or community credit union, the continuing credit union will remain a community charter. Future community expansions will be based on the continuing credit union's original community area.
Emergency mergers involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director or Office of National Examinations
and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the merging credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators.

# V.D.3—Purchase and Assumption (P

# A)
Another alternative for acquiring the field of membership of a failing credit union is through a consolidation known as a P
A. Generally, the requirements applicable to community expansions found in this chapter apply to purchase and assumptions where the purchasing credit union is a federal charter.
A P
A has limited application because, in most instances, the failing credit union must be placed into involuntary liquidation. However, in the few instances where a P
A may occur, the assuming federal credit union, as with emergency mergers, may acquire the entire field of membership if the emergency criteria are satisfied.
In a P
A processed under the emergency criteria, specified loans, shares, and certain other designated assets and liabilities may also be acquired without regard to field of membership restrictions and without changing the character of the continuing federal credit union for purposes of future field of membership amendments.
If the P
A does not meet the emergency criteria, then only members of record can be obtained unless they otherwise qualify for membership in the community charter.
P
As involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the purchased and/or assumed credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators.

# V.D.4—Spin-Offs
A spin-off occurs when, by agreement of the parties, a portion of the field of membership, assets, liabilities, shares, and capital of a credit union are transferred to a new or existing credit union. A spin-off is unique in that usually one credit union has a field of membership expansion and the other loses a portion of its field of membership.
All field of membership requirements apply regardless of whether the spun-off group goes to a new or existing federal charter.
The request for approval of a spin-off must be supported with a plan that addresses, at a minimum:
• Why the spin-off is being requested;
• What part of the field of membership is to be spun off;
• Whether the field of membership requirements are met;
• Which assets, liabilities, shares, and capital are to be transferred;
• The financial impact the spin-off will have on the affected credit unions;
• The ability of the acquiring credit union to effectively serve the new members;
• The proposed spin-off date; and
• Disclosure to the members of the requirements set forth above.
The spin-off request must also include current financial statements from the affected credit unions and the proposed voting ballot.
For federal credit unions spinning off a portion of the community, membership notice and voting requirements and procedures are the same as for mergers (see part 708 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations), except that only the members directly affected by the spin-off—those whose shares are to be transferred—are permitted to vote. Members whose shares are not being transferred will not be afforded the opportunity to vote. All members of the group to be spun off (whether they voted in favor, against, or not at all) will be transferred if the spin-off is approved by the voting membership. Voting requirements for federally insured state credit unions are governed by state law.

# V.E—Overlaps

# V.E.1—General
Generally, an overlap exists when a group of persons is eligible for membership in two or more credit unions. NCUA will permit community credit unions to overlap any other charters without performing an overlap analysis.

# V.E.2—Exclusionary Clauses
An exclusionary clause is a limitation precluding the credit union from serving the primary members of a portion of a group or community otherwise included in its field of membership.
NCUA no longer grants exclusionary clauses. Those granted prior to the adoption of this new Chartering and Field of Membership Manual will remain in effect unless the credit unions agree to remove them or one of the affected credit unions submits a housekeeping amendment to have it removed.

# V.F—Charter Conversions
A community federal credit union may convert to a single occupational or associational, or multiple common bond credit union. The converting credit union must meet all occupational, associational, and multiple common bond requirements, as applicable. The converting credit union may continue to serve members of record of the prior field of membership as of the date of
the conversion, and any groups or communities obtained in an emergency merger or P
A. A change to the credit union's field of membership and designated common bond will be necessary.
A community credit union may convert to serve a new geographical area provided the field of membership requirements of V.A.3 of this chapter are met. Members of record of the original community can continue to be served.

# V.G—Other Persons With a Relationship to the Community
A number of persons who have a close relationship to the community may be included, at the charter applicant's option, in the field of membership. These include the following:
• Spouses of persons who died while within the field of membership of this credit union;
• Employees of this credit union;
• Volunteers in the community;
• Members of the immediate family or household; and
• Organizations of such persons
Immediate family is defined as spouse, child, sibling, parent, grandparent, or grandchild. This includes stepparents, stepchildren, stepsiblings, and adoptive relationships.
Household is defined as persons living in the same residence maintaining a single economic unit.
Membership eligibility is extended only to individuals who are members of an “immediate family or household” of a credit union member. It is not necessary for the primary member to join the credit union in order for the immediate family or household member of the primary member to join, provided the immediate family or household clause is included in the field of membership. However, it is necessary for the immediate family member or household member to first join in order for that person's immediate family member or household member to join the credit union. A credit union can adopt a more restrictive definition of immediate family or household.
Under the Federal Credit Union Act, once a person becomes a member of the credit union, such person may remain a member of the credit union until the person chooses to withdraw or is expelled from the membership of the credit union. This is commonly referred to as “once a member, always a member.” The “once a member, always a member” provision does not prevent a credit union from restricting services to members who are no longer within the field of membership.

# Chapter 3—Low-Income Credit Unions and Credit Unions Serving Underserved Areas

# I—Introduction
One of the primary reasons for the creation of federal credit unions is to make credit available to people of modest means for provident and productive purposes. To help NCUA fulfill this mission, the agency has established special operational policies for federal credit unions that serve low-income groups and underserved areas. The policies provide a greater degree of flexibility that will enhance and invigorate capital infusion into low-income groups, low-income communities, and underserved areas. These unique policies are necessary to provide credit unions serving low-income groups with financial stability and potential for controlled growth and to encourage the formation of new charters as well as the delivery of credit union services in low-income communities.

# II—Low-Income Credit Union

# II.A—Defined
A credit union serving predominantly low-income members may be designated as a low- income credit union. Section 701.34 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations defines the term “low- income members” as those members:
• Who make less than 80 percent of the average for all wage earners as established by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; or
• Whose median family income falls at or below 80 percent of the median family income for the nation as established by the Census Bureau.
The term “low-income members” also includes members who are full-time or part-time students in a college, university, high school, or vocational school.
To obtain a low-income designation from NCUA, an existing credit union must establish that a majority of its members meet the low-income definition. An existing community credit union that serves a geographic area where a majority of residents meet the annual income standard is presumed to be serving predominantly low-income members. A low-income designation for a new credit union charter may be based on a majority of the potential membership.

# II.B—Special Programs
A credit union with a low-income designation has greater flexibility in accepting nonmember deposits insured by the NCUSIF, are exempt from the aggregate loan limit on business loans, and may offer secondary capital accounts to strengthen its capital base. It also may participate in special funding programs such as the Community Development Revolving Loan Program for Credit
Unions (CDRLP) if it is involved in the stimulation of economic development and community revitalization efforts.
The CDRLP provides both loans and grants for technical assistance to low-income credit unions. The requirements for participation in the revolving loan program are in part 705 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations. Only operating credit unions are eligible for participation in this program.

# II.C—Low-Income Documentation
A federal credit union charter applicant or existing credit union wishing to receive a low- income designation should forward a separate request for the designation to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director, along with appropriate documentation supporting the request.
For community charter applicants, the supporting material should include the median family income or annual wage figures for the community to be served. If this information is unavailable, the applicant should identify the individual zip codes or census tracts that comprise the community and NCUA will assist in obtaining the necessary demographic data.
Similarly, if single occupational or associational or multiple common bond charter applicants cannot supply income data on its potential members, they should provide the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director with a list which includes the number of potential members, sorted by their residential zip codes, and NCUA will assist in obtaining the necessary demographic data.
An existing credit union can perform a loan or membership survey to determine if the credit union is primarily serving low-income members.

# II.D—Third-Party Assistance
A low-income federal credit union charter applicant may contract with a third party to assist in the chartering and low-income designation process. If the charter is granted, a low-income credit union may contract with a third party to provide necessary management services. Such contracts should not exceed the duration of one year subject to renewal.

# II.E—Special Rules for Low-Income Federal Credit Unions
In recognition of the unique efforts needed to help make credit union service available to low-income groups, NCUA has adopted special rules that pertain to low-income credit union charters, as well as field of membership additions for low-income credit unions. These special rules provide additional latitude to enable underserved, low-income individuals to gain access to credit union service.
NCUA permits credit union chartering and field of membership amendments based on associational groups formed for the sole purpose of making credit union service available to low- income persons. The association must be defined so that all of its members will meet the low- income definition of Section 701.34 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations. Any multiple common bond credit union can add low-income associations to their fields of membership.
A low-income designated community federal credit union has additional latitude in serving persons who are affiliated with the community. In addition to serving members who live, work, worship, or attend school in the community, a low-income community federal credit union may also serve persons who participate in programs to alleviate poverty or distress, or who participate in associations headquartered in the community.
Examples of a low-income designated community and an associational-based low-income federal credit union are as follows:
• Persons who live in [the target area]; persons who work, worship, attend school, or participate in associations headquartered in [the target area]; persons participating in programs to alleviate poverty or distress which are located in [the target area]; incorporated and unincorporated organizations located in [the target area] or maintaining a facility in [the target area]; and organizations of such persons.
• Members of the Canarsie Economic Assistance League, in Brooklyn, NY, an association whose members all meet the low-income definition of Section 701.34 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations.

# III—Service to Underserved Communities

# III.A—General
A multiple common bond federal credit union may include in its field of membership, without regard to location, an “underserved area” as defined by the Federal Credit Union Act. 12 U.S.C. 1759(c)(2).
The addition of an “underserved area” will not change the charter type of the multiple common bond federal credit union. More than one multiple common-bond federal credit union can serve the same “underserved area,” provided each credit union is approved as provided below.
By adding an “underserved area,” a multiple common bond federal credit union does not become eligible to receive the benefits afforded to low-income designated credit unions, such as expanded use of nonmember deposits and access to the Community Development Revolving Loan Program for Credit Unions.

# III.B—“Underserved Area” Defined
The Federal Credit Union Act defines an “underserved area” as (1) a “local community, neighborhood, or rural district” that (2) meets the definition of an “investment area” under section 103(16) of the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 (“CDFI”), 12 U.S.C. 4702(16), and (3) is “underserved by other depository institutions” based on data of the NCUA Board and the federal banking agencies.

# III.B.1—Local Community
To be eligible for approval as “underserved,” a proposed area must be a well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district as defined in Chapter 2, sections V.A.1. and V.A.2. of this Manual.

# III.B.2—Investment Area
To be approved as an “underserved area,” the proposed area must meet the CDFI definition of an “investment area.”
Id.
§ 4702(16). A proposed area that, at the time the credit union applies, is designated in its entirety as an Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community (
id.
§ 1391) automatically qualifies as an “investment area”; no further criteria of an “investment area” must be met.
Id.
§ 4702(16)(B). A proposed area that is not designated as such must qualify as an “investment area” under “the objective criteria of economic distress” developed by the CDFI Fund (“distress criteria”) based on current decennial U.S. Census data, and also must have “significant unmet needs” for loans and financial services that credit unions are authorized to offer to their members.
Id.
§ 4702(16)(A).

# III.B.2.a—Economic Distress Criteria
Geographic Unit(s) By Proposed Area's Location.
The location of a proposed “underserved area” either within or outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area corresponding to the most recent completed decennial census published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census (“decennial Census”) determines the geographic unit(s) that apply to determine whether the area meets the distress criteria.
Within a Metropolitan Statistical Area.
For a proposed area located, in whole or in part, within a Metropolitan Statistical Area, the permissible geographic units (“Metro units”) for implementing the economic distress criteria are: (i) A census tract; (ii) a block group; and (iii) an American Indian or Alaskan Native area. 12 CFR 1805.201(b)(3)(ii)(B) (2008). For ease of implementation, it is advisable to use a census tract as the proposed area's Metro unit.
Outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area.
For a proposed area that is located entirely outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area, the permissible units (“Non-Metro units”) for implementing the economic distress criteria are: (i) A county or equivalent area; (ii) a minor civil division that is a unit of local government; (iii) an incorporated place; (iv) a census tract; (v) a block numbering area; (vi) a block group; and (vii) an American Indian or Alaskan Native area.
Id.
For ease of implementation, it is advisable to use either a census tract or county, as the case may be, as the proposed area's Non-Metro unit.
Proposed Area Consisting of a Single Metro Unit.
A proposed area consisting of a single whole Metro unit (
e.g.,
a single census tract located within a Metropolitan Statistical Area) must meet one of the following distress criteria, as reported by the most recent decennial Census:
•
Unemployment.
The proposed area's unemployment rate is at least 1.5 times the national average; or
•
Poverty.
At least 20 percent (20%) of the proposed area's population lives in poverty; or
•
Median Family Income.
The proposed area's Median Family Income (“MFI”) is at or below 80 percent (80%) of either the MFI of the corresponding Metropolitan Statistical Area, or of the national MFI for Metro Areas, whichever is greater; or
•
Other Criterion.
Any other economic distress criterion the CDFI Fund may adopt in the future.
Id.
§ 1805.201(b)(3)(ii)(D)(1), (2)(i) and (3) (2008).
Proposed Area Consisting of a Single Non-Metro Unit.
A proposed area consisting of a single whole Non-Metro unit (
e.g.,
a single county located outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area) must meet one of the following distress criteria, as reported by the most recent decennial Census:
•
Unemployment.
The proposed area's unemployment rate is at least 1.5 times the national average; or
•
Poverty.
At least 20 percent (20%) of the proposed area's population lives in poverty; or
•
Median Family Income.
The proposed area's MFI is at or below 80 percent (80%) of either the corresponding state's Non-Metro MFI or the national MFI for Non-Metro Areas, whichever is greater; or
•
Other Criterion.
Any other economic distress criterion the CDFI Fund may adopt in the future.

Id.
§ 1805.201(b)(3)(ii)(D)(1), (2)(ii) and (3) (2008). Alternatively, a proposed area consisting of a single Non-Metro county (located outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area) may instead meet either of the following two criteria, as reported by the decennial Census:
•
County Population Loss.
County's population loss of at least 10 percent (10%) between the most recent and the preceding decennial Census; or
•
County Migration Loss.
County's net migration loss of at least 5 percent (5%) in the 5- year period preceding the most recent decennial Census.
Id.
§ 1805.201(b)(3)(ii)(D)(4)-(5) (2008).
Proposed Area Consisting of Multiple Contiguous Units.
When a proposed area consists of either multiple contiguous Metro units (
e.g.,
a group of adjoining census tracts) or multiple contiguous Non-Metro units (
e.g.,
a group of adjoining counties), a population threshold applies when implementing the economic distress criteria. At least 85 percent (85%) of the area's total population must reside within the units that are “distressed,”
i.e.,
that meet one of the applicable economic distress criteria above, as reported by the decennial Census (Unemployment, Poverty and MFI for census tracts plus, for counties only, Population Loss and Migration Loss); the balance of the area's population may reside in the non-“distressed” tract(s). The population threshold is met, and the whole proposed area qualifies as “distressed,” when the “distressed” units represent at least 85 percent of the area's total population.

# III.B.2.b—Proposed Area's “Significant Unmet Needs”
A proposed area that is “distressed” also must display “significant unmet needs” for loans or for one or more of the financial services credit unions are authorized to offer. To meet this criterion, the credit union must include within its Business Plan a section, one page in length, entitled “Significant Unmet Needs for Credit Union Services” (“SUN section”) that establishes the existence of such unmet needs by identifying the credit and depository needs of the community and detailing how the credit union plans to serve those needs. The credit union may choose which among the following “credit and depository needs” to address in the SUN section: loans, share draft accounts, savings accounts, check cashing, money orders, certified checks, automated teller machines, deposit taking, safe deposit box services, and similar services. The existence of each “credit and depository need” the credit union identifies and plans to serve must be supported by objective reasons and/or accompanying documentation derived from an identified, authoritative source of the credit union's choice. Third-party documentation generally is the most compelling.

# III.B.3—Underserved by Other Depository Institutions
A proposed area that meets the CDFI definition of an “investment area” (
i.e.,
is “distressed” and has “significant unmet needs”) must also be underserved by other insured depository institutions, including credit unions. 12 U.S.C. 1759(c)(2)(A)(ii). This statutory criterion is met when the concentration of depository institution facilities among the population of the proposed area's non-“distressed” tracts—which sets a benchmark level of adequate service—is greater than the concentration of facilities among the population of all of the proposed area's census tracts combined. This establishes the area's concentration of facilities ratio. If there are no non- “distressed” tracts within a proposed area, a non-“distressed” census tract or larger geographic unit (
e.g.,
city or county) of the credit union's choice that adjoins the proposed area may be used to set the benchmark concentration ratio.
Without regard to a proposed area's location within or outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area, this criterion compares two ratios: the ratio of facilities to the population of the non- “distressed” tracts (the benchmark) versus the same facilities-to-population ratio among all the tracts of the proposed area as a whole. If the benchmark ratio is greater than the ratio for the whole area, then the area is “underserved by other depository institutions,” and vice versa.
When, as the result of an initial Concentration of Facilities ratio calculation, a proposed area does not qualify as “underserved by other depository institutions,” NCUA will exclude non- depository banks (
e.g.,
trust companies) and non-community credit unions (
i.e.,
those institutions unable to serve the general public) from the computation. For the purposes of this analysis, a multiple common bond credit union already serving the area as an underserved area is considered able to serve the general public and thus would not be excluded. With both of these exclusions, NCUA will recalculate the concentration of facilities ratio to determine whether, as a result, the proposed area qualifies as “underserved by other depository institutions.”
As one alternative to the concentration of facilities ratio, a proposed area will qualify as “underserved by other depository institutions” if it is designated an “underserved county” by NCUA based on data produced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (available at:
http://www.consumerfinance.gov/guidance/#ruralunderserved
).
NCUA will make its list of “underserved counties” available on its Web site.
As another alternative to the concentration of facilities ratio, a proposed area will qualify as “underserved by other depository institutions” if the credit seeking to serve it, using a metric of its own choosing, provided that it is based on NCUA or other Federal banking agency data, that establishes to NCUA that the proposed area is “underserved by other depository institutions.”

# III.C—NCUA Approval
If NCUA approves the request to add an “underserved area,” the credit union will be
issued an amendment to Section 5 of its charter.

# III.D—Approval to Serve an Already Approved “Underserved Area”
Once a credit union is initially approved to serve an “underserved area,” other credit unions that subsequently apply may be approved to serve the same area. To be approved, the area must qualify as “underserved” at the time the new applicant applies. An applicant must demonstrate that the area continues to be “distressed”, as provided above, only if a new decennial Census has been published since the date the area was last approved. In any case, the applicant must demonstrate that the area still has “significant unmet needs” for loans or credit union services (to qualify as an “investment area”), and remains “underserved by other depository institutions” (to qualify as “underserved”).

# III.E—Business Plan
A federal credit union that desires to include an underserved community in its field of membership must first develop, and submit for approval, a business plan specifying how it will serve the community. In addition, the business plan must include a SUN section as provided in section III.B.2.b. above. The credit union will be expected to regularly review the business plan to determine if the community is being adequately served. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director may require periodic service status reports from a credit union about the “underserved area” to ensure that the needs of the community are being met, and must require such reports before NCUA allows a multiple common bond federal credit union to add an additional “underserved area.”

# III.F—Service Facility
Once an “underserved area” has been added to a federal credit union's field of membership, the credit union must establish within two years, and maintain, an office or service facility in the community. A service facility is defined as a place where shares are accepted for members' accounts, loan applications are accepted and loans are disbursed. By definition, a service facility includes a credit union-owned branch, a shared branch, a mobile branch, an office operated on a regularly scheduled weekly basis, or a credit union-owned electronic facility that meets, at a minimum, the above requirements. A service facility also includes a shared branch or a shared branch network location, including an electronic facility that meets the above requirements, if a credit union participates in a shared branching network.
This definition does not include an ATM or the credit union's internet website.

# IV—Appeal Procedures for Denial of Underserved Area

# IV.A—NCUA Disapproval
When NCUA disapproves any application to add an “underserved area” in whole or in part, under this chapter, the applicant will be informed in writing of the:
• Specific reasons for the action;
• Options to consider, if appropriate, for gaining approval; and
• Appeal procedures.

# IV.B—Appeal of Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director Decision
If the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director denies an “underserved area” request, the Federal credit union may appeal that decision to the NCUA Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart B to part 746 of this chapter.
Before appealing, the credit union may, within 30 days of the denial, provide supplemental information to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director for reconsideration. A request for reconsideration should contain new and material evidence addressing the reasons for the initial denial or explain extenuating circumstances that precluded the inclusion of existing material evidence or information that should have been filed with the request for reconsideration. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will have 30 days from the date of the receipt of the request for reconsideration to make a final decision. If the request is again denied, the applicant may proceed with the appeal process within 60 days of the date of the last denial. A petitioner may seek a second reconsideration based on new material evidence or information or extenuating circumstances that precluded the inclusion of such information in the previous request.

# Chapter 4—Charter Conversions

# I—Introduction
A charter conversion is a change in the jurisdictional authority under which a credit union operates.
Federal credit unions receive their charters from NCUA and are subject to its supervision, examination, and regulation.
State-chartered credit unions are incorporated in a particular state, receiving their charter from the state agency responsible for credit unions and subject to the state's regulator. If the state-chartered credit union's deposits are federally insured, it will also fall under NCUA's jurisdiction.
A federal credit union's power and authority are derived from the Federal Credit Union Act and NCUA Rules and Regulations. State-chartered credit unions are governed by state law and regulation. Certain federal
laws and regulations also apply to federally insured state chartered credit unions.
There are two types of charter conversions: federal charter to state charter and state charter to federal charter. Common bond and community requirements are not an issue from NCUA's standpoint in the case of a federal to state charter conversion. The procedures and forms relevant to both types of charter conversion are included in appendix 4.

# II—Conversion of a State Credit Union to a Federal Credit Union

# II.A—General Requirements
Any state-chartered credit union may apply to convert to a federal credit union. In order to do so it must:
• Comply with state law regarding conversion and file proof of compliance with NCUA;
• File the required conversion application, proposed federal credit union organization certificate, and other documents with NCUA;
• Comply with the requirements of the Federal Credit Union Act,
e.g.,
chartering and reserve requirements; and
• Be granted federal share insurance by NCUA.
Conversions are treated the same as any initial application for a federal charter, including an on-site examination by NCUA where appropriate. NCUA will also consult with the appropriate state authority regarding the credit union's current financial condition, management expertise, and past performance. Since the applicant in a conversion is an ongoing credit union, the economic advisability of granting a charter is more readily determinable than in the case of an initial charter applicant.
A converting state credit union's field of membership must conform to NCUA's chartering policy. The field of membership will be phrased in accordance with NCUA chartering policy. However, if the converting credit union is a multiple group charter and the new federal charter is a multiple group, then the new federal charter may retain in its field of membership any group that the state credit union was serving at the time of conversion. Subsequent changes must conform to NCUA chartering policy in effect at that time.
If the converting credit union is a community charter and the new federal charter is community-based, it must meet the community field of membership requirements set forth in Chapter 2, Section V of this manual. If the state-chartered credit union's community boundary is more expansive than the approved federal boundary, only members of record outside of the new community boundary may continue to be served.
The converting credit union, regardless of charter type, may continue to serve members of record. The converting credit union may retain in its field of membership any group or community added pursuant to state emergency provisions.

# II.B—Submission of Conversion Proposal to NCUA
The following documents must be submitted with the conversion proposal:
• Conversion of State Charter to Federal Charter (NCUA 4000);
• Organization Certificate (NCUA 4008). Only Part (3) and the signature/notary section should be completed and, where applicable, signed by the credit union officials.
• Report of Officials and Agreement to Serve (NCUA 4012);
• The Application to Convert From State Credit Union to Federal Credit Union (NCUA 4401);
• The Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts (NCUA 9500);
• Certification of Resolution (NCUA 9501);
• Written evidence regarding whether the state regulator is in agreement with the conversion proposal; and
• Business plan, as appropriate, including the most current financial report and delinquent loan schedule.
If the state charter is applying to become a federal community charter, it must also comply with the documentation requirements included in Chapter 2, Section V.A.2 of this manual.

# II.C—NCUA Consideration of Application To Convert

# II.C.1—Review by the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director
The application will be reviewed to determine that it is complete and that the proposal is in compliance with Section 125 of the Federal Credit Union Act. This review will include a determination that the state credit union's field of membership is in compliance with NCUA's chartering policies. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director may make further investigation into the proposal and may require the submission of additional information to support the request to convert.

# II.C.2—On-Site Review
NCUA may conduct an on-site examination of the books and records of the credit union. Non-federally insured credit unions will be assessed an insurance application fee.

# II.C.3—Approval by the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director and Conditions to the Approval
The conversion will be approved by the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director if it is in compliance with Section 125 of the Federal Credit Union Act and meets the criteria for federal insurance.
Where applicable, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will specify any special conditions that the credit union must meet in order to convert to a federal charter, including changes to the credit union's field of membership in order to conform to NCUA's chartering policies. Some of these conditions may be set forth in a Letter of Understanding and Agreement (LUA), which requires the signature of the officials and the appropriate NCUA regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director.

# II.C.4—Notification
The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will notify both the credit union and the state regulator of the decision on the conversion.

# II.C.5—NCUA Disapproval
When NCUA disapproves any application to convert to a federal charter, the applicant will be informed in writing of the:
• Specific reasons for the action;
• Options to consider, if appropriate, for gaining approval; and
• Appeal procedures.

# II.C.6—Appeal of the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director Decision
If a conversion to a Federal charter is denied by the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director, the applicant credit union may appeal that decision to the NCUA Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart B to part 746 of this chapter.
Before appealing, the credit union may, within 30 days of the denial, provide supplemental information to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director for reconsideration. A request for reconsideration should contain new and material evidence addressing the reasons for the initial denial or explain extenuating circumstances that precluded the inclusion of existing material evidence or information that should have been filed with the request for reconsideration. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will have 30 days from the date of the receipt of the request for reconsideration to make a final decision. If the request is again denied, the applicant may proceed with the appeal process within 60 days of the date of the last denial. A petitioner may seek a second reconsideration based on new material evidence or information or extenuating circumstances that precluded the inclusion of such information in the previous request.

# II.D—Action by Board of Directors

# II.D.1—General
Upon being informed of the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director's preliminary approval, the board must:
• Comply with all requirements of the state regulator that will enable the credit union to convert to a federal charter and cease being a state credit union;
• Obtain a letter or official statement from the state regulator certifying that the credit union has met all of the state requirements and will cease to be a state credit union upon its receiving a federal charter. A copy of this document must be submitted to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director;
• Obtain a letter from the private share insurer (includes excess share insurers), if applicable, certifying that the credit union has met all withdrawal requirements. A copy of this document must be submitted to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director; and
• Submit a statement of the action taken to comply with any conditions imposed by the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director in the preliminary approval of the conversion proposal and, if applicable, submit the signed LUA.

# II.D.2—Application for a Federal Charter
When the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director has received evidence that the board of directors has satisfactorily completed the actions described above, the Federal charter and new Certificate of Insurance will be issued.
The credit union may then complete the conversion as discussed in the following section. A credit union may request the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director to reconsider a denial of a conversion application and/or appeal a denial to the NCUA Board. For more information, refer to Section II.C.6 of this chapter.

# II.E—Completion of the Conversion

# II.E.1—Effective Date of Conversion
The date on which the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director approves the Organization Certificate and the Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts is the date on which the credit union becomes a federal credit union. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will notify the credit union and the state regulator of the date of the conversion.

# II.E.2—Assumption of Assets and Liabilities
As of the effective date of the conversion, the federal credit union will be the owner of all of the assets and will be responsible for
all of the liabilities and share accounts of the state credit union.

# II.E.3—Board of Directors' Meeting
Upon receipt of its federal charter, the board will hold its first meeting as a federal credit union. At this meeting, the board will transact such business as is necessary to complete the conversion as approved and to operate the credit union in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Credit Union Act and NCUA Rules and Regulations.
As of the commencement of operations, the accounting system, records, and forms must conform to the standards established by NCUA.

# II.E.4—Credit Union's Name
Changing of the credit union's name on all signage, records, accounts, investments, and other documents should be accomplished as soon as possible after conversion. The credit union has 180 days from the effective date of the conversion to change its signage and promotional material. This requires the credit union to discontinue using any remaining stock of “state credit union” stationery immediately, and discontinue using credit cards, ATM cards, etc., within 180 days after the effective date of the conversion, or the reissue date whichever is later. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director has the discretion to extend the timeframe for an additional 180 days. Member share drafts with the state-chartered name can be used by the members until depleted.

# II.E.5—Reports to NCUA
Within 10 business days after commencement of operations, the recently converted federal credit union must submit to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director the following:
• Report of Officials (NCUA 4501); and
• Financial and Statistical Reports, as of the commencement of business of the federal credit union.

# III—Conversion of a Federal Credit Union to a State Credit Union

# III.A—General Requirements
Any federal credit union may apply to convert to a state credit union. In order to do so, it must:
• Notify NCUA prior to commencing the process to convert to a state charter and state the reason(s) for the conversion;
• Comply with the requirements of Section 125 of the Federal Credit Union Act that enable it to convert to a state credit union and to cease being a federal credit union; and
• Comply with applicable state law and the requirements of the state regulator.
It is important that the credit union provide an accurate disclosure of the reasons for the conversion. These reasons should be stated in specific terms, not as generalities. The federal credit union converting to a state charter remains responsible for the entire operating fee for the year in which it converts.

# III.B—Special Provisions Regarding Federal Share Insurance
If the federal credit union intends to continue federal share insurance after the conversion to a state credit union, it must submit an Application for Insurance of Accounts (NCUA 9600) to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director at the time it requests approval of the conversion proposal. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director has the authority to approve or disapprove the application.
If the converting federal credit union does not intend to continue federal share insurance or if its application for continued insurance is denied, insurance will cease in accordance with the provisions of Section 206 of the Federal Credit Union Act.
If, upon its conversion to a state credit union, the federal credit union will be terminating its federal share insurance or converting from federal to non-federal share insurance, it must comply with the membership notice and voting procedures set forth in Section 206 of the Federal Credit Union Act and part 708 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations, and address the criteria set forth in Section 205(c) of the Federal Credit Union Act.
Where the state credit union will be non-federally insured, federal insurance ceases on the effective date of the charter conversion. If it will be otherwise uninsured, then federal insurance will cease one year after the date of conversion subject to the restrictions in Section 206(d)(1) of the Federal Credit Union Act. In either case, the state credit union will be entitled to a refund of the federal credit union's NCUSIF capitalization deposit after the final date on which any of its shares are federally insured.
The NCUA Board reserves the right to delay the refund of the capitalization deposit for up to one year if it determines that payment would jeopardize the NCUSIF.

# III.C—Submission of Conversion Proposal to NCUA
Upon approval of a proposition for conversion by a majority vote of the board of directors at a meeting held in accordance with the federal credit union's bylaws, the conversion proposal will be submitted to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director and will include:
• A current financial report;
• A current delinquent loan schedule;
• An explanation and appropriate documents relative to any changes in insurance of member accounts;
• A resolution of the board of directors;
• A proposed Notice of Special Meeting of the Members (NCUA 4221);
• A copy of the ballot to be sent to all members (NCUA 4506);
• If the credit union intends to continue with federal share insurance, an application for insurance of accounts (NCUA 9600);
• Evidence that the state regulator is in agreement with the conversion proposal; and
• A statement of reasons supporting the request to convert.

# III.D—Approval of Proposal to Convert

# III.D.1—Review by the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director
The proposal will be reviewed to determine that it is complete and is in compliance with Section 125 of the Federal Credit Union Act. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director may make further investigation into the proposal and require the submission of additional information to support the request.

# III.D.2—Conditions to the Approval
The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will specify any special conditions that the credit union must meet in order to proceed with the conversion.

# III.D.3—Approval by the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director
The proposal will be approved by the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director if it is in compliance with Section 125 and, in the case where the state credit union will no longer be federally insured, the notice and voting requirements of Section 206 of the Federal Credit Union Act.

# III.D.4—Notification
The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will notify both the credit union and the state regulator of the decision on the proposal.

# III.D.5—Disapproval
When NCUA disapproves any application to convert to a state charter, the applicant will be informed in writing of the:
• Specific reasons for the action;
• If appropriate, options or suggestions that could be considered for gaining approval; and
• Appeal procedures.

# III.D.6—Appeal of Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director Decision
If the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director denies a conversion to a State charter, the Federal credit union may appeal that decision to the NCUA Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart B to part 746 of this chapter.
Before appealing, the credit union may, within 30 days of the denial, provide supplemental information to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director for reconsideration. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will have 30 business days from the date of the receipt of the request for reconsideration to make a final decision. If the application is again denied, the credit union may proceed with the appeal process to the NCUA Board within 60 days of the date of the last denial by the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director.

# III.E—Approval of Proposal by Members
The members may not vote on the proposal until it is approved by the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director. Once approval of the proposal is received, the following actions will be taken by the board of directors:
• The proposal must be submitted to the members for approval and a date set for a meeting to vote on the proposal. The proposal may be acted on at the annual meeting or at a special meeting for that purpose. The members must also be given the opportunity to vote by written ballot to be filed by the date set for the meeting.
• Members must be given advance notice (NCUA 4221) of the meeting at which the proposal is to be submitted. The notice must:
• Specify the purpose, time and place of the meeting;
• Include a brief, complete, and accurate statement of the reasons for and against the proposed conversion, including any effects it could have upon share holdings, insurance of member accounts, and the policies and practices of the credit union;
• Specify the costs of the conversion,
i.e.,
changing the credit union's name, examination and operating fees, attorney and consulting fees, tax liability, etc.;
• Inform the members that they have the right to vote on the proposal at the meeting, or by written ballot to be filed not later than the date and time announced for the annual meeting, or at the special meeting called for that purpose;
• Be accompanied by a Federal to State Conversion—Ballot for Conversion Proposal (NCUA 4506); and
• State in
bold
face type that the issue will be decided by a majority of members who vote.
• The proposed conversion must be approved by a majority of all of the members who vote on the proposal, a quorum being present, in order for the credit union to proceed further with the proposition, provided federal insurance is maintained. If the proposed state-chartered credit union will not
be federally insured, 20 percent of the total membership must participate in the voting, and of those, a majority must vote in favor of the proposal. Ballots cast by members who did not attend the meeting but who submitted their ballots in accordance with instructions above will be counted with votes cast at the meeting. In order to have a suitable record of the vote, the voting at the meeting should be by written ballot as well.
• The board of directors shall, within 10 days, certify the results of the membership vote to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director. The statement shall be verified by affidavits of the Chief Executive Officer and the Recording Officer on NCUA 4505.

# III.F—Compliance With State Laws
If the proposal for conversion is approved by a majority of all members who voted, the board of directors will:
• Ensure that all requirements of state law and the state regulator have been accommodated;
• Ensure that the state charter or the license has been received within 90 days from the date the members approved the proposal to convert; and
• Ensure that the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director is kept informed as to progress toward conversion and of any material delay or of substantial difficulties which may be encountered.
If the conversion cannot be completed within the 90-day period, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director should be informed of the reasons for the delay. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director may set a new date for the conversion to be completed.

# III.G—Completion of Conversion
In order for the conversion to be completed, the following steps are necessary:
• The board of directors will submit a copy of the state charter to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director within 10 days of its receipt. This will be accompanied by the federal charter and the federal insurance certificate. A copy of the financial reports as of the preceding month-end should be submitted at this time.
• The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will notify the credit union and the state regulator in writing of the receipt of evidence that the credit union has been authorized to operate as a state credit union.
• The credit union shall cease to be a federal credit union as of the effective date of the state charter.
• If the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director finds a material deviation from the provisions that would invalidate any steps taken in the conversion, the credit union and the state regulator shall be promptly notified in writing. This notice may be either before or after the copy of the state charter is filed with the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director. The notice will inform the credit union as to the nature of the adverse findings. The conversion will not be effective and completed until the improper actions and steps have been corrected.
• Upon ceasing to be a federal credit union, the credit union shall no longer be subject to any of the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act, except as may apply if federal share insurance coverage is continued. The successor state credit union shall be immediately vested with all of the assets and shall continue to be responsible for all of the obligations of the federal credit union to the same extent as though the conversion had not taken place. Operation of the credit union from this point will be in accordance with the requirements of state law and the state regulator.
• If the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director is satisfied that the conversion has been accomplished in accordance with the approved proposal, the federal charter will be canceled.
• There is no federal requirement for closing the records of the federal credit union at the time of conversion or for the manner in which the records shall be maintained thereafter. The converting credit union is advised to contact the state regulator for applicable state requirements.
• The credit union shall neither use the words “Federal Credit Union” in its name nor represent itself in any manner as being a federal credit union.
• Changing of the credit union's name on all signage, records, accounts, investments, and other documents should be accomplished as soon as possible after conversion. Unless it violates state law, the credit union has 180 days from the effective date of the conversion to change its signage and promotional material. This requires the credit union to discontinue using any remaining stock of “federal credit union” stationery immediately, and discontinue using credit cards, ATM cards, etc., within 180 days after the effective date of the conversion, or the reissue date, whichever is later. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director has the discretion to extend the timeframe for an additional 180 days. Member share drafts with the federal chartered name can be used by the members until depleted. If the state credit union is not federally insured, it must change its name and must immediately cease using any credit union documents referencing federal insurance.
• If the state credit union is to be federally insured, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will issue a new insurance certificate.

# APPENDIX 1 GLOSSARY
These definitions apply only for use with this Manual. Definitions are not intended to be all inclusive or comprehensive. This Manual, the Federal Credit Union Act, and NCUA Rules and Regulations, as well as state laws, may be used for further reference.
Adequately capitalized
—A credit union is considered “adequately capitalized” when it meets the “adequately capitalized” definition in Part 702 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations. A multiple common bond credit union must be “adequately capitalized” in order to add new groups to its charter. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion director, with input from the appropriate regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director, may determine that a less than “adequately capitalized” credit union can qualify for an expansion if it is making reasonable progress toward becoming “adequately capitalized,” and the addition of the group would not adversely affect the credit union's capitalization level.
Affinity
—A relationship upon which a community charter is based. Acceptable affinities include living, working, worshiping, or attending school in a community.
Appeal

Charters are issued by the National Credit Union Administration for federal credit unions and by the designated state chartering authority for credit unions organized under the laws of that state.
Common bond
—The characteristic or combination of characteristics which distinguishes a particular group of persons from the general public. There are two common bonds which can serve as a basis for a group forming a federal credit union or being included in an existing federal credit union's field of membership: Occupational—employment by the same company, related companies or in a trade, industry, or profession (TIP); and associational—membership in the same association.
Community credit union

Immediate family member
—A spouse, child, sibling, parent, grandparent, or grandchild. This includes stepparents, stepchildren, stepsiblings, and adoptive relationships.
In danger of insolvency
—In making the determination that a particular credit union is in danger of insolvency, NCUA will establish that the credit union falls into one or more of the following categories:
1. The credit union's net worth is declining at a rate that will render it insolvent within 30 months. In projecting future net worth, NCUA may rely on data in addition to Call Report data. The trend must be supported by at least 12 months of historic data.
2. The credit union's net worth is declining at a rate that will take it under two percent (2%) net worth within 18 months. In projecting future net worth, NCUA may rely on data in addition to Call Report data. The
trend must be supported by at least 12 months of historic data.
3. The credit union's net worth, as self-reported on its Call Report, is significantly undercapitalized, and NCUA determines that there is no reasonable prospect of the credit union becoming adequately capitalized in the succeeding 36 months. In making its determination on the prospect of achieving adequate capitalization, NCUA will assume that, if adverse economic conditions are affecting the value of the credit union's assets and liabilities, including property values and loan delinquencies related to unemployment, these adverse conditions will not further deteriorate.

Merger
—Absorption by one credit union of all of the assets, liabilities and equity of another credit union. Mergers must be approved by the National Credit Union Administration and by the appropriate state regulator whenever a state credit union is involved.
Multiple common bond credit union
—A credit union whose field of membership consists of more than one group, each of which has a common bond of occupation or association.
Occupational common bond
—Employment by the same entity or related entities or a Trade, Industry, or Profession.
Once a member, always a member
—A provision of the Federal Credit Union Act which permits an individual to remain a member of the credit union until he or she chooses to withdraw or is expelled from the membership of the credit union. Under this provision, leaving a group that is named in the credit union's charter does not terminate an individual's membership in the credit union.

Overlap
—The situation which results when a group is eligible for membership in more than one credit union.

Service facility
—A place where shares are accepted for members' accounts, loan applications are accepted or loans are disbursed. This definition includes a credit union-owned branch, a mobile branch, an office operated on a regularly scheduled weekly basis, a credit union-owned ATM, or a credit union-owned electronic facility that meets, at a minimum, these requirements. A service facility also includes a shared branch or a shared branch network location, including a shared ATM or other electronic facility, if a credit union participates in a shared branching network. For purposes of serving an underserved area: (1) A service facility is a place where shares are accepted for members' accounts, loan applications are accepted, and loans are disbursed; and (2) a service facility does not include an ATM or shared ATM.
The credit union's internet website is not a service facility.
Single associational common bond credit union
—A credit union whose field of membership includes members and employees of a recognized association.

§ 702.1
Authority, purpose, scope, and other supervisory authority.
(a)
Authority.
Subparts A and B of this part and subpart L of part 747 of this chapter are issued by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) pursuant to sections 120 and 216 of the Federal Credit Union Act (FCUA), 12 U.S.C. 1766 and 1790d (section 1790d), as revised by section 301 of the Credit Union Membership Access Act, Public Law 105-219, 112 Stat. 913 (1998).
(b)
Purpose.
The express purpose of prompt corrective action under section 1790d is to resolve the problems of federally insured credit unions at the least possible long-term loss to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. Subparts A and B of this part carry out the purpose of prompt corrective action by establishing a framework of minimum capital requirements, and mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions applicable according to a credit union's capital classification, designed primarily to restore and improve the capital adequacy of federally insured credit unions.
(c)
Scope.
Subparts A and B of this part implement the provisions of section 1790d as they apply to federally insured credit unions, whether federally- or state-chartered; to such credit unions defined as “new” pursuant to section 1790d(b)(2); and to such credit unions defined as “complex” pursuant to section 1790d(d). Certain of these provisions also apply to officers and directors of federally insured credit unions. Subpart C applies capital planning and stress testing to credit unions defined as covered credit unions under § 702.302. This part does not apply to corporate credit unions. Unless otherwise provided, procedures for issuing, reviewing and enforcing orders and directives issued under this part are set forth in subpart L of part 747 of this chapter.
(d)
Other supervisory authority.
Neither section 1790d nor this part in any way limits the authority of the NCUA Board or appropriate state official under any other provision of law to take additional supervisory actions to address unsafe or unsound practices or conditions, or violations of applicable law or regulations. Action taken under this part may be taken independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition to any other enforcement action available to the NCUA Board or appropriate state official, including issuance of cease and desist orders, orders of prohibition, suspension and removal, or assessment of civil money penalties, or any other actions authorized by law.

A recourse obligation typically arises when a credit union transfers assets in a sale and retains an explicit obligation to repurchase assets or to absorb losses due to a default on the payment of principal or interest or any other deficiency in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party. Recourse may also exist implicitly if the credit union provides credit enhancement beyond any contractual obligation to support assets it has transferred.

§ 702.103
Applicability of risk-based capital measures.
For purposes of § 702.102, a credit union is defined as “complex” and a risk-based capital measure is applicable only if the credit union's quarter-end total assets exceed five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000), as reflected in its most recent Call Report. A complex credit union may calculate its risk-based capital measure either by using the risk-based capital ratio under § 702.104(a) through (c), or, for a qualifying complex credit union opting into the CCULR framework, by using the CCULR framework under § 702.104(d).
[86 FR 72805, Dec. 23, 2021]
§ 702.104
Risk-based capital ratio.
A complex credit union must calculate its risk-based capital measure in accordance with this section. A complex credit union may calculate its risk-based capital measure either by using the risk-based capital ratio under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, or, for a qualifying complex credit union opting into the CCULR framework, by using the CCULR framework under paragraph (d) of this section.
(a)
Calculation of the risk-based capital ratio.
To determine its risk-based capital ratio, a complex credit union must calculate the percentage, rounded to two decimal places, of its risk-based capital ratio numerator as described in paragraph (b) of this section, to its total risk-weighted assets as described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Risk-based capital ratio numerator.
The risk-based capital ratio numerator is the sum of the specific capital elements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, minus the regulatory adjustments in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(1)
Capital elements of the risk-based capital ratio numerator.
The capital elements of the risk-based capital numerator are:
(i) Undivided earnings;
(ii) Appropriation for non-conforming investments;
(iii) Other reserves;
(iv) Equity acquired in merger;
(v) Net income
(vi) ALLL, maintained in accordance with GAAP;
(vii) The outstanding principal amount of Subordinated Debt treated as Regulatory Capital in accordance with § 702.407 and the outstanding principal amount of Grandfathered Secondary Capital treated as Regulatory Capital in accordance with § 702.414; and
(viii) Section 208 assistance included in net worth (as defined in § 702.2).
(2)
Risk-based capital ratio numerator deductions.
The elements deducted from the sum of the capital elements of the risk-based capital ratio numerator are:
(i) NCUSIF Capitalization Deposit;
(ii) Goodwill;
(iii) Other intangible assets;
(iv) Identified losses not reflected in the risk-based capital ratio numerator; and
(v) Mortgage servicing assets that exceed 25 percent of the sum of the capital elements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, less deductions required under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) thorough (iv) of this section.
(c)
Risk-weighted assets

General.
Risk-weighted assets includes risk- weighted on-balance sheet assets as described in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, plus the risk-weighted off-balance sheet assets in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, plus the risk-weighted derivatives in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, less the risk-based capital ratio numerator deductions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If a particular asset, derivative contract, or off balance sheet item has features or characteristics that suggest it could potentially fit into more than one risk weight category, then a credit union shall assign the asset, derivative contract, or off balance sheet item to the risk weight category that most accurately and appropriately reflects its associated credit risk.
(2)
Risk weights for on-balance sheet assets.
The risk categories and weights for assets of a complex credit union are as follows:
(i)
Category 1—zero percent risk weight.
A credit union must assign a zero percent risk weight to:

General.
Notwithstanding the risk weights assigned in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a credit union must assign a 100 percent risk weight to non-significant equity exposures.
(B)
Determination of non-significant equity exposures.
A credit union has non-significant equity exposures if the aggregate amount of its equity exposures does not exceed 10 percent of the sum of the credit union's capital elements of the risk-based capital ratio numerator (as defined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section).

(4)
Risk weights for off-balance sheet items.
The risk weighted amounts for all off-balance sheet items are determined by multiplying the off-balance sheet exposure amount by the appropriate CCF and the assigned risk weight as follows:
(i) For the outstanding balance of loans transferred to a Federal Home Loan Bank under the mortgage partnership finance program, a 20 percent CCF and a 50 percent risk weight.

(A) For commercial loans, a 100 percent risk weight.
(B) For first-lien residential real estate loans, a 50 percent risk weight.
(C) For junior-lien residential real estate loans, a 100 percent risk weight.
(D) For all secured consumer loans, a 75 percent risk weight.
(E) For all unsecured consumer loans, a 100 percent risk weight.
(iii) For unfunded commitments:
(A) For a commitment that is unconditionally cancelable, a 0 percent CCF.
(B) For commercial loans, a 50 percent CCF with a 100 percent risk weight.

(6) Asset Securitizations Issued by Complex Credit Unions. A credit union must follow the requirements of the applicable provisions of 12 CFR 324.41 when it transfers exposures in connection with a securitization. A credit union may only exclude the transferred exposures from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets if each condition in 12 CFR 324.41 is satisfied. A credit union that meets these conditions, but retains any credit risk for the transferred exposures, must hold risk-based capital against the credit risk it retains in connection with the securitization.
(d)
Complex Credit Union Leverage Ratio (CCULR) Framework
—(1)
General.
A qualifying complex credit union that has opted into the CCULR framework under paragraph (d)(5) of this section is considered to have met the capital ratio requirements for the well capitalized capital category under § 702.102(a)(1) if it has a CCULR of 9.0 percent or greater.
(2)
Qualifying Complex Credit Union.
For purposes of this part, a qualifying complex credit union means a complex credit union under § 702.103 that satisfies all of the following criteria:
(i) Has a CCULR of 9.0 percent or greater;
(ii) Has total off-balance sheet exposures of 25 percent or less of its total assets;
(iii) Has the sum of total trading assets and total trading liabilities of 5 percent or less of its total assets; and
(iv) Has the sum of total goodwill and total other intangible assets of 2 percent or less of its total assets.
(3)
Calculation of Qualifying Criteria.
Each of the qualifying criteria in paragraph (d)(2) of this section is calculated based on data reported in the Call Report as of the end of the most recent calendar quarter.
(4)
Calculation of the CCULR.
A qualifying complex credit union opting into the CCULR framework under this paragraph (d) calculates its CCULR in the same manner as its net worth ratio under § 702.2.
(5)
Opting into the CCULR Framework.
(i) A qualifying complex credit union may opt into the CCULR framework by completing the applicable reporting requirements of its Call Report.
(ii) A qualifying complex credit union can opt into the CCULR framework at the end of each calendar quarter.
(6)
Opting Out of the CCULR Framework.
(i) A qualifying complex credit union may voluntarily opt out of the framework at the end of each calendar quarter.
(ii) [Reserved]
(7)
Treatment when ceasing to meet the qualifying complex credit union requirements.
(i) If a qualifying complex credit union that has opted into the CCULR framework ceases to meet the qualifying criteria in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the credit union has two calendar quarters (grace period) either to
satisfy the requirements to be a qualifying complex credit union or to calculate its risk-based capital ratio under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
(ii) The grace period begins at the end of the calendar quarter in which the credit union no longer satisfies the criteria to be a qualifying complex credit union. The grace period ends on the last day of the second consecutive calendar quarter following the beginning of the grace period.
(iii) During the grace period, the credit union continues to be treated as a qualifying complex credit union for the purpose of this part and must continue calculating and reporting its CCULR, unless the qualifying complex credit union has opted out of using the CCULR framework under paragraph (d)(6) of this section. The qualifying complex credit union also continues to be considered to have met the capital ratio requirements for the well capitalized capital category under § 702.102(a)(1). However, if the qualifying complex credit union has a CCULR of less than seven percent, it will not be considered to have met the capital ratio requirements for the well capitalized capital category under § 702.102(a)(1) and its capital classification is determined by its net worth ratio.
(iv) [Reserved]
(v) A qualifying complex credit union that ceases to meet the qualifying criteria in paragraph (d)(2) of this section as a result of a merger or acquisition that is not a supervisory merger or combination has no grace period and must comply with the risk-based capital ratio under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section in the quarter it ceases to be a qualifying complex credit union.
(e)
Reservation of authority.
The NCUA may require a complex credit union that otherwise would meet the definition of a qualifying complex credit union to comply with the risk-based capital ratio under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section if the NCUA determines that the complex credit union's capital requirements under paragraph (d) of this section are not commensurate with its risks. Any credit union required to comply with the risk-based capital ratio under this paragraph (e), would be permitted a minimum of a two-quarter grace period before being subject to risk-based capital requirements.
[80 FR 66706, Oct. 29, 2015, as amended at 86 FR 11073, Feb. 23, 2021; 86 FR 72805, Dec. 23, 2021]
§ 702.105
Derivative contracts.
(a)
OTC interest rate derivative contracts
—(1)
Exposure amount
—(i)
Single OTC interest rate derivative contract.
Except as modified by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the exposure amount for a single OTC interest rate derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying master netting agreement is equal to the sum of the credit union's current credit exposure and potential future credit exposure (PFE) on the OTC interest rate derivative contract.
(A)
Current credit exposure.
The current credit exposure for a single OTC interest rate derivative contract is the greater of the fair value of the OTC interest rate derivative contract or zero.
(B)
PFE.
(
1
) The PFE for a single OTC interest rate derivative contract, including an OTC interest rate derivative contract with a negative fair value, is calculated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the OTC interest rate derivative contract by the appropriate conversion factor in Table 1 of this section.
(
2)
A credit union must use an OTC interest rate derivative contract's effective notional principal amount (that is, the apparent or stated notional principal amount multiplied by any multiplier in the OTC interest rate derivative contract) rather than the apparent or stated notional principal amount in calculating PFE.

Non-interest rate derivative contracts are addressed in paragraph (d) of this section.
(ii)
Multiple OTC interest rate derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement.
Except as modified by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the exposure amount for multiple OTC interest rate derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement is equal to the sum of the net current credit exposure and the adjusted sum of the PFE amounts for all OTC interest rate derivative contracts subject to the qualifying master netting agreement.
(A)
Net current credit exposure.
The net current credit exposure is the greater of the net sum of all positive and negative fair value of the individual OTC interest rate derivative contracts subject to the qualifying master netting agreement or zero.
(B)
Adjusted sum of the PFE amounts (Anet).
The adjusted sum of the PFE amounts is calculated as Anet = (0.4 × Agross) + (0.6 × NGR × Agross), where:
(
1
) Agross equals the gross PFE (that is, the sum of the PFE amounts as determined under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section for each individual derivative contract subject to the qualifying master netting agreement); and
(
2
) Net-to-gross Ratio (NGR) equals the ratio of the net current credit exposure to the gross current credit exposure. In calculating the NGR, the gross current credit exposure equals the sum of the positive current credit exposures (as determined under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section) of all individual derivative contracts subject to the qualifying master netting agreement.
(2)
Recognition of credit risk mitigation of collateralized OTC derivative contracts.
A credit union may recognize credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an OTC derivative contract or multiple OTC derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement (netting set) by following the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Cleared transactions for interest rate derivatives
—(1)
General requirements.
A credit union must use the methodologies described in paragraph (b) of this section to calculate risk-weighted assets for a cleared transaction.
(2)
Risk-weighted assets for cleared transactions.
(i) To determine the risk weighted asset amount for a cleared transaction, a credit union must multiply the trade exposure amount for the cleared transaction, calculated in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, by the risk weight appropriate for the cleared transaction, determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(ii) A credit union's total risk-weighted assets for cleared transactions is the sum of the risk-weighted asset amounts for all its cleared transactions.
(3)
Trade exposure amount.
For a cleared transaction the trade exposure amount equals:
(i) The exposure amount for the derivative contract or netting set of derivative contracts, calculated using the methodology used to calculate exposure amount for OTC interest rate derivative contracts under paragraph (a) of this section; plus
(ii) The fair value of the collateral posted by the credit union and held by the, clearing member, or custodian.
(4)
Cleared transaction risk weights.
A credit union must apply a risk weight of:
(i) Two percent if the collateral posted by the credit union to the DCO or clearing member is subject to an arrangement that prevents any losses to the credit union due to the joint default or a concurrent insolvency, liquidation, or receivership proceeding of the clearing member and any other clearing member clients of the clearing member; and the clearing member credit union has conducted sufficient legal review to conclude with a well-founded basis (and maintains sufficient written documentation of that legal review) that in the event of a legal challenge (including one resulting from an event of default or from liquidation, insolvency, or receivership proceedings) the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the arrangements to be legal, valid, binding and enforceable under the law of the relevant jurisdictions; or
(ii) Four percent if the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i) are not met.
(5)
Recognition of credit risk mitigation of collateralized OTC derivative contracts.
A credit union may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial
collateral that secures a cleared derivative contract by following the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Recognition of credit risk mitigation of collateralized interest rate derivative contracts.
(1) A credit union may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures an OTC interest rate derivative contract or multiple interest rate derivative contracts subject to a qualifying master netting agreement (netting set) or clearing arrangement by using the simple approach in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(2) As an alternative to the simple approach, a credit union may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures such a contract or netting set if the financial collateral is marked-to-fair value on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement by applying a risk weight to the exposure as if it were uncollateralized and adjusting the exposure amount calculated under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section using the collateral approach in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The credit union must substitute the exposure amount calculated under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section in the equation in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(3)
Collateralized transactions
—(i)
General.
A credit union may use the approach in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section to recognize the risk-mitigating effects of financial collateral.
(ii)
Simple collateralized derivatives approach.
To qualify for the simple approach, the financial collateral must meet the following requirements:
(A) The collateral must be subject to a collateral agreement for at least the life of the exposure;
(B) The collateral must be revalued at least every six months; and
(C) The collateral and the exposure must be denominated in the same currency.
(iii)
Risk weight substitution.
(A) A credit union may apply a risk weight to the portion of an exposure that is secured by the fair value of financial collateral (that meets the requirements for the simple collateralized approach of this section) based on the risk weight assigned to the collateral as established under § 702.104(c).
(B) A credit union must apply a risk weight to the unsecured portion of the exposure based on the risk weight applicable to the exposure under this subpart.
(iv)
Exceptions to the 20 percent risk weight floor and other requirements.
Notwithstanding the simple collateralized derivatives approach in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section:
(A) A credit union may assign a zero percent risk weight to an exposure to a derivatives contract that is marked-to-market on a daily basis and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement, to the extent the contract is collateralized by cash on deposit.
(B) A credit union may assign a 10 percent risk weight to an exposure to a derivatives contract that is marked-to-market daily and subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement, to the extent that the contract is collateralized by an exposure that qualifies for a zero percent risk weight under § 702.104(c)(2)(i).
(v) A credit union may assign a zero percent risk weight to the collateralized portion of an exposure where:
(A) The financial collateral is cash on deposit; or
(B) The financial collateral is an exposure that qualifies for a zero percent risk weight under § 702.104(c)(2)(i), and the credit union has discounted the fair value of the collateral by 20 percent.
(4)
Collateral haircut approach.
(i) A credit union may recognize the credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral that secures a collateralized derivative contract by using the standard supervisory haircuts in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(ii) The collateral haircut approach applies to both OTC and cleared interest rate derivatives contracts discussed in this section.
(iii) A credit union must determine the exposure amount for a collateralized derivative contracts by setting the exposure amount equal to the max {0,[(exposure amount − value of collateral) + (sum of current fair value of collateral instruments * market price volatility haircut of the collateral instruments)]}, where:
(A) The value of the exposure equals the exposure amount for OTC interest
rate derivative contracts (or netting set) calculated under paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(B) The value of the exposure equals the exposure amount for cleared interest rate derivative contracts (or netting set) calculated under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(C) The value of the collateral is the sum of cash and all instruments under the transaction (or netting set).
(D) The sum of current fair value of collateral instruments as of the measurement date.
(E) A credit union must use the standard supervisory haircuts for market price volatility in Table 2 to this section.

§ 702.106
Prompt corrective action for adequately capitalized credit unions.
(a)
Earnings retention.
Beginning on the effective date of classification as adequately capitalized or lower, a federally insured credit union must increase the dollar amount of its net worth quarterly either in the current quarter, or on average over the current and three preceding quarters, by an amount equivalent to at least 1/10th percent (0.1%) of its total assets (or more by choice), until it is well capitalized.
(b)
Decrease in retention.
Upon written application received no later than 14 days before the quarter end, the NCUA Board, on a case-by-case basis, may permit a credit union to increase the dollar amount of its net worth by an amount that is less than the amount required under paragraph (a) of this section, to the extent the NCUA Board determines that such lesser amount:
(1)(i) Is necessary to avoid a significant redemption of shares; and
(ii) Would further the purpose of this part.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, from February 28, 2022, until March 31, 2023, for a credit union that is adequately capitalized:
(i) The NCUA Board may issue an administrative order specifying temporary revisions to the earnings retention requirement, to the extent the NCUA Board determines that such lesser amount—
(A) Is necessary to avoid a significant redemption of shares; and
(B) Would further the purpose of this part.
(ii) Despite the issuance of an administrative order under paragraph (b)(2) of the section, the Regional Director may require a credit union to submit an earnings retention waiver under paragraph (b)(1) if the credit union poses an undue risk the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund or exhibits material safety and soundness concerns.
(c)
Decrease by FISCU.
The NCUA Board shall consult and seek to work cooperatively with the appropriate state official before permitting a federally insured state-chartered credit union to decrease its earnings retention under paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Periodic review.
A decision under paragraph (b) of this section to permit a credit union to decrease its earnings retention is subject to quarterly review and revocation except when the credit union is operating under an approved net worth restoration plan that provides for decreasing its earnings retention as provided under paragraph (b) of this section.
[80 FR 66706, Oct. 29, 2015, as amended at 87 FR 10950, Feb. 28, 2022]
§ 702.107
Prompt corrective action for undercapitalized credit unions.
(a)
Mandatory supervisory actions by credit union.
A credit union which is undercapitalized must—
(1)
Earnings retention.
Increase net worth in accordance with § 702.106;
(2)
Submit net worth restoration plan.
Submit a net worth restoration plan pursuant to § 702.111,
provided however,
that a credit union in this category having a net worth ratio of less than five percent (5%) which fails to timely submit such a plan, or which materially fails to implement an approved plan, is classified significantly undercapitalized pursuant to § 702.102(a)(4)(i);
(3)
Restrict increase in assets.
Beginning the effective date of classification as undercapitalized or lower, not permit the credit union's assets to increase beyond its total assets for the preceding quarter unless—
(i)
Plan approved.
The NCUA Board has approved a net worth restoration plan which provides for an increase in total assets and—
(A) The assets of the credit union are increasing consistent with the approved plan; and
(B) The credit union is implementing steps to increase the net worth ratio consistent with the approved plan;
(ii)
Plan not approved.
The NCUA Board has not approved a net worth restoration plan and total assets of the credit union are increasing because of increases since quarter-end in balances of:
(A) Total accounts receivable and accrued income on loans and investments; or
(B) Total cash and cash equivalents; or
(C) Total loans outstanding, not to exceed the sum of total assets plus the quarter-end balance of unused commitments to lend and unused lines of credit provided however that a credit union which increases a balance as permitted under paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(A), (B) or (C) of this section cannot offer rates on shares in excess of prevailing rates on shares in its relevant market area, and cannot open new branches;
(4)
Restrict member business loans.
Beginning the effective date of classification as undercapitalized or lower, not increase the total dollar amount of member business loans (defined as loans outstanding and unused commitments to lend) as of the preceding quarter-end unless it is granted an exception under 12 U.S.C. 1757a(b).
(b)
Second tier discretionary supervisory actions by NCUA.
Subject to the applicable procedures for issuing, reviewing and enforcing directives set forth in subpart L of part 747 of this chapter, the NCUA Board may, by directive, take one or more of the following actions with respect to an undercapitalized credit union having a net worth ratio of less than five percent (5%), or a director, officer or employee of such a credit union, if it determines that those actions are necessary to carry out the purpose of this part:
(1)
Requiring prior approval for acquisitions, branching, new lines of business.
Prohibit a credit union from, directly or indirectly, acquiring any interest in any business entity or financial institution, establishing or acquiring any additional branch office, or engaging in any new line of business, unless the NCUA Board has approved the credit union's net worth restoration plan, the credit union is implementing its plan, and the NCUA Board determines that the proposed action is consistent with and will further the objectives of that plan;
(2)
Restricting transactions with and ownership of a CUSO.
Restrict the credit union's transactions with a CUSO, or require the credit union to reduce or divest its ownership interest in a CUSO;
(3)
Restricting dividends paid.
Restrict the dividend rates the credit union pays on shares to the prevailing rates paid on comparable accounts and maturities in the relevant market area, as determined by the NCUA Board, except that dividend rates already declared on shares acquired before imposing a restriction under this paragraph may not be retroactively restricted;
(4)
Prohibiting or reducing asset growth.
Prohibit any growth in the credit union's assets or in a category of assets, or require the credit union to reduce its assets or a category of assets;
(5)
Alter, reduce or terminate activity.

to alter, reduce, or terminate any activity which poses excessive risk to the credit union;
(6)
Prohibiting nonmember deposits.
Prohibit the credit union from accepting all or certain nonmember deposits;
(7)
Dismissing director or senior executive officer.

§ 702.110
Consultation with state officials on proposed prompt corrective action.
(a)
Consultation on proposed conservatorship or liquidation.
Before placing a federally insured state-chartered credit union into conservatorship (pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1786(h)(1)(F) or (G)) or liquidation (pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1787(a)(3)) as permitted or required under subparts A or B of this part to facilitate prompt corrective action—
(1) The NCUA Board shall seek the views of the appropriate state official (as defined in § 702.2), and give him or her an opportunity to take the proposed action;
(2) The NCUA Board shall, upon timely request of the appropriate state official, promptly provide him or her with a written statement of the reasons for the proposed conservatorship or liquidation, and reasonable time to respond to that statement; and
(3) If the appropriate state official makes a timely written response that disagrees with the proposed conservatorship or liquidation and gives reasons for that disagreement, the NCUA Board shall not place the credit
union into conservatorship or liquidation unless it first considers the views of the appropriate state official and determines that—
(i) The NCUSIF faces a significant risk of loss if the credit union is not placed into conservatorship or liquidation; and
(ii) Conservatorship or liquidation is necessary either to reduce the risk of loss, or to reduce the expected loss, to the NCUSIF with respect to the credit union.
(b)
Nondelegation.
The NCUA Board may not delegate any determination under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(c)
Consultation on proposed discretionary action.
The NCUA Board shall consult and seek to work cooperatively with the appropriate state official before taking any discretionary supervisory action under §§ 702.107(b), 702.108(b), 702.109(b), 702.204(b) and 702.205(b) with respect to a federally insured state-chartered credit union; shall provide prompt notice of its decision to the appropriate state official; and shall allow the appropriate state official to take the proposed action independently or jointly with NCUA.
§ 702.111
Net worth restoration plans (NWRP).
(a)
Schedule for filing
—(1)
Generally.
A credit union shall file a written net worth restoration plan (NWRP) with the appropriate Regional Director and, if state-chartered, the appropriate state official, within 45 calendar days of the effective date of classification as either undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, unless the NCUA Board notifies the credit union in writing that its NWRP is to be filed within a different period.
(2)
Exception.
An otherwise adequately capitalized credit union that is reclassified undercapitalized on safety and soundness grounds under § 702.102(b) is not required to submit a NWRP solely due to the reclassification, unless the NCUA Board notifies the credit union that it must submit an NWRP.
(3)
Filing of additional plan.
Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a credit union that has already submitted and is operating under a NWRP approved under this section is not required to submit an additional NWRP due to a change in net worth category (including by reclassification under § 702.102(b)), unless the NCUA Board notifies the credit union that it must submit a new NWRP. A credit union that is notified to submit a new or revised NWRP shall file the NWRP in writing with the appropriate Regional Director within 30 calendar days of receiving such notice, unless the NCUA Board notifies the credit union in writing that the NWRP is to be filed within a different period.
(4)
Failure to timely file plan.
When a credit union fails to timely file an NWRP pursuant to this paragraph, the NCUA Board shall promptly notify the credit union that it has failed to file an NWRP and that it has 15 calendar days from receipt of that notice within which to file an NWRP.
(b)
Assistance to small credit unions.
Upon timely request by a credit union having total assets of less than $10 million (regardless how long it has been in operation), the NCUA Board shall provide assistance in preparing an NWRP required to be filed under paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
Contents of NWRP.
An NWRP must—
(1) Specify—
(i) A quarterly timetable of steps the credit union will take to increase its net worth ratio, and risk-based capital measure if applicable, so that it becomes adequately capitalized by the end of the term of the NWRP, and to remain so for four (4) consecutive calendar quarters;
(ii) The projected amount of net worth increases in each quarter of the term of the NWRP as required under § 702.106(a), or as permitted under § 702.106(b);
(iii) How the credit union will comply with the mandatory and any discretionary supervisory actions imposed on it by the NCUA Board under this subpart;
(iv) The types and levels of activities in which the credit union will engage; and
(v) If reclassified to a lower category under § 702.102(b), the steps the credit union will take to correct the unsafe or unsound practice(s) or condition(s);
(2) Include pro forma financial statements, including any off-balance sheet items, covering a minimum of the next two years; and
(3) Contain such other information as the NCUA Board has required.
(4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, the Board may permit a credit union that is undercapitalized to submit to the Regional Director a streamlined NWRP attesting that its reduction in capital was caused by share growth and that such share growth is a temporary condition due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A streamlined NWRP plan may be accepted from February 28, 2022, until March 31, 2023.
(d)
Criteria for approval of NWRP.
The NCUA Board shall not accept a NWRP plan unless it—
(1) Complies with paragraph (c) of this section;
(2) Is based on realistic assumptions, and is likely to succeed in restoring the credit union's net worth; and
(3) Would not unreasonably increase the credit union's exposure to risk (including credit risk, interest-rate risk, and other types of risk).
(e)
Consideration of regulatory capital.
To minimize possible long-term losses to the NCUSIF while the credit union takes steps to become adequately capitalized, the NCUA Board shall, in evaluating an NWRP under this section, consider the type and amount of any form of regulatory capital which may become established by NCUA regulation, or authorized by state law and recognized by NCUA, which the credit union holds, but which is not included in its net worth.
(f)
Review of NWRP
—(1)
Notice of decision.
Within 45 calendar days after receiving an NWRP under this part, the NCUA Board shall notify the credit union in writing whether the NWRP has been approved, and shall provide reasons for its decision in the event of disapproval.
(2)
Delayed decision.
If no decision is made within the time prescribed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the NWRP is deemed approved.
(3)
Consultation with state officials.
In the case of an NWRP submitted by a federally insured state-chartered credit union (whether an original, new, additional, revised or amended NWRP), the NCUA Board shall, when evaluating the NWRP, seek and consider the views of the appropriate state official, and provide prompt notice of its decision to the appropriate state official.
(g)
NWRP not approved
—(1)
Submission of revised NWRP.
If an NWRP is rejected by the NCUA Board, the credit union shall submit a revised NWRP within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of disapproval, unless it is notified in writing by the NCUA Board that the revised NWRP is to be filed within a different period.
(2)
Notice of decision on revised NWRP.
Within 30 calendar days after receiving a revised NWRP under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the NCUA Board shall notify the credit union in writing whether the revised NWRP is approved. The Board may extend the time within which notice of its decision shall be provided.
(3)
Disapproval of reclassified credit union's NWRP.
A credit union which has been classified significantly undercapitalized shall remain so classified pending NCUA Board approval of a new or revised NWRP.
(4)
Submission of multiple unapproved NWRPs.
The submission of more than two NWRPs that are not approved is considered an unsafe and unsound condition and may subject the credit union to administrative enforcement actions under section 206 of the FCUA, 12 U.S.C. 1786 and 1790d.
(h)
Amendment of NWRP.
A credit union that is operating under an approved NWRP may, after prior written notice to, and approval by the NCUA Board, amend its NWRP to reflect a change in circumstance. Pending approval of an amended NWRP, the credit union shall implement the NWRP as originally approved.
(i)
Publication.
An NWRP need not be published to be enforceable because publication would be contrary to the public interest.
(j)
Termination of NWRP.
For purposes of this part, an NWRP terminates once the credit union is classified as adequately capitalized and remains so for four consecutive quarters. For example, if a credit union with an active NWRP attains the classification as adequately classified on December 31,
2015 this would be quarter one and the fourth consecutive quarter would end September 30, 2016.
[80 FR 66706, Oct. 29, 2015, as amended at 86 FR 72806, Dec. 23, 2021; 87 FR 10950, Feb. 28, 2022]

Full and fair disclosure implemented.
The financial statements of a credit union shall provide for full and fair disclosure of all assets, liabilities, and members' equity, including such valuation (allowance) accounts as may be necessary to present fairly the financial condition; and all income and expenses necessary to present fairly the statement of income for the reporting period.
(c)

The Statement of Financial Condition, when presented to members, to creditors or to NCUA, shall contain a dual declaration by the treasurer and the chief executive officer, or in the latter's absence, by any other officer designated by the board of directors of the reporting credit union to make such declaration, that the report and related financial statements are true and correct to the best of their knowledge and belief and present fairly the financial condition and the statement of income for the period covered.
(d)
Charges for loan and lease losses.
Full and fair disclosure demands that a credit union properly address charges for loan losses as follows:
(1) Charges for loan and lease losses shall be made timely and in accordance with GAAP;
(2) The ALLL must be maintained in accordance with GAAP; and
(3) At a minimum, adjustments to the ALLL shall be made prior to the distribution or posting of any dividend to the accounts of members.
§ 702.114
Payment of dividends.

# Subpart B—Alternative Prompt Corrective Action for New Credit Unions

# Source:
80 FR 66706, Oct. 29, 2015, unless otherwise noted.
§ 702.201
Scope and definition.
(a)
Scope.
This subpart B applies in lieu of subpart A of this part exclusively to credit unions defined in paragraph (b) of this section as “new” pursuant to section 216(b)(2) of the FCUA, 12 U.S.C. 1790d(b)(2).
(b)
New credit union defined.
A “new” credit union for purposes of this subpart is a credit union that both has been in operation for less than ten (10) years and has total assets of not more than $10 million. Once a credit union reports total assets of more than $10 million on a Call Report, the credit union is no longer new, even if its assets subsequently decline below $10 million.
(c)
Effect of spin-offs.
A credit union formed as the result of a “spin-off” of a group from the field of membership of an existing credit union is deemed to be in operation since the effective date of the spin-off. A credit union whose
total assets decline below $10 million because a group within its field of membership has been spun-off is deemed “new” if it has been in operation less than 10 years.
(d)
Actions to evade prompt corrective action.
If the NCUA Board determines that a credit union was formed, or was reduced in asset size as a result of a spin-off, or was merged, primarily to qualify as “new” under this subpart, the credit union shall be deemed subject to prompt corrective action under subpart A of this part.
§ 702.202
Net worth categories for new credit unions.
(a)
Net worth measures.
For purposes of this part, a new credit union must determine its capital classification quarterly according to its net worth ratio.
(b)
Effective date of net worth classification of new credit union.
For purposes of subpart B of this part, the effective date of a new credit union's classification within a capital category in paragraph (c) of this section shall be determined as provided in § 702.101(c); and written notice of a decline in net worth classification in paragraph (c) of this section shall be given as required by § 702.101(c).
(c)
Net worth categories.
A credit union defined as “new” under this section shall be classified—
(1)
Well capitalized
if it has a net worth ratio of seven percent (7%) or greater;
(2)
Adequately capitalized
if it has a net worth ratio of six percent (6%) or more but less than seven percent (7%);
(3)
Moderately capitalized
if it has a net worth ratio of three and one-half percent (3.5%) or more but less than six percent (6%);
(4)
Marginally capitalized
if it has a net worth ratio of two percent (2%) or more but less than three and one-half percent (3.5%);
(5)
Minimally capitalized
if it has a net worth ratio of zero percent (0%) or greater but less than two percent (2%); and
(6)
Uncapitalized
if it has a net worth ratio of less than zero percent (0%).
Table 1 to § 702.202—Capital Categories for New Credit Unions
A new credit union's capital classification is
If it's net worth ratio is
Well Capitalized
7% or above.
Adequately Capitalized
6 to 7%.
Moderately Capitalized
3.5% to 5.99%.
Marginally Capitalized
2% to 3.49%.
Minimally Capitalized
0% to 1.99%.
Uncapitalized
Less than 0%.
(d)
Reclassification based on supervisory criteria other than net worth.
Subject to § 702.102(b), the NCUA Board may reclassify a well capitalized, adequately capitalized or moderately capitalized new credit union to the next lower capital category (each of such actions is hereinafter referred to generally as “reclassification”) in either of the circumstances prescribed in § 702.102(b).
(e)
Consultation with state officials.
The NCUA Board shall consult and seek to work cooperatively with the appropriate state official before reclassifying a federally insured state-chartered credit union under paragraph (d) of this section, and shall promptly notify the appropriate state official of its decision to reclassify.
§ 702.203
Prompt corrective action for adequately capitalized new credit unions.
Beginning on the effective date of classification, an adequately capitalized new credit union must increase the dollar amount of its net worth by the amount reflected in its approved initial or revised business plan in accordance with § 702.204(a)(2), or in the absence of such a plan, in accordance with § 702.106 until it is well capitalized.
§ 702.204
Prompt corrective action for moderately capitalized, marginally capitalized, or minimally capitalized new credit unions.
(a)
Mandatory supervisory actions by new credit union.
Beginning on the date of classification as moderately capitalized, marginally capitalized or minimally capitalized (including by reclassification under § 702.202(d)), a new credit union must—

Schedule for filing
—(1)
Generally.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a new credit union classified moderately capitalized or lower must file a written revised business plan (RBP) with the appropriate Regional Director and, if state-chartered, with the appropriate state official, within 30 calendar days of either:
(i) The last of the calendar month following the end of the calendar quarter that the credit union's net worth ratio has not increased consistent with the-present approved business plan;
(ii) The effective date of classification as less than adequately capitalized if the credit union has no then-present approved business plan; or
(iii) The effective date of classification as less than adequately capitalized if the credit union has increased the total amount of member business loans in violation of § 702.204(a)(3).
(2)
Exception.
The NCUA Board may notify the credit union in writing that its RBP is to be filed within a different period or that it is not necessary to file an RBP.
(3)
Failure to timely file plan.
When a new credit union fails to file an RBP as provided under paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the NCUA Board shall promptly notify the credit union that it has failed to file an RBP and that it has 15 calendar days from receipt of that notice within which to do so.
(b)
Contents of revised business plan.
A new credit union's RBP must, at a minimum—
(1) Address changes, since the new credit union's current business plan was approved, in any of the business plan elements required for charter approval under chapter 1, section IV.D. of appendix B to part 701 of this chapter, or for state-chartered credit unions under applicable state law;
(2) Establish a timetable of quarterly targets for net worth during each year in which the RBP is in effect so that the credit union becomes adequately capitalized by the time it no longer qualifies as “new” per § 702.201;
(3) Specify the projected amount of earnings of net worth increases as provided under § 702.204(a)(1) or 702.205(a)(1);
(4) Explain how the new credit union will comply with the mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions imposed on it by the NCUA Board under this subpart;
(5) Specify the types and levels of activities in which the new credit union will engage;
(6) In the case of a new credit union reclassified to a lower category under § 702.202(d), specify the steps the credit union will take to correct the unsafe or unsound condition or practice; and
(7) Include such other information as the NCUA Board may require.
(c)
Criteria for approval.
The NCUA Board shall not approve a new credit union's RBP unless it—
(1) Addresses the items enumerated in paragraph (b) of this section;
(2) Is based on realistic assumptions, and is likely to succeed in building the credit union's net worth; and
(3) Would not unreasonably increase the credit union's exposure to risk (including credit risk, interest-rate risk, and other types of risk).
(d)
Review of revised business plan
—(1)
Notice of decision.
Within 30 calendar days after receiving an RBP under this section, the NCUA Board shall notify the credit union in writing whether its RBP is approved, and shall provide reasons for its decision in the event of disapproval. The NCUA Board may extend
the time within which notice of its decision shall be provided.
(2)
Delayed decision.
If no decision is made within the time prescribed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the RBP is deemed approved.
(3)
Consultation with state officials.
When evaluating an RBP submitted by a federally insured state-chartered new credit union (whether an original, new or additional RBP), the NCUA Board shall seek and consider the views of the appropriate state official, and provide prompt notice of its decision to the appropriate state official.
(e)
Plan not approved
—(1)
Submission of new revised plan.
If an RBP is rejected by the NCUA Board, the new credit union shall submit a new RBP within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of disapproval of its initial RBP, unless it is notified in writing by the NCUA Board that the new RBP is to be filed within a different period.
(2)
Notice of decision on revised plan.
Within 30 calendar days after receiving an RBP under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the NCUA Board shall notify the credit union in writing whether the new RBP is approved. The Board may extend the time within which notice of its decision shall be provided.
(3)
Submission of multiple unapproved RBPs.
The submission of more than two RBPs that are not approved is considered an unsafe and unsound condition and may subject the credit union to administrative enforcement action pursuant to section 206 of the FCUA, 12 U.S.C. 1786 and 1790d.
(f)
Amendment of plan.
A credit union that has filed an approved RBP may, after prior written notice to and approval by the NCUA Board, amend it to reflect a change in circumstance. Pending approval of an amended RBP, the new credit union shall implement its existing RBP as originally approved.
(g)
Publication.
An RBP need not be published to be enforceable because publication would be contrary to the public interest.

§ 702.304
Capital planning.
(a)
Annual capital planning.
(1) A covered credit union must develop and maintain a capital plan. Tier I and tier II credit unions must complete this plan and their capital policy by December 31 each year, but are not required to submit this plan to the NCUA.

(ii) A detailed description of the credit union's process for assessing capital adequacy;
(2) A discussion of how the credit union will, under expected and unfavorable conditions, maintain stress test capital commensurate with all of its risks, including reputational, strategic, legal, and compliance risks;
(3) A discussion of how the credit union will, under expected and unfavorable conditions, maintain ready access to funding, meet its obligations to all creditors and other counterparties, and continue to serve as an intermediary for its members;
(4) A discussion of any expected changes to the credit union's business plan that are likely to have a material impact on the credit union's capital adequacy and liquidity; and
(5) A program to:
(i) Conduct sensitivity testing to analyze the effect on the credit union's stress test capital of changes in variables, parameters, and inputs used by the credit union in preparing its capital plan;
(ii) Conduct reverse stress testing to identify events and circumstances that cause severely unfavorable outcomes for the credit union; and
(iii) Analyze the impact of credit risk and interest rate risk to capital under unfavorable economic conditions, both separately and in combination with each other.

# Editorial Note:
At 84 FR 1606, Feb. 5, 2019, § 702.504 (prior to redesignation as § 702.304) was amended in paragraph (b)(4) by revising the citation “§ 702.306(c)” to read “§ 702.506(c)”; however, that citation did not exist in the section and the amendment could not be incorporated due to inaccurate amendatory instruction.
§ 702.305
NCUA action on capital plans.
(a)
Timing
—(1)
Tier I
tier II credit unions.
NCUA will address any deficiencies in the capital plans submitted by tier I and tier II credit unions through the supervisory process.
(2)
Tier III credit unions.
NCUA will notify tier III credit unions of the acceptance or rejection of their capital
plans by August 31 of the year in which their plan is submitted.
(b)
Grounds for rejection of capital plan.
NCUA may reject a capital plan if it determines that:
(1) The covered credit union has material unresolved supervisory issues associated with its capital planning process;
(2) The capital analysis underlying the covered credit union's capital plan, or the covered credit union's methodologies for reviewing the robustness of its capital adequacy, are not reasonable or appropriate;
(3) Data utilized for the capital analysis is insufficiently detailed to capture the risks of the covered credit union, or the data lacks integrity;
(4) The plan does not meet all of the requirements of § 702.304;
(5) Unacceptable weakness in the capital plan or policy, the capital planning analysis, or any critical system or process supporting capital analysis;
(6) The covered credit union's capital planning process constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, NCUA order, directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, NCUA. In determining whether a capital plan would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice, NCUA considers whether the covered credit union is and would remain in sound financial condition after giving effect to the capital plan.
(c)
Notification in writing.
NCUA will notify the credit union in writing of the reasons for a decision to reject a capital plan.
(d)
Resubmission of a capital plan.
If NCUA rejects a tier III credit union's capital plan, the credit union must update and resubmit an acceptable capital plan to NCUA by November 30 of the year in which the credit union submitted its plan. The resubmitted capital plan must, at a minimum, address:
(1) NCUA-noted deficiencies in the credit union's original capital plan or policy; and
(2) Remediation plans for unresolved supervisory issues contributing to the rejection of the credit union's original capital plan.
(e)
Supervisory actions.
Any tier III credit union operating without a capital plan accepted by NCUA may be subject to supervisory actions on the part of NCUA.
(f)
Consultation on proposed action.
Before taking any action under this section on the capital plan of a federally insured, state-chartered credit union, NCUA will consult and work cooperatively with the appropriate State official.

§ 702.306
Annual supervisory stress testing.
(a)
General requirements.
Only tier II and tier III credit unions are required to conduct supervisory stress tests. The supervisory stress tests consist of a baseline scenario, and stress scenarios, which NCUA will provide by February 28 of each year. The tests will be based on the credit union's financial data as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or such other date as directed by NCUA. The tests will take into account all relevant exposures and activities of the credit union to evaluate its ability to absorb losses in specified scenarios over a planning horizon.
(b)
Credit union-run supervisory stress tests
—(1)
General.
All supervisory stress tests must be conducted according to NCUA's instructions.
(2)
Tier III credit unions.
When conducting its stress test, a tier III credit union must apply the minimum stress test capital ratio to all time periods in the planning horizon. The minimum stress test capital ratio is 5 percent.
(3)
NCUA tests.
NCUA reserves the right to conduct the tests described in this section on any covered credit union at any time. Where both NCUA and a covered credit union have conducted the tests, the results of NCUA's tests will determine whether the covered credit union has met the requirements of this subpart.
(c)
Potential impact on capital.
In conducting stress tests under this subpart, the credit union, or the NCUA if it elects to conduct the stress test under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, will estimate the following for each scenario during each quarter of the planning horizon:
(1) Losses, pre-provision net revenues, loan and lease loss provisions, and net income; and
(2) The potential impact on the stress test capital ratio, incorporating the effects of any capital action over the planning horizon and maintenance of an allowance for loan losses appropriate for credit exposures throughout the horizon. The credit union, or the NCUA if it elects to conduct the stress test under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, will conduct the stress tests without assuming any risk mitigation actions on the part of the credit union, except those existing and identified as part of the credit union's balance sheet, or off-balance sheet positions, such as derivative positions, on the date of the stress test.
(d)
Information collection.
Upon request, the covered credit union must provide NCUA with any relevant qualitative or quantitative information requested by NCUA pertinent to the capital plans or stress tests under this part.
(e)
Stress test results.
A credit union required to conduct stress tests under this section must incorporate the results of its tests in its capital plan. A credit union required to conduct stress tests must submit its stress test results to NCUA by May 31 of each year.
(f)
Supervisory actions.
(1) If a credit union-run stress test shows a tier III credit union does not have the ability to maintain a stress test capital ratio of 5 percent or more under expected and stressed conditions in each quarter of the planning horizon, the credit union must incorporate, into its capital plan, a stress test capital enhancement plan that shows how it will meet that target.
(2) If an NCUA-run stress test shows that a tier III credit union does not have the ability to maintain a stress test capital ratio of 5 percent or more under expected and stressed conditions in each quarter of the planning horizon, the credit union must provide NCUA, by November 30 of the calendar year in which NCUA conducted the tests, a stress test capital enhancement plan showing how it will meet that target.
(3) A tier III credit union operating without an NCUA approved stress test capital enhancement plan required under this section may be subject to supervisory actions.
(g)
Consultation on proposed action.
Before taking any action under this section against a federally insured, state-chartered credit union, NCUA will consult and work cooperatively with the appropriate State official.

# Subpart D—Subordinated Debt, Grandfathered Secondary Capital, and Regulatory Capital

# Source:
86 FR 11074, Feb. 23, 2021, unless otherwise noted.
§ 702.401
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Subordinated Debt.
This subpart sets forth the requirements applicable to all Subordinated Debt issued by a federally insured, natural person credit union, including the NCUA's review and approval of that credit union's application to issue or prepay Subordinated Debt. This subpart shall apply to a federally insured, state-chartered credit union only to the extent that such federally insured, state-chartered credit union is permitted by applicable state law to issue debt instruments of the type described in this subpart. To the extent that such state law is more restrictive than this subpart with respect to the issuance of such debt instruments, that state law shall apply. Except as provided in the next sentence, any secondary capital, as that term is used in the Federal Credit Union Act, issued after January 1, 2022, is Subordinated Debt and subject to the requirements of this subpart. Issuances of secondary capital, as that term is used in the Federal Credit Union Act, to the U.S. Government or any of its subdivisions, under applications approved before January 1, 2022, pursuant to § 701.34 or § 741.204(c) of this chapter, are not subject to the requirements applicable to Subordinated Debt, discussed elsewhere in this subpart, irrespective of the date of issuance.
(b)
Grandfathered Secondary Capital.
Any secondary capital defined as “Grandfathered Secondary Capital”
under § 702.402, is governed by § 702.414. Grandfathered Secondary Capital will no longer be treated as Regulatory Capital as of the later of 30 years from the date of issuance or January 1, 2052.

§ 702.403
Eligibility.
(a) Subject to receiving approval under § 702.408 or § 702.409, a credit union may issue Subordinated Debt only if, at the time of such issuance, the credit union is:
(1) A complex credit union with a capital classification of at least “undercapitalized,” as defined in § 702.102;
(2) A LICU;

(4) A new credit union with Retained Earnings equal to or greater than one percent (1%) of assets.
(b) At the time of issuance of any Subordinated Debt, an Issuing Credit Union may not have any investments, direct or indirect, in Subordinated Debt or Grandfathered Secondary Capital (or any interest therein) of another credit union. If a credit union acquires Subordinated Debt or Grandfathered Secondary Capital in a merger or other consolidation, the Issuing Credit Union may still issue Subordinated Debt, but it may not invest (directly or indirectly) in the Subordinated Debt or Grandfathered Secondary Capital of any other credit union while any Subordinated Debt Notes issued by the Issuing Credit Union remain outstanding.
(c) If the Issuing Credit Union is a complex credit union that is not also a LICU, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Subordinated Debt issued by that Issuing Credit Union may not exceed 100 percent of its net worth, as determined at the time of each issuance of Subordinated Debt.
§ 702.404

(6) Be applied by the Issuing Credit Union at the end of each of its fiscal years (or more frequently as determined by the Issuing Credit Union) in which the Subordinated Debt remains outstanding to cover any deficit in Retained Earnings on a pro rata basis among all holders of the Subordinated Debt and Grandfathered Secondary Capital of the Issuing Credit Union; it being understood that any amounts applied to cover a deficit in Retained Earnings shall no longer be considered due and payable to the holder(s) of the Subordinated Debt or Grandfathered Secondary Capital;
(7) Except as provided in §§ 702.411 and 702.412(c), be payable in full by the Issuing Credit Union or its successor or assignee only at maturity;

(2) Include any express or implied terms that make it senior to any other Subordinated Debt issued under this subpart or Grandfathered Secondary Capital;
(3) Cause the Issuing Credit Union to exceed the borrowing limit in § 741.2 of this chapter or, for federally insured, state-chartered credit unions, any more restrictive state borrowing limit;
(4) Provide the holder thereof with any management or voting rights in the Issuing Credit Union;
(5) Be eligible to be pledged or provided by the investor as security for a loan from, or other obligation owing to, the Issuing Credit Union;
(6) Include any express or implied term, condition, or agreement that would require the Issuing Credit Union to prepay or accelerate payment of principal of or interest on the Subordinated Debt prior to maturity, including investor put options;
(7) Include an express or implied term, condition, or agreement that would trigger an event of default based on the Issuing Credit Union's default on other debts;

(9) Require the Issuing Credit Union to make any form of payment other than in cash.
(c)
Negative covenants.
A Subordinated Debt Note must not include any provision or covenant that unduly restricts or otherwise acts to unduly
limit the authority of the Issuing Credit Union or interferes with the NCUA's supervision of the Issuing Credit Union. This includes, but is not limited to, a provision or covenant that:
(1) Requires the Issuing Credit Union to maintain a minimum amount of Retained Earnings or other metric, such as a minimum net worth ratio or minimum asset, liquidity, or loan ratios;

(ii) At the time of such change, is not in material default of any provision of the Subordinated Debt Note, after giving effect to the applicable cure period described in paragraph (d) of this section; and
(5) Provides for default of the Subordinated Debt as the result of an act or omission of any third party, including but not limited to a credit union service organization, as defined in § 712.1(d) of this chapter.
(d)
Default covenants.
A Subordinated Debt Note that includes default covenants must provide the Issuing Credit Union with a reasonable cure period of not less than 30 calendar days.
(e)
Minimum denominations of issuances to Natural Person Accredited Investors.
An Issuing Credit Union may only issue Subordinated Debt Notes to Natural Person Accredited Investors in minimum denominations of $100,000, and cannot exchange any such Subordinated Debt Notes after the initial issuance or any subsequent resale for Subordinated Debt Notes of the Issuing Credit Union in denominations less than $10,000. Each such Subordinated Debt Note, if issued in certificate form, must include a legend disclosing that it cannot be exchanged for Subordinated Debt Notes of the Issuing Credit Union in denominations less than $100,000, and Subordinated Debt Notes issued in book-entry or other uncertificated form shall include appropriate instructions prohibiting the exchange of such Subordinated Debt Notes for Subordinated Debt Notes of the Issuing Credit Union in denominations that would violate the foregoing restrictions.

(ii) Beginning 60 days after the effective date of an Issuing Credit Union being classified as “critically undercapitalized” or, in the case of a new credit union, “uncapitalized,” the Issuing Credit Union shall not pay principal of or interest on its Subordinated Debt, until reauthorized to do so by the NCUA; provided, however, that unpaid interest shall continue to accrue under the terms of the Subordinated Debt Note, to the extent permitted by law; and
(3) The risk factors associated with the NCUA's or, if applicable, the state supervisory authority's, authority to conserve or liquidate a credit union under the Federal Credit Union Act (FCU Act) or applicable state law.

(2) Provided the Issuing Credit Union filing the document has complied with all requirements regarding the filing in this section, the date of filing of the document is the date the NCUA receives the filing. An electronic filing that is submitted on a business day by direct transmission commencing on or before 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings Time, whichever is then currently in effect, would be deemed received by the NCUA on the same business day. An electronic filing that is submitted by direct transmission commencing after 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings Time, whichever is then currently in effect, or on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, would be deemed received by the NCUA on the next business day. If an electronic filer in good faith attempts to file a document with the NCUA in a timely manner, but the filing is delayed due to technical difficulties beyond the electronic filer's control, the electronic filer may request that the NCUA adjust the filing date of such document. The NCUA may grant the request if it appears that such adjustment is appropriate and consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
(3) If an Issuing Credit Union experiences unanticipated technical difficulties preventing the timely preparation and submission of an electronic filing, the Issuing Credit Union may, upon notice to the Appropriate Supervision Office, file the subject filing in paper format no later than one business day after the date on which the filing was to be made.

Nor does this section waive, limit, or otherwise affect the authority, rights, or powers of the NCUA or the NCUA Board in any capacity to take any action or to exercise any power not specifically mentioned, including but not limited to any rights, powers, or remedies of the NCUA Board as conservator or liquidating agent (or its lawfully appointed designee) regarding transfers or other conveyances taken in contemplation of the Issuing Credit Union's insolvency or with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud the Issuing Credit Union or the creditors of such Issuing Credit Union, or that is fraudulent under applicable law.
§ 702.414
Regulations governing Grandfathered Secondary Capital.
This section recodifies the requirements from 12 CFR 701.34(b), (c), and (d) that were in effect as of December 31, 2021, with minor modifications. The terminology used in this section is specific to this section. Except as provided in the next sentence, all secondary capital issued under § 701.34 of this chapter before January 1, 2022, or, in the case of a federally insured, state-chartered credit union, § 741.204(c) of this chapter, that is referred to elsewhere in this subpart as “Grandfathered Secondary Capital,” is subject to the requirements set forth in this section. Issuances of secondary capital to the
U.S. Government or any of its subdivisions, under applications approved before January 1, 2022, pursuant to § 701.34 or § 741.204(c) of this chapter, are also considered “Grandfathered Secondary Capital” irrespective of the date of issuance.
(a) Secondary capital is subject to the following conditions:
(1)
Secondary capital plan.
A credit union that has Grandfathered Secondary Capital under this section must have a written, NCUA-approved “Secondary Capital Plan” that, at a minimum:
(i) States the maximum aggregate amount of uninsured secondary capital the LICU plans to accept;
(ii) Identifies the purpose for which the aggregate secondary capital will be used, and how it will be repaid;
(iii) Explains how the LICU will provide for liquidity to repay secondary capital upon maturity of the accounts;
(iv) Demonstrates that the planned uses of secondary capital conform to the LICU's strategic plan, business plan, and budget; and
(v) Includes supporting pro forma financial statements, including any off-balance sheet items, covering a minimum of the next two years.
(2)
Issuances not completed before January 1, 2022.
Except as provided in the next sentence, any issuances of secondary capital not completed by January 1, 2022, are, as of January 1, 2022, subject to the requirements applicable to Subordinated Debt discussed elsewhere in this subpart. Issuances of secondary capital to the U.S. Government or any of its subdivisions, under applications approved before January 1, 2022, pursuant to § 701.34 or § 741.204(c) of this chapter, are not subject to the requirements applicable to Subordinated Debt, discussed elsewhere in this subpart, irrespective of the date of issuance.
(3)
Nonshare account.
The secondary capital account is established as an uninsured secondary capital account or other form of non-share account.
(4)
Minimum maturity.
The maturity of the secondary capital account is a minimum of five years.
(5)
Uninsured account.
The secondary capital account is not insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund or any governmental or private entity.
(6)
Subordination of claim.
The secondary capital account investor's claim against the LICU is subordinate to all other claims including those of shareholders, creditors and the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.
(7)
Availability to cover losses.
Funds deposited into a secondary capital account, including interest accrued and paid into the secondary capital account, are available to cover operating losses realized by the LICU that exceed its net available reserves (exclusive of secondary capital and allowance accounts for loan and lease losses), and to the extent funds are so used, the LICU must not restore or replenish the account under any circumstances. The LICU may, in lieu of paying interest into the secondary capital account, pay accrued interest directly to the investor or into a separate account from which the secondary capital investor may make withdrawals. Losses must be distributed pro-rata among all secondary capital accounts held by the LICU at the time the losses are realized. In instances where a LICU accepted secondary capital from the United States Government or any of its subdivisions under the Community Development Capital Initiative of 2010 (“CDCI secondary capital”) and matching funds were required under the Initiative and are on deposit in the form of secondary capital at the time a loss is realized, a LICU must apply either of the following pro-rata loss distribution procedures to its secondary capital accounts with respect to the loss:
(i) If not inconsistent with any agreements governing other secondary capital on deposit at the time a loss is realized, the CDCI secondary capital may be excluded from the calculation of the pro-rata loss distribution until all of its matching secondary capital has been depleted, thereby causing the CDCI secondary capital to be held as senior to all other secondary capital until its matching secondary capital is exhausted. The CDCI secondary capital should be included in the calculation of the pro-rata loss distribution and is available to cover the loss only after
all of its matching secondary capital has been depleted.
(ii) Regardless of any agreements applicable to other secondary capital, the CDCI secondary capital and its matching secondary capital may be considered a single account for purposes of determining a pro-rata share of the loss and the amount determined as the pro-rata share for the combined account must first be applied to the matching secondary capital account, thereby causing the CDCI secondary capital to be held as senior to its matching secondary capital. The CDCI secondary capital is available to cover the loss only after all of its matching secondary capital has been depleted.
(8)
Security.
The secondary capital account may not be pledged or provided by the account investor as security on a loan or other obligation with the LICU or any other party.
(9)
Merger or dissolution.
In the event of merger or other voluntary dissolution of the LICU, other than merger into another LICU, the secondary capital accounts will be closed and paid out to the account investor to the extent they are not needed to cover losses at the time of merger or dissolution.
(10)
Contract agreement.
A secondary capital account contract agreement must have been executed by an authorized representative of the account investor and of the LICU reflecting the terms and conditions mandated by this section and any other terms and conditions not inconsistent with this section.
(11)
Disclosure and acknowledgement.
An authorized representative of the LICU and of the secondary capital account investor each must have executed a “Disclosure and Acknowledgment” as set forth in the appendix to this subpart at the time of entering into the account agreement. The LICU must retain an original of the account agreement and the “Disclosure and Acknowledgment” for the term of the agreement, and a copy must be provided to the account investor.
(12)
Prompt corrective action.
As provided in this part, the NCUA may prohibit a LICU as classified “critically undercapitalized” or, if “new,” as “moderately capitalized”, “marginally capitalized”, “minimally capitalized” or “uncapitalized,” as the case may be, from paying principal, dividends, or interest on its uninsured secondary capital accounts established after August 7, 2000, except that unpaid dividends or interest will continue to accrue under the terms of the account to the extent permitted by law.
(b)
Accounting treatment; Recognition of net worth value of accounts
—(1)
Debt.
A LICU that issued secondary capital accounts pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must record the funds on its balance sheet as a debt titled “uninsured secondary capital account.”
(2)
Schedule for recognizing net worth value.
The LICU's reflection of the net worth value of the accounts in its financial statement may never exceed the full balance of the secondary capital on deposit after any early redemptions and losses. For accounts with remaining maturities of less than five years, the LICU must reflect the net worth value of the accounts in its financial statement in accordance with the lesser of:
(i) The remaining balance of the accounts after any redemptions and losses; or
(ii) The amounts calculated based on the following schedule:
Table 1 to Paragraph

(3)
Financial statement.
The LICU must reflect the full amount of the secondary capital on deposit in a footnote to its financial statement.
(c)
Redemption of secondary capital.
With the written approval of NCUA, secondary capital that is not recognized as net worth under paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be redeemed according to the remaining maturity schedule in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(1)
Request to redeem secondary capital.
A request for approval to redeem discounted secondary capital may be submitted in writing at any time, must specify the increment(s) to be redeemed and the schedule for redeeming all or any part of each eligible increment, and must demonstrate to the satisfaction of NCUA that:
(i) The LICU will have a post-redemption net worth classification of at least “adequately capitalized” under this part;
(ii) The discounted secondary capital has been on deposit at least two years;
(iii) The discounted secondary capital will not be needed to cover losses prior to final maturity of the account;
(iv) The LICU's books and records are current and reconciled;
(v) The proposed redemption will not jeopardize other current sources of funding, if any, to the LICU; and
(vi) The request to redeem is authorized by resolution of the LICU's board of directors.
(2)
Decision on request.
A request to redeem discounted secondary capital may be granted in whole or in part. If a LICU is not notified within 45 days of receipt of a request for approval to redeem secondary capital that its request is either granted or denied, the LICU may proceed to redeem secondary capital accounts as proposed.

Subject to the written approval of NCUA obtained pursuant to the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, a LICU can redeem all or part of secondary capital accepted from the United States Government or any of its subdivisions at any time after the secondary capital has been on deposit for two years. If the secondary capital was accepted under conditions that required matching secondary capital from a source other than the Federal Government, the matching secondary capital may also be redeemed in the manner set forth in the preceding sentence. For purposes of obtaining NCUA's approval, all secondary capital a LICU accepts from the United States Government or any of its subdivisions, as well as its matching secondary capital, if any, is eligible for early redemption regardless of whether any part of the secondary capital has been discounted pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

# Subpart G—CECL Transition Provisions

# Source:
86 FR 34932, July 1, 2021, unless otherwise noted.
§ 702.701
Authority, purpose, and scope.
(a)
Authority.
This subpart is issued by the National Credit Union Administration Board pursuant to section 216 of the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1790d, as added by section 301 of the Credit Union Membership Access Act, Public Law 105-219, 112 Stat. 913 (1998).
(b)
Purpose.
This subpart provides for the phase in of the adverse effects on the regulatory capital of federally insured credit unions that may result from the adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting methodology.
(c)
Scope.
(1) The transition provisions of this subpart apply to Federally insured credit unions, whether Federally or State-chartered, including credit unions defined as “new” pursuant to section 1790d(b)(2) that make charges for loan losses in accordance with:
(i) Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) under § 702.402(d)(1)(i); or
(ii) In the case of Federally-insured, State-chartered credit unions, any other applicable standard under State law or regulation under § 702.402(d)(1)(ii)(B).
(2) The transition provisions of this subpart do not apply to Federally-insured credit unions, whether Federally or State-chartered, including credit unions defined as “new” pursuant to section 1790d(b)(2), that make charges for loan losses using a reasonable reserve methodology under § 702.402(d)(1)(ii)(A).
§ 702.702
Definitions.
In addition to the definitions set forth in § 702.2, the following definitions apply to this subpart:
CECL transitional amount
means the decrease of a credit union's retained earnings resulting from its adoption of CECL, as determined pursuant to § 702.703(b).
Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL)
means the current expected credit losses methodology under GAAP.
Transition period
means the 12-quarter reporting period beginning the first day of the fiscal year in which the credit union adopts CECL.
§ 702.703
CECL transition provisions.
(a)
Eligibility.
The NCUA shall use the transition provisions of this subpart in determining a credit union's net worth category under this part, as applicable, if:
(1) The credit union has not adopted CECL before its first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2022; and
(2) The credit union records a reduction in retained earnings due to the adoption of CECL.
(b)
Determination of CECL transition amount.
(1) For purposes of calculating the first three quarters of the transition period, as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the CECL transitional amount is equal to the difference between the credit union's retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the credit union adopts CECL and the credit union's retained earnings as of the closing of the fiscal year immediately prior to the credit union's adoption of CECL.
(2) For purposes of calculating the fourth through twelfth quarters of the transition period, as described in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, the CECL transitional amount is equal to the difference between the credit union's retained earnings as of the end of the fiscal year in which the credit union adopts CECL and the credit union's retained earnings as of the beginning of its next fiscal year.
(c)
Calculation of CECL transition provision.
In determining the net worth category of a credit union as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the NCUA shall:
(1) Increase retained earnings and total assets as reported on the Call Report for purposes of the net worth ratio by 100 percent of its CECL transitional amount during the first three quarters of the transition period (first three reporting quarters of the fiscal year in which the credit union adopts CECL);
(2) Increase retained earnings and total assets as reported on the Call Report for purposes of the net worth ratio by sixty-seven percent of its CECL transitional amount during the second four quarters of the transition period (fourth reporting quarter of the fiscal year in which the credit union adopts CECL and first three reporting quarters of the next fiscal year); and
(3) Increase retained earnings and total assets as reported on the Call Report for purposes of the net worth ratio by thirty-three percent of its CECL transitional amount during the final four quarters of the transition period.
Pt. 702, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 702—Gross-Up Approach, and Look-Through Approaches
Instead of using the risk weights assigned in § 702.104(c)(2) a credit union may determine the risk weight of certain investment funds, and the risk weight of a non-subordinated or subordinated tranche of any investment as follows:
(a)
Gross-up approach
—(1)
Applicability.
Section 702.104(c)(3)(iii)(A) of this part provides that, a credit union may use the gross-up approach in this appendix to determine the risk weight of the carrying value of non-subordinated or subordinated tranches of any investment.
(2)
Calculation.
To use the gross-up approach, a credit union must calculate the following four inputs:
(i) Pro rata share, which is the par value of the credit union's exposure as a percent of the par value of the tranche in which the securitization exposure resides;
(ii) Enhanced amount, which is the par value of tranches that are more senior to the tranche in which the credit union's securitization resides;
(iii) Exposure amount, which is the amortized cost for investments classified as held-to-maturity and available-for-sale, and the fair value for trading securities; and
(iv) Risk weight, which is the weighted-average risk weight of underlying exposures of the securitization as calculated under this appendix.
(3)
Credit equivalent amount.
The “credit equivalent amount” of a securitization exposure under this part equals the sum of:
(i) The exposure amount of the credit union's exposure; and
(ii) The pro rata share multiplied by the enhanced amount, each calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this appendix.
(4)
Risk-weighted assets.
To calculate risk-weighted assets for a securitization exposure under the gross-up approach, a credit union must apply the risk weight required under
paragraph (a)(2) of this appendix to the credit equivalent amount calculated in paragraph (a)(3) of this appendix.
(5)
Securitization exposure defined.
For purposes of this this paragraph (a), “securitization exposure” means:
(i) A credit exposure that arises from a securitization; or
(ii) An exposure that directly or indirectly references a securitization exposure described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this appendix.
(6)
Securitization defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (a), “securitization” means a transaction in which:
(i) The credit risk associated with the underlying exposures has been separated into at least two tranches reflecting different levels of seniority;
(ii) Performance of the securitization exposures depends upon the performance of the underlying exposures; and
(iii) All or substantially all of the underlying exposures are financial exposures (such as loans, receivables, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, or other debt securities).
(b)
Look-through approaches.
—(1)
Applicability.
Section 702.104(c)(3)(iii)(B) provides that, a credit union may use one of the look-through approaches in this appendix to determine the risk weight of the exposure amount of any investment fund, or the holding of separate account insurance.
(2)
Full look-through approach.
(i)
General.
A credit union that is able to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for its proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the investment fund may set the risk-weighted asset amount of the credit union's exposure to the fund equal to the product of:
(A) The aggregate risk-weighted asset amounts of the exposures held by the fund as if they were held directly by the credit union; and
(B) The credit union's proportional ownership share of the fund.
(ii)
Holding report.
To calculate the risk-weighted amount under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this appendix, a credit union should:
(A) Use the most recently issued investment fund holding report; and
(B) Use an investment fund holding report that reflects holding that are not older than 6-months from the quarter-end effective date (as defined in § 702.101(c)(1).
(3)
Simple modified look-through approach.
Under the simple modified look-through approach, the risk-weighted asset amount for a credit union's exposure to an investment fund equals the exposure amount multiplied by the highest risk weight that applies to any exposure the fund is permitted to hold under the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar agreement that defines the fund's permissible investments (excluding derivative contracts that are used for hedging rather than speculative purposes and that do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures).
(4)
Alternative modified look-through approach.
Under the alternative modified look-through approach, a credit union may assign the credit union's exposure amount to an investment fund on a pro rata basis to different risk weight categories under subpart A of this part based on the investment limits in the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. The risk-weighted asset amount for the credit union's exposure to the investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the exposure amount assigned to an exposure type multiplied by the applicable risk weight under subpart A of this part. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure types within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the credit union must assume that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its investment limits in the exposure type with the highest applicable risk weight under subpart A of this part and continues to make investments in order of the exposure type with the next highest applicable risk weight under subpart A of this part until the maximum total investment level is reached. If more than one exposure type applies to an exposure, the credit union must use the highest applicable risk weight. A credit union may exclude derivative contracts held by the fund that are used for hedging rather than for speculative purposes and do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures.

Definitions.
The following definitions apply to this part:
Adjusted trading

Associated personnel
means a person engaged in the investment banking or securities business who is directly or indirectly controlled by a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) member, whether or not this person is registered or exempt from registration with FINRA. Associated personnel includes every sole proprietor, partner, officer, director, or branch manager of any FINRA member.
Banker's acceptance
means a time draft that is drawn on and accepted by a bank and that represents an irrevocable obligation of the bank.
Bank note
means a direct, unconditional, and unsecured general obligation of a bank that ranks equally with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of the bank, except deposit liabilities and other obligations that are subject to any priorities or preferences.
Borrowing repurchase transaction
means a transaction in which the Federal credit union agrees to sell a security to a counterparty and to repurchase the same or an identical security
from that counterparty at a specified future date and at a specified price.
Call
means an option that gives the holder the right to buy a specified quantity of a security at a specified price during a fixed time period.
Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO)
means a multi-class mortgage related security.
Collective investment fund
means a fund maintained by a national bank under 12 CFR part 9 (Comptroller of the Currency's regulations).

means a characteristic of an investment that gives the issuer or holder the right to alter the level and timing of the cash flows of the investment. Embedded options include call and put provisions and interest rate caps and floors. Since a prepayment option in a mortgage is a type of call provision, a mortgage-backed security composed of mortgages that may be prepaid is an example of an investment with an embedded option.

Non-federally insured corporate credit unions must agree, by written contract, to both adhere to the requirements of this part and submit to examinations, as determined by NCUA, as a condition of receiving shares or deposits from federally insured credit unions. This part grants certain additional authorities to federal corporate credit unions.

Definitions.
As used in this part:

Applicable state regulator
means the prudential state regulator of a state chartered corporate credit union.
Asset-backed security
(ABS) means a security that is primarily serviced by the cashflows of a discrete pool of receivables or other financial assets, either fixed or revolving, that by their terms convert into cash within a finite time period plus any rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distribution of proceeds to the security holders. Mortgage-backed securities are a type of asset-backed security.
Available to cover losses that exceed retained earnings
means that the funds are available to cover operating losses realized, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), by the corporate credit union that exceed retained earnings and equity acquired in a combination. Likewise,
available to cover losses that exceed retained earnings and perpetual contributed capital (PCC)
means that the funds are available to cover operating losses realized, in accordance with GAAP, by the corporate credit union that exceed retained earnings and equity acquired in a combination and PCC. Any such losses must be distributed
pro rata
at the time the loss is realized first among the holders of PCC, and when all PCC is exhausted, then
pro rata
among all nonperpetual capital accounts (NCAs) and unconverted membership capital accounts, all subject to the optional prioritization described in appendix A of this part. To the extent that any contributed capital funds are used to cover losses, the corporate credit union must not restore or replenish the affected capital accounts under any circumstances. In addition, contributed capital that is used to cover losses in a calendar year previous to the year of liquidation has no claim against the liquidation estate.
CLF-related bridge loan
means interim financing, extending up to ten business days, that a corporate credit union provides for a natural person credit union from the time the CLF approves a loan to the natural person credit union until the CLF funds the loan. To repay a CLF-related bridge loan, the borrowing natural person credit union assigns the proceeds of the CLF advance to the corporate credit union making the CLF-related bridge loan for the duration of the bridge loan.
Collateralized Debt Obligation or Collateralized Loan Obligation

Generally accepted auditing standards
(GAAS) means the standards approved and adopted by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants which apply when an independent, licensed certified public accountant audits private company financial statements in the United States of America. Auditing standards differ from auditing procedures in that procedures address acts to be performed, whereas standards measure the quality of the performance of those acts and the objectives to be achieved by use of the procedures undertaken. In addition, auditing standards address the auditor's professional
qualifications as well as the judgment exercised in performing the audit and in preparing the report of the audit.
Immediate family member

Reliable financial reporting refers to preparation of Call Reports as well as financial data published and presented to members that meet management's financial reporting objectives. Internal control over safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition refers to prevention or timely detection of transactions involving such unauthorized access, use, or disposition of assets which could result in a loss that is material to the financial statements.

Internal Control—Integrated Framework,
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), or comparable, reasonable, and U.S.-recognized criteria.
Internal control over financial reporting
means a process effected by those charged with governance, management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation of reliable financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

(2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and those charged with governance; and
(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention, or timely detection and correction, of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Investment grade
means the issuer of the security has an adequate capacity to meet the financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the asset or exposure, even under adverse economic conditions. An issuer has an adequate capacity to meet financial commitments if the risk of default by the obligor is low and the full and timely repayment of principal and interest on the security is expected. A corporate credit union may consider any or all of the following factors, to the extent appropriate, with respect to the credit risk of a security: Credit

Minimal amount of credit risk
means the amount of credit risk when the issuer of a security has a very strong capacity to meet all financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the asset or exposure, even under adverse economic conditions. An issuer has a very strong capacity to meet all financial commitments if the risk of default by the obligor is very low, and the full and timely repayment of principal and interest on the security is expected. A corporate credit union may consider any or all of the following factors, to the extent appropriate, with respect to the credit risk of a security: Credit spreads; securities-related research; internal or external credit risk assessments; default statistics; inclusion on an index; priorities and enhancements; price, yield, and/or volume; asset class-specific factors.

Also, any amounts deducted in calculating Tier 1 capital are also deducted from net assets.
Net economic value

Perpetual contributed capital, and the unamortized portion of nonperpetual capital that is, the portion that qualifies as capital for purposes of any of the minimum capital ratios, is excluded from liabilities for purposes of
this calculation. The NEV ratio is calculated by dividing NEV by the fair value of assets.

Net risk-weighted
assets means risk-weighted assets less CLF stock subscriptions, CLF-related bridge loans, loans guaranteed by the NCUSIF, and member reverse repurchase transactions.

§ 704.3
Corporate credit union capital.
(a)
Capital requirements.
(1) A corporate credit union must maintain at all times:
(i) A leverage ratio of 4.0 percent or greater;
(ii) A Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.0 percent or greater; and
(iii) A total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 percent or greater.
(2) To ensure it meets its capital requirements, a corporate credit union must develop and ensure implementation of written short- and long-term capital goals, objectives, and strategies which provide for the building of capital consistent with regulatory requirements, the maintenance of sufficient capital to support the risk exposures that may arise from current and projected activities, and the periodic review and reassessment of the capital position of the corporate credit union.
(3) Beginning with the first call report submitted on or after October 21, 2013, a corporate credit union must calculate and report to NCUA the ratio of its retained earnings to its moving daily average net assets. If this ratio is less than 0.45 percent, the corporate credit union must, within 30 days, submit a retained earnings accumulation plan to the NCUA for NCUA's approval. The plan must contain a detailed explanation of how the corporate credit union will accumulate earnings sufficient to meet all its future minimum leverage ratio requirements, including
specific semiannual milestones for accumulating retained earnings. In the case of a state-chartered corporate credit union, the NCUA will consult with the appropriate state supervisory authority (SSA) before making a determination to approve or disapprove the plan, and will provide the SSA a copy of the completed plan. If the corporate credit union fails to submit a plan acceptable to NCUA, or fails to comply with any element of a plan approved by NCUA, the corporate will immediately be classified as significantly undercapitalized or, if already significantly undercapitalized, as critically undercapitalized for purposes of prompt corrective actions. The corporate credit union will be subject to all the associated actions under § 704.4.
(b)
Requirements for nonperpetual capital accounts (NCAs)
—(1)
Form.
NCA funds may be in the form of a term certificate or a no-maturity notice account.
(2)
Disclosure.
The terms and conditions of a nonperpetual capital account must be disclosed to the recorded owner of the account at the time the account is opened and at least annually thereafter.
(i) The initial NCA disclosure must be signed by either all of the directors of the member credit union or, if authorized by board resolution, the chair and secretary of the board; and
(ii) The annual disclosure notice must be signed by the chair of the corporate credit union. The chair must sign a statement that certifies that the notice has been sent to all entities with NCAs. The certification must be maintained in the corporate credit union's files and be available for examiner review.
(3)
Five-year remaining maturity.
When a no-maturity NCA has been placed on notice, or a term account has a remaining maturity of less than five years, the corporate will reduce the amount of the account that can be considered as nonperpetual capital by a constant monthly amortization that ensures the capital is fully amortized one year before the date of maturity or one year before the end of the notice period. The full balance of an NCA being amortized, not just the remaining non-amortized portion, is available to absorb losses in excess of the sum of retained earnings and perpetual contributed capital until the funds are released by the corporate credit union at the time of maturity or the conclusion of the notice period.
(4)
Release.
Nonperpetual capital may not be released due solely to the merger, charter conversion, or liquidation of the account holder. In the event of a merger, the capital account transfers to the continuing entity. In the event of a charter conversion, the capital account transfers to the new institution. In the event of liquidation, the corporate may release a member capital account to facilitate the payout of shares, but only with the prior written approval of the NCUA.
(5)
Redemption.
A corporate credit union may redeem NCAs prior to maturity or prior to the end of the notice period only if it meets its minimum required capital and net economic value ratios after the funds are redeemed and only with the prior approval of NCUA and, for state chartered corporate credit unions, the applicable state regulator.
(6)
Sale.
A member may transfer its interest in a nonperpetual capital account to another member or to a nonmember (other than a natural person). At least 14 days before consummating such a transfer, the member must notify the corporate credit union of the pending transfer. The corporate credit union must, within 10 days of such notice, provide the member and the potential transferee all financial information about the corporate credit union that is available to the public or that the corporate credit union has provided to its members, including any call report data submitted by the corporate credit union to NCUA but not yet posted on NCUA's Web site.
(7)
Merger.
In the event of a merger of a corporate credit union, nonperpetual capital will transfer to the continuing corporate credit union. The minimum five-year notice period for withdrawal of no-maturity capital remains in effect.
(c)
Requirements for perpetual contributed capital (PCC)
—(1)
Disclosure.
The terms and conditions of any perpetual contributed capital instrument must be disclosed to the recorded owner of
the instrument at the time the instrument is created and must be signed by either all of the directors of the member credit union or, if authorized by board resolution, the chair and secretary of the board.
(2)
Release.
Perpetual contributed capital may not be released due solely to the merger, charter conversion or liquidation of a member credit union. In the event of a merger, the perpetual contributed capital transfers to the continuing credit union. In the event of a charter conversion, the perpetual contributed capital transfers to the new institution. In the event of liquidation, the perpetual contributed capital may be released to facilitate the payout of shares with NCUA's prior written approval.
(3)
Callability.
A corporate credit union may call PCC instruments only if it meets its minimum required capital and net economic value ratios after the funds are called and only with the prior approval of the NCUA and, for state chartered corporate credit unions, the applicable state regulator. PCC accounts are callable on a pro-rata basis across an issuance class.
(4)
Perpetual contributed capital.
A corporate credit union may issue perpetual contributed capital to both members and nonmembers.
(5) The holder of a PCC instrument may transfer its interests in the instrument to another member or to a nonmember (other than a natural person). At least 14 days before consummating such a transfer, the member must notify the corporate credit union of the pending transfer. The corporate credit union must, within 10 days of such notice, provide the member and the potential transferee all financial information about the corporate credit union that is available to the public or that the corporate credit union has provided to its members, including any call report data submitted by the corporate credit union to NCUA but not yet posted on NCUA's Web site.
(6) A corporate credit union is permitted to condition membership, services, or prices for services on a member's ownership of PCC, provided the corporate credit union gives existing members at least six months written notice of:
(i) The requirement to purchase PCC, including specific amounts; and
(ii) The effects of a failure to purchase the requisite PCC on the pricing of services or on the member's access to membership or services.
(d)
Individual minimum capital requirements
—(1)
General.
The rules and procedures specified in this paragraph apply to the establishment of an individual minimum capital requirement for a corporate credit union that varies from any of the risk-based capital requirement(s) or leverage ratio requirements that would otherwise apply to the corporate credit union under this part.
(2)
Appropriate considerations for establishing individual minimum capital requirements.
Minimum capital levels higher than the risk-based capital requirements or the leverage ratio requirement under this part may be appropriate for individual corporate credit unions. The NCUA may establish increased individual minimum capital requirements, including modification of the minimum capital requirements related to being either significantly and critically undercapitalized for purposes of § 704.4 of this part, upon a determination that the corporate credit union's capital is or may become inadequate in view of the credit union's circumstances. For example, higher capital levels may be appropriate when NCUA determines that:
(i) A corporate credit union is receiving special supervisory attention;
(ii) A corporate credit union has or is expected to have losses resulting in capital inadequacy;
(iii) A corporate credit union has a high degree of exposure to interest rate risk, prepayment risk, credit risk, concentration risk, certain risks arising from nontraditional activities or similar risks, or a high proportion of off-balance sheet risk including standby letters of credit;
(iv) A corporate credit union has poor liquidity or cash flow;
(v) A corporate credit union is growing, either internally or through acquisitions, at such a rate that supervisory problems are presented that are not dealt with adequately by other NCUA regulations or other guidance;
(vi) A corporate credit union may be adversely affected by the activities or
condition of its CUSOs or other persons or entities with which it has significant business relationships, including concentrations of credit;
(vii) A corporate credit union with a portfolio reflecting weak credit quality or a significant likelihood of financial loss, or has loans or securities in nonperforming status or on which borrowers fail to comply with repayment terms;
(viii) A corporate credit union has inadequate underwriting policies, standards, or procedures for its loans and investments;
(ix) A corporate credit union has failed to properly plan for, or execute, necessary retained earnings growth, or
(ix) A corporate credit union has a record of operational losses that exceeds the average of other, similarly situated corporate credit unions; has management deficiencies, including failure to adequately monitor and control financial and operating risks, particularly the risks presented by concentrations of credit and nontraditional activities; or has a poor record of supervisory compliance.
(3)
Standards for determination of appropriate individual minimum capital requirements.
The appropriate minimum capital levels for an individual corporate credit union cannot be determined solely through the application of a rigid mathematical formula or wholly objective criteria. The decision is necessarily based, in part, on subjective judgment grounded in agency expertise. The factors to be considered in NCUA's determination will vary in each case and may include, for example:
(i) The conditions or circumstances leading to the determination that a higher minimum capital requirement is appropriate or necessary for the corporate credit union;
(ii) The exigency of those circumstances or potential problems;
(iii) The overall condition, management strength, and future prospects of the corporate credit union and, if applicable, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and business partners;
(iv) The corporate credit union's liquidity, capital and other indicators of financial stability, particularly as compared with those of similarly situated corporate credit unions; and
(v) The policies and practices of the corporate credit union's directors, officers, and senior management as well as the internal control and internal audit systems for implementation of such adopted policies and practices.
(4) Procedures—(i) In the case of a state chartered corporate credit union, NCUA will consult with the appropriate state regulator when considering imposing a new minimum capital requirement.
(ii) When the NCUA determines that a minimum capital requirement is necessary or appropriate for a particular corporate credit union, it will notify the corporate credit union in writing of its proposed individual minimum capital requirement; the schedule for compliance with the new requirement; and the specific causes for determining that the higher individual minimum capital requirement is necessary or appropriate for the corporate credit union. The NCUA shall forward the notifying letter to the appropriate state supervisory authority (SSA) if a state-chartered corporate credit union would be subject to an individual minimum capital requirement.
(iii) The corporate credit union's response must include any information that the credit union wants the NCUA to consider in deciding whether to establish or to amend an individual minimum capital requirement for the corporate credit union, what the individual capital requirement should be, and, if applicable, what compliance schedule is appropriate for achieving the required capital level. The responses of the corporate credit union and SSA must be in writing and must be delivered to the NCUA within 30 days after the date on which the notification was received. The NCUA may extend the time period for good cause, and the time period for response by the insured corporate credit union may be shortened for good cause:
(A) When, in the opinion of the NCUA, the condition of the corporate credit union so requires, and the NCUA informs the corporate credit union of the shortened response period in the notice;
(B) With the consent of the corporate credit union; or
(C) When the corporate credit union already has advised the NCUA that it cannot or will not achieve its applicable minimum capital requirement.
(iv) Failure by the corporate credit union to respond within 30 days, or such other time period as may be specified by the NCUA, may constitute a waiver of any objections to the proposed individual minimum capital requirement or to the schedule for complying with it, unless the NCUA has provided an extension of the response period for good cause.
(v) After expiration of the response period, the NCUA will decide whether or not the proposed individual minimum capital requirement should be established for the corporate credit union, or whether that proposed requirement should be adopted in modified form, based on a review of the corporate credit union's response and other relevant information. The NCUA's decision will address comments received within the response period from the corporate credit union and the appropriate state supervisory authority (SSA) (if a state-chartered corporate credit union is involved) and will state the level of capital required, the schedule for compliance with this requirement, and any specific remedial action the corporate credit union could take to eliminate the need for continued applicability of the individual minimum capital requirement. The NCUA will provide the corporate credit union and the appropriate SSA (if a state-chartered corporate credit union is involved) with a written decision on the individual minimum capital requirement, addressing the substantive comments made by the corporate credit union and setting forth the decision and the basis for that decision. Upon receipt of this decision by the corporate credit union, the individual minimum capital requirement becomes effective and binding upon the corporate credit union. This decision represents final agency action.
(vi) In lieu of the procedures established above, a corporate credit union may request an informal hearing. The corporate credit union must make the request for a hearing in writing, and NCUA must receive the request no later than 10 days following the date of the notice described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section. Upon receipt of the request for hearing, NCUA will conduct an informal hearing and render a decision using the procedures described in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of § 747.3003 of this chapter.
(5)
Failure to comply.
Failure to satisfy any individual minimum capital requirement, or to meet any required incremental additions to capital under a schedule for compliance with such an individual minimum capital requirement, will constitute a basis to take action as described in § 704.4.
(6)
Change in circumstances.
If, after a decision is made under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, there is a change in the circumstances affecting the corporate credit union's capital adequacy or its ability to reach its required minimum capital level by the specified date, the NCUA may amend the individual minimum capital requirement or the corporate credit union's schedule for such compliance. The NCUA may decline to consider a corporate credit union's request for such changes that are not based on a significant change in circumstances or that are repetitive or frivolous. Pending the NCUA's reexamination of the original decision, that original decision and any compliance schedule established in that decision will continue in full force and effect.
(e)
Reservation of authority
—(1)
Transactions for purposes of evasion.
The NCUA may disregard any transaction entered into primarily for the purpose of reducing the minimum required amount of regulatory capital or otherwise evading the requirements of this section.
(2)
Period-end versus average figures.
The NCUA reserves the right to require a corporate credit union to compute its capital ratios on the basis of period-end assets rather than average assets when the NCUA determines this requirement is appropriate to carry out the purposes of this part.
(3)
Reservation of authority.
(i) Notwithstanding the definitions of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital in paragraph (d) of this section, NCUA may find that a particular asset or Tier 1 capital or
Tier 2 capital component has characteristics or terms that diminish its contribution to a corporate credit union's ability to absorb losses, and NCUA may require the discounting or deduction of such asset or component from the computation of Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital, or total capital.
(ii) Notwithstanding appendix C to this part, the NCUA will look to the substance of a transaction and may find that the assigned risk-weight for any asset, or credit equivalent amount or credit conversion factor for any off-balance sheet item does not appropriately reflect the risks imposed on the corporate credit union. The NCUA may require the corporate credit union to apply another risk-weight, credit equivalent amount, or credit conversion factor that NCUA deems appropriate.
(iii) If appendix C to this part does not specifically assign a risk-weight, credit equivalent amount, or credit conversion factor to a particular asset or activity of the corporate credit union, the NCUA may assign any risk-weight, credit equivalent amount, or credit conversion factor that it deems appropriate. In making this determination, NCUA will consider the risks associated with the asset or off-balance sheet item as well as other relevant factors.
(4) Where practicable, the NCUA will consult with the appropriate state regulator before taking any action under this paragraph (e) that involves a state chartered corporate credit union.
(5) Before taking any action under this paragraph (e), NCUA will provide the corporate credit union with written notice of the intended action and the reasons for such action. The corporate credit union will have seven days to provide the NCUA with a written response, and the NCUA will consider the response before taking the action. Upon the timely request of the corporate credit union, and for good cause, NCUA may extend the seven day response period.
(f)
Former capital accounts.
This paragraph addresses membership capital accounts (MCAs) that qualified as corporate capital prior to October 20, 2011 but which no longer satisfy the definitions of capital because the accounts have not been converted by the member to nonperpetual capital accounts (NCAs) or to perpetual contributed capital (PCC).
(1) For MCAs structured as adjustable balance accounts, the corporate will immediately place the account on notice of withdrawal if the member has not already done so. The corporate will continue to adjust the balance of the MCA account in accordance with the original terms of the account until the entire notice period has run and then return the remaining balance, less any losses, to the member. Until the expiration of the notice period the entire adjusted balance will be available to cover losses at the corporate credit union that exceed retained earnings and PCC (excluding, if a corporate credit union exercises the capital prioritization option under Part I of appendix A to this part, any PCC with priority under that option).
(2) For term MCAs, the corporate credit union will return the balance of the MCA account to the member at the expiration of the term. Until the expiration of term, the entire account balance will be available to cover losses that exceed retained earnings and PCC (excluding, if a corporate credit union exercises the capital prioritization option under part I of appendix A to this part, any PCC with priority under that option).
(3) A corporate credit union may count a portion of unconverted MCAs as Tier 2 capital. Beginning on the date of issuance (for term MCAs) or the date of notice of withdrawal (for other MCAs), the corporate may count the entire account balance as Tier 2 capital, but will then reduce the amount of the account that can be considered as Tier 2 capital by a constant monthly amortization that ensures the capital is fully amortized one year before the date of maturity or one year before the end of the notice period. For adjustable balance account MCAs where the adjustment is determined based on some impermanent measure, such as shares on deposit with the corporate, the corporate credit union may not treat any part of the account as capital.

§ 704.4
Prompt corrective action.
(a)
Purpose.
The principal purpose of this section is to define, for corporate credit unions that are not adequately capitalized, the capital measures and capital levels that are used for determining appropriate supervisory actions. This section establishes procedures for submission and review of capital restoration plans and for issuance and review of capital directives, orders, and other supervisory directives.
(b)
Scope.
This section applies to corporate credit unions, including officers, directors, and employees.
(1) This section does not limit the authority of NCUA in any way to take supervisory actions to address unsafe or unsound practices, deficient capital levels, violations of law, unsafe or unsound conditions, or other practices. The NCUA may take action under this section independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition to any other enforcement action available to the NCUA, including issuance of cease and desist orders, approval or denial of applications or notices, assessment of civil money penalties, or any other actions authorized by law.
(2) Unless permitted by the NCUA or otherwise required by law, no corporate credit union may state in any advertisement or promotional material its capital category under this part or that the NCUA has assigned the corporate credit union to a particular category.
(3) Any group of credit unions applying for a new corporate credit union charter will submit, as part of the charter application, a detailed draft plan for soliciting contributed capital and building retained earnings. The draft plan will include specific levels of contributed capital and retained earnings and the anticipated timeframes for achieving those levels. The Board will review the draft plan and modify it as necessary. If the Board approves the plan, the Board will include any necessary waivers of this section or part.
(c)
Notice of capital category.
(1) Effective date of determination of capital category. A corporate credit union will be deemed to be within a given capital category as of the most recent date:
(i) A 5310 Financial Report is required to be filed with the NCUA;
(ii) A final NCUA report of examination is delivered to the corporate credit union; or
(iii) Written notice is provided by the NCUA to the corporate credit union that its capital category has changed as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) or (d)(3) of this section.
(2) Adjustments to reported capital levels and category—
(i) Notice of adjustment by corporate credit union. A corporate credit union must provide the NCUA with written notice that an adjustment to the corporate credit union's capital category may have occurred no later than 15 calendar days following the date that any material event has occurred that would cause the corporate credit union to be placed in a lower capital category from the category assigned to the corporate credit union for purposes of this section on the basis of the corporate credit union's most recent call report or report of examination.
(ii) Determination by the NCUA to change capital category. After receiving notice pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or on its own initiative, the NCUA will determine whether to change the capital category of the corporate credit union and will notify the corporate credit union of the NCUA's determination.
(d)
Capital measures and capital category definitions
—(1)
Capital measures.
For purposes of this section, the relevant capital measures are:
(i) The total risk-based capital ratio;
(ii) The Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio; and
(iii) The leverage ratio.
(2)
Capital categories.
For purposes of this section, a corporate credit union is:
(i) Well capitalized if the corporate credit union:
(A) Has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 percent or greater; and
(B) Has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 percent or greater; and
(C) Has a leverage ratio of 5.0 percent or greater; and
(D) Is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by NCUA to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.
(ii) Adequately capitalized if the corporate credit union:
(A) Has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 percent or greater; and
(B) Has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.0 percent or greater; and
(C) Has:
(
1
) A leverage ratio of 4.0 percent or greater; and
(
2
) Does not meet the definition of a well capitalized corporate credit union.
(iii) Undercapitalized if the corporate credit union:
(A) Has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0 percent; or
(B) Has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0 percent; or
(C) Has a leverage ratio that is less than 4.0 percent.
(iv) Significantly undercapitalized if the corporate credit union has:
(A) A total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0 percent; or
(B) A Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3.0 percent; or
(C) A leverage ratio that is less than 3.0 percent.
(v) Critically undercapitalized if the corporate credit union has:
(A) A total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0 percent; or
(B) A Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 2.0 percent; or
(C) A leverage ratio that is less than 2.0 percent.
(3)
Reclassification based on supervisory criteria other than capital.
Notwithstanding the elements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the NCUA may reclassify a well capitalized corporate credit union as adequately capitalized, and may require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized corporate credit union to comply with certain mandatory or discretionary supervisory actions as if the corporate credit union were in the next lower capital category, in the following circumstances:
(i) Unsafe or unsound condition. The NCUA has determined, after notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) of this section, that the corporate credit union is in an unsafe or unsound condition; or
(ii) Unsafe or unsound practice. NCUA has determined, after notice and an opportunity for hearing pursuant to paragraph (h)(1) of this section, that the corporate credit union received a less-than-satisfactory CAMELS rating (
i.e.,
three or lower) for any rating category (other than in a rating category specifically addressing capital adequacy) and has not corrected the conditions that served as the basis for the less than satisfactory rating. Ratings under this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) refer to the most recent ratings (as determined either on-site or off-site by the most recent examination) of which the corporate credit union has been notified in writing.
(4) The NCUA may, for good cause, modify any of the percentages in paragraph (d)(2) of this section as described in § 704.3(d).
(e)
Capital restoration plans
—(1)
Schedule for filing plan
—(i)
In general.
A corporate credit union must file a written capital restoration plan with the NCUA within 45 days of the date that the corporate credit union receives notice or is deemed to have notice that the corporate credit union is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, unless the NCUA notifies the corporate credit union in writing that the plan is to be filed within a different period. An adequately capitalized corporate credit union that has been required pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section to comply with supervisory actions as if the corporate credit union were undercapitalized is not required to submit a capital restoration plan solely by virtue of the reclassification.
(ii)
Additional capital restoration plans.
Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, a corporate credit union that has already submitted and is operating under a capital restoration plan approved under this section is not required to submit an additional capital restoration plan based on a revised calculation of its capital measures or a reclassification of the institution under paragraph (d)(3) of this section unless the NCUA notifies the corporate credit union that it must submit a new or revised capital plan. A corporate credit union that is notified that it must submit a new or revised capital restoration plan must file the plan in writing with the NCUA within 45 days of receiving such notice, unless the NCUA notifies the corporate credit union in
writing that the plan is to be filed within a different period.
(2)
Contents of plan.
All financial data submitted in connection with a capital restoration plan must be prepared in accordance with the instructions provided on the call report, unless the NCUA instructs otherwise. The capital restoration plan must include all of the information required to be filed under paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section. A corporate credit union required to submit a capital restoration plan as the result of a reclassification of the corporate credit union pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section must include a description of the steps the corporate credit union will take to correct the unsafe or unsound condition or practice.
(3)
Failure to submit a capital restoration plan.
A corporate credit union that is undercapitalized and that fails to submit a written capital restoration plan within the period provided in this section will, upon the expiration of that period, be subject to all of the provisions of this section applicable to significantly undercapitalized credit unions.
(4)
Review of capital restoration plans.
Within 60 days after receiving a capital restoration plan under this section, the NCUA will provide written notice to the corporate credit union of whether it has approved the plan. The NCUA may extend this time period.
(5)
Disapproval of capital plan.
If the NCUA does not approve a capital restoration plan, the corporate credit union must submit a revised capital restoration plan, when directed to do so, within the time specified by the NCUA. An undercapitalized corporate credit union is subject to the provisions applicable to significantly undercapitalized credit unions until it has submitted, and NCUA has approved, a capital restoration plan. If the NCUA directs that the corporate credit union submit a revised plan, it must do so in time frame specified by the NCUA.
(6)
Failure to implement a capital restoration plan.
Any undercapitalized corporate credit union that fails in any material respect to implement a capital restoration plan will be subject to all of the provisions of this section applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions.
(7)
Amendment of capital plan.
A corporate credit union that has filed an approved capital restoration plan may, after prior written notice to and approval by the NCUA, amend the plan to reflect a change in circumstance. Until such time as NCUA has approved a proposed amendment, the corporate credit union must implement the capital restoration plan as approved prior to the proposed amendment.
(f)
Mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions
—(1)
Mandatory supervisory actions
—(i)
Provisions applicable to all corporate credit unions.
All corporate credit unions are subject to the restrictions contained in paragraph (k)(1) of this section on capital distributions.
(ii) Provisions applicable to undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized corporate credit unions. Immediately upon receiving notice or being deemed to have notice, as provided in paragraph (c) or (e) of this section, that the corporate credit union is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, the corporate credit union will be subject to the following provisions of paragraph (k) of this section:
(A) Restricting capital distributions (paragraph (k)(1));

(E) Requiring prior approval of certain expansion proposals (paragraph (k)(2)(iv)).
(iii) Additional provisions applicable to significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized corporate credit unions. In addition to the mandatory requirements described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, immediately upon receiving notice or being deemed to have notice that the corporate credit union is significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, or that the corporate credit union is subject to the provisions applicable to corporate credit unions that
are significantly undercapitalized because the credit union failed to submit or implement in any material respect an acceptable capital restoration plan, the corporate credit union will become subject to the provisions of paragraph (k)(3)(iii) of this section that restrict compensation paid to senior executive officers of the institution.
(iv) Additional provisions applicable to critically undercapitalized corporate credit unions. In addition to the provisions described in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (f)(1)(iii) of this section, immediately upon receiving notice or being deemed to have notice that the corporate credit union is critically undercapitalized, the corporate credit union will become subject to these additional provisions of paragraph (k) of this section:
(A) Restricting the activities of the corporate credit union ((k)(5)(i)); and
(B) Restricting payments on subordinated debt of the corporate credit union ((k)(5)(ii)).
(2)
Discretionary supervisory actions.
(i) All PCA actions listed in paragraph (k) of this section that are not discussed in paragraph (f)(1) of this section are discretionary.
(ii) All discretionary actions available to NCUA in the case of an undercapitalized corporate credit union are available to NCUA in the case of a significantly undercapitalized credit union. All discretionary actions available to NCUA in the case of an undercapitalized corporate credit union or a significantly undercapitalized corporate credit union are available to NCUA in the case of a critically undercapitalized corporate credit union.
(iii) In taking any discretionary PCA actions with a corporate credit union that is deemed to be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, or has been reclassified as undercapitalized, or significantly undercapitalized; or an action in connection with an officer or director of such corporate credit union; the NCUA will follow the procedures for issuing directives under paragraphs (g) and (i) of this section.
(iv) NCUA will consult and seek to work cooperatively with the appropriate state supervisory authority (SSA) before taking any discretionary supervisory action with respect to a state-chartered corporate credit union; will provide notice of its decision to the SSA; and will allow the appropriate SSA an opportunity to take the proposed action independently or jointly with NCUA.
(g)
Directives to take prompt corrective action.
The NCUA will provide an undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized corporate credit union prior written notice of the NCUA's intention to issue a directive requiring such corporate credit union to take actions or to follow proscriptions described in this part. Section 747.3002 of this chapter prescribes the notice content and associated process.
(h)
Procedures for reclassifying a corporate credit union based on criteria other than capital.
When the NCUA intends to reclassify a corporate credit union or subject it to the supervisory actions applicable to the next lower capitalization category based on an unsafe or unsound condition or practice, the NCUA will provide the credit union with prior written notice of such intent. Section 747.3003 of this chapter prescribes the notice content and associated process.
(i)
Order to dismiss a Director or senior executive officer.
When the NCUA issues and serves a directive on a corporate credit union requiring it to dismiss from office any director or senior executive officer under paragraphs (k)(3) of this section, the NCUA will also serve upon the person the corporate credit union is directed to dismiss (Respondent) a copy of the directive (or the relevant portions, where appropriate) and notice of the Respondent's right to seek reinstatement. Section 747.3004 of this chapter prescribes the content of the notice of right to seek reinstatement and the associated process.
(j)
Enforcement of directives.
Section 747.3005 of this chapter prescribes the process for enforcement of directives.
(k)
Remedial actions towards undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized corporate credit unions.
(1) Provision applicable to all corporate credit unions. A corporate credit union is prohibited from making any capital distribution,
including payment of dividends on perpetual and nonperpetual capital accounts, if, after making the distribution, the credit union would be undercapitalized.
(2) Provisions applicable to undercapitalized corporate credit unions.
(i) Monitoring required. The NCUA will—
(A) Closely monitor the condition of any undercapitalized corporate credit union;
(B) Closely monitor compliance with capital restoration plans, restrictions, and requirements imposed under this section; and

(A) Any undercapitalized corporate credit union must submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the NCUA.
(B) The capital restoration plan will—
(
1
) Specify—

(
ii
) The levels of capital to be attained during each year in which the plan will be in effect;
(
iii
) How the corporate credit union will comply with the restrictions or requirements then in effect under this section; and
(
iv
) The types and levels of activities in which the corporate credit union will engage; and

(C) The NCUA will not accept a capital restoration plan unless the NCUA determines that the plan—
(
1
) Complies with paragraph (k)(2)(ii)(B) of this section;
(
2
) Is based on realistic assumptions, and is likely to succeed in restoring the corporate credit union's capital; and
(
3
) Would not appreciably increase the risk (including credit risk, interest-rate risk, and other types of risk) to which the corporate credit union is exposed.
(iii) Asset growth restricted. An undercapitalized corporate credit union must not permit its daily average net assets during any calendar month to exceed its moving daily average net assets unless—
(A) The NCUA has accepted the corporate credit union's capital restoration plan; and
(B) Any increase in total assets is consistent with the plan.
(iv) Prior approval required for acquisitions, branching, and new lines of business. An undercapitalized corporate credit union must not, directly or indirectly, acquire any interest in any entity, establish or acquire any additional branch office, or engage in any new line of business unless the NCUA has accepted the corporate credit union's capital restoration plan, the corporate credit union is implementing the plan, and the NCUA determines that the proposed action is consistent with and will further the achievement of the plan.
(3) Provisions applicable to significantly undercapitalized corporate credit unions and undercapitalized corporate credit unions that fail to submit and implement capital restoration plans.
(i)
In general.
This paragraph applies with respect to any corporate credit union that—

(
2
) Fails in any material respect to implement a plan accepted by the NCUA.
(ii)
Specific actions authorized.
The NCUA may take one or more of the following actions:
(A) Requiring recapitalization.
(
1
) Requiring the corporate credit union to seek and obtain additional contributed capital.
(
2
) Requiring the corporate credit union to increase its rate of earnings retention.
(
3
) Requiring the corporate credit union to combine, in whole or part,
with another insured depository institution, if one or more grounds exist under this section or the Federal Credit Union Act for appointing a conservator or liquidating agent.

(E) Restricting activities. Requiring the corporate credit union or any of its CUSOs to alter, reduce, or terminate any activity that the NCUA determines poses excessive risk to the corporate credit union.
(F) Improving management. Doing one or more of the following:
(
1
) New election of directors. Ordering a new election for the corporate credit union's board of directors.
(
2
) Dismissing directors or senior executive officers. Requiring the corporate credit union to dismiss from office any director or senior executive officer who had held office for more than 180 days immediately before the corporate credit union became undercapitalized.
(
3
) Employing qualified senior executive officers. Requiring the corporate credit union to employ qualified senior executive officers (who, if the NCUA so specifies, will be subject to approval by the NCUA).
(G) Requiring divestiture. Requiring the corporate credit union to divest itself of or liquidate any interest in any entity if the NCUA determines that the entity is in danger of becoming insolvent or otherwise poses a significant risk to the corporate credit union;
(H) Conserve or liquidate the corporate credit union if NCUA determines the credit union has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized; and
(I) Requiring other action. Requiring the corporate credit union to take any other action that the NCUA determines will better carry out the purpose of this section than any of the actions described in this paragraph.

(i)
In general.
If the NCUA determines, after notice and an opportunity for hearing as described in subpart M of part 747 of this chapter, that a corporate credit union is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the corporate credit union to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice, the NCUA may—
(A) If the corporate credit union is well capitalized, reclassify the corporate credit union as adequately capitalized;
(B) If the corporate credit union is adequately capitalized (but not well capitalized), require the corporate credit union to comply with one or more provisions of paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section, as if the corporate credit union were undercapitalized; or
(C) If the corporate credit union is undercapitalized, take any one or more actions authorized under paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of this section as if the corporate credit union were significantly undercapitalized.
(ii)
Contents of plan.
Any plan required under paragraph (k)(4)(i) of this section will specify the steps that the corporate credit union will take to correct the unsafe or unsound condition or practice. Capital restoration plans, however, will not be required under paragraph (k)(4)(i)(B) of this section.

Interest, although not payable, may continue to accrue under the terms of any subordinated debt to the extent otherwise permitted by law. Dividends on contributed capital do not, however, continue to accrue.
(iii) Conservatorship, liquidation, or other action. The NCUA may, at any time, conserve or liquidate any critically undercapitalized corporate credit union or require the credit union to combine, in whole or part, with another institution. NCUA will consider, not later than 90 days after a corporate credit union becomes critically undercapitalized, whether NCUA should liquidate, conserve, or combine the institution.
(6) Restricting activities of critically undercapitalized corporate credit unions. To carry out the purpose of this section, the NCUA will, by order—
(i) Restrict the activities of any critically undercapitalized corporate credit union; and
(ii) At a minimum, prohibit any such corporate credit union from doing any of the following without the NCUA's prior written approval:

If a corporation in which a corporate credit union is interested in investing does not have a readily ascertainable NAICS classification, a corporate credit union will use its reasonable judgment in assigning such a classification. NCUA may direct, however, that the corporate credit union change the classification.
(f)
Credit ratings.
(1) Before purchasing an investment, a corporate credit union must conduct and document an analysis that reasonably concludes the investment has no more than a minimal amount of credit risk.

(1) Appropriate monitoring of the investment would reasonably lead to the conclusion that the investment presents more than a minimal amount of credit risk; or
(2) The investment is part of an asset class or group of investments that exceeds the issuer, sector, or subsector concentration limits of this section. For purposes of measurement, each new credit transaction must be evaluated in terms of the corporate credit union's capital at the time of the transaction. An investment that fails a requirement of this section because of a subsequent reduction in capital will be deemed nonconforming. A corporate credit union is required to exercise reasonable efforts to bring nonconforming investments into conformity within 90 calendar days. Investments that remain nonconforming for more than 90 calendar days will be deemed to fail a requirement of this section and the corporate credit union will have to comply with § 704.10 of this part.

§ 704.8
Asset and liability management.
(a)
Policies.
A corporate credit union must operate according to a written asset and liability management policy which addresses, at a minimum:
(1) The purpose and objectives of the corporate credit union's asset and liability activities;
(2) The maximum allowable percentage decline in net economic value (NEV), compared to base case NEV;
(3) The minimum allowable NEV ratio;
(4) Policy limits and specific test parameters for the NEV sensitivity analysis requirements set forth in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section;
(5) The modeling of indexes that serve as references in financial instrument coupon formulas; and
(6) The tests that will be used, prior to purchase, to estimate the impact of investments on the percentage decline in NEV compared to base case NEV. The most recent NEV analysis, as determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section may be used as a basis of estimation.
(b)
Asset and liability management committee (ALCO).
A corporate credit union's ALCO must have at least one member who is also a member of the board of directors. The ALCO must review asset and liability management reports on at least a monthly basis. These reports must address compliance with Federal Credit Union Act, NCUA Rules and Regulations (12 CFR chapter VII), and all related risk management policies.
(c)
Penalty for early withdrawals.
A corporate credit union that permits early certificate/share withdrawals must assess market-based penalties sufficient to cover the estimated replacement cost of the certificate redeemed. This means the minimum penalty must be reasonably related to the rate that the corporate credit union would be required to offer to attract funds for a similar term with similar characteristics.
(d)
Interest rate sensitivity analysis.
(1) A corporate credit union must:
(i) Evaluate the risk in its balance sheet by measuring, at least quarterly, including once on the last day of the calendar quarter, the impact of an instantaneous, permanent, and parallel shock in the yield curve of plus and minus 100, 200, and 300 BP on its NEV and NEV ratio. If the base case NEV ratio falls below 3 percent at the last testing date, these tests must be calculated at least monthly, including once on the last day of the month, until the base case NEV ratio again exceeds 3 percent;
(ii) Limit its risk exposure to levels that do not result in a base case NEV ratio or any NEV ratio resulting from the tests set forth in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section below 2 percent; and
(iii) Limit its risk exposures to levels that do not result in a decline in NEV of more than 15 percent.
(2) A corporate credit union must assess annually if it should conduct periodic additional tests to address market factors that may materially impact that corporate credit union's NEV. These factors should include, but are not limited to, the following:
(i) Changes in the shape of the Treasury yield curve;
(ii) Adjustments to prepayment projections used for amortizing securities to consider the impact of significantly faster/slower prepayment speeds; and
(iii) Adjustments to volatility assumptions to consider the impact that changing volatilities have on embedded option values.
(e)
Net interest income modeling.
A corporate credit union must perform net interest income (NII) modeling to project earnings in multiple interest rate environments for a period of no less than 1 year. NII modeling must, at minimum, be performed at least quarterly, including once on the last day of the calendar quarter.
(f)
Weighted average asset life.
The weighted average life (WAL) of a corporate credit union's financial assets, consisting of cash, investments, and loans, but excluding derivative contracts and equity investments, may not exceed 2 years. A corporate credit union must test its financial assets at least quarterly, including once on the last day of the calendar quarter, for compliance with this WAL limitation. When calculating its WAL, a corporate credit union must assume that no issuer or market options will be exercised. If the WAL of a corporate credit union's assets exceeds 2 years on the testing date, this test must be calculated at least monthly, including once on the last day of the month, until the WAL is below 2 years.
(g)
Weighted average asset life with 50 percent slowdown in prepayment speeds.
The weighted average life (WAL) of a corporate credit union's financial assets, consisting of cash, investments, and loans, but excluding derivative contracts and equity investments, may not exceed 2.25 years when prepayment speeds are reduced by 50 percent. A corporate credit union must test its financial assets at least quarterly, including once on the last day of the calendar quarter, for compliance with this WAL limitation. When calculating its WAL, a corporate credit union must assume that no issuer or market options will be exercised. If the WAL of a corporate credit union's assets exceeds 2.25 years, this test must be calculated at least monthly, including once on the last day of the month, until the WAL with the 50 slowdown in prepayment speeds is below 2.25 years.
(h)
Government issued or guaranteed securities.
The WAL of investments that are issued or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. government, its agencies or sponsored enterprises, including investments that are fully insured or guaranteed (including accumulated dividends and interest) by the NCUSIF or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, will be multiplied by a factor of 0.50 for purposes of the WAL tests of paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section.
(i)
Effective and spread durations.
A corporate credit union must measure at least once a quarter, including once on the last day of the calendar quarter, the effective duration and spread durations of each of its assets and liabilities, where the values of these are affected by changes in interest rates or credit spreads.
(j)
Limit breaches.
(1)(i) If a corporate credit union's decline in NEV, base case NEV ratio, or any NEV ratio calculated under paragraph (d) of this section exceeds established or permitted limits, or the corporate credit union is unable to satisfy the tests in paragraph (f) or (g) of this section, the operating management of the corporate credit union must immediately report this information to its board of directors and ALCO; and
(ii) If the corporate credit union cannot adjust its balance sheet to meet the requirements of paragraph (d), (f), or (g) of this section within 10 calendar days after detection by the corporate credit union, the corporate credit union must notify in writing the Director of the Office of National Examinations and Supervision.
(2) If any breach described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section persists for 30 or more calendar days, the corporate credit union:
(i) Must immediately submit a detailed, written action plan to the NCUA that sets forth the time needed and means by which it intends to come into compliance and, if the NCUA determines that the plan is unacceptable, the corporate credit union must immediately restructure its balance sheet to bring the exposure back within compliance or adhere to an alternative course of action determined by the NCUA; and
(ii) If presently categorized as adequately capitalized or well capitalized for prompt corrective action purposes, and the breach was of paragraph (d) of this section, the corporate credit union will immediately be recategorized as undercapitalized until coming into compliance, and
(iii) If presently categorized as less than adequately capitalized for prompt corrective action purposes, and the breach was of paragraph (d) of this section, the corporate credit union will immediately be downgraded one additional capital category.

In the management of liquidity, a corporate credit union must:
(1) Evaluate the potential liquidity needs of its membership in a variety of economic scenarios;
(2) Regularly monitor and demonstrate accessibility to sources of internal and external liquidity;
(3) Keep a sufficient amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand to support its payment system obligations;

(1) The investment's characteristics and risks;
(2) The process to obtain and adequately evaluate the investment's market pricing, cash flows, and risk;

(4) The impact that either holding or selling the investment will have on the corporate credit union's earnings, liquidity, and capital in different interest rate environments; and

(ii) A corporate credit union investing in or lending to a corporate CUSO must obtain a written legal opinion that concludes the corporate CUSO is organized and operated in a manner that the corporate credit union will not reasonably be held liable for the obligations of the corporate CUSO. This opinion must address factors that have led courts to “pierce the corporate veil,” such as inadequate capitalization, lack of corporate identity, common boards of directors and employees, control of one entity over another, and lack of separate books and records.

(v) Will not acquire control, directly or indirectly, of another depository financial institution or to invest in shares, stocks, or obligations of an insurance company, trade association, liquidity facility, or similar organization;

(vii) Will inform the corporate, at least quarterly, of all the compensation paid by the CUSO to its employees who are also employees of the corporate credit union; and
(viii) Will comply with all the requirements of this section.
(e)

(4)
Excess capacity.
Excess capacity is the excess use or capacity remaining in facilities, equipment or services that: a corporate credit union properly invested in or established, in good faith, with the intent of serving its members; and it reasonably anticipates will be taken up by the future expansion of services to its members. A corporate credit union may sell or lease the excess capacity in facilities, equipment or services, such as office space, employees and data processing.

(8)
Trustee or custodial services.
Trustee services are services in which the corporate credit union is authorized to act under a written trust agreement to the extent permitted under part 724 of this chapter. Custodial and safekeeping services are services a corporate credit union performs on behalf of its member to act as custodian or safekeeper of investments.
(b)
Procedure for adding services that are not preapproved.
To provide a service to its members that is not preapproved by NCUA:
(1) A federal corporate credit union must request approval from NCUA. The request must include a full explanation and complete documentation of the service and how the service relates to a corporate credit union's authority to provide services to its members. The request must be submitted jointly to the Director of the Office of National Examinations and Supervision and the Secretary of the Board. The request will be treated as a petition to amend § 704.12 and NCUA will request public comment or otherwise act on the petition within a reasonable period of time. Before engaging in the formal approval process, a corporate credit union should seek an advisory opinion from NCUA's Office of General Counsel as to whether a proposed service is already
covered by one of the authorized categories without filing a petition to amend the regulation; and
(2) A state-chartered corporate credit union must submit a request for a waiver that complies with § 704.1(b) to the Director of the Office of National Examinations and Supervision.

The internal auditor's responsibilities will, at a minimum, comply with the Standards and Professional Practices of Internal Auditing, as established by the Institute of Internal Auditors. The internal auditor will report directly to the chair of the corporate credit union's supervisory committee, who may delegate supervision of the internal auditor's daily activities to the chief executive officer of the corporate credit union. The internal auditor's reports, findings, and recommendations will be in writing and presented to the supervisory committee no less than quarterly, and will be provided upon request to the IPA and NCUA.

§ 704.16
Contracts/written agreements.
Services, facilities, personnel, or equipment shared with any party shall be supported by a written contract, with the duties and responsibilities of each party specified and the allocation of service fee/expenses fully supported and documented.
§ 704.17
State-chartered corporate credit unions.
(a) This part does not expand the powers and authorities of any state-
chartered corporate credit union, beyond those powers and authorities provided under the laws of the state in which it was chartered.
(b) A state-chartered corporate credit union that is not insured by the NCUSIF, but that receives funds from federally insured credit unions, is considered an “institution-affiliated party” within the meaning of Section 206(r) of the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1786(r).
(c) NCUA will notify, consult with, and provide explanation to the appropriate state supervisory authority before taking administrative action against a state-chartered corporate credit union.
§ 704.18
Fidelity bond coverage.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides the fidelity bond requirements for employees and officials in corporate credit unions.
(b)
Review of bond coverage.
(1) The board of directors of each corporate credit union shall, at least annually, carefully review the bond coverage in force to determine its adequacy in relation to risk exposure and to the minimum requirements in this section.
(2) The board of directors of each corporate credit union must review all applications for purchase or renewal of its fidelity bond coverage. After review, the credit union's board must pass a resolution approving the purchase or renewal of fidelity bond coverage and delegate one member of the board, who is not an employee of the credit union, to sign the purchase or renewal agreement and all attachments; provided, however, that no board members may be a signatory on consecutive purchase or renewal agreements for the same fidelity bond coverage policy.
(c)
Minimum coverage; approved forms.
(1) The fidelity bond coverage must be purchased from a company holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury.
(2) Fidelity bonds must provide coverage for the fraud and dishonesty of all employees, directors, officers, and supervisory and credit committee members.
(3) The NCUA Board must approve all bond forms before a corporate credit union may use them. Corporate credit unions may not use any bond form that has been amended since the time the NCUA Board approved the form or any rider, endorsement, renewal, or other document that limits coverage of approved bond forms without receiving approval from the NCUA Board. Approval on all bond forms expires 10 years after the date the NCUA Board approved or reapproved use of the bond form unless otherwise determined by the NCUA Board; provided, however, that any bond forms approved before 2019 will expire on January 1, 2029, unless otherwise determined by the NCUA Board. The NCUA reserves the right to review a bond form at any point after its approval.
(4) Fidelity bonds must include an option for the liquidating agent to purchase coverage in the event of an involuntary liquidation that extends the discovery period for a covered loss for at least one year after liquidation. In the case of a voluntary liquidation, fidelity bonds must remain in effect, or provide that the discovery period is extended, for at least four months after the final distribution of assets.
(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all bonds must include a provision, in a form approved by the NCUA Board, requiring written notification by surety to NCUA:
(i) When the fidelity bond of a credit union is terminated in its entirety;
(ii) When fidelity bond coverage is terminated, by issuance of a written notice, on an employee, director, officer, supervisory or credit committee member; or
(iii) When a deductible is increased above permissible limits. Said notification shall be sent to NCUA and shall include a brief statement of cause for termination or increase.
(d)
Minimum coverage amounts.
(1) The minimum amount of bond coverage will be computed based on the corporate credit union's daily average net assets for the preceding calendar year. The following table lists the minimum requirements:
Daily average net assets
Minimum
bond
(million)
Less than $50 million
$1.0
$50-$99 million
2.0
$100-$499 million
4.0
$500-$999 million
6.0
$1.0-$1.999 billion
8.0
$2.0-$4.999 billion
10.0
$5.0-$9.999 billion
15.0
$10.0-$24.999 billion
20.0
$25.0 billion plus
25.0
(2) It is the duty of the board of directors of each corporate credit union to provide adequate protection to meet its unique circumstances by obtaining, when necessary, bond coverage in excess of the minimums in the table in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(e)
Deductibles.
(1) The maximum amount of deductibles allowed are based on the corporate credit union's leverage ratio. The following table sets out the maximum deductibles, except that in each category the maximum deductible shall be $5 million:
Leverage ratio
Maximum deductible
Less than 1.0 percent
7.5 percent of Tier 1 capital.
1.0-1.74 percent
10.0 percent of Tier 1 capital.
1.75-2.24 percent
12.0 percent of Tier 1 capital.
Greater than 2.25 percent
15.0 percent of Tier 1 capital.
(2) A deductible may be applied separately to one or more insuring clauses in a blanket bond. Deductibles in excess of those showing in this section must have the written approval of NCUA at least 30 calendar days prior to the effective date of the deductibles.
(f)
Additional coverage.
NCUA may require additional coverage for any corporate credit union when, in the opinion of NCUA, current coverage is insufficient. The board of directors of the corporate credit union must obtain additional coverage within 30 calendar days after the date of written notice from NCUA.
[62 FR 12938, Mar. 19, 1997, as amended at 67 FR 65657, Oct. 25, 2002; 76 FR 79533, Dec. 22, 2011; 80 FR 25939, May 6, 2015; 84 FR 35524, July 24, 2019]
§ 704.19
Disclosure of executive compensation.
(a)
Annual disclosure.
A corporate credit union must annually prepare and maintain a disclosure of the dollar amount of compensation paid to its most highly compensated employees, including compensation from any CUSO in which the corporate credit union has invested or made a loan, in accordance with the following schedule:
(1) For corporate credit unions with forty-one or more full time employees, disclosure is required of the compensation paid to the five most highly compensated employees;

(4) In all cases, compensation paid to the corporate credit union's chief executive officer must also be disclosed, if the chief executive officer is not already included among the most highly compensated employees described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.
(b)
Availability of disclosure.
Any member may obtain a copy of the most current disclosure, and all disclosures for the previous three years, on request made in person or in writing. The corporate credit union must provide the disclosure(s), at no cost to the member, within five business days of receiving the request. In addition, the corporate must distribute the most current disclosure to all its members at least once a year, either in the annual report or in some other manner of the corporate's choosing.
(c)
Supplemental information.
In providing the disclosure required by this section, a corporate credit union may also provide supplementary information to put the disclosure in context, for example, salary surveys, a discussion of compensation in relation to other credit union expenses, or compensation information from similarly sized credit unions or financial institutions.
(d)
Special rule for mergers.
With respect to any merger involving a corporate credit union that would result in a material increase in compensation,
i.e.,
an increase of more than 15 percent or $10,000, whichever is greater,
for any senior executive officer or director of the merging corporate, the corporate must:
(1) Describe the compensation arrangement in the merger plan documents submitted to NCUA for approval of the merger, pursuant to § 708b of this part; and
(2) In the case of any federally chartered corporate credit union, describe the compensation arrangement in the materials provided to the membership of the merging credit union before the member vote on approving the merger.

§ 704.22
Membership fees.
(a) A corporate credit union may charge its members a membership fee. The fee may be one-time or periodic.
(b) The corporate credit union must calculate the fee uniformly for all members as a percentage of each member's assets, except that the corporate credit union may reduce the amount of the fee for members that have contributed capital to the corporate credit union. Any reduction must be proportional to the amount of the member's nondepleted contributed capital.

Pt. 704, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 704—Capital Prioritization and Model Forms

# Part I—Optional Capital Prioritization
Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, a corporate credit union, at its option, may determine that capital contributed to the corporate credit union on or after January 18, 2011 will have priority, for purposes of availability to absorb losses and payout in liquidation, over capital contributed to the corporate credit union before that date. The board of directors at a corporate credit union that desires to make this determination must:
(a) On or before January 18, 2011, adopt a resolution implementing its determination.
(b) Inform the credit union's members and NCUA, in writing and as soon as practicable after adoption of the resolution, of the contents of the board resolution.
(c) Ensure the credit union uses the appropriate initial and periodic Model Form disclosures in Part II below.

# Part II—Model Forms
Part II contains model forms intended for use by corporate credit unions to aid in compliance with the capital disclosure requirements of § 704.3 and Part I of this Appendix.

# Model Form A

# Terms and Conditions of Nonperpetual Capital

# Note:
This form is for use on and after October 20, 2011 in the circumstances where the credit union has determined NOT to give newly issued capital priority over older capital as described in Part I of this Appendix. Also, corporate credit unions should ensure that existing membership capital accounts that do not meet the qualifying conditions for nonperpetual capital are modified so as to meet those conditions.

# Terms and Conditions of Nonperpetual Capital Account
(1) A nonperpetual capital account is not subject to share insurance coverage by the NCUSIF or other deposit insurer.
(2) A nonperpetual capital account is not releasable due solely to the merger, charter conversion or liquidation of the member credit union. In the event of a merger, the nonperpetual capital account transfers to the continuing credit union. In the event of a charter conversion, the nonperpetual capital account transfers to the new institution. In the event of liquidation, the nonperpetual capital account may be released to facilitate the payout of shares with the prior written approval of NCUA.
(3) If the nonperpetual capital account is a notice account, a member credit union may withdraw the nonperpetual capital with a minimum of five years' notice. If the nonperpetual capital account is a term instrument it may be redeemed only at maturity. The corporate credit union may not redeem any account prior to the expiration of the notice period, or maturity, without the prior written approval of the NCUA.
(4) Nonperpetual capital cannot be used to pledge borrowings.
(5) Nonperpetual capital is available to cover losses that exceed retained earnings and perpetual contributed capital. Any such losses will be distributed
pro rata
among nonperpetual capital account holders at the time the loss is realized. To the extent that NCA funds are used to cover losses, the corporate credit union is prohibited from restoring or replenishing the affected accounts under any circumstances.
(6) Where the corporate credit union is liquidated, nonperpetual capital accounts are payable only after satisfaction of all liabilities of the liquidation estate including uninsured obligations to shareholders and the NCUSIF. However, nonperpetual capital that is used to cover losses in a calendar year previous to the year of liquidation has no claim against the liquidation estate.
(7) Where the corporate credit union is merged into another corporate credit union, the nonperpetual capital account will transfer to the continuing corporate credit union. For notice accounts, the five-year notice period for withdrawal of the nonperpetual capital account will remain in effect. For term accounts, the original term will remain in effect.
(8) If a term certificate—: The nonperpetual capital account is a term certificate that will mature on—(date)—(insert date with a minimum five-year original maturity).
I have read the above terms and conditions and I understand them.
I further agree to maintain in the credit union's files the annual notice of terms and conditions of the nonperpetual capital account.
The notice form must be signed by either all of the directors of the member credit union or, if authorized by board resolution, the chair and secretary of the board of the credit union.
The annual disclosure notice form must be signed by the chair of the corporate credit union. The chair must then sign a statement that certifies that the notice has been sent to member credit unions with nonperpetual capital accounts. The certification must be maintained in the corporate credit union's files and be available for examiner review.

Pt. 704, App. B

# Appendix B to Part 704—Expanded Authorities and Requirements
A corporate credit union may obtain all or part of the expanded authorities contained in
this appendix if it meets the applicable requirements of part 704 and appendix B, fulfills additional management, infrastructure, and asset and liability requirements, and receives NCUA's written approval. Additional guidance is set forth in the NCUA publication Guidelines for Submission of Requests for Expanded Authority.
A corporate credit union seeking expanded authorities must submit to NCUA a self-assessment plan supporting its request. A corporate credit union may adopt expanded authorities when NCUA has provided final approval. If NCUA denies a request for expanded authorities, it will advise the corporate credit union of the reason(s) for the denial and what it must do to resubmit its request. NCUA may revoke these expanded authorities at any time if an analysis indicates a significant deficiency. NCUA will notify the corporate credit union in writing of the identified deficiency. A corporate credit union may request, in writing, reinstatement of the revoked authorities by providing a self-assessment plan detailing how it has corrected the deficiency.
A state chartered corporate credit union may not exercise any expanded authority that exceeds the powers and authorities provided for under its state laws. Accordingly, requests by state chartered corporate credit unions for expansions under this part must be approved by the state regulator before being submitted to NCUA.

# Minimum Requirement
In order to participate in any of the authorities set forth in Base-Plus, Part I, Part II, Part III, or Part IV of this Appendix, a corporate credit union must evaluate monthly, including once on the last day of the month, the changes in NEV, NEV ratio, NII, WAL, and duration as required by paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (e), (f), (g), and (i) of § 704.8.

# Part I
(a) A corporate credit union that has met all the requirements established by NCUA for this Part I, including a minimum leverage ratio of at least six percent, may:
(1) Purchase an investment after conducting and documenting an analysis that reasonably concludes the investment is at least investment grade;
(2) Engage in short sales of permissible investments to reduce interest rate risk;

(b) In performing the rate stress tests set forth in § 704.8(d), the NEV of a corporate credit union that has met the requirements of this Part I may decline as much as:
(1) 20 percent;
(2) 28 percent if the corporate credit union has a seven percent minimum leverage ratio and a two and a half percent retained earnings ratio, and is specifically approved by the NCUA; or
(3) 35 percent if the corporate credit union has an eight percent minimum leverage ratio and a three percent retained earnings ratio and is specifically approved by the NCUA.
(c) The maximum aggregate amount in unsecured loans and lines of credit to any one member credit union, excluding pass-through and guaranteed loans from the CLF and the NCUSIF, must not exceed 100 percent of the corporate credit union's total capital. The board of directors must establish the limit, as a percent of the corporate credit union's total capital plus pledged shares, for secured loans and lines of credit.
(d) The aggregate total of investments purchased under the authority of Part I (a)(1) and Part I (a)(2) may not exceed the lower of 500 percent of the corporate credit union's total capital or 25 percent of assets.

Before purchasing an investment, the corporate credit union must conduct and document an analysis that reasonably concludes the foreign issue or issuer has no more than a minimal amount of credit risk;
(2) For each approved foreign bank line, the corporate credit union must identify the specific banking centers and branches to which it will lend funds;
(3) Obligations of any single foreign obligor may not exceed 25 percent of total capital or $5 million, whichever is greater; and

(4) The corporate credit union must comply with § 704.10 of this part if the credit quality of the counterparty deteriorates below the minimum credit quality standards established by the corporate credit union's board of directors.

# Part IV
A corporate credit union that has met all the requirements established by NCUA for this Part IV may participate in loans with member natural person credit unions as approved by the NCUA and subject to the following:
(a) The maximum aggregate amount of participation loans with any one member credit union must not exceed 25 percent of capital; and
(b) The maximum aggregate amount of participation loans with all member credit unions will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the NCUA.

# Part I: Introduction

# (a) Scope
(1) This Appendix explains how a corporate credit union must compute its risk-weighted assets for purposes of determining its capital ratios.
(2) Risk-weighted assets equal risk-weighted on-balance sheet assets (computed under Section II(a) of this Appendix), plus risk-weighted off-balance sheet activities (computed under Section II(b) of this Appendix), plus risk-weighted recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, and certain other positions (computed under Section II(c) of this Appendix).
(3) Assets not included (
i.e.,
deducted from capital) for purposes of calculating capital under part 704 are not included in calculating risk-weighted assets.
(4) Although this Appendix describes risk-weightings for various assets and activities, this Appendix does not provide authority for corporate credit unions to invest in or purchase any particular type of asset or to engage in any particular type of activity. A corporate credit union
must have other identifiable authority
for any investment it makes or activity it engages in. So, for example, this Appendix describes risk weightings for subordinated securities. Section 704.5, however, prohibits corporate credit unions from investing in subordinated securities, and so a corporate credit union cannot invest in subordinated securities.

# (b) Definitions
The following definitions apply to this Appendix. Additional definitions, applicable to this entire part, are located in § 704.2 of this part.
Cash items in the process of collection
means checks or drafts in the process of collection that are drawn on another depository institution, including a central bank, and that are payable immediately upon presentation; U.S. Government checks that are drawn on the United States Treasury or any other U.S. Government or Government-sponsored agency and that are payable immediately upon presentation; broker's security drafts and commodity or bill-of-lading drafts payable immediately upon presentation; and unposted debits.
Commitment
means any arrangement that obligates a corporate credit union to:
(1) Purchase loans or securities;
(2) Extend credit in the form of loans or leases, participations in loans or leases,
overdraft facilities, revolving credit facilities, home equity lines of credit, eligible ABCP liquidity facilities, or similar transactions.
Depository institution
means a financial institution that engages in the business of providing financial services; that is recognized as a bank or a credit union by the supervisory or monetary authorities of the country of its incorporation and the country of its principal banking operations; that receives deposits to a substantial extent in the regular course of business; and that has the power to accept demand deposits. In the United States, this definition encompasses all federally insured offices of commercial banks, mutual and stock savings banks, savings or building and loan associations (stock and mutual), cooperative banks, credit unions, and international banking facilities of domestic depository institutions.
Bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies are excluded from this definition. For the purposes of assigning risk-weights, the differentiation between OECD depository institutions and non-OECD depository institutions is based on the country of incorporation. Claims on branches and agencies of foreign banks located in the United States are to be categorized on the basis of the parent bank's country of incorporation.
Direct credit substitute
means an arrangement in which a corporate credit union assumes, in form or in substance, credit risk associated with an on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet asset or exposure that was not previously owned by the corporate credit union (third-party asset) and the risk assumed by the corporate credit union exceeds the
pro rata
share of the corporate credit union's interest in the third-party asset. If a corporate credit union has no claim on the third-party asset, then the corporate credit union's assumption of any credit risk is a direct credit substitute. Direct credit substitutes include:
(1) Financial standby letters of credit that support financial claims on a third party that exceed a corporate credit union's
pro rata
share in the financial claim;
(2) Guarantees, surety arrangements, credit derivatives, and similar instruments backing financial claims that exceed a corporate credit union's
pro rata
share in the financial claim;
(3) Purchased subordinated interests that absorb more than their
pro rata
share of losses from the underlying assets, including any tranche of asset-backed securities that is not the most senior tranche;
(4) Credit derivative contracts under which the corporate credit union assumes more than its
pro rata
share of credit risk on a third-party asset or exposure;
(5) Loans or lines of credit that provide credit enhancement for the financial obligations of a third party;
(6) Purchased loan servicing assets if the servicer is responsible for credit losses or if the servicer makes or assumes credit-enhancing representations and warranties with respect to the loans serviced. Servicer cash advances as defined in this section are not direct credit substitutes;
(7) Clean-up calls on third-party assets. However, clean-up calls that are 10 percent or less of the original pool balance and that are exercisable at the option of the corporate credit union are not direct credit substitutes; and
(8) Liquidity facilities that provide support to asset-backed commercial paper.
Exchange rate contracts
means cross-currency interest rate swaps; forward foreign exchange rate contracts; currency options purchased; and any similar instrument that, in the opinion of the NCUA, may give rise to similar risks.
Face amount
means the notional principal, or face value, amount of an off-balance sheet item or the amortized cost of an on-balance sheet asset.
Financial asset
means cash or other monetary instrument, evidence of debt, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity, or a contract that conveys a right to receive or exchange cash or another financial instrument from another party.
Financial standby letter of credit
means a letter of credit or similar arrangement that represents an irrevocable obligation to a third-party beneficiary:
(1) To repay money borrowed by, or advanced to, or for the account of, a second party (the account party); or
(2) To make payment on behalf of the account party, in the event that the account party fails to fulfill its obligation to the beneficiary.
OECD-based country
means a member of that grouping of countries that are full members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) plus countries that have concluded special lending arrangements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) associated with the IMF's General Arrangements To Borrow. This term excludes any country that has rescheduled its external sovereign debt within the previous five years. A rescheduling of external sovereign debt generally would include any renegotiation of terms arising from a country's inability or unwillingness to meet its external debt service obligations, but generally would not include renegotiations of debt in the normal course of business, such as a renegotiation to allow the borrower to take advantage of a decline in interest rates or other change in market conditions.
Original maturity
means, with respect to a commitment, the earliest date after a commitment is made on which the commitment is scheduled to expire (
i.e.,
it will reach its stated maturity and cease to be binding on either party), provided that either:
(1) The commitment is not subject to extension or renewal and will actually expire on its stated expiration date; or
(2) If the commitment is subject to extension or renewal beyond its stated expiration date, the stated expiration date will be deemed the original maturity only if the extension or renewal must be based upon terms and conditions independently negotiated in good faith with the member at the time of the extension or renewal and upon a new, bona fide credit analysis utilizing current information on financial condition and trends.
Performance-based standby letter of credit
means any letter of credit, or similar arrangement, however named or described, which represents an irrevocable obligation to the beneficiary on the part of the issuer to make payment on account of any default by a third party in the performance of a nonfinancial or commercial obligation. Such letters of credit include arrangements backing subcontractors' and suppliers' performance, labor and materials contracts, and construction bids.
Prorated assets
means the total assets (as determined in the most recently available GAAP report but in no event more than one year old) of a consolidated CUSO multiplied by the corporate credit union's percentage of ownership of that consolidated CUSO.
Qualifying mortgage loan
means a loan that:
(1) Is fully secured by a first lien on a one-to four-family residential property;
(2) Is underwritten in accordance with prudent underwriting standards, including standards relating to the ratio of the loan amount to the value of the property (LTV ratio), as presented in the
Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies
(December 31, 1992). A nonqualifying mortgage loan that is paid down to an appropriate LTV ratio (calculated using value at origination, appraisal obtained within the prior six months, or updated value using an automated valuation model) may become a qualifying loan if it meets all other requirements of this definition;
(3) Maintains an appropriate LTV ratio based on the amortized principal balance of the loan; and
(4) Is performing and is not more than 90 days past due.
If a corporate credit union holds the first and junior lien(s) on a residential property and no other party holds an intervening lien, the transaction is treated as a single loan secured by a first lien for the purposes of determining the LTV ratio and the appropriate risk-weight under Appendix C. Also, a loan to an individual borrower for the construction of the borrower's home may be included as a qualifying mortgage loan.
Qualifying multifamily mortgage loan.
(1)
Qualifying multifamily mortgage loan
means a loan secured by a first lien on multifamily residential properties consisting of 5 or more dwelling units, provided that:
(i) The amortization of principal and interest occurs over a period of not more than 30 years;
(ii) The original minimum maturity for repayment of principal on the loan is not less than seven years;
(iii) When considering the loan for placement in a lower risk-weight category, all principal and interest payments have been made on a timely basis in accordance with its terms for the preceding year;
(iv) The loan is performing and not 90 days or more past due;
(v) The loan is made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards; and
(vi) If the interest rate on the loan does not change over the term of the loan, the current loan balance amount does not exceed 80 percent of the value of the property securing the loan, and for the property's most recent calendar year, the ratio of annual net operating income generated by the property (before payment of any debt service on the loan) to annual debt service on the loan is not less than 120 percent, or in the case of cooperative or other not-for-profit housing projects, the property generates sufficient cash flows to provide comparable protection to the institution; or
(vii) If the interest rate on the loan changes over the term of the loan, the current loan balance amount does not exceed 75 percent of the value of the property securing the loan, and for the property's most recent calendar year, the ratio of annual net operating income generated by the property (before payment of any debt service on the loan) to annual debt service on the loan is not less than 115 percent, or in the case of cooperative or other not-for-profit housing projects, the property generates sufficient cash flows to provide comparable protection to the institution.
(2) For purposes of paragraphs (1)(vi) and (1)(vii) of this definition, the term value of the property means, at origination of a loan to purchase a multifamily property, the lower of the purchase price or the amount of the initial appraisal, or if appropriate, the initial evaluation. In cases not involving purchase of a multifamily loan, the value of the property is determined by the most current appraisal, or if appropriate, the most current evaluation. In cases where a borrower refinances a loan on an existing property, as an alternative to paragraphs (1)(iii), (1)(vi), and (1)(vii) of this definition:
(i) All principal and interest payments on the loan being refinanced have been made on
a timely basis in accordance with the terms of that loan for the preceding year; and
(ii) The net income on the property for the preceding year would support timely principal and interest payments on the new loan in accordance with the applicable debt service requirement.
Qualifying residential construction loan,
also referred to as a residential bridge loan, means a loan made in accordance with sound lending principles satisfying the following criteria:
(1) The builder must have substantial project equity in the home construction project;
(2) The residence being constructed must be a 1-4 family residence sold to a home purchaser;
(3) The lending entity must obtain sufficient documentation from a permanent lender (which may be the construction lender) demonstrating that the home buyer intends to purchase the residence and has the ability to obtain a permanent qualifying mortgage loan sufficient to purchase the residence;
(4) The home purchaser must have made a substantial earnest money deposit;
(5) The construction loan must not exceed 80 percent of the sales price of the residence;
(6) The construction loan must be secured by a first lien on the lot, residence under construction, and other improvements;
(7) The lending credit union must retain sufficient undisbursed loan funds throughout the construction period to ensure project completion;
(8) The builder must incur a significant percentage of direct costs (
i.e.,
the actual costs of land, labor, and material) before any drawdown on the loan;
(9) If at any time during the life of the construction loan any of the criteria of this rule are no longer satisfied, the corporate must immediately recategorize the loan at a 100 percent risk-weight and must accurately report the loan in the corporate's next quarterly call report;
(10) The home purchaser must intend that the home will be owner-occupied;
(11) The home purchaser(s) must be an individual(s), not a partnership, joint venture, trust corporation, or any other entity (including an entity acting as a sole proprietorship) that is purchasing the home(s) for speculative purposes; and
(12) The loan must be performing and not more than 90 days past due.
The NCUA retains the discretion to determine that any loans not meeting sound lending principles must be placed in a higher risk-weight category. The NCUA also reserves the discretion to modify these criteria on a case-by-case basis provided that any such modifications are not inconsistent with the safety and soundness objectives of this definition.
Qualifying securities firm
means:
(1) A securities firm incorporated in the United States that is a broker-dealer that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and that complies with the SEC's net capital regulations (17 CFR 240.15c3(1)); and
(2) A securities firm incorporated in any other OECD-based country, if the corporate credit union is able to demonstrate that the securities firm is subject to consolidated supervision and regulation (covering its subsidiaries, but not necessarily its parent organizations) comparable to that imposed on depository institutions in OECD countries. Such regulation must include risk-based capital requirements comparable to those imposed on depository institutions under the Accord on International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards (1988, as amended in 1998).
Recourse
means a corporate credit union's retention, in form or in substance, of any credit risk directly or indirectly associated with an asset it has sold (in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) that exceeds a
pro rata
share of that corporate credit union's claim on the asset. If a corporate credit union has no claim on an asset it has sold, then the retention of any credit risk is recourse. A recourse obligation typically arises when a corporate credit union transfers assets in a sale and retains an explicit obligation to repurchase assets or to absorb losses due to a default on the payment of principal or interest or any other deficiency in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party. Recourse may also exist implicitly if a corporate credit union provides credit enhancement beyond any contractual obligation to support assets it has sold. Recourse obligations include:
(1) Credit-enhancing representations and warranties made on transferred assets;
(2) Loan servicing assets retained pursuant to an agreement under which the corporate credit union will be responsible for losses associated with the loans serviced. Servicer cash advances as defined in this section are not recourse obligations;
(3) Retained subordinated interests that absorb more than their
pro rata
share of losses from the underlying assets;
(4) Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase, if the assets are not already included on the balance sheet;
(5) Loan strips sold without contractual recourse where the maturity of the transferred portion of the loan is shorter than the maturity of the commitment under which the loan is drawn;
(6) Credit derivatives that absorb more than the corporate credit union's
pro rata
share of losses from the transferred assets;
(7) Clean-up calls on assets the corporate credit union has sold. However, clean-up calls that are 10 percent or less of the original pool balance and that are exercisable at
the option of the corporate credit union are not recourse arrangements; and
(8) Liquidity facilities that provide support to asset-backed commercial paper.
Replacement
cost means, with respect to interest rate and exchange-rate contracts, the loss that would be incurred in the event of a counterparty default, as measured by the net cost of replacing the contract at the current market value. If default would result in a theoretical profit, the replacement value is considered to be zero. This mark-to-market process must incorporate changes in both interest rates and counterparty credit quality.
Residential properties
means houses, condominiums, cooperative units, and manufactured homes. This definition does not include boats or motor homes, even if used as a primary residence, or timeshare properties.
Residual interest.
(1)
Residual interest
means any on-balance sheet asset that:
(i) Represents an interest (including a beneficial interest) created by a transfer that qualifies as a sale (in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) of financial assets, whether through a securitization or otherwise; and
(ii) Exposes a corporate credit union to credit risk directly or indirectly associated with the transferred asset that exceeds a
pro rata
share of that corporate credit union's claim on the asset, whether through subordination provisions or other credit enhancement techniques.
(2) Residual interests generally include spread accounts, cash collateral accounts, retained subordinated interests (and other forms of overcollateralization), and similar assets that function as a credit enhancement. Residual interests further include those exposures that, in substance, cause the corporate credit union to retain the credit risk of an asset or exposure that had qualified as a residual interest before it was sold.
(3) Corporate credit unions will use this definition of the term “residual interests,” and not the definition in § 704.2, for purposes of applying this Appendix.
Risk participation
means a participation in which the originating party remains liable to the beneficiary for the full amount of an obligation (
e.g.,
a direct credit substitute), notwithstanding that another party has acquired a participation in that obligation.
Risk-weighted assets
means the sum total of risk-weighted on-balance sheet assets, as calculated under Section II(a) of this Appendix, and the total of risk-weighted off-balance sheet credit equivalent amounts. The total of risk-weighted off-balance sheet credit equivalent amounts equals the risk-weighted off-balance sheet activities as calculated under Section II(b) of this Appendix plus the risk-weighted recourse obligations, risk-weighted direct credit substitutes, and certain other risk-weighted positions as calculated under Section II(c) of this Appendix.
Servicer cash advance
means funds that a residential mortgage servicer advances to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments, including advances made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses to facilitate the timely collection of the loan. A servicer cash advance is not a recourse obligation or a direct credit substitute if:
(1) The servicer is entitled to full reimbursement and this right is not subordinated to other claims on the cash flows from the underlying asset pool; or
(2) For any one loan, the servicer's obligation to make nonreimbursable advances is contractually limited to an insignificant amount of the outstanding principal amount on that loan.
Structured financing program
means a program where receivable interests and asset-or mortgage-backed securities issued by multiple participants are purchased by a special purpose entity that repackages those exposures into securities that can be sold to investors. Structured financing programs allocate credit risk, generally, between the participants and credit enhancement provided to the program.
Unconditionally cancelable
means, with respect to a commitment-type lending arrangement, that the corporate credit union may, at any time, with or without cause, refuse to advance funds or extend credit under the facility.
United States Government or its agencies
means an instrumentality of the U.S. Government whose debt obligations are fully and explicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the United States Government.
United States Government-sponsored agency or corporation
means an agency or corporation originally established or chartered to serve public purposes specified by the United States Congress but whose obligations are not explicitly guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government.

# Part II: Risk-Weightings

# (a) On-Balance Sheet Assets
Except as provided in Section II(b) of this Appendix, risk-weighted on-balance sheet assets are computed by multiplying the on-balance sheet asset amounts times the appropriate risk-weight categories. The risk-weight categories are:
(1) Zero percent Risk-Weight (Category 1).
(i) Cash, including domestic and foreign currency owned and held in all offices of a corporate credit union or in transit. Any foreign currency held by a corporate credit union must be converted into U.S. dollar equivalents;
(ii) Securities issued by and other direct claims on the U.S. Government or its agencies (to the extent such securities or claims
are unconditionally backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government) or the central government of an OECD country;
(iii) Notes and obligations issued or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government;
(iv) Deposit reserves at, claims on, and balances due from Federal Reserve Banks;
(v) The book value of paid-in Federal Reserve Bank stock;
(vi) That portion of assets directly and unconditionally guaranteed by the United States Government or its agencies, or the central government of an OECD country.
(viii) Claims on, and claims guaranteed by, a qualifying securities firm that are collateralized by cash on deposit in the corporate credit union or by securities issued or guaranteed by the United States Government or its agencies, or the central government of an OECD country. To be eligible for this risk-weight, the corporate credit union must maintain a positive margin of collateral on the claim on a daily basis, taking into account any change in a corporate credit union's exposure to the obligor or counterparty under the claim in relation to the market value of the collateral held in support of the claim.
(2) 20 percent Risk-Weight (Category 2).
(i) Cash items in the process of collection;
(ii) That portion of assets conditionally guaranteed by the United States Government or its agencies, or the central government of an OECD country;
(iii) That portion of assets collateralized by the current market value of securities issued or guaranteed by the United States government or its agencies, or the central government of an OECD country;
(iv) Securities (not including equity securities) issued by and other claims on the U.S. Government or its agencies which are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government;
(v) Securities (not including equity securities) issued by, or other direct claims on, United States Government-sponsored agencies;
(vi) That portion of assets guaranteed by United States Government-sponsored agencies;
(vii) That portion of assets collateralized by the current market value of securities issued or guaranteed by United States Government-sponsored agencies;
(viii) Claims on, and claims guaranteed by, a qualifying securities firm, subject to the following conditions:
(A) A qualifying securities firm must meet the minimum credit quality standards as established by the corporate credit union's board of directors or have at least one issue of long-term unsecured debt that is reasonably determined to present no more than a minimal amount of credit risk, whichever requirement is more stringent. Alternatively, a qualifying securities firm may rely on the creditworthiness of its parent consolidated company, if the parent consolidated company guarantees the claim.
(B) A collateralized claim on a qualifying securities firm does not have to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section of Appendix C if the claim arises under a contract that:
(
1
) Is a reverse repurchase/repurchase agreement or securities lending/borrowing transaction executed using standard industry documentation;
(
2
) Is collateralized by debt or equity securities that are liquid and readily marketable;
(
3
) Is marked-to-market daily;
(
4
) Is subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement under the standard industry documentation; and
(
5
) Can be liquidated, terminated or accelerated immediately in bankruptcy or similar proceeding, and the security or collateral agreement will not be stayed or avoided under applicable law of the relevant jurisdiction. For example, a claim is exempt from the automatic stay in bankruptcy in the United States if it arises under a securities contract or a repurchase agreement subject to Section 555 or 559 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. 555 or 559), a qualified financial contract under Section 207(c)(8) of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1787(c)(8)) or Section 11(e)(8) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1821(e)(8)), or a netting contract between or among financial institutions under Sections 401-407 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (12 U.S.C. 4401-4407), or Regulation EE (12 CFR part 231).
(C) If the securities firm uses the claim to satisfy its applicable capital requirements, the claim is not eligible for a risk-weight under this paragraph II(a)(2)(viii);
(ix) Claims representing general obligations of any public-sector entity in an OECD country, and that portion of any claims guaranteed by any such public-sector entity;
(x) Balances due from and all claims on domestic depository institutions. This includes demand deposits and other transaction accounts, savings deposits and time certificates of deposit, federal funds sold, loans to other depository institutions, including overdrafts and term federal funds, holdings of the corporate credit union's own discounted acceptances for which the account party is a depository institution, holdings of bankers acceptances of other institutions and securities issued by depository institutions, except those that qualify as capital;
(xi) The book value of paid-in Federal Home Loan Bank stock;
(xii) Deposit reserves at, claims on and balances due from the Federal Home Loan Banks;
(xiii) Assets collateralized by cash held in a segregated deposit account by the reporting corporate credit union;
(xiv) Claims on, or guaranteed by, official multilateral lending institutions or regional development institutions in which the United States Government is a shareholder or contributing member;
1
1
These institutions include, but are not limited to, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Investments Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements.
(xv) That portion of assets collateralized by the current market value of securities issued by official multilateral lending institutions or regional development institutions in which the United States Government is a shareholder or contributing member.
(xvi) All claims on depository institutions incorporated in an OECD country, and all assets backed by the full faith and credit of depository institutions incorporated in an OECD country. This includes the credit equivalent amount of participations in commitments and standby letters of credit sold to other depository institutions incorporated in an OECD country, but only if the originating bank remains liable to the member or beneficiary for the full amount of the commitment or standby letter of credit. Also included in this category are the credit equivalent amounts of risk participations in bankers' acceptances conveyed to other depository institutions incorporated in an OECD country. However, bank-issued securities that qualify as capital of the issuing bank are not included in this risk category;
(xvii) Claims on, or guaranteed by depository institutions other than the central bank, incorporated in a non-OECD country, with a remaining maturity of one year or less;
(xviii) That portion of local currency claims conditionally guaranteed by central governments of non-OECD countries, to the extent the corporate credit union has local currency liabilities in that country.
(3) 50 percent Risk-Weight (Category 3).
(i) Revenue bonds issued by any public-sector entity in an OECD country for which the underlying obligor is a public-sector entity, but which are repayable solely from the revenues generated from the project financed through the issuance of the obligations;
(ii) Qualifying mortgage loans and qualifying multifamily mortgage loans;
(iii) Privately-issued mortgage-backed securities (
i.e.,
those that do not carry the guarantee of the U.S. Government, a U.S. government agency, or a U.S. government sponsored enterprise) representing an interest in qualifying mortgage loans or qualifying multifamily mortgage loans. If the security is backed by qualifying multifamily mortgage loans, the corporate credit union must receive timely payments of principal and interest in accordance with the terms of the security. Payments will generally be considered timely if they are not 30 days past due; and
(iv) Qualifying residential construction loans.
(4) 100 percent Risk-Weight (Category 4).
All assets not specified above or deducted from calculations of capital pursuant to § 704.2 and § 704.3 of this part, including, but not limited to:
(i) Consumer loans;
(ii) Commercial loans;
(iii) Home equity loans;
(iv) Non-qualifying mortgage loans;
(v) Non-qualifying multifamily mortgage loans;
(vi) Residential construction loans;
(vii) Land loans;
(viii) Nonresidential construction loans;
(ix) Obligations issued by any state or any political subdivision thereof for the benefit of a private party or enterprise where that party or enterprise, rather than the issuing state or political subdivision, is responsible for the timely payment of principal and interest on the obligations,
e.g.,
industrial development bonds;
(x) Debt securities not specifically risk-weighted in another category;
(xi) Investments in fixed assets and premises;
(xii) Servicing assets;
(xiii) Interest-only strips receivable;
(xiv) Equity investments;
(xv) The prorated assets of subsidiaries (except for the assets of consolidated CUSOs) to the extent such assets are included in adjusted total assets;
(xvi) All repossessed assets or assets that are more than 90 days past due; and
(xvii) Intangible assets not specifically weighted in some other category.
(5) Indirect ownership interests in pools of assets. Assets representing an indirect holding of a pool of assets,
e.g.,
mutual funds, are assigned to risk-weight categories under this section based upon the risk-weight that would be assigned to the assets in the portfolio of the pool. An investment in shares of a mutual fund whose portfolio consists primarily of various securities or money market instruments that, if held separately, would be assigned to different risk-weight categories, generally is assigned to the risk-weight category appropriate to the highest risk-weighted asset that the fund is permitted to hold in accordance with the investment objectives set forth in its prospectus.
The corporate credit union may, at its option, assign the investment on a
pro rata
basis to different risk-weight categories according to the investment limits in its prospectus. In no case will an investment in shares in any such fund be assigned to a total risk-weight less than 20 percent. If the corporate credit union chooses to assign investments on a
pro rata
basis, and the sum of the investment limits of assets in the fund's prospectus exceeds 100 percent, the corporate credit union must assign the highest
pro rata
amounts of its total investment to the higher risk categories. If, in order to maintain a necessary degree of short-term liquidity, a fund is permitted to hold an insignificant amount of its assets in short-term, highly liquid securities of superior credit quality that do not qualify for a preferential risk-weight, such securities will generally be disregarded in determining the risk-weight category into which the corporate credit union's holding in the overall fund should be assigned. The prudent use of hedging instruments by a mutual fund to reduce the risk of its assets will not increase the risk-weighting of the mutual fund investment. For example, the use of hedging instruments by a mutual fund to reduce the interest rate risk of its government bond portfolio will not increase the risk-weight of that fund above the 20 percent category. Nonetheless, if the fund engages in any activities that appear speculative in nature or has any other characteristics that are inconsistent with the preferential risk-weighting assigned to the fund's assets, holdings in the fund will be assigned to the 100 percent risk-weight category.
(6) Derivatives. Certain transactions or activities, such as derivatives transactions, may appear on a corporate credit union's balance sheet but are not specifically described in the Section II(a) on-balance sheet risk-weight categories. These items will be assigned risk-weights as described in Section II(b) or II(c) below.

# (b) Off-Balance Sheet Items
Except as provided in Section II(c) of this Appendix, risk-weighted off-balance sheet items are determined by the following two-step process. First, the face amount of the off-balance sheet item must be multiplied by the appropriate credit conversion factor listed in this Section II(b). This calculation translates the face amount of an off-balance sheet exposure into an on-balance sheet credit-equivalent amount. Second, the credit-equivalent amount must be assigned to the appropriate risk-weight category using the criteria regarding obligors, guarantors, and collateral listed in Section II(a) of this Appendix.
2
The following are the credit conversion factors and the off-balance sheet items to which they apply.
2
The sufficiency of collateral and guarantees for off-balance sheet items is determined by the market value of the collateral or the amount of the guarantee in relation to the face amount of the item, except for derivative contracts, for which this determination is generally made in relation to the credit equivalent amount. Collateral and guarantees are subject to the same provisions noted under paragraph II(d) of this Appendix C.
(1) 100 percent credit conversion factor (Group A).
(i) Risk participations purchased in bankers' acceptances;
(ii) Forward agreements and other contingent obligations with a certain draw down,
e.g.,
legally binding agreements to purchase assets at a specified future date. On the date a corporate credit union enters into a forward agreement or similar obligation, it should convert the principal amount of the assets to be purchased at 100 percent as of that date and then assign this amount to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor or guarantor of the item, or the nature of the collateral;
(iii) Indemnification of members whose securities the corporate credit union has lent as agent. If the member is not indemnified against loss by the corporate credit union, the transaction is excluded from the risk-based capital calculation. When a corporate credit union lends its own securities, the transaction is treated as a loan. When a corporate credit union lends its own securities or is acting as agent, agrees to indemnify a member, the transaction is assigned to the risk-weight appropriate to the obligor or collateral that is delivered to the lending or indemnifying institution or to an independent custodian acting on their behalf; and
(2) 50 percent credit conversion factor (Group B).
(i) Transaction-related contingencies, including, among other things, performance bonds and performance-based standby letters of credit related to a particular transaction;
(ii) Unused portions of commitments (including home equity lines of credit and eligible ABCP liquidity facilities) with an original maturity exceeding one year except those listed in paragraph II (b)(5) of this Appendix. For eligible ABCP liquidity facilities, the resulting credit equivalent amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the assets to be funded by the liquidity facility based on the assets of the obligor, after considering any collateral of guarantees.
(iii) Revolving underwriting facilities, note issuance facilities, and similar arrangements
pursuant to which the corporate credit union's CUSO or member can issue short-term debt obligations in its own name, but for which the corporate credit union has a legally binding commitment to either:
(A) Purchase the obligations the member is unable to sell by a stated date; or
(B) Advance funds to its member, if the obligations cannot be sold.
(3) 20 percent credit conversion factor (Group C). Trade-related contingencies,
i.e.,
short-term, self-liquidating instruments used to finance the movement of goods and collateralized by the underlying shipment. A commercial letter of credit is an example of such an instrument.
(4) Zero percent credit conversion factor (Group E). (i) Unused portions of commitments with an original maturity of one year or less;
(ii) Unused commitments with an original maturity greater than one year, if they are unconditionally cancelable at any time at the option of the corporate credit union and the corporate credit union has the contractual right to make, and in fact does make, either:
(A) A separate credit decision based upon the borrower's current financial condition before each drawing under the lending facility; or
(B) An annual (or more frequent) credit review based upon the borrower's current financial condition to determine whether or not the lending facility should be continued; and
(iii) The unused portion of retail credit card lines or other related plans that are unconditionally cancelable by the corporate credit union in accordance with applicable law.
(5) Off-balance sheet derivative contracts; interest rate and foreign exchange rate contracts (Group F).
(i) Calculation of credit equivalent amounts. The credit equivalent amount of an off-balance sheet derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract in accordance with paragraph II(b)(6)(ii) of this Appendix is equal to the sum of the current credit exposure,
i.e.,
the replacement cost of the contract, and the potential future credit exposure of the contract. The calculation of credit equivalent amounts is measured in U.S. dollars, regardless of the currency or currencies specified in the contract.
(A) Current credit exposure. The current credit exposure of an off-balance sheet derivative contract is determined by the mark-to-market value of the contract. If the mark-to-market value is positive, then the current credit exposure equals that mark-to-market value. If the mark-to-market value is zero or negative, then the current exposure is zero. In determining its current credit exposure for multiple off-balance sheet derivative contracts executed with a single counterparty, a corporate credit union may net positive and negative mark-to-market values of off-balance sheet derivative contracts if subject to a bilateral netting contract as provided in paragraph II(b)(6)(ii) of this Appendix.
(B) Potential future credit exposure. The potential future credit exposure of an off-balance sheet derivative contract, including a contract with a negative mark-to-market value, is estimated by multiplying the notional principal by a credit conversion factor.
3
Corporate credit unions, subject to examiner review, should use the effective rather than the apparent or stated notional amount in this calculation. The conversion factors are:
4
3
For purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure for foreign exchange contracts and other similar contracts, in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, total notional principal is defined as the net receipts to each party falling due on each value date in each currency.
4
No potential future credit exposure is calculated for single currency interest rate swaps in which payments are made based upon two floating rate indices, so-called floating/floating or basis swaps; the credit equivalent amount is measured solely on the basis of the current credit exposure.

(ii) Off-balance sheet derivative contracts subject to bilateral netting contracts. In determining its current credit exposure for multiple off-balance sheet derivative contracts executed with a single counterparty, a corporate credit union may net off-balance sheet derivative contracts subject to a bilateral netting contract by offsetting positive
and negative mark-to-market values, provided that:
(A) The bilateral netting contract is in writing;
(B) The bilateral netting contract creates a single legal obligation for all individual off-balance sheet derivative contracts covered by the bilateral netting contract. In effect, the bilateral netting contract provides that the corporate credit union has a single claim or obligation either to receive or pay only the net amount of the sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values on the individual off-balance sheet derivative contracts covered by the bilateral netting contract. The single legal obligation for the net amount is operative in the event that a counterparty, or a counterparty to whom the bilateral netting contract has been validly assigned, fails to perform due to any of the following events: Default, insolvency, bankruptcy, or other similar circumstances;
(C) The corporate credit union obtains a written and reasoned legal opinion(s) representing, with a high degree of certainty, that in the event of a legal challenge, including one resulting from default, insolvency, bankruptcy or similar circumstances, the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the corporate credit union's exposure to be the net amount under:
(
1
) The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered or the equivalent location in the case of noncorporate entities, and if a branch of the counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;
(
2
) The law that governs the individual off-balance sheet derivative contracts covered by the bilateral netting contract; and
(
3
) The law that governs the bilateral netting contract;
(D) The corporate credit union establishes and maintains procedures to monitor possible changes in relevant law and to ensure that the bilateral netting contract continues to satisfy the requirements of this section; and
(E) The corporate credit union maintains in its files documentation adequate to support the netting of an off-balance sheet derivative contract.
5
5
By netting individual off-balance sheet derivative contracts for the purpose of calculating its credit equivalent amount, a corporate credit union represents that documentation adequate to support the netting of an off-balance sheet derivative contract is in the corporate credit union's files and available for inspection by the NCUA. Upon determination by the NCUA that a corporate credit union's files are inadequate or that a bilateral netting contract may not be legally enforceable under any one of the bodies of law described in paragraphs II(b)(5)(ii) of this Appendix, the underlying individual off-balance sheet derivative contracts may not be netted for the purposes of this section.
(iii) Walkaway clause. A bilateral netting contract that contains a walkaway clause is not eligible for netting for purposes of calculating the current credit exposure amount. The term “walkaway clause” means a provision in a bilateral netting contract that permits a nondefaulting counterparty to make a lower payment than it would make otherwise under the bilateral netting contract, or no payment at all, to a defaulter or the estate of a defaulter, even if the defaulter or the estate of the defaulter is a net creditor under the bilateral netting contract.
(iv) Risk-weighting. Once the corporate credit union determines the credit equivalent amount for an off-balance sheet derivative contract, that amount is assigned to the risk-weight category appropriate to the counterparty, or, if relevant, to the nature of any collateral or guarantee. Collateral held against a netting contract is not recognized for capital purposes unless it is legally available for all contracts included in the netting contract. However, the maximum risk-weight for the credit equivalent amount of such off-balance sheet derivative contracts is 50 percent.
(v) Exceptions. The following off-balance sheet derivative contracts are not subject to the above calculation, and therefore, are not part of the denominator of a corporate credit union's risk-based capital ratio:
(A) A foreign exchange rate contract with an original maturity of 14 calendar days or less; and
(B) Any interest rate or foreign exchange rate contract that is traded on an exchange requiring the daily payment of any variations in the market value of the contract.

# (c) Recourse Obligations, Direct Credit Substitutes, and Certain Other Positions
(1) In general. Except as otherwise permitted in this Section II(c), to determine the risk-weighted asset amount for a recourse obligation or a direct credit substitute (but not a residual interest):
(i) Multiply the full amount of the credit-enhanced assets for which the corporate credit union directly or indirectly retains or assumes credit risk by a 100 percent conversion factor (For a direct credit substitute that is an on-balance sheet asset (
e.g.,
a purchased subordinated security), a corporate credit union must use the amount of the direct credit substitute and the full amount of the asset it supports,
i.e.,
all the more senior positions in the structure); and
(ii) Assign this credit equivalent amount to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor in the underlying transaction, after considering any associated guarantees
or collateral. Section II(a) lists the risk-weight categories.
(2) Residual interests. Except as otherwise permitted under this Section II(c), a corporate credit union must maintain risk-based capital for residual interests as follows:
(i) Other residual interests. A corporate credit union must maintain risk-based capital for a residual interest equal to the face amount of the residual interest, even if the amount of risk-based capital that must be maintained exceeds the full risk-based capital requirement for the assets transferred.
(ii) Residual interests and other recourse obligations. Where a corporate credit union holds a residual interest and another recourse obligation in connection with the same transfer of assets, the corporate credit union must maintain risk-based capital equal to the greater of:
(A) The risk-based capital requirement for the residual interest as calculated under Section II(c)(2)(i) through (ii) of this Appendix; or
(B) The full risk-based capital requirement for the assets transferred, subject to the low-level recourse rules under Section II(c)(5) of this Appendix.
(3) Internal ratings-based approach—
(i) Calculation. Corporate credit unions with advanced risk management and reporting systems may seek NCUA approval to use credit risk models to calculate risk-weighted asset amounts for positions described in paragraphs II (c)(1) and (2) of this section of the Appendix C. In determining whether to grant approval, NCUA will consider the financial condition and risk management sophistication of the corporate credit union and the adequacy of the corporate credit union's risk models and supporting management information systems.
(ii) Consistent use of internal ratings-based approach. A corporate credit union that has been granted NCUA approval to use an internal ratings-based approach and that has determined to use such an approach must do so in a consistent manner for all securities so rated.
(4) Limitations on risk-based capital requirements—
(i) Low-level exposure rule. If the maximum contractual exposure to loss retained or assumed by a corporate credit union is less than the effective risk-based capital requirement, as determined in accordance with this Section II(c), for the assets supported by the corporate credit union's position, the risk-based capital requirement is limited to the corporate credit union's contractual exposure less any recourse liability account established in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This limitation does not apply when a corporate credit union provides credit enhancement beyond any contractual obligation to support assets it has sold.
(ii) Mortgage-related securities or participation certificates retained in a mortgage loan swap. If a corporate credit union holds a mortgage-related security or a participation certificate as a result of a mortgage loan swap with recourse, it must hold risk-based capital to support the recourse obligation and that percentage of the mortgage-related security or participation certificate that is not covered by the recourse obligation. The total amount of risk-based capital required for the security (or certificate) and the recourse obligation is limited to the risk-based capital requirement for the underlying loans, calculated as if the corporate credit union continued to hold these loans as an on-balance sheet asset.
(iii) Related on-balance sheet assets. If an asset is included in the calculation of the risk-based capital requirement under this Section II(c) and also appears as an asset on the corporate credit union's balance sheet, the corporate credit union must risk-weight the asset only under this Section II(c), except in the case of loan servicing assets and similar arrangements with embedded recourse obligations or direct credit substitutes. In that case, the corporate credit union must separately risk-weight the on-balance sheet servicing asset and the related recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes under this section, and incorporate these amounts into the risk-based capital calculation.
(5) Obligations of CUSOs. All recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes retained or assumed by a corporate credit union on the obligations of CUSOs in which the corporate credit union has an equity investment are risk-weighted in accordance with this Section II(c), unless the corporate credit union's equity investment is deducted from the credit union's capital and assets under § 704.2 and § 704.3.
(d)
Collateral.
The only forms of collateral that are recognized for risk-weighting purposes are cash on deposit in the corporate credit union; Treasuries, U.S. Government agency securities, and U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise securities; and securities issued by multilateral lending institutions or regional development banks. Claims secured by cash on deposit are assigned to the zero percent risk-weight category (to the extent of the cash amount). Claims secured by securities are assigned to the twenty percent risk-weight category (to the extent of the fair market value of the securities).

§ 705.1
Authority, purpose, and scope.
(a) This part 705 is issued by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) under section 130 of the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1772c-1, which implements the Community Development Credit Union Revolving Loan Fund Transfer Act (Pub. L. 99-609, 100 Stat. 3475 (Nov. 6, 1986)).
(b) This part describes how NCUA makes money available to credit unions from its Community Development Revolving Loan Fund (Fund). NCUA administers the Fund and makes both loans and technical assistance grants to credit unions in accordance with the eligibility criteria and other qualifications, subject to the terms and conditions set out in this part. All loans and technical assistance grants made under this part are subject to funds availability and NCUA's discretion.
(c) NCUA's policy is to revolve the loan funds to credit unions as often as practical in order to achieve maximum economic impact on as many credit unions as possible.
(d) The financial awards provided to credit unions through the Fund will better enable them to support the communities in which they operate; provide basic financial services to low-income residents of these communities, and result in more opportunities for the residents of those communities to improve their financial circumstances.
(e) The Fund is intended to support the efforts of credit unions through loans and technical assistance grants needed for:
(1) Providing basic financial and related services to residents in their communities;
(2) Enhancing their capacity to better serve their members and the communities in which they operate; and
(3) Responding to emergencies.
[76 FR 67587, Nov. 2, 2011, as amended at 81 FR 85112, Nov. 25, 2016]

[81 FR 85112, Nov. 25, 2016, as amended at 85 FR 62212, Oct. 2, 2020]
§ 705.3
Eligibility requirements.
To be eligible to receive a CDRLF award, in the form of either a loan or a technical assistance grant, a Qualifying Credit Union must, within the timeframes specified in any Notice of Funding Opportunity:
(a) Complete and submit an Application; and
(b) Meet the underwriting standards established by NCUA, including those pertaining to financial viability, as set forth in the Application and any related materials developed by NCUA.
§ 705.4
Permissible uses of loan funds.
NCUA may make loans from the Fund to Participating Credit Unions for various uses. The following is a non-exhaustive list of permissible uses or projects:
(a) Development of new products or services for members, including new or expanded share draft or credit card programs;
(b) Partnership arrangements with community-based service organizations or government agencies;
(c) Loan programs, including, but not limited to, microbusiness loans, payday loan alternatives, education loans, and real estate loans;
(d) Acquisition, expansion, or improvement of office space or equipment, including branch facilities, ATMs, and electronic banking facilities; and
(e) Operational programs such as security or disaster recovery.
§ 705.5
Terms and conditions for loans.
(a) NCUA may make loans, in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as it may determine, from the Fund to Participating Credit Unions.
(b)
Funding Limits.
NCUA will publish any applicable loan funding limits in the applicable Notice of Funding Opportunity.
(c)
Recording of a loan.
At the discretion of NCUA, a loan will be recorded by a Participating Credit Union as either a note payable or a nonmember deposit.
(d)
Interest rate.
The rate of interest on loans is governed by the CDRLF Loan Interest Rate Policy, which can be found on NCUA's Web site or by contacting NCUA's Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion. The specific interest rate for a particular funding will be announced in the related Notice of Funding Opportunity. The Board will announce changes, if any, to the CDRLF Loan Interest Rate Policy and those changes will apply to loans made under future Notices of Funding Opportunities.
(e)
Repayment and maturity.
(1) Awards made available through loans, whether recorded as a note payable or nonmember deposit, must be repaid to NCUA. All loans will be scheduled for repayment consistent with sound business practices and the objectives of the Program, but in no case will the term exceed five years.
(2) Interest payments will be required semiannually beginning six months after the initial distribution of a loan.
(3) NCUA may allow flexible repayment of loan principal. Details and specific provisions will be addressed in the Notice of Funding Opportunity and other program materials.
(f)
Acceleration.
The terms of each loan agreement will provide for the immediate acceleration of the unpaid balance for breach or default in performance by the Participating Credit Union of the terms or conditions of the loan. Default and breach include misrepresentation; failure to make interest or principal payments when due; failure to file required reports; insolvency of the Participating Credit Union; and, if required by NCUA, failure to maintain adequate matching funds for the duration of the loan. Other specific causes of default and breach will be identified in the loan documents between the Participating Credit Union and NCUA.
The unpaid balance will also be accelerated and immediately due if any part of the loan funds are improperly used or if uninvested loan proceeds remain unused for an unreasonable or unjustified period of time.
(g)
Matching requirements.
At its discretion, NCUA may require a Participating Credit Union to develop and implement a plan to match all or a portion of the funds represented by loan proceeds. Such requirement will be based on the financial condition of the Participating Credit Union, which will be evaluated under criteria contained in the related Notice of Funding Opportunity. Matching funds must be from non-governmental member or nonmember share deposits. Participating Credit Unions required to provide matching funds are subject to the following general provisions and any other conditions in the related Notice of Funding Opportunity and agreements between the Participating Credit Union and NCUA:
(1) Loan monies made available generally must be matched by the Participating Credit Union in an amount equal to the loan amount. Any loan monies matched by nonmember share deposits are not subject to the 20% limitation on nonmember deposits under § 701.32 of this chapter. Participating Credit Unions must maintain the increase in the total amount of share deposits for the duration of the loan. Once the loan is repaid, nonmember share deposits accepted to meet the matching requirement are subject to § 701.32 of this chapter.
(2) Upon approval of its loan application, and before it meets its matching, if required, a Participating Credit Union may receive the entire loan commitment in a single payment. If, at NCUA's discretion, any funds are withheld, the remainder of the funds committed will be available to the Participating Credit Union only after it has documented that it has met the match requirement.
(3) Failure of a Participating Credit Union to generate the required match within the time specified in the loan documents may result in the reduction of the loan proportionate to the amount of match actually generated. Payment of any additional funds initially approved may be limited as appropriate to reflect the revised amount of the loan approved. Any funds already advanced to the Participating Credit Union in excess of the revised amount of loan approval must be repaid immediately to NCUA. Failure to repay such funds to NCUA upon demand may result in the default of the entire loan.
(h)
Other terms and conditions.
Other terms and conditions pertaining to loans, including but not necessarily limited to duration, repayment obligations, security agreements (if any), and covenants, will be specified in the related Notice of Funding Opportunity or applicable loan documents to be signed by the Participating Credit Union.
[76 FR 67587, Nov. 2, 2011, as amended at 81 FR 85112, Nov. 25, 2016; 82 FR 60292, Dec. 20, 2017]
§ 705.6
Terms and conditions for technical assistance grants.
(a) Participating Credit Unions must comply with the terms and conditions for technical assistance grants specified for each funding opportunity offered under a Notice of Funding Opportunity.
(b) NCUA will establish applicable funding limits for technical assistance grants in the Notice of Funding Opportunity.
[81 FR 85112, Nov. 25, 2016]
§ 705.7
Application and award processes.
(a)
Notice of Funding Opportunity.
NCUA will publish a Notice of Funding Opportunity in the
Federal Register
and on its Web site. The Notice of Funding Opportunity will describe the loan and technical assistance grant programs for the period in which funds are available. It also will announce special initiatives, the amount of funds available, funding priorities, permissible uses of funds, funding limits, deadlines, and other pertinent details. The Notice of Funding Opportunity will also advise potential applicants on how to obtain an Application and related materials. NCUA may supplement the information contained in the Notice of Funding Opportunity through such other media as it determines appropriate, including Letters to Credit
Unions, press releases, direct notices to Qualifying Credit Unions, and announcements on its Web site.
(b)
Application requirements.
A Qualifying Credit Union must demonstrate a sound financial position and ability to manage its day-to-day business affairs. It also must show that its planned use of proceeds is consistent with the purpose of the Program, the requirements of this part, and the related Notice of Funding Opportunity. The related Notice of Funding Opportunity may include additional details and requirements.
(1) Applications to participate and qualify for a loan or technical assistance grant under the Program may be obtained from the National Credit Union Administration as outlined in the related Notice of Funding Opportunity.
(2) With respect to loans, NCUA will also require a Qualifying Credit Union to develop and submit a narrative describing how the Qualifying Credit Union intends to use the money obtained from the Fund to enhance the products or services it provides to its membership and how those enhanced products or services support the membership and community served by the Qualifying Credit Union.
(3) In addition to those items required in this section, a Qualifying Credit Union that is a non-federally insured credit union must also include the following:
(i) A copy of its most recent external audit report;
(ii) Proof of deposit and surety bond insurance which states the maximum insurance levels permitted by the policies;
(iii) A balance sheet, an income and expense statement, and a schedule of delinquent loans, for each of the four most recent quarter-ends;
(iv) Documentation of the credit union's status as a low-income credit union by the appropriate state supervisory agency consistent with NCUA Rules and Regulations at §§ 701.34(a) and 741.204(b); and
(v) An agreement to be subject to examination by NCUA.
(c)
Evaluation and selection of Qualifying Credit Unions.
NCUA will generally evaluate applications submitted by Qualifying Credit Unions in accordance with the criteria described in this section. Nothing in this section, however, precludes NCUA from considering other criteria included in the related Notice of Funding Opportunity that NCUA determines to be necessary based on the type of funding initiative, economic environment, or other factors or conditions that warrant the evaluation of additional or alternative criteria. Generally, NCUA will evaluate complete applications to determine if the Qualifying Credit Union satisfies the following:
(1)
Financial and Performance.
The Qualifying Credit Union must exhibit a safe and sound financial condition, including a demonstrated ability to perform the requirements associated with the type of award being sought and compliance with NCUA's underwriting standards. In this respect, NCUA will consider the Qualifying Credit Union's long-term financial viability, including absence of indicators suggesting the Qualifying Credit Union is a candidate for merger, a purchase and assumption transaction, or conservatorship. NCUA will also consider the Qualifying Credit Union's compliance with the provisions of any previous loan or technical assistance grant received. NCUA may also consider information concerning the Qualifying Credit Union to which it already has access, including information obtained through the examination process and data contained in Call Reports.
(2)
Compatibility.
NCUA will evaluate whether the stated objectives to be accomplished through the use of the loan or technical assistance grant proceeds conform to the broad purposes and rationale underlying the Fund. Specifically, NCUA will consider whether the award will enable the Qualifying Credit Union to provide basic financial products and related services to its members or enhance its capacity to better serve its members and the community in which it operates. NCUA will also consider whether the use of the financial award will conform to any applicable funding priority, special initiative, or special instruction announced in the related Notice of Funding Opportunity.
(3)
Feasibility.
NCUA will consider the likelihood of the Qualifying Credit
Union's success in accomplishing its stated objectives, based on its Application and the factors NCUA determines are relevant.
(4)
Examination Information and Applicable Concurrence.
In evaluating a Qualifying Credit Union, NCUA will consider all information provided by NCUA staff or state supervisory authority staff that performed the Qualifying Credit Union's most recent examination. In addition:
(i) NCUA will only provide a loan to a qualifying federal credit union with the concurrence of that credit union's supervising Regional Director; and
(ii) NCUA will only provide a loan to a qualifying state-charted credit union with the written concurrence of the applicable Regional Director and the credit union's state supervisory authority. A qualifying state-chartered credit union should notify its state supervisory authority that it is applying for a loan from the Fund before submitting its application to NCUA. However, a qualifying state-chartered credit union is not required to obtain concurrence before applying for a loan. NCUA will obtain the concurrence directly from the state supervisory authority rather than through the qualifying state-chartered credit union. Additionally, before NCUA will provide a loan to a qualifying state-charted credit union the credit union must make copies of its state examination reports available to NCUA and agree to examination by NCUA.
(d)
Requests for additional information.
NCUA will make its funding determinations among the several qualified Applications based on its discretion and consideration of which best meet the priorities and initiatives established and announced by NCUA. During its evaluation process, however, NCUA may request a Qualifying Credit Union to provide additional clarifying or technical information to support its application. NCUA may determine not to provide further consideration of any Application failing to provide additional required information.
(e)
Timing.
NCUA will announce, in the related Notice of Funding Opportunity, the deadline for Qualifying Credit Unions to submit all required documentation, including the Application. Failure to submit all of the requested information or to submit the information within the timeframe specified in the Notice of Funding Opportunity, or in the case of requests for additional clarifying or technical information, within the time specified by NCUA, may result in rejection of the Application without further consideration.
(f)
Notice of Award.
NCUA will determine whether an application meets NCUA's standards established by this part and the related Notice of Funding Opportunity. NCUA will provide written notice to a Qualifying Credit Union as to whether or not it has qualified for a loan or technical assistance grant under this part. A Qualifying Credit Union whose application has been denied for failure of a qualification may appeal that decision in accordance with § 705.10 of this part.
(g)
Disbursement
—(1)
Loans.
Before NCUA will disburse a loan, the Participating Credit Union must sign the loan agreement, promissory note, and any other loan related documents. NCUA may, in its discretion, choose not to disburse the entire amount of the loan at once.
(2)
Technical Assistance Grants.
NCUA will disburse technical assistance grants in such amounts, and in accordance with such terms and conditions, as NCUA may establish. In general, technical assistance grants are provided on a reimbursement basis, to cover expenditures approved in advance by NCUA and supported by receipts evidencing payment by the Participating Credit Union.

§ 705.8
Urgency.
On an emergency basis, subject to funds availability, NCUA may consider a funding request from a Qualifying Credit Union experiencing an unplanned or unexpected expense that the Qualifying Credit Union is unable to meet with its own resources. The Qualifying Credit Union must demonstrate a compelling need for immediate assistance without which its continued operations would be threatened
or severely disrupted. NCUA, in its discretion, will determine whether the situation constitutes an emergency and if the Qualifying Credit Union is required to submit any additional information to show why the funds are needed on an emergency basis. NCUA will determine and substantiate any reason to expedite funding in such case. Requests for loans or technical assistance grants under this section will be addressed on an ongoing basis and are outside the scope of the related Notice of Funding Opportunity. Technical assistance grants and loans provided on this basis must still demonstrate a purpose consistent with the goals of the Fund. Loans and technical assistance grants made under this section are not anticipated to be a regular source of funding for any Qualifying Credit Unions.

§ 705.9
Reporting and monitoring.
(a)
General.
NCUA's policy is to monitor Participating Credit Unions to assure that loan and technical assistance grant funds awarded under this part have been used in accordance with their intended purposes and to determine whether anticipated outcomes have been achieved. Particular emphasis will be placed on reviewing loan funds earmarked for programs or initiatives proposed by the Participating Credit Union to determine if the funds have been used as represented and whether the program or initiative has had the impact anticipated by the Participating Credit Union.
(b)
Reporting
—(1)
Reporting to NCUA.
A Participating Credit Union must complete and submit to NCUA all required reports, at such times and in such formats as NCUA will direct. Such reports must describe how the Participating Credit Union has used the loan or technical assistance grant proceeds and the results it has obtained, in relation to the programs, policies, or initiatives identified by the Participating Credit Union in its application. NCUA may request additional information as it determines appropriate.
(2)
Reporting to Members
—(i)
Loans.
A Participating Credit Union that receives a loan under this part must report on the progress of providing needed community services to the Participating Credit Union's members once a year, either at the annual meeting or in a written report sent to all members. The Participating Credit Union must also submit to NCUA the written report or a summary of the report provided to members.
(ii)
Technical Assistance Grants.
A Participating Credit Union that receives a technical assistance grant under this part should report on the progress of providing needed community services to the Participating Credit Union's members once a year, either at the annual meeting or in a written report sent to all members.
(c)
Monitoring.
At its discretion, for verification purposes and as part of its evaluation of the effectiveness of the loan and technical assistance grant programs, NCUA may elect to review information concerning Participating Credit Unions to which it already has access, including information obtained through the examination process and data contained in Call Reports.

§ 705.10
Appeals.
(a)
Appeals of non-qualification.
A Qualifying Credit Union whose application for a loan or technical assistance grant has been denied under § 705.7(f) for failure to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in § 705.7(c), including any additional criteria set forth in the related notice of funding opportunity, may request the Director of the Office of Small Credit Union Initiatives to reconsider the denial and/or appeal that decision to the NCUA Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart B to part 746 of this chapter, subject to the following limitations:
(1)
Scope.
The scope of the Board's review is limited to the threshold question of qualification and not the issue of whether, among qualified applicants, a particular loan or technical assistance grant is funded.
(2)
Appeals procedures inapplicable.
The foregoing procedure applies during an open period in which funds are available and NCUA has called for applications. NCUA will reject any application submitted during a period in
which NCUA has not called for applications, except for applications submitted under § 705.8. Such rejections are not subject to appeal or review by the NCUA Board.
(b)
Appeals of technical assistance grant reimbursement denials.
Pursuant to NCUA Interpretative Ruling and Policy Statement 11-1, any Participating Credit Union may appeal a denial of a technical assistance grant reimbursement to NCUA's Supervisory Review Committee. All appeals of technical assistance grant reimbursements must be submitted to the Supervisory Review Committee within 30 days from the date of the denial. The decisions of the Supervisory Review Committee are final and may not be appealed to the NCUA Board.

Coverage.
This part applies to all credit unions whose accounts are either insured by, or eligible to be insured by, the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, except for any credit union that has been designated as a corporate credit union by the National Credit Union Administration and any credit union that has $2 million or less in assets, after subtracting any nonmember deposits, and is determined to be nonautomated by the National Credit Union Administration.

(b)
General.
The disclosures shall reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the member and the credit union. Disclosures may be made in languages other than English, provided the disclosures are available in English upon request.
(c)
Relation to Regulation E (12 CFR part 1005).
Disclosures required by and provided in accordance with the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1601) and its implementing Regulation

§ 707.7
Payment of dividends.
(a)
Permissible methods
—(1)
Balance on which dividends are calculated.
Credit unions shall calculate dividends on the full amount of principal in an account for each day by use of either the daily balance method or the average daily balance method. Credit unions shall calculate dividends by use of a daily rate of at least
1/365
of the dividend rate. In a leap year a daily rate of
1/366
of the dividend rate may be used.
(2)
Determination of minimum balance to earn dividends.
A credit union shall use the same method to determine any minimum balance required to earn dividends as it uses to determine the balance on which dividends are calculated. A credit union may use an additional method that is unequivocally beneficial to the member.
(b)
Compounding and crediting policies.
This section does not require credit unions to compound or credit dividends at any particular frequency.
(c)
Date dividends begin to accrue.
Dividends shall begin to accrue not later than the day specified in section 606 of the Expedited Funds Availability Act (12 U.S.C. 4005) and implementing Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229). Dividends shall accrue on funds until the day funds are withdrawn.

§ 707.8
Advertising.
(a)
Misleading or inaccurate advertisements.
An advertisement must not:
(1) Be misleading or inaccurate or misrepresent a credit union's account agreement; or
(2) Refer to or describe an account as “free” or “no cost” or contain a similar term if any maintenance or activity fee may be imposed on the account. The word “profit” must not be used in referring to dividends or interest paid on an account.
(b)
Permissible rates.
If an advertisement states a rate of return, it shall state the rate as an “annual percentage yield,” using that term. (The abbreviation “APY” may be used provided the term “annual percentage yield” is stated at least once in the advertisement.) The advertisement shall not state any other rate, except that the “dividend rate,” using that term, may be stated in conjunction with, but not more conspicuously than, the annual percentage yield to which it relates.
(c)
When additional disclosures are required.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if the annual percentage yield is stated in an advertisement, the advertisement shall state the following information, to the extent applicable, clearly and conspicuously:
(1)
Variable rates.
For variable-rate accounts, a statement that the rate may change after the account is opened.
(2)
Time annual percentage yield is offered.
For interest-bearing accounts and dividend-bearing term share accounts, the period of time the annual percentage yield will be offered, or a statement that the annual percentage yield is accurate as of a specified date. For dividend-bearing accounts other than term share accounts, a statement that the annual percentage yield is accurate as of the last dividend declaration date. In the event that disclosure of an annual percentage yield as of the last dividend declaration date might be inaccurate because of known or contemplated dividend rate changes, the credit union may disclose the prospective annual percentage yield. Such prospective annual percentage yield may be disclosed either in lieu of, or in addition to, the dividend rate and annual percentage yield as of the last dividend declaration date.
(3)
Minimum balance.
The minimum balance required to earn the advertised annual percentage yield. For tiered-rate accounts, the minimum balance required for each tier shall be stated in close proximity and with equal prominence to the applicable annual percentage yield.
(4)
Minimum opening deposit.

Features of term share accounts.
For term share accounts:
(i)
Time requirements.
The term of the account.
(ii)
Early withdrawal penalties.
A statement that a penalty will or may be imposed for early withdrawal.
(iii)
Required dividend payouts.
For noncompounding term share accounts with a stated maturity greater than one year that do not compound dividends on an annual or more frequent basis, that require dividend payouts at least annually, and that disclose an APY determined in accordance with section E of appendix A of this part, a statement that dividends cannot remain on account and that payout of dividends is mandatory.
(d)
Bonuses.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if a bonus is stated in an advertisement, the advertisement shall state the following information, to the extent applicable, clearly and conspicuously:
(1) The “annual percentage yield,” using that term;

Pt. 707, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 707—Annual Percentage Yield Calculation
The annual percentage yield (APY) measures the total amount of dividends a credit union pays on an account based on the dividend rate and the frequency of compounding. The annual percentage yield is expressed as an annualized rate, based on a 365-day year. (Credit unions may calculate the annual percentage yield based on a 365-day or a 366-day year in a leap year.) Part I of this appendix discusses the annual percentage yield calculations for account disclosures and advertisements, while Part II discusses annual percentage yield earned calculations for statements. The annual percentage yield reflects only dividends and does not include the value of any bonus, as that term is defined in part 707, that may be provided to the member to open, maintain, increase or renew an account. Dividends, interest or other earnings are not to be included in the annual percentage yield if such amounts are determined by circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. These formulas apply to both dividend-bearing and interest-bearing accounts held by credit unions.

# Part I. Annual Percentage Yield for Account Disclosures and Advertising Purposes
In general, the annual percentage yield for account disclosures under §§ 707.4 and 707.5 and for advertising under § 707.8 is an annualized rate that reflects the relationship between the amount of dividends that would be earned by the member for the term of the account and the amount of principal used to calculate those dividends. The amount of dividends that would be earned may be projected based on the most recent past declared rate or an anticipated future rate, whichever the credit union judges to most reasonably approximate the dividends to be earned. Special rules apply to accounts with tiered and stepped dividend rates, and to certain term share accounts with a stated maturity greater than 1 year.

# A. General Rules
Except as provided in Part I. E. of this appendix, the annual percentage yield shall be calculated by the formula shown below. Credit unions may calculate the annual percentage yield using projected dividends based on either the rate at the last dividend declaration date or the rate anticipated at a future date. The credit union must disclose whichever option it uses to members. Credit unions shall calculate the annual percentage yield based on the actual number of days for the term of the account. For accounts without a stated maturity date (such as a typical share or share draft account), the calculation shall be based on an assumed term of 365 days. In determining the total dividends figure to be used in the formula, credit unions shall assume that all principal and dividends remain on deposit for the entire term, and that no other transactions (deposits or withdrawals) occur during the term. (This assumption shall not be used if a credit union requires, as a condition of the account, that members withdraw dividends during the term. In such a case, the dividends (and annual percentage yield calculation) shall reflect that requirement.) For term share accounts that are offered in multiples of months, credit unions may base the number of days on either the actual number of days during the applicable period, or the number of days that would occur for any actual sequence of that many calendar months. If credit unions choose to use this permissive rule, they must use the same number of days to calculate the dollar amount of dividends that will be earned on the account in the annual percentage yield formula (where “Dividends” are divided by “Principal”.)
The annual percentage yield is to be calculated by use of the following general formula ((“APY”) is used for convenience in the formulas):
APY = 100 [(1 + Dividends/Principal)
(365/Days in term)
−1].
“Principal” is the amount of funds assumed to have been deposited at the beginning of the account.
“Dividends” is the total dollar amount of dividends earned on the Principal for the term of the account.
“Days in term” is the actual number of days in the term of the account.
When the “days in term” is 365 (that is, where the stated maturity is 365 days or where the account does not have a stated maturity), the APY can be calculated by use of the following simple formula:
APY = 100 (Dividends/Principal).
Examples:
(1) If a credit union would pay $61.68 in dividends for a 365-day year on $1,000 deposited into a share draft account, the APY is 6.17%:
APY = 100 [(1 + 61.68/1,000)
(365/365)
−1]
APY = 6.17%.
Or, using the simple formula above (since the term is deemed to be 365 days):
APY = 100(61.68/1,000)
APY = 6.17%.
(2) If a credit union pays $30.37 in dividends on a $1,000 six-month term share certificate account (where the six-month period used by the credit union contains 182 days), using the general formula above, the APY is 6.18%:
APY = 100 [(1 + 30.37/1,000)
(365/182)
−1]
APY = 6.18%.
The APY is affected by the frequency of compounding, i.e., the amount of dividends will be greater the more frequently dividends are compounded for a given nominal rate. When two credit unions are offering the same dividend rate on, for example, a share account, the APY disclosed may be different if the credit unions use a different frequency of compounding.
Examples:
(1) If a credit union pays $1,268.25 in dividends for a 365-day year on $10,000 deposited into a regular share account earning 12%, and the dividends are compounded monthly, the APY will be 12.68%.
APY = 100($1,268.25/10,000)
APY = 12.68%
(2) However, if a credit union is compounding dividends on a quarterly basis on an account which otherwise has the same terms, the dividends will be $1,255.09 and the APY will be 12.55%.
APY = 100 ($1,255.09/10,000)
APY = 12.55%

# B. Stepped-Rate Accounts (Different Rates Apply in Succeeding Periods)
For accounts with two or more dividend rates applied in succeeding periods (where the rates are known at the time the account is opened), a credit union shall assume each dividend rate is in effect for the length of time provided for in any share agreement.
Examples:
(1) If a credit union offers a $1,000 6-month term share (certificate) account on which it pays a 5% dividend rate, compounded daily, for the first three months (which contain 91 days), and a 5.5% dividend rate, compounded daily, for the next three months (which contain 92 days), the total dividends for six months is $26.68, and, using the general formula above, the APY is 5.39%:
APY = 100 [(1 + 26.68/1,000)
(365/183)
−1]
APY = 5.39%.
(2) If a credit union offers a $1,000 2-year share certificate on which it pays a 6% dividend rate, compounded daily, for the first year, and a 6.5% dividend rate, compounded daily, for the next year, the total dividends for two years is $133.13, and, using the general formula above, the APY is 6.45%:
APY = 100 [(1 + 133.13/1,000)
(365/730)
−1]
APY = 6.45%.

# C. Variable-Rate Accounts
For variable-rate accounts without an introductory premium or discounted rate, a credit union must base the calculation only on the initial dividend rate in effect when the account is opened (or advertised), and assume that this rate will not change during the year.
Variable-rate accounts with an introductory premium or discount rate must be treated like stepped-rate accounts. Thus, a credit union shall assume that: (1) The introductory simple dividend rate is in effect for the length of time provided for in the account contract; and (2) the variable dividend rate that would have been in effect when the account is opened or advertised (but for the introductory rate) is in effect for the remainder of the year. If the variable rate is tied to an index, the index-based rate in effect at the time of disclosure must be used for the remainder of the year. If the rate is not tied to an index, the rate in effect for existing members holding the same account (who are not receiving the introductory dividend rate) must be used for the remainder of the year.
For example, if a credit union offers an account on which it pays a 7% dividend rate, compounded daily, for the first three months (which, for example, contains 91 days), while the variable dividend rate that would have been in effect when the account was opened was 5%, the total dividends for a 365-day year for a $1,000 account balance is $56.52, (based on 91 days at 7% followed by 274 days at 5%). Using the simple formula, the APY is 5.65%:
APY = 100 (56.52/1,000)
APY = 5.65%.

# D. Accounts With Tiered Rates (Different Rates Apply to Specified Balance Level)
For accounts in which two or more dividend rates paid on the account are applicable to specified balance levels, the credit union must calculate the annual percentage yield in accordance with the method described below that it uses to calculate dividends. In all cases, an annual percentage yield (or a range of annual percentage yields, if appropriate) must be disclosed for each balance tier.
For purposes of the examples discussed below, assume the following:
Simple dividend rate (Percent)
Share balance required to earn rate
5.25
Up to but not exceeding $2,500.
5.50
Above $2,500, but not exceeding $15,000.
5.75
Above $15,000.

# Tiering Method A
Under this method, a credit union pays on the full balance in the account the stated dividend rate that corresponds to the applicable share balance tier. For example, if a member deposits $8,000, the credit union pays the 5.50% dividend rate on the entire $8,000. This is also known as a “hybrid” or “plateau” tiered rate account.
When this method is used to determine dividends, only one annual percentage yield will apply to each tier. Within each tier, the annual percentage yield will not vary with the amount of principal assumed to have been deposited.
For the dividend rates and account balances assumed above, the credit union will state three annual percentage yields—one corresponding to each balance tier. Calculation of each annual percentage yield is similar for this type of account as for accounts with a single fixed dividend rate. Thus, the calculation is based on the total amount of dividends that would be received by the member for each tier of the account for a year and the principal assumed to have been deposited to earn that amount of dividends.
First tier.
Assuming daily compounding, the credit union will pay $53.90 in dividends on a $1,000 account balance. Using the general formula for the first tier, the APY is 5.39%:
APY = 100 [(1 + 53.90/1,000)
(365/365)
−1]
APY = 5.39%.
Using the simple formula:
APY = 100 (53.90/1,000)
APY = 5.39%.
Second tier.
The credit union will pay $452.29 in dividends on an $8,000 deposit. Thus, using the simple formula, the annual percentage yield for the second tier is 5.65%:
APY = 100(452.29/8,000)
APY = 5.65%.
Third tier.
The credit union will pay $1,183.61 in dividends on a $20,000 account balance. Thus, using the simple formula, the annual percentage yield for the third tier is 5.92%:
APY = 100(1,183.61/20,000)
APY = 5.92%.

# Tiering Method B
Under this method, a credit union pays the stated dividend rate only on that portion of the balance within the specified tier. For example, if a member deposits $8,000, the credit union pays 5.25% on only $2,500 and 5.50% on $5,500 (the difference between $8,000 and the first tier cutoff of $2,500). This is also known as a “pure” tiered rate account.
The credit union that computes dividends in this manner must provide a range that shows the lowest and the highest annual percentage yields for each tier (other than for the first tier, which, like the tiers in Method A, has the same annual percentage yield throughout). The low figure for an annual percentage yield is calculated based on the total amount of dividends earned for a year assuming the
minimum
principal required to earn the dividend rate for that tier. The high figure for an annual percentage yield is based on the amount of dividends the credit union would pay on the
highest
principal that could be deposited to earn that same dividend rate. If the account does not have a limit on the amount that can be deposited, the credit union may assume any amount.
For the tiering structure assumed above, the credit union would state a total of five annual percentage yields—one figure for the first tier and two figures stated as a range for the other two tiers.
First tier.
Assuming daily compounding, the credit union could pay $53.90 in dividends on a $1,000 account balance. For this first tier, using the simple formula, the annual percentage yield is 5.39%:
APY = 100 (53.90/1,000)
APY = 5.39%.
Second tier.
For the second tier the credit union would pay between $134.75 and $841.45 in dividends, based on assumed balances of $2,500.01 and $15,000, respectively. For $2,500.01, dividends would be figured on $2,500 at 5.25% dividend rate plus dividends on $.01 at 5.50%. For the low end of the second tier, therefore, the annual percentage yield is 5.39%. Using the simple formula:
APY = 100 (134.75/2,500)
APY = 5.39%.
For $15,000, dividends are figured on $2,500 at 5.25% dividend rate plus dividends on $12,500 at 5.50% dividend rate. For the high end of the second tier, the annual percentage yield, using the simple formula, is 5.61%:
APY = 100 (841.45/15,000)
APY = 5.61%.
Thus, the annual percentage yield range that would be stated for the second tier is 5.39% to 5.61%.
Third tier.
For the third tier, the credit union would pay $841.45 and $5,871.78 in dividends on the low end of the third tier (a balance of $15,000.01). For $15,000.01, dividends would be figured on $2,500 at 5.25% dividend rate, plus dividends on $12,500 at 5.50% dividend rate, plus dividends on $.01 at 5.75% dividend rate. For the low end of the third tier, therefore, the annual percentage yield, using the simple formula, is 5.61%:
APY = 100 (841.45/15,000)
APY = 5.61%.
Assuming the credit union does not limit the account balance, it may assume any maximum amount for the purposes of computing the annual percentage yield for the high end of the third tier. For an assumed maximum balance amount of $100,000, dividends would be figured on $2,500 at 5.25% dividend rate, plus dividends on $12,500 at 5.50% dividend rate, plus dividends on $85,000 at 5.75% dividend rate. For the high end of the third tier, therefore, the annual percentage yield, using the simple formula, is 5.87%:
APY = 100 (5,871.78/100,000)
APY = 5.87%.
Thus, the annual percentage yield that would be stated for the third tier is 5.61% to 5.87%. If the assumed maximum balance amount is $1,000,000, credit unions would use $985,000 rather than $85,000 in the last calculation. In that case for the high end of the third tier, the annual percentage yield, using the simple formula, is 5.91%:
APY = 100 (59,134.22/1,000,000)
APY = 5.91%
Thus, the annual percentage yield range that would be stated for the third tier is 5.61% to 5.91%.

# E. Term Share Accounts with a Stated Maturity Greater than One Year that Pay Dividends At Least Annually
1. For term share accounts with a stated maturity greater than one year, that do not compound dividends on an annual or more frequent basis, and that require the member to withdraw dividends at least annually, the annual percentage yield may be disclosed as equal to the dividend rate.
Example:
If a credit union offers a $1,000 two-year term share account that does not compound and that pays out dividends semi-annually by check or transfer at a 6.00% dividend rate, the annual percentage yield may be disclosed as 6.00%.
2. For term share accounts covered by this paragraph that are also stepped-rate accounts, the annual percentage yield may be disclosed as equal to the composite dividend rate.
Example:
(1) If a credit union offers a $1,000 three-year term share account that does not compound and that pays out dividends annually by check or transfer at a 5.00% dividend rate for the first year, 6.00% dividend rate for the second year, and 7.00% dividend rate for the third year, the credit union may compute the composite dividend rate and APY as follows:
(a) Multiply each dividend rate by the number of days it will be in effect;
(b) Add these figures together; and
(c) Divide by the total number of days in the term.
(2) Applied to the example, the products of the dividend rates and days the rates are in effect are (5.00% × 365 days) 1825, (6.00% × 365 days) 2190, and (7.00% × 365) 2555, respectively. The sum of these products, 6570, is divided by 1095, the total number of days in the term. The composite dividend rate and APY are both 6.00%.

# Part II. Annual Percentage Yield Earned for Statements
The annual percentage yield earned for statements under § 707.6 is an annualized rate that reflects the relationship between the amount of dividends actually earned (accrued or paid and credited) to the member's account during the period and the average daily balance in the account for the period over which the dividends were earned.
Pursuant to § 707.6(a), when dividends are paid less frequently than statements are sent, the APY Earned may reflect the number of days over which dividends were earned rather than the number of days in the statement period, e.g., if a credit union uses the average daily balance method and calculates dividends for a period other than the statement period, the annual percentage yield earned shall reflect the relationship between the amount of dividends earned and the average daily balance in the account for the other period, such as a crediting or dividend period.
The annual percentage yield shall be calculated by using the following formulas (“APY Earned” is used for convenience in the formulas):

# A. General Formula
APY Earned = 100 [(1 + Dividends earned/Balance)
(365/Daysinperiod)
−1].
“Balance” is the average daily balance in the account for the period.
“Dividends earned” is the actual amount of dividends accrued or paid and credited to the account for the period.
“Days in period” is the actual number of days over which the dividends disclosed on the statement were earned.
Examples:
(1) If a credit union calculates dividends for the statement period (and uses either the daily balance or the average daily balance method), and the account had a balance of $1,500 for 15 days and a balance of $500 for the remaining 15 days of a 30-day statement period, the average daily balance for the period is $1,000. Assume that $5.25 in dividends was earned during the period. The annual percentage yield earned (using the formula above) is 6.58%:
APY Earned = 100 [(1 + 5.25/1,000)
(365/30)
−1]
APY Earned = 6.58%.
(2) Assume a credit union calculates dividends on the average daily balance for the calendar month and provides periodic statements that cover the period from the 16th of one month to the 15th of the next month. The account has a balance of $2,000 September 1 through September 15 and a balance of $1,000 for the remaining 15 days of September. The average daily balance for the month of September is $1,500, which results in $6.50 in dividends earned for the month. The annual percentage yield earned for the month of September would be shown on the periodic statement covering September 16 through October 15. The annual percentage yield earned (using the formula above) is 5.40%:
APY Earned = 100 [(1 + 6.50/1,500)
(365/30)
−1]
APY Earned = 5.40%.
(3) Assume a credit union calculates dividends on the average daily balance for a quarter (for example, the calendar months of September through November), and provides monthly periodic statements covering calendar months. The account has a balance of $1,000 throughout the 30 days of September, a balance of $2,000 throughout the 31 days of October, and a balance of $3,000 throughout the 30 days of November. The average daily balance for the quarter is $2,000, which results in $21 in dividends earned for the quarter. The annual percentage yield earned would be shown on the periodic statement for November. The annual percentage yield earned (using the formula above) is 4.28%:
APY Earned = 100 [(1 + 21/2,000)
(365/91)
−1]
APY Earned = 4.28%.

# B. Special formula for use where periodic statement is sent more often than the period for which dividends are compounded.
Credit unions that use the daily balance method to accrue dividends and that issue periodic statements more often than the period for which dividends are compounded shall use the following special formula:
er27se93.000
The following definition applies for use in this formula (all other terms are defined under Part II):
“Compounding” is the number of days in each compounding period.
Assume a credit union calculates dividends for the statement period using the daily balance method, pays a 5.00% dividend rate, compounded annually, and provides periodic statements for each monthly cycle. The account has a daily balance of $1000.00 for a 30-day statement period. The dividend earned of $4.11 for the period, and the annual percentage yield earned (using the special formula above) is 5.00%:
er27se93.001
APY Earned = 5.00%.

# General Note:
Appendix B contains model clauses and sample forms intended for optional use by credit unions to aid in compliance with the disclosure requirements of §§ 707.4 (account disclosures), 707.5 (subsequent disclosures), 707.6 (statement disclosures), and 707.8 (advertisements). Section 269(b) of TISA provides that credit unions that use these clauses and forms will be in compliance with TISA's disclosure provisions.
As discussed in the supplementary information to § 707.3(a), this final rule provides for flexibility in designing the format of the disclosures. Credit unions can choose to prepare a single document or brochure that incorporates disclosures for all accounts offered, or to prepare different documents for each type of account. Credit unions may also use inserts to a document, or fill in blanks to show current rates, fees and other terms.
In the model clauses, words in parentheses indicate the type of disclosure a credit union should insert in the space provided (for example, a credit union might insert “July 23, 1995” in the blank for a “(date)” disclosure). Brackets and “/” indicate that a credit union must choose the alternative that best describes its practice (for example, “[daily balance/ average daily balance]”). It should be noted that only in sections B-6 through B-10 of this appendix have specific examples of disclosures been given, with dates and figures. Sections B-1 through B-5, and section B-11 provide only unspecific model clauses or blank forms. The Board felt, as articulated in the appendix A to Regulation DD, that a mix of blank clauses and forms and application of the model clauses to real specific situations would benefit those who must comply with TISA.
Any references to NCUA Rules and Regulations, the
NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws,

Fixed-Rate Accounts (§ 707.4(b)(1)(i)(A-B))

# 1. Interest-bearing Accounts
The interest rate on your deposit account is ______% with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ______%. [For purposes of this disclosure, this is a rate and APY that were offered within the most recent seven calendar days and were accurate as of (date). Please call (credit union telephone number) to obtain current rate information.] You will be paid this rate [for (time period)/until (date)/for at least 30 calendar days].

# Note:
This provision reflects an accurate statement for an interest-bearing account authorized by state law for state-chartered credit unions. While the definition of the term “interest” permits its substitution for the term “dividends,” separate disclosures should be made for interest-bearing accounts. Since account opening disclosures may be provided to potential members requesting account information before opening an account, and members opening new accounts, information is provided indicating that the rate may not be current, but that the potential member or member may call the credit union to obtain up-to-date information. When opening a new account, of course, a credit union could provide the contractual rate alone, and delete the sentences in brackets. Given the definition of fixed-rate account in § 707.2(n), credit unions offering fixed-rate accounts must contract to hold rates steady for at least a 30-day period. Thus, if the 30-day option of the last sentence is not chosen, the period chosen must be longer than 30 days.

# 2. Dividend-bearing Term Share Accounts
The dividend rate on your term share account is ______% with an annual percentage
yield (APY) of ______%. [For purposes of this disclosure, this is a rate and APY that were offered within the most recent seven calendar days and were accurate as of (date). Please call (credit union telephone number) to obtain current rate information.] You will be paid this rate [for (time period)/until (date)/for at least 30 calendar days].

# Note:
This provision reflects an accurate statement for a fixed-rate, dividend-bearing term share account. Interest-bearing term share accounts would use the disclosure in § 1, above. Since account opening disclosures may be provided to potential members requesting account information before opening an account, and members opening new accounts, information is provided indicating that the rate may not be current, but that the potential member or member may call the credit union to obtain up-to-date information. When opening a new account, of course, a credit union could provide the contractual rate alone, and delete the sentences in brackets. Given the definition of fixed-rate account in § 707.2(n), credit unions offering fixed-rate accounts must contract to hold rates steady for at least a 30-day period. Thus, if the 30-day option of the last sentence is not chosen, the period chosen must be longer than 30 days.

# 3. Other Dividend-bearing Accounts
[As of [the last dividend declaration date/ (date)], the dividend rate was ______% with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ______% on your account. /or The prospective dividend rate on your account is ______% with a prospective APY of ______% for the current dividend period.] You will be paid this rate for [(time period)/at least 30 calendar days].
or
[As of [the last dividend declaration date/ (date)], the dividend rate was ______% with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ______% on your account. /or The prospective dividend rate on your account is ______% with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ______% for this dividend period.] This rate will not change unless the credit union notifies you at least 30 calendar days prior to any change.

# Note:
Credit unions may disclose the dividend rate and annual percentage yield on accounts as of the last dividend declaration date. This necessitates inclusion of a disclosure of the actual calendar date of the last dividend declaration date. Additionally or alternatively (if the last dividend rate could be inaccurate), credit unions may disclose a prospective dividend rate and a prospective annual percentage yield. Such prospective rates and yields must be estimated in good faith, and must be declared at the proper time if it is at all possible to do so. As for the last sentence in these disclosures, this provision reflects a credit union policy to set prospective dividend rates for the next month (or at least 30 days), quarter or other period. Many credit unions, at their mid-monthly board meeting, set prospective dividend rates for the next month beginning on the 1st day of the month and continuing to the last day of the month. These rates must be formalized or ratified at the end of a dividend period. Given the timing of the board meetings, the time to prepare and mail notices and the 30 day period, it will often take credit unions 45 to 60 days to effectively change rates. For these reasons, the Board strongly suggests that credit unions do not offer fixed-rate, dividend-bearing accounts.

Variable-Rate Accounts (§ 707.4(b)(1)(ii))

# 1. Interest-bearing Accounts
The interest rate on your deposit account is ______%, with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ______%. [For purposes of this disclosure, this is a rate and APY that were offered within the most recent seven calendar days and were accurate as of (date). Please call (credit union telephone number) to obtain current rate information.] The interest rate and annual percentage yield may change every (time period) based on [(name of index)/the determination of the credit union board of directors]. The interest rate for your account will [never change by more than ______% each (time period)/never be less/more than ______%/never exceed ______% above or fall more than ______% below the initial interest rate].

# Note:
This disclosure combines the requirements of § 707.4(b)(1)(i) with § 707.4(b)(1)(ii) for interest-bearing accounts. The variable nature of a deposit account usually is based on an external index or is set at the discretion of the board. If another means of rate setting is used, that, instead of the proposed language, must be disclosed. Since account opening disclosures may be provided to potential members requesting account information before opening an account, and members opening new accounts, information is provided indicating that the rate may not be current, but that the potential member or member may call the credit union to obtain up-to-date information. When opening a new account, of course, a credit union could provide the contractual rate alone, and delete the sentences in brackets. Rarely would there be limitations on rate changes, but language is provided for this situation in the last sentence. Of course, it is only to be used if it applies to an account.

# 2. Dividend-bearing Term Share Accounts
The dividend rate on your term share account is ______%, with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ______%. [For purposes of this disclosure, this is a rate and APY that were
offered within the most recent seven calendar days and were accurate as of (date). Please call (credit union telephone number) to obtain current rate information.] The dividend rate and annual percentage yield may change every (time period) based on [(name of index)/the determination of the credit union board of directors]. The dividend rate for your account will [never change by more than ______% each (time period)/never be less/more than ______% /never exceed ______% above or fall more than ______% below the initial dividend rate].

# Note:
This disclosure combines the requirements of § 707.4(b)(1)(i) with § 707.4(b)(1)(ii) for dividend-bearing, variable-rate term share accounts. The variable nature of a deposit account usually is based on an external index or is set at the discretion of the board. If another means of rate setting is used, that, instead of the model language, must be disclosed. Since account opening disclosures may be provided to potential members requesting account information before opening an account, and members opening new accounts, information is provided indicating that the rate may not be current, but that the potential member or member may call the credit union to obtain up-to-date information. When opening a new account, of course, a credit union could provide the contractual rate alone, and delete the sentences in brackets. Rarely would there be limitations on rate changes, but language is provided for this situation in the last sentence. Of course, it is only to be used if it applies to an account.

# 3. Other Dividend-bearing Accounts
[As of [the last dividend declaration date/ (date)], the dividend rate was ______% with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ______% on your account. /or The prospective dividend rate on your account is ______% with an anticipated annual percentage yield (APY) of ______% for the current dividend period.] The dividend rate and annual percentage yield may change every (dividend period) as determined by the credit union board of directors.

# Note:
This language combines the requirements of § 707.4(b)(1)(i) with § 707.4(b)(1)(ii). Credit unions may disclose the dividend rate and annual percentage yield on accounts as of the last dividend declaration date. This necessitates inclusion of a disclosure of the actual calendar date of the last dividend declaration date or use of the phrase “last dividend declaration date”. Additionally or alternatively, credit unions may disclose a prospective dividend rate and a prospective annual percentage yield. Such prospective rates and yields must be estimated in good faith, and must be declared at the proper time if it is at all possible to do so. As for the last sentence in these disclosures, this provision reflects the variable nature of the account. Generally, there is only one variable-rate feature for share accounts: the frequency of dividend period rate changes (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually). Normally, there are no contractual limitations on share account earnings (unless imposed by a regulator), nor are earnings based on any internal or external index. If contractual limitations or an index are involved, however, those factors would need to be disclosed (unless a regulator orders otherwise).

Stepped-Rate Accounts (§ 707.4(b)(1)(i))

# 1. Interest-bearing Accounts
The initial interest rate on your deposit account is ______%. You will be paid that rate [for (time period)/ until (date)]. After that time, the interest rate for your deposit account will be ______% and you will be paid that rate [for (time period)/ until (date)]. The annual percentage yield (APY) for your account is ______%. [For purposes of this disclosure, this is a rate and APY that were offered within the most recent seven calendar days and were accurate as of (date). Please call (credit union telephone number) to obtain current rate information.] You will be paid this rate [for (time period)/until (date)/for at least 30 calendar days].

# 2. Dividend-bearing Term Share Accounts
The initial dividend rate on your term share account is ______%. You will be paid that rate [for (time period)/ until (date)]. After that time, the dividend rate for your term share account will be ______% and you will be paid that rate [for (time period)/ until (date)]. The annual percentage yield (APY) for your account is ______%.

The annual percentage yield (APY) for your account is ______%. You will be paid this rate for [(time period)/at least 30 calendar days].

# Note:
Stepped-rate accounts are accounts with two or more rates that take effect in succeeding periods. The applicable rates and
time periods
are known
when the account is opened. By nature these are fixed-rate accounts and are usually associated with term share (certificate) accounts. Accordingly, a contract provision (for share accounts) to change rates should be included.

# Note:
Tiering Method A pays the stated interest rate that corresponds to the applicable deposit tier on the full balance in the account. This example contemplates a two-tier system. The option (1, 2 or 3) most closely matching the terms of the account should be chosen as the appropriate disclosure. For tiered-rate accounts, a disclosure may be added about the currency of the rate, as is provided in the first set of brackets. A disclosure regarding the fixed-rate or variable-rate nature of the account must be added, as is provided in the last set of brackets.

# Tiering Method B
1* An interest rate of ________% will be paid only on the portion of your [daily balance/average daily balance] that is greater than $________. The annual percentage yield (APY) for this tier will range from ________% to ________%, depending on the balance in the account.
2* An interest rate of ________% will be paid only on the portion of your [daily balance/average daily balance] that is greater than $________, but less than $________. The annual percentage yield (APY) for this tier will range from ________% to ________%, depending on the balance in the account.
3* If your [daily balance/average daily balance] is $________ or less, the interest rate paid on the entire balance will be ________%, with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ________%.

# Note:
Tiering Method B pays different stated interest rates corresponding to applicable deposit tiers, on the applicable balance in each tier of the account. For example, a credit union might pay 3% interest on account funds of $500 or below, and pay 4% interest on the portion of the same account that exceeds $500. The example contemplates an account with two tiers, but additional tiers are possible. The option (1, 2 or 3) most closely matching the terms of the account should be chosen as the appropriate disclosure.

The annual percentage yield (APY) for this tier ranged from ________% to ________%, depending on the balance in the account. /or A prospective dividend rate of ________% will be paid only on the portion of your [daily balance/average daily balance] that is greater than $________, but less than $________] with a prospective annual percentage yield (APY) ranging from ________% to ________%, depending on the balance in the account, for this dividend period.]
3* [As of [the last dividend declaration date/ (date)], if your [daily balance/average daily balance] was $________ or less, the dividend rate paid on the entire balance was ________%, with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ________%. /or If your [daily balance/average daily balance] was $______ or less, the prospective dividend rate paid on the entire balance in your account will be ______% with a prospective annual percentage yield (APY) of ______% for this dividend period.

# Note:
Tiering Method B pays different stated dividend rates corresponding to applicable account tiers, on the applicable balance in each tier of the account. For example, a credit union might pay a 3% dividend on account funds of $500 or below, and pay a 4% dividend on the portion of the same account that exceeds $500. The example contemplates an account with two tiers, but additional tiers are possible. The option (1, 2 or 3) most closely matching the terms of the account should be chosen as the appropriate disclosure. Note that the prospective rate disclosure options match the required tiered-rate disclosures based on the previous dividend declaration date.
Tiered-rate accounts can be either fixed-rate or variable-rate accounts. The last sentence offers an option of either fixed-rate or variable-rate disclosures. Thus, the disclosures outlined above must be made in addition to either: (i) Disclosure of the period the fixed-rates are in effect or (ii) the variable-rate disclosures. Tiered-rate accounts are also subject to the requirement for disclosure of the balance computation method, see paragraph (e) to this appendix.

Nature of Dividends (§ 707.4(b)(8))
Dividends are paid from current income and available earnings, after required transfers to reserves at the end of a dividend period.

# Note:
The Board of Directors declares dividends based on current income and available earnings of the credit union after providing for the required reserves at the end of the month. The dividend rate and annual percentage yield shown may reflect either the last dividend declaration date on the account or the earnings the credit union anticipates having available for distribution. This disclosure only applies to share and share draft (as opposed to deposit) accounts and should be grouped with the Rate Information to make the disclosures more meaningful. This disclosure also does not apply to term share accounts for reasons discussed in the supplementary information regarding §§ 707.3(e) and 707.4(b)(8).

# (

# )
Compounding and Crediting (§ 707.4(b)(2))
[Dividends/Interest] will be compounded (frequency) and will be credited (frequency).
and, if applicable:
If you close your [share/deposit] account before [dividends/interest] [are/is] paid, you will not receive the accrued [dividends/interest].
and, if applicable (for dividend-bearing accounts):
For this account type, the dividend period is (frequency), for example, the beginning date of the first dividend period of the calendar year is (date) and the ending date of such dividend period is (date). All other dividend periods follow this same pattern of dates. The dividend declaration date follows the ending date of a dividend period, and for the example is (date).

# Note:
Where the word “(frequency)” appears, time periods must be inserted to coincide with those specified in board resolutions of each credit union's board of directors. A disclosure of dividend period was added to § 707.4(b)(2)(i) in the final rule to assist members in knowing when dividend rate and APY disclosures would be given by a credit union using the optional statement rule of § 707.6(a). The dividend declaration date is important for purposes of § 707.4(a)(2)(ii), request disclosures, § 707.4(b)(2), account opening disclosures, and § 707.8(c)(2), advertising disclosures. The Board believes that this is critical information for dividend-bearing accounts, but that provision by an example (whether of the first dividend period of the year, or of any randomly chosen dividend period) is favorable to providing a list of such dates for the entire year or for a period of years (although these methods would also be permissible). As noted in the supplementary information to § 707.2(j), dividend declaration date, the dividend period and actual dividend distribution date may vary. Thus, it is possible for crediting periods and dividend periods not to coincide, though the Board believes that credit unions should make every effort to attempt to coordinate the two periods.

Minimum Balance Requirements (§ 707.4(b)(3)(i))
(i)
To open the account
The minimum balance required to open this account is $________.
or, for first share account at a credit union
The minimum required to open this account is the purchase of a (par value of a share) share in the credit union.
(ii)
To avoid imposition of fees
You must maintain a minimum daily balance of $________ in your account to avoid a service fee. If, during any (time period), your account balance falls below the required minimum daily balance, your account will be subject to a service fee of $________ for that (time period).
or
You must maintain a minimum average daily balance of $________ in your account to avoid a service fee. If, during any (time period), your average daily balance is below the required minimum, your account will be subject to a service fee of $________ for that (time period).
(iii)
To obtain the annual percentage yield disclosed
You must maintain a minimum daily balance of $________ in your account each day to obtain the disclosed annual percentage yield.
or
You must maintain a minimum average daily balance of $________ in your account to obtain the disclosed annual percentage yield.
(iv)
Absence of minimum balance requirements
No minimum balance requirements apply to this account.
(v)
Par value
The par value of a share in this credit union is $________.

# Note:
Where the words “(time period)” appear, time periods should be inserted to coincide with those specified in board resolutions of each credit union's board of directors. As the supplementary information to § 707.4(b)(3)(i) explains, the par value of a share to establish membership is a critical disclosure to be made to potential members of credit unions. The par value disclosure is required by § 707.4(b)(3)(i) as being analogous to a minimum balance account opening requirement.

Balance Computation Method (§ 707.4(b)(3)(ii))
(i)
Daily Balance Method
[Dividends/Interest] [are/is] calculated by the daily balance method which applies a daily periodic rate to the balance in the account each day.
(ii)
Average Daily Balance Method
[Dividends/Interest] [are/is] calculated by the average daily balance method which applies a periodic rate to the average daily balance in the account for the period. The average daily balance is calculated by adding the balance in the account for each day of the period and dividing that figure by the number of days in the period.

# Note:
Any explanation of balance computation method must contain enough information for members to grasp the means by which dividends or interest will be calculated on their accounts. Using a shorthand form, such as “day in/day out” for the daily balance method or “average balance” for the average daily balance method, without more information, is insufficient. In addition, any disclosure based on the equivalency of the two allowable methods, such as stating that the average daily balance method was the same as the daily balance method, is impermissible and misleading.

# )
Accrual of Dividends/Interest on Noncash Deposits (§ 704.4(b)(3)(iii))
[Dividends/Interest] will begin to accrue on the business day you [place/deposit] noncash items (e.g. checks) to your account.
or
[Dividends/Interest] will begin to accrue no later than the business day we receive provisional credit for the [placement/deposit] of noncash items (e.g. checks) to your account.

# Note:
Accrual information is not included in the explanation of balance computation method required by § 707.4(b)(4)(ii). In addition, the disclosures required by TISA do not
affect the substantive requirements of the EFAA and Regulation CC.
The EFAA and Regulation CC control, and any modifications to them should occasion credit unions to revisit this disclosure with a view to revising it to reflect current law.

Fees and Charges (§ 707.4(b)(4))
The following fees and charges may be assessed against your account:
(Service/explanation)—$______.
(Service/explanation)—$______.

# Note:
Fees and charges may be disclosed in an account disclosure, or separately in a Rate and Fee Schedule (see section B-11 of this appendix). In either event, the disclosure should also specify when the fee will be assessed by using phrases such as “per item,” “per month,” or “per inquiry.”

Transaction Limitations (§ 707.4(b)(5))
The minimum amount you may [withdraw/write a draft for] is $________
During any statement period, you may not make more than six withdrawals or transfers to another credit union account of yours or to a third party by means of a preauthorized or automatic transfer or telephonic order or instruction. No more than three of the six transfers may be made by check, draft, debit card, if applicable, or similar order to a third party. If you exceed the transfer limitations set forth above in any statement period, your account will be subject to [closure by the credit union/a fee of $________.

# Note:
This paragraph satisfies the requirements of § 707.4(b)(6) with respect to the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation D limitations on share accounts and money market accounts. These are some of the more common limitations applicable.
The credit union reserves the right to require a member intending to make a withdrawal from any account (except a share draft account) to give written notice of such intent not less than seven days and up to 60 days before such withdrawal.

# Note:
This disclosure is limited to federal credit unions with Bylaws containing this limitation. See
Standard Federal Credit Union Bylaws,
Art. III, section 5(a). Similar disclosures are required of any state-chartered credit unions having similar limitations in their bylaws, or under state law. This limitation does not directly relate to the “number” or “amount” of transactions, and accordingly, may not be necessary under § 707.4(b)(5), but would, if applicable, be required by § 707.3(b).

Disclosures Related to Term Share Accounts (§ 707.4(b)(6))
(i)
Time requirements
Your account will mature on (date).
or
Your account will mature after (time period).
(ii)
Early withdrawal penalties
We [will/may] impose a penalty if you withdraw [any/all] of the [funds/principal] in your account before the maturity date. The penalty will equal [________ [days'/weeks'/months'] [dividends/interest] on your account.
or
We [will/may] impose a penalty of $__________ if you withdraw [any/all] of the [funds/principal] before the maturity date.
If you withdraw some of your funds before maturity, the [dividend/interest] rate for the remaining funds in your account will be ______%, with an annual percentage yield of ______%.

# Note:
In most cases, the dividend rate and annual percentage yield on the funds remaining in the account after early withdrawal are the same as before the withdrawal. Accordingly, the disclosure of dividend rate and annual percentage yield after withdrawal is required only if the dividend rate and APY will change.
(iii)
Withdrawal of Dividends/Interest Prior to Maturity
The annual percentage yield is based on an assumption that [dividends/interest] will remain in the account until maturity. A withdrawal will reduce earnings.

# Note:
This disclosure may be used if the credit union compounds dividends/interest and allows withdrawal of accrued dividends/interest before maturity. This disclosure alerts members that the annual percentage yield is based on an assumption that the dividends/interest remain on deposit until maturity.
(iv)
Renewal Policies

# 1.
Automatically Renewable Term Share Accounts
Your term share account will automatically renew at maturity. You will have a grace period of ________ [calendar/business] days after the maturity date to withdraw the funds in the account without being charged an early withdrawal penalty.
or
Your term share account will automatically renew at maturity. There is no grace period following the maturity of this account.

# 2.
Non-Automatically Renewable Term Share Accounts
This account will not renew automatically at maturity. If you do not renew the account, your account will [continue to earn/
no longer earn] [dividends/interest] after the maturity date.

# Note:
These disclosures should agree with the necessary pre-maturity notices for term share accounts in B-3 of this appendix.
(v)
Required dividend distribution.
This account requires the distribution of dividends and does not allow dividends to remain in the account.

# (

Bonuses (§ 704.4(b)(7))
You will [be paid/receive] [$__________/(description of item)] as a bonus [when you open the account/on (date)].
You must maintain a minimum [daily balance/average daily balance] of $__________ to obtain the bonus.
To earn the bonus, [$__________/your entire principal] must remain on deposit [for (time period)/until (date)].

# Note:
These disclosures follow the requirements of § 707.4(b)(7) and should be used as applicable. Further information may also be added, especially if it clarifies the conditions and timing of receiving the bonus, or better informs the member about the bonus.

# B-2 Model Clauses for Changes in Terms (§ 707.5(
a

# ))
On (date), the (type of fee) will increase to $__________.
On (date), the [dividend/interest] rate on your account will decrease to ______%, with an annual percentage yield (APY) of ______%.
On (date), the [minimum daily balance/average daily balance] required to avoid imposition of a fee will increase to $__________.

# Note:
These examples apply to the more common changes necessitating a change in terms notice. However, any change, amendment or modification reducing the APY or adversely affecting the members holding such accounts must be disclosed. For such changes not contemplated by the model clauses, the Board recommends the use of as simple language as possible to convey the change, along with cross-referencing to the particular sections or paragraph numbers of the account opening disclosures, when to do so
will assist members in reviewing and understanding the change.

# Note:
This form is modeled on NCUA Form FCU 150, Application for Membership, as discussed in the
Accounting Manual for FCUs,
§§ 5030.1, 5150.3. It is noted that other information can also be requested on the signature card, as long as it is in accordance with federal and state laws. For example, information identifying the member, such as a state driver's license number, could be added. The types of accounts that the signature applies to could be specified. Furthermore, the Board notes that this card contains much identification information that may not be necessary for all credit unions; common sense should guide credit union boards of directors in designing their applications for membership/signature cards. However, the Board believes that the information solicited on this form is reasonable and prudent for many credit unions. Payable on death designations, joint account language required under state law, life savings beneficiary designations, and other like variations and designations may be added to the card if so desired. The proposed signature card/ application for membership form contained taxpayer certification language. One commenter noted that the IRS may always change its requirements in this area, which are beyond the authority of the Board. Therefore, the Board has deleted reference to the IRS taxpayer certification required by 26 U.S.C. 3406, but notes that such certification must be made in accordance with applicable law and IRS rules. The information may be included on the front and back of a standard size signature card, or on the front of a large size signature card. However, no account terms may be included on a signature card unless a copy of the signature card is provided to the member at the time of account opening. The Board recommends that credit unions refrain from this practice, and instead use standard account disclosures. One reason for this is that if laws, regulations or credit union policies change, discrepancies may result between them and the earlier signature card terms. Given the longevity of credit union membership, signature cards may well be in use for up to or over a century. In addition, as signature cards are relatively small, they probably will not contain enough space to make all desired and required disclosures. Fragmentation of terms, some on signature cards, some on separate disclosures, could easily lead to member confusion. As terms are usually construed against the drafter, credit unions should be very careful in their use of account terms and conditions varying from those provided as model clauses and sample forms in this appendix.

# Note:
This form is modeled on NCUA Form FCU 107SCP, Credit Union Share Certificate, as discussed in the
Accounting Manual for FCUs,
§§ 5030.1, 5150.6. It is simplified to reflect the term share (certificate) account agreement, the parties involved, the maturity term and the annual percentage yield and dividend rate. All other terms are incorporated by reference. This should allow the credit union maximum flexibility in fashioning certificate, and other term share account, products. If a credit union so desired, other terms and conditions could be incorporated into the term share certificate itself, as long as a copy is presented to the member at the account opening. Care should also be taken to ensure that the term share certificate format addresses any necessary state law concerns. As the FRB's Regulation D on reserve requirements permits all term share accounts to be represented by a transferable or nontransferable, or a negotiable or nonnegotiable, certificate, instrument, passbook, statement or otherwise, and still be considered a “time deposit”, the Board has made no entry on this sample form regarding such terms, leaving the decision instead to
each credit union's board of directors. 12 CFR 204.2(c)(2).

# B-6 Sample Form (Regular Share Account Disclosures)

# Regular Share Account Disclosures
1.
Rate information.
As of April 1, 1995, the dividend rate was 5.00% and the annual percentage yield (APY) was 5.13% on your regular share account. In addition, the credit union estimates a prospective dividend rate of 5.25% and a prospective APY of 5.39% on your share account for this dividend period. The dividend rate and annual percentage yield may change every quarter as determined by the credit union board of directors.
2.
Compounding and crediting.
Dividends will be compounded daily and will be credited quarterly. For this account type, the dividend period is quarterly, for example, the beginning date of the first dividend period of the calendar year is January 1 and the ending date of such dividend period is March 31. All other dividend periods follow this same pattern of dates. The dividend declaration date follows the ending date of a dividend period, and for the example is April 1. If you close your regular share account before dividends are credited, you will not receive accrued dividends.
3.
Minimum balance requirements.
The minimum balance to open this account is the purchase of a $5 share in the Credit Union. You must maintain a minimum daily balance of $500 in your account to avoid a service fee. If, during any day during a quarter, your account balance falls below the required minimum daily balance, your account will be subject to a service fee of $5 for that quarter.
4.
Balance computation method.
Dividends are calculated by the daily balance method which applies a daily periodic rate to the principal in your account each day.
5.
Accrual of dividends.
Dividends will begin to accrue on the business day you deposit noncash items (e.g., checks) to your account.

8.
Nature of dividends.
Dividends are paid from current income and available earnings, after required transfers to reserves at the end of a dividend period.
9.
Bylaw Requirements.
A member who fails to complete payment of one share within __________ of his admission to membership, or within __________ from the increase in the par value in shares, or a member who reduces his share balance below the par value of one share and does not increase the balance to at least the par value of one share within __________ of the reduction may be terminated from membership at the end of a dividend period. [All blanks should be filled with time chosen by credit union board of directors.] Shares may be transferred only from one member to another, by written instrument in such form as the Credit Union may prescribe. The Credit Union reserves the right, at any time, to require members to give, in writing, not more than 60 days notice of intention to withdraw the whole or any part of the amounts so paid in by them. No member may withdraw shareholdings that are pledged as required on security on loans without the written approval of the credit committee or a loan officer, except to the extent that such shares exceed the member's total primary and contingent liability to the Credit Union. No member may withdraw any shareholdings below the amount of his/her primary or contingent liability to the Credit Union if he/she is delinquent as a borrower, or if borrowers for whom he/she is comaker, endorser, or guarantor are delinquent, without the written approval of the credit committee or loan officer.

Other Terms and Conditions.
[In this item, which may be titled or subdivided in any manner by each credit union, NCUA suggests that the following issues be covered or handled: Statutory lien or setoff; expenses (garnishments and bankruptcy orders and holds on account); joint ownership accounts; trust accounts; payable-on-death accounts; retirement accounts; Uniform Transfer to Minor Act accounts; sole proprietorship accounts; escrow and custodial accounts; corporation accounts; not-for-profit corporation accounts; voluntary association accounts; partnership accounts; public unit accounts; powers of attorney (guardianship orders); tax
disclosures and certifications; Uniform Commercial Code variances; amendments; reliance on signature card; change of address; incorporations of other documents by reference, such as expedited funds availability policies, service charges schedules or electronic banking disclosures; ability to suspend services; and operational matters (stop payment orders—verbal and written, satisfactory identification, refusal of deposits not in proper form, wire transfers, stale check deposits, availability of periodic statements or passbook feature.)]

# Note:
This form is modeled on the share account disclosures in the
Accounting Manual for FCUs,
§ 5150.7. The disclosures are for a variable-rate, daily balance method dividend calculation regular share account in an FCU with a $500 minimum balance to avoid service fees. For the example, the account was opened on May 1, 1995. Other terms are self-explanatory. The dividend rate paid and annual percentage yield disclosures will reflect the prospective dividend rate for a given dividend period. Item nos. 1-8 reflect standard TISA and part 707 disclosures discussed in sections B-1 through B-3 of this appendix. Note that if the credit union limits the maximum amount of shares which may be held by one member under
NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws,
Art. III, section 2, that this should be stated in item no. 7, transaction limitations. Item no. 9 reflects various terms provided in Art. III, sections 3-6 of the
NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws.
Item no. 10 reflects the par value amount of regular shares in a federal credit union, pursuant to section 117 of the FCU Act, 12 U.S.C. 117. It also states the dividend period of the credit union, which is set by the board of directors. Item no. 11 addresses the requirements of 12 CFR part 740. Non-federally insured credit unions (NICUs) would be expected to disclose information required by section 151 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. 12 U.S.C. 1831t. By December 19, 1992, all NICUs were required to include conspicuously on all periodic statements of account, signature cards, passbooks, share certificates and other similar instruments of deposit and in all advertising a notice that the credit union is not federally insured. Additional disclosures will be required of NICUs by June 19, 1994. Item no. 12 is inserted to ensure that credit unions add other account terms and conditions not covered by the proposed regulation. These sorts of terms are contemplated by proposed § 707.3(b), requiring that the disclosures reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the member and the credit union. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but to give a general idea of other topics often covered in share account contracts. Item no. 12 is not expressly required by either TISA or part 707, but any of these terms that are disclosed must be accurate and not misleading. Also the Board strongly recommends that such terms are included in account opening disclosures to inform the membership and to clearly set forth the legal relationship between the members and their credit union.

# B-7 Sample Form (Share Draft Account Disclosures)

# Share Draft Account Disclosures
1.
Rate information.
As of January 1, 1995, the dividend rate was 3.00% and the annual percentage yield (APY) was 3.04% on your share account. In addition, the prospective dividend rate on your account is 3.15% with a prospective annual percentage yield (APY) of 3.20% for the current dividend period. The dividend rate and APY may change every dividend period as determined by the credit union board of directors.
2.
Compounding and crediting.
Dividends will be compounded monthly and will be credited monthly. For this account type, the dividend period is monthly, for example, the beginning date of the first dividend period of the calendar year is January 1 and the ending date of such dividend period is January 31. All other dividend periods follow this same pattern of dates. The dividend declaration date follows the ending date of a dividend period, and for the example above is February 1. If you close your share draft account before dividends are credited, you will not receive accrued dividends.
3.
No Minimum balance requirements apply to this account.
4.
Balance computation method.
Dividends are calculated by the average daily balance method which applies a periodic rate to the average daily balance in the account for the period. The average daily balance is calculated by adding the balance in the account for each day of the period and dividing that figure by the number of days in the period.
5.
Accrual of dividends.
Dividends will begin to accrue no later than the business day we receive provisional credit for the placement of noncash items (e.g. checks) to your account.
6.
Fees and charges.
The following fees and charges may be assessed against your account.
a. Statement copies—$5.00 per statement.
b. Account inquiries—$3.00 per inquiry.

Nature of dividends.
Dividends are paid from current income and available earnings, after required transfers to reserves at the end of a dividend period.
9.
Bylaw Requirements.
A member who fails to complete payment of one share within __________ of his admission to membership, or within __________ from the increase in the par value in shares, or a member who reduces his share balance below the par value of one share and does not increase the balance to at least the par value of one share within __________ of the reduction may be terminated from membership at the end of a dividend period. [All blanks should be filled with time chosen by credit union board of directors.] Shares may be transferred only from one member to another, by written instrument in such form as the Credit Union may prescribe. The Credit Union reserves the right, at any time, to require members to give, in writing, not more than 60 days notice of intention to withdraw the whole or any part of the amounts so paid in by them. Shares paid in under an accumulated payroll deduction plan may not be withdrawn until credited to a member's account. No member may withdraw shareholdings that are pledged as required on security on loans without the written approval of the credit committee or a loan officer, except to the extent that such shares exceed the member's total primary and contingent liability to the Credit Union. No member may withdraw any shareholdings below the amount of his/her primary or contingent liability to the Credit Union if he/she is delinquent as a borrower, or if borrowers for whom he/she is comaker, endorser, or guarantor are delinquent, without the written approval of the credit committee or loan officer.

# Note:
This form is modeled on the share account disclosures in the
Accounting Manual for FCUs,
§ 5150.7. The disclosures are for a variable-rate, average daily balance method dividend calculation share draft account in an FCU with no minimum balance requirement. For purposes of this example, the account was opened on January 15, 1995. The Credit Union has monthly dividend periods. Other terms are self-explanatory. The dividend rate paid and annual percentage yield disclosures will reflect the prospective dividend rate for a given dividend period. The disclosures are very similar to the ones in section B-6 of appendix B, except for the rollback and par value disclosures, which have been removed from the final rule and appendices.

# Money Market Share Account Disclosures
1.
Rate information.
As of January 1, 1995, if your average daily balance was $500 or more, the dividend rate paid on the entire balance in your account was 4.75%, with an annual percentage yield (APY) of 4.85%. If your average daily balance is $500 or more, a prospective dividend rate of 4.95% will be paid on the entire balance in your account with a prospective APY of 5.00% for this dividend period on your account. The dividend rate and APY may change every dividend period as determined by the credit union board of directors.

During any statement period, you may not make more than six withdrawals or transfers to another credit union account of yours or to a third party by means of a preauthorized or automatic transfer or telephonic order or instruction. No more than three of the six transfers may be made by check, draft, debit card, if applicable, or similar order to a third party. If you exceed the transfer limitations set forth above in any statement period, your account will be subject to closure by the credit union or to a fee of $1.00 per item.
8.

Pt. 707, App. C

# Appendix C to Part 707—Official Staff Interpretations

# Introduction
1.
Official status.
This commentary is the means by which the staff of the Office of General Counsel of the National Credit Union Administration issues official staff interpretations of Part 707 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations. Good faith compliance with this commentary affords protection from liability under section 271(f) of the Truth in Savings Act (TISA), 12 U.S.C. 4311.

# Section 707.1—Authority, Purpose, Coverage, and Effect on State Laws

# (c) Coverage
1.
Foreign applicability.
Part 707 applies to all credit unions that offer share and deposit accounts to residents (including resident aliens) of any state as defined in § 707.2(v) and that offer accounts insurable by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) whether or not such accounts are insured by the NCUSIF. Corporate credit unions designated as such by NCUA under 12 CFR 704.2 (definition of “corporate credit union”) are exempt from part 707.
2.
Persons who advertise accounts.
Persons who advertise accounts are subject to the advertising rules. This includes agent and agented accounts, such as a member who subdivides interests in a jumbo term share certificate account for sale to other parties or among members who form a certificate account investment club. For example, if an agent places an advertisement that offers members an interest in an account at a credit union, the advertising rules apply to the advertisement, whether the account is held by the agent or directly by the member.
3.
Nonautomated credit unions.
Nonautomated credit unions with an asset size of $2 million or less, after subtracting any nonmember deposits, are exempt from TISA and part 707. NCUA defines a “nonautomated credit union” as a credit union without sufficient data processing capability and capacity to establish, operate and maintain a share and loan software system to timely and accurately process all account transactions of all members. The nonautomated credit union exemption is available to all credit unions meeting the asset size and automation standards of this comment, including newly chartered credit unions. If any of the credit unions eligible for this exemption grow to have more than $2 million in assets
as of December 31 of any year, the NCUA Board will require such credit unions to comply with TISA and part 707 on January 1 of one year after such credit union loses its exemption eligibility. Similarly, if a credit union becomes sufficiently automated to operate a complete share and loan system, such credit union will be entitled to the same compliance phase-in period.

# (d) Effect on State Laws
1.
Preemption of state laws/Inconsistent requirements.
State law requirements that are inconsistent with the requirements of TISA and part 707 are preempted to the extent of the inconsistency. A state law is inconsistent if it requires a credit union to make disclosures or take actions that contradict the requirements of the federal law. A state law is also contradictory if it requires the use of the same term to represent a different amount or a different meaning than the federal law, requires the use of a term different from that required in the federal law to describe the same item, or permits a method of calculating dividends or interest on an account different from that required in the federal law.
2.
Preemption determinations.
A credit union, state, or other interested party may request the Board to determine whether a state law requirement is inconsistent with the federal requirements. A request for a determination should be addressed to NCUA's Office of General Counsel, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314. Written preemption requests should cite (or include a copy of) the allegedly inconsistent state law, demonstrate the inconsistency with TISA and part 707 and the burden on credit unions, and formally request a preemption determination. The Office of General Counsel may provide other interested parties, particularly affected states, an informal opportunity to comment on any request for a preemption determination, unless it finds that such notice and opportunity for comment would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. NCUA will publicize any preemption determinations using any means readily at its disposal.
3.
Effect of preemption determinations.
After the Board, through its Office of General Counsel, determines that a state law is inconsistent, a credit union may not make disclosures using the inconsistent term or take actions relying on the inconsistent law.
4.
Reversal of determination.
The Board reserves the right to reverse a determination for any reason bearing on the coverage or effect of state or federal law.

# Section 707.2—Definitions

# (a) Account
1.
Covered accounts.
Examples of accounts subject to the regulation are:
i. Dividend-bearing and interest-bearing accounts.
ii. Non-dividend-bearing and non-interest-bearing accounts.
iii. Accounts opened as a condition of obtaining a credit card.
iv. Escrow accounts with a consumer purpose, such as an account established by a member to escrow rental payments, pending resolution of a dispute with the member's landlord.
v. Accounts held by a parent or custodian for a minor under a state's Uniform Gift to Minors Act (or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act).
vi. Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and simplified employee pension (SEP) accounts.
vii. Payable-on-Death (POD) or “Totten trust” accounts.
2.
Other accounts.
Examples of accounts
not
subject to the regulation are:
i. Mortgage escrow accounts for collecting taxes and property insurance premiums.
ii. Accounts established to make periodic disbursements on construction loans.
iii. Trust accounts opened by a trustee pursuant to a formal written trust agreement (not merely declarations of trust on a signature card such as a “Totten trust,” or an IRA or SEP account).
iv. Accounts opened by an executor in the name of decedent's estate.
v. Accounts of individuals operating businesses as sole proprietors.
vi. Certificates of indebtedness. Some credit unions borrow funds from their members through a certificate of indebtedness that sets forth the terms and conditions of the repayment of the borrowing, such as federal credit unions do through 12 CFR 701.38. Such an account does not represent an account in a credit union and is not covered by part 707.
vii. Unincorporated nonbusiness association accounts.
3.
Other investments.
The term “account” does not apply to these products. Examples of products not covered are:
i. Government securities.
ii. Mutual funds.
iii. Annuities.
iv. Securities or obligations of a credit union.
v. Contractual arrangements such as repurchase agreements, interest rate swaps, and bankers acceptances.
vi. Purchases of U.S. Savings Bonds through a credit union.
vii. Services offered through a group purchasing plan or a credit union service organization (CUSO).
4.
Options.
All dividend-bearing and interest-bearing accounts are either fixed-rate or variable-rate accounts.
5.
Use of synonyms.
Generally, it is not the purpose of part 707 to prohibit specific descriptive terms for accounts. For example,
credit unions can use adjectives and trade names to describe accounts such as “Best Share Draft Account,” or “Ultra Money Market Share Account.” Synonyms for share, share draft, money market share, and term share accounts may be used to describe various types of credit union share and deposit accounts as long as the synonym is accurate and not misleading and, for account disclosures, is used in conjunction with the correct legal term. For example, the following synonyms may be used:
i. The term “checking account” may be used to describe share draft accounts.
ii. The term “money market account” may be used to describe money market share accounts.
iii. The term “savings account” may be used to describe regular share and share accounts.
iv. The terms “share certificate,” “certificate account,” or “certificate” may be used to describe share certificates and other dividend-bearing term share accounts.
v. However, under no circumstances may a credit union describe a share account as a deposit account, or vice versa. For example, the term “certificate of deposit” or “CD” may not be used to describe share certificates and other dividend-bearing term share accounts. Similarly, the terms “time account” (used in Regulation DD, 12 CFR 1030.2(u)) and “time deposit” (used in Federal Reserve Board's Regulation D, 12 CFR 204.2(c)) may not be used to describe term share accounts.

# (b) Advertisement
1.
Covered messages.
Advertisements include commercial messages in visual, oral, or print media that invite, offer, or otherwise announce generally to members and potential members the availability of member accounts such as:
i. Telephone solicitations.
ii. Messages on automated teller machine (ATM) screens (including any printout).
iii. Messages on a computer screen in a credit union's lobby (including any printout) other than a screen viewed solely by the credit union's employee.
iv. Messages in a newspaper, magazine, or promotional flyer or on radio or television.
v. Messages promoting an account that are provided along with information about the member's existing account at a credit union and that promote another account at the credit union (such as account promotional messages on the periodic statement).
2.
Other messages.
Examples of messages that are
not
advertisements are:
i. Rate sheets published in newspapers, periodicals, or trade journals (unless the credit union or share and deposit broker that offers accounts at the credit union pays a fee to have the information included or otherwise controls publication).
ii. Telephone conversations initiated by a member or potential member about an account.
iii. An in-person discussion with a member about the terms for a specific account.
iv. For purposes of § 707.8(b) of this part through § 707.8(e) of this part, information given to members about existing accounts, such as current rates recorded on a voice-response machine or notices for automatically renewable time account sent before renewal.
v. Information about a particular transaction in an existing account.
vi. Disclosures required by Federal or other applicable law.
vii. A share account agreement.

# (c) Annual Percentage Yield.
1.
General.
The annual percentage yield (APY) is required for disclosures for new accounts, oral responses to inquiries about rates; disclosures provided upon request; initial disclosures (if the credit union chooses to provide full disclosures instead of the abbreviated notice); notices prior to the renewal of a term share account, if known at the time the notice is sent, and in advertising. The annual percentage yield shows the total amount of dividends for a 365 day period (or a 366 day period for a leap year) on an assumed principal amount based on the dividend rate and frequency of compounding as a percentage of the assumed principal (for accounts such as share or share draft accounts) or for the total amount of dividends over the term of the account for term share accounts. The annual percentage yield assumes the principal amount remains in the account for 365 days (366 days for leap year) or for the term of the account.
2.
How Annual Percentage Yield Differs from Annual Percentage Yield Earned.
The annual percentage yield (APY) differs from the annual percentage yield earned (APYE). The annual percentage yield earned is required for periodic statements only. The annual percentage yield earned shows the total amount of dividends earned for the dividend or statement period as a percent of the actual average daily balance in the member's account. Unlike the annual percentage yield, the annual percentage yield earned is affected by additions and withdrawals during the period. The annual percentage yield and the annual percentage yield earned must be calculated according to the formulas provided in appendix A to this rule.

# (d) Average Daily Balance Method
1.
General.
One of the two required methods (the daily balance is the other) of determining the balance upon which dividends must be accrued and paid. The average daily balance method requires the application of a periodic rate to the average daily balance in the account for the average daily balance
calculation period. The average daily balance is determined by adding the full amount of principal in the account for each day of the period and dividing that figure by the number of days in the period.

# (e) Board.
1.
General.
The NCUA Board.

# (f) Bonus
1.
General.
Bonuses include items of value offered as incentives to members, such as an offer to pay the final installment deposit for a holiday club account if the final installment is over $10. Bonuses do not include the payment of dividends (including extraordinary dividends), the waiver or reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses, non-dividend membership benefits, or other consideration aggregating $10 or less per year.
2.
Examples.
The following are examples of bonuses.
i. A credit union offers $25 to potential members for becoming a member and opening an account. The $25 could be provided by check, cash, or direct deposit.
ii. A credit union offers $25 to a member with only a regular share account to open a share draft account. The $25 could be provided by check, cash, or direct deposit.
iii. A credit union offers a portable radio with a value of $20 to members and potential members for opening a share draft account.
iv. A credit union pays the final installment deposit for a holiday club account if over $10.
3.
Examples not comprising bonuses.
The following are examples of items that are
not
bonuses:
i. Discount coupons distributed by credit unions for use at restaurants or stores.
ii. A credit union offers $20 to any member if the member is responsible for encouraging a potential member to open an account. The $20 is not a bonus because the $20 is not paid to the individual opening the account. Any item, including cash, given or offered to a third party (that is not a joint member or joint owner in an account being opened) in exchange for a member or potential member opening (or a member renewing or adding to) an account is not a bonus.
iii. A credit union offers $25 to a member if the member can locate his name in the body of a newsletter.
iv. Life savings benefits. Many credit unions offer life savings benefits to beneficiaries of deceased members. Because the benefit accrues to a third party, such life savings plans offered are not bonuses.
v. A credit union offers to pay annual membership dues in a benevolent organization for a class of members.
4.
De minimis rule.
Items with a
de minimis
value of $10 or less are not bonuses. Credit unions may rely on the valuation standard used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to determine if the value of the item is
de minimis.
Items required to be reported by the credit union under IRS rules are bonuses under this regulation. Examples of items of
de minimis
values are:
i. Disability insurance premiums on a share account valued at an amount of $10 or less per year.
ii. Coffee mugs, T-shirts or other merchandise with a market value of $10 or less per year.
5.
Aggregation.
In determining if an item valued at $10 or less is a bonus, credit unions must aggregate per account per calendar year items that may be given to members. In making this determination, credit unions aggregate per account only the market value of items that may be given for a specific promotion. To illustrate, assume a credit union offers in January to give members an item valued at $7 for each calendar quarter during the year that the average account balance in a share draft account exceeds $10,000. The bonus rules are triggered, since members are eligible under the promotion to receive up to $28 during the year. However, the bonus rules are not triggered if an item valued at $7 is offered to members opening a share draft account during the month of January, even though in November the credit union introduces a new promotion that includes, for example, an offer to existing share draft accountholders for an item valued at $8 for maintaining an average balance of $5,000 for the month.
6.
Waiver or reduction of a fee or absorption of expenses.
Bonuses do not include value received by members through the waiver or reduction of fees for credit union-related services (even if the fees waived exceed $10), such as the following:
i. Waiving a safe deposit box rental fee for one year for members who open a new account.
ii. Waiving fees for travelers checks for members, and waiving check and share draft printing fees.
iii. Nondiscriminatorily waiving all fees for a particular class of members, such as seniors or minors.
iv. Discounts on interest rates charged for loans at the credit union.
v. Rebates of loan interest already paid by a member.
vi. Discounts on application fees charged for loans at the credit union.
vii. Packaged, linked, or tied-account services.
7.
Non-dividend membership benefits.
Such benefits are not bonuses because they are sporadic in nature, often difficult to value, and providing non-dividend membership benefits is a long-standing unique credit union practice. (See commentary to § 707.2(r) for examples of such benefits.)

Includes credit unions in the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, and U.S. territories. Applies to credit unions whether or not the accounts in the credit union are federally, state, privately insured, or uninsured.

# (h) Daily Balance Method
1.
General.
One of the two required methods (the average daily balance is the other) of determining the balance upon which dividends must be accrued and paid. The daily balance method requires the application of a daily periodic rate to the full amount of principal in the account each day.

# (i) Dividend and Dividends
1.
General.
Member savings placed in share accounts are equity investments, and the returns earned on these accounts are dividends. Federal credit unions may only offer dividend-bearing and non-dividend-bearing share accounts. State-chartered credit unions may offer both share and deposit accounts if permitted by state law. State law, including without limitation regulations and official interpretations, will determine if returns earned in accounts in state-chartered credit unions are dividends. Dividends exclude the payment of a bonus or other consideration worth $10 or less given during a year, the waiver or reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses, non-dividend membership benefits and extraordinary dividends. Dividend-bearing accounts must be either fixed-rate or variable-rate accounts.
2.
Procedure.
Credit unions must follow appropriate law (state law for state-chartered credit unions and federal law for federal credit unions) in determining dividend policies and declaring dividends. Generally, dividends may be viewed as a portion of the available account and undivided earnings of the credit union which is set apart, after required transfer to reserves, by valid act of the board of directors, for distribution among the members. As a matter of legal procedure, members are usually not entitled to dividends until the following steps are completed: (1) The board of the credit union develops a nondiscriminatory dividend policy, by establishing dividend periods, dividend credit determination dates dividend distribution dates, any associated penalties (if applicable), and the method of dividend computation for each type of share account; (2) the provisions for required transfers to reserves are made; (3) sufficient and available prior and/or current earnings are available at the end of the dividend period; (4) the board formally makes a dividend declaration in accordance with the credit union's dividend policy; and (5) dividends must be paid to members by a credit to the appropriate share account, payment by check or share draft, or by a combination of the two methods.
3.
When available.
Credit unions must follow the law of their primary chartering authority to determine when dividends are available. Generally, it is the declaration of the dividend itself which creates the dividend and the member has no right to receive a dividend until it is so declared. The decision of when to declare dividends lies within the official discretion of each credit union's board of directors and cannot be abrogated by contract. An agreement to pay dividends on a share account is generally interpreted not as an obligation to pay the stipulated dividends absolutely and unconditionally, but as an undertaking to pay them out of the earnings when sufficiently accumulated from which dividends in general are properly payable. Generally, “prospective rates” are rates set in good faith in advance of the close of a dividend period, that may be altered if sufficient funds are not available, or in the event of a superseding event, such as a strike, plant closure, significant fluctuation in market rates and/or a significant change in financial structure, natural disaster or emergency that alters the assumptions under which the “prospective rates” were made. It is the intent of TISA that all disclosure be accurate when made, and credit unions are urged to make every effort to ratify disclosed “prospective rates.” “Prospective rates” may also be referred to as “projected rates” or similar wording, but not as “estimated rates.” (See comment 3(b)-2, prohibiting use of estimates).
4.
Sample dividend resolutions.
(i) The following resolution may be used where the dividend rates are set after the close of a dividend period.

# Resolution of Board of Directors for the Declaration of Dividends
A. I, ________________, certify that I am Secretary of ________________ Credit Union Board of Directors, and that the following is a correct copy of the resolution for declaring dividend adopted by the ________________ Credit Union at a meeting of the Board of Directors duly and properly held on __________________, 19____. This resolution appears in the minutes of this meeting and has not been rescinded or modified.
B. Resolved, that
(1) The Board of Directors has developed a nondiscriminatory dividend policy, by establishing dividend periods, dividend credit determination dates, dividend distribution dates, any associated penalties (if applicable), and the method of dividend computation for each type of share account;
(2) The required transfers to reserves have been made; and
(3) Sufficient and available prior and/or current earnings are available at the end of this dividend period.
C. Resolved, further, that the Board of Directors now formally makes a dividend declaration in accordance with the Credit Union's dividend policy and authorizes that on ________________, 19____, dividends must be paid to members by a credit to the appropriate share account, payment by share draft or by a combination of the two methods.
D. I further certify that the Board of Directors of this Credit Union has, and at the time of adoption of this resolution had, full power and lawful authority to adopt the foregoing resolutions and that this resolution revokes any prior resolution.
In witness whereof, this is my signature and the date on which I signed this Resolution.

(ii) The following resolution may be used where the dividend rates are set before the close of a dividend period.

# Resolution of Board of Directors for the Declaration of Dividends
A. I, ________________, certify that I am the Secretary of ________________ Credit Union, and that the following is a correct copy of the resolution for declaring dividends adopted by the ________________ Credit Union at a meeting of the Board of Directors duly and properly held on ____________________, 19____. This resolution appears in the minutes of that meeting and has not been rescinded or modified.
B. Resolved, that the Board of Directors has adopted a nondiscriminatory dividend policy, by establishing dividend periods, dividend credit determination dates, dividend distribution dates, any associated penalties (if applicable) and the method of dividend computation for each type of share account.
C. Resolved, that it is the policy and practice of the Board of Directors to meet periodically to establish prospective dividend rates for each type of dividend-bearing share account.
D. Resolved, that if the required transfers to reserves have been made and there are sufficient and available prior and/or current earnings available at the end of a dividend period, the officers of the Credit Union are authorized to pay dividends at the rate prospectively established by the Board of Directors for each account for the dividend period. The officers may pay the dividends without any further action of the Board of Directors. The act of paying the dividends shall constitute the declaration of the dividends and shall be a ratification of the prospective dividend rate.
In witness whereof, this is my signature and the date on which I signed this Resolution.

5.
Referencing.
Except where specifically stated otherwise, use of the term “share” in part 707, as in “share account,” also refers to “deposit,” as in “deposit account,” where appropriate (for interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing deposit accounts at some state-chartered credit unions).

# (j) Dividend Declaration Date
1.
General.
The importance of the dividend declaration date is to tie the last paid dividend to a certain period of time to place members and potential members on notice that the last paid dividend is different from the next dividend to be paid. In order to achieve this purpose, a credit union may use any of the following methods:
i. “As of 3/15/95” (the date the board of directors last met and declared the last paid dividend).
ii. “As of 3/31/95” (the last day of the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid).
iii. “For the period 1/1/95 to 3/31/95” (the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid).
iv. “For the first quarter of 1995” (the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid).
v. “For April 1995” (the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid).
vi. “As of the last dividend declaration date” (the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid).

# (k) Dividend Period
1.
General.
The dividend period is to be set by a credit union's board of directors for each account type, e.g., regular share, share draft, money market share, and term share. The most common dividend periods are weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. Dividend periods need not agree with calendar months, e.g., a monthly dividend period could begin March 15 and end April 14.

# (l) Dividend Rate
1.
General.
The dividend rate does not reflect compounding. Compounding is reflected in the “annual percentage yield” definition.
2.
Referencing.
Except where specifically stated otherwise, use of the term “dividend rate” in part 707 also refers to “interest
rate,” where appropriate (for interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposit accounts at some state-chartered credit unions).

# (m) Extraordinary Dividends
1.
General.
The definition encompasses all irregularly scheduled and declared dividends, and as dividends, extraordinary dividends are exempt from the “bonus” disclosure requirements. Extraordinary dividends do not have to be disclosed on account disclosures, but the dollar amount of an extraordinary dividend credited to the account during the statement period does have to be separately disclosed on the periodic statement for the dividend period during which the extraordinary dividends are earned. Extraordinary dividends, like ordinary dividends, do not include the payment of a bonus or other consideration worth $10 or less given during a year, the waiver or reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses or non-dividend membership benefits. See comments 2(f) 1 through 7 and 2(i) 1 through 4. Extraordinary dividends may be calculated by any means determined by the board of directors of a credit union and may not be used in the annual percentage yield earned calculation.
2.
Use of synonym.
Extraordinary dividends may be described as “bonus dividends.”

# (n) Fixed-Rate Account
1.
General.
Includes all accounts in which the credit union, by contract, agrees to give at least 30 days advance written notice of decreases in the dividend rate. Thus, credit unions can decrease rates only after providing advance written notice of rate decreases,
e.g.,
a “change-in-terms notice.”

# (o) Grace Period
1.
General.
A period after maturity of an automatically renewing term share account during which the member may withdraw funds without being assessed a penalty. Use of a “grace period” is discretionary, not mandatory. This definition does not refer to the “grace period” account, which is a synonym for “federal rollback method” or “in by the 10th” accounts, which are prohibited by TISA and part 707.

# (p) Interest
1.
General.
Member savings placed in deposit accounts are debt investments, and the return earned on these accounts is interest. Federal credit unions are not authorized to offer any interest-bearing deposit accounts. State-chartered credit unions may offer both share and deposit accounts if permitted by state law. State law, including without limitation regulations and official interpretations, will determine if returns earned in accounts in state-chartered credit unions are interest. Interest excludes the payment of a bonus or other consideration worth $10 or less given during a year, the waiver of reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses, non-dividend membership benefits, and extraordinary dividends.
2.
Differences between dividends and interest.
Generally, dividends are returns on an equity investment (shares); interest is return on a debt investment (deposits). Dividends, in general, are not properly payable until declared at the close of a dividend period; interest, in general, is properly payable daily according to the deposit contract. Dividend rates are prospective until actually declared; interest rates are set according to contract in advance and are earned on that basis. Share accounts establish a member (owner)/credit union (cooperative) relationship; deposit accounts establish a depositor (creditor)/depository (debtor) relationship.
3.
Referencing.
Except where specifically stated otherwise, use of the terms “dividend” or “dividends” in part 707 also refers to “interest” where appropriate (for interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposit accounts at some state-chartered credit unions).

# (q) Member
1.
Professional capacity.
Examples of accounts held by a natural person in a professional capacity for another are:
i. Attorney-client trust accounts.
ii. Trust, estate and court-ordered accounts.
iii. Landlord-tenant security accounts.
2.
Other accounts.
Examples of accounts
not
held in a professional capacity include accounts held by parents for a child under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act.
3.
Retirement plans.
IRAs and SEP accounts are member accounts to the extent that funds are invested in accounts subject to the regulation. Keogh accounts, like sole proprietor accounts, are not subject to the regulation.

# (r) Non-Dividend Membership Benefits
1.
General.
Term reflects unique credit union practices that are difficult to value, encourage community spirit, and are not granted in such quantity as to be includable as calculable dividends.
2.
Examples.
Examples include:
i. Food, refreshments, and drawings and raffles at annual meetings, member functions, and branch openings.
ii. Travel club benefits.
iii. Prizes offered at annual meetings, such as U.S. Savings Bonds, a deposit of funds into the winner's account, trips, and other gifts. Such prizes are not bonuses because they are offered as an incentive to increase attendance at the annual meeting, and not to entice members to open, maintain, or
renew accounts or increase an account balance.
iv. Life savings benefits.

# (s) Passbook Account
1.
Relation to Regulation E.
Passbook accounts include accounts accessed by preauthorized electronic fund transfers to the account (as defined in 12 CFR 1005.2(k)), such as an account credited by direct share and deposit of social security payments. Accounts that permit access by other electronic means are not “passbook accounts,” and any statements that are sent four or more times a year must comply with the requirements of § 707.6.

# (t) Periodic Statement
1.
General.
Periodic statements are not required by part 707. Passbook and term share accounts are exempt from periodic statement requirements.
2.
Examples.
Periodic statements do not include:
i. Additional statements provided solely upon request.
ii. General service information such as a quarterly newsletter or other correspondence that describes available services and products.

# (u) Potential Member
1.
General.
A potential member is a natural person eligible for membership in a credit union, who has not yet taken the steps necessary to become a member. The term also includes natural person nonmembers eligible to hold accounts in a credit union pursuant to relevant federal or state law.
2.
Verification of eligibility.
It is recommended that credit unions have sound written procedures in place to identify those eligible for membership. If these procedures include verification measures, such as an application process, verification telephone call or letter to an employer or association within the field of membership, witnessing by an existing member, or similar procedure, then the credit union may first verify the membership eligibility of a potential member before providing account disclosures or other information to the potential member. This process of verifying a member's eligibility status, making a recommendation for membership, and providing account disclosures should be completed within 20 calendar days. This period also applies when potential members not on credit union premises request disclosures.
3.
Nonmembers.
Within its sole discretion, the board of directors of a credit union may provide TISA disclosures to nonmembers who are ineligible for membership or to hold an account at the credit union. If disclosures are made to such nonmembers, it is the position of the Board that no civil liability can accrue to the credit union for any errors in such disclosures. (See commentary to § 707.3(d)).

# (v) State
1.
General.
Territories and possessions include American Samoa, Guam, the Mariana Islands, and the Marshall Islands.

# (w) Stepped-Rate Account
1.
General.
Stepped-rate accounts are those accounts in which two or more dividend rates (known at the time the account is opened) will take effect in succeeding periods.
2.
Example.
An example of a stepped-rate account is a one-year term share certificate account in which a 5.00% dividend rate is paid for the first six months, and 5.50% for the second six months.

# (x) Term Share Account
1.
Relation to the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation D.
Federal Reserve Board's Regulation D permits, in limited circumstances, the withdrawal of funds without penalty during the first six days after a “time deposit” is opened. (See 12 CFR 204.2(c)(1)(i).) But the fact that a member makes a withdrawal as permitted by Regulation D does not disqualify the account from being a term share account for purposes of this regulation (such as withdrawals upon the death of the member, or within a “grace period” for automatically renewable term share accounts).
2.
Club accounts.
Club accounts, including Christmas club, holiday club, and vacation club accounts may be either term share or regular share accounts, depending on the terms of the account. Although club accounts typically have a maturity date, they are not term share accounts unless they also require a penalty of at least seven days' dividends for withdrawals during the first six days after the account is opened.

# (y) Tiered-Rate Account
1.
General.
Tiered-rate accounts are those accounts in which two or more dividend rates are paid on the account and are determined by reference to a specified balance level. Tiered-rate accounts are of two types: Tiering Method A and Tiering Method B. In Tiering Method A accounts, the credit union pays the applicable tiered dividends rate on the entire amount in the account. This method is also known as the “hybrid” or “plateau” tiered-rate account. In Tiering Method B accounts, the credit union does not pay the applicable tiered dividends rate on the entire amount in the account, but only on the portion of the share account balance that falls within each specified tier. This method is also known as the “pure” or “split-rate” tiered-rate account. (See appendix A, part I, D.)
2.
Example.
An example of a tiered-rate account is one in which a credit union pays a 5.00% dividend rate on balances below $1,000, and 5.50% on balances $1,000 and above.
3.
Term share accounts.
Term share accounts that pay different rates based solely on the amount of the initial share and deposit are not tiered-rate accounts.
4.
Minimum balance accounts.
A requirement to maintain a minimum balance to earn dividends does not make an account a tiered-rate account. If dividends are not paid on amounts below a specified balance level, then the account has a minimum balance requirement (required to be disclosed under § 707.4(b)(3)(i)), but the account does not constitute a tiered-rate account. A zero rate (0%) cannot constitute a tier. Minimum balance accounts are single rate accounts with a minimum balance requirement.

# (z) Variable-Rate Account
1.
General.
Includes accounts in which the credit union does not contract to give at least 30 days advance written notice of decreases in the dividend rate. An account meets this definition whether the rate change is determined by reference to an index, by use of a formula, or merely at the discretion of the credit union's board of directors. An account that permits one or more rate adjustments prior to maturity at the member's option, such as a rate relock option, is a variable-rate account.
2.
Differences between fixed-rate and variable-rate accounts.
All accounts must either be fixed-rate or variable-rate accounts. Classifying an account as variable-rate affects credit unions three ways:
i. Additional account disclosures are required (§ 707.4(b)(1)(ii));
ii. Rate decreases are exempted from change-in-terms requirements (§ 707.5(a)(2)(i)); and
iii. Advertising notice required (§ 707.8(c)(1)).
Fixed-rate accounts require a contract term obligating the credit union to a 30-day advance, written notice to members before decreasing the dividend rate on the account. Term changes adversely affecting the member and rate decreases cannot take effect until 30 days after such fixed-rate change-in-terms notices are mailed or delivered to members (§ 707.5(a)).

# Section 707.3—General Disclosure Requirements

# (a) Form
1.
General.
All required disclosures (e.g., account disclosures, change-in-terms notices, term share renewal/maturity notices, statement disclosures and advertising disclosures) must be made clearly and conspicuously, in a form the member may retain. Disclosures need be made only as applicable (e.g., disclosures for a non-dividend-bearing account would not include disclosure of annual percentage yield, dividend rate, or other disclosures pertaining to dividend calculations).
2.
Design requirements.
Disclosures must be presented in a format that allows members and potential members to readily understand the terms of their account. Credit unions are not required to use a particular type size or typeface, nor are credit unions required to state any term more conspicuously than any other term. Disclosures may be made:
i. In any order.
ii. In combination with other disclosures or account terms.
iii. In combination with disclosures for other types of accounts, as long as it is clear to members and potential members which disclosures apply to their account.
iv. On more than one page and on the front and reverse sides.
v. By using inserts to a document or filling in blanks.
vi. On more than one document, as long as the documents are provided at the same time.
3.
Consistent terminology.
A credit union must use the same terminology to describe terms or features that are required to be disclosed. For example, if a credit union describes a monthly fee (regardless of account activity), as a “monthly service fee” in account opening disclosures, the periodic statements and change-in-terms notices must use the same terminology so that members and potential members can readily identify the fee.

# (b) General
1.
Terms and conditions.
Credit unions are required to have disclosures reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the credit union and a member at the time the member opens the account. This provision does not impose any contract terms or supersede state or other laws that define how the legal obligations between a credit union and its membership are determined.
2.
Specificity of legal obligation.
Credit unions may refer to the calendar month or to roughly equivalent intervals during a calendar year as a “month.” Use of estimates is prohibited in TISA disclosures.
3.
Foreign language.
Disclosures may be made in any foreign language, if desired by the board of directors of a credit union. However, disclosures must also be provided in English, upon request.

# (c) Relation to Regulation E
1.
General rule.
Compliance with Regulation E (12 CFR part 1005) is deemed to satisfy the disclosure requirements of this regulation, such as when:
i. A credit union changes a term that triggers a notice under Regulation E, and the
timing and disclosure rules of Regulation E for sending change-in-terms notices.
ii. A member adds an ATM access feature to an account, and the credit union provides disclosures pursuant to Regulation E, including disclosure of fees before the member receives ATM access. (See 12 CFR 1005.7.)
iii. A credit union complying with the timing rules of Regulation E discloses at the same time fees for electronic services (such as balance inquiry fees imposed if the inquiry is made at an ATM) that are required to be disclosed by this regulation, but not by Regulation E.
iv. A credit union relies on Regulation E's rules regarding disclosures of limitations on the frequency and amount of electronic fund transfers, including security-related exceptions. But any limitation on the number of “intra-institutional transfers” to or from the member's other accounts at the credit union during a given time period must be disclosed, even though intra-institutional transfers are exempt from Regulation E.

# (d) Multiple Members
1.
General.
When an account has multiple natural person member accountholders, delivery of disclosures to any member accountholder or agent authorized by the accountholder satisfies the disclosure requirements of part 707.

# (e) Oral Response to Inquiries
1.
Application of rule.
Credit unions need not provide rate information orally. Disclosures need be made only as appropriate. For example, the requirement to give a telephone number for a member to call about rates for interest-bearing accounts and dividend-bearing term share accounts, would not be necessary for members calling the credit union for information. Also, the disclosure requirements are applicable only to credit union employees and volunteers acting in the ordinary course of credit union business.
2.
Relation to advertising.
The advertising rules do not cover an oral response to a question about rates.
3.
Existing accounts.
This paragraph does not apply to oral responses about rate information for existing term share accounts or accounts not currently offered. For example, if a member holding a one-year term share account requests dividend rate information about the account during the term, the credit union need not disclose the annual percentage yield, unless the member is calling for rate information under a maturity notice.

# (f) Rounding and Accuracy Rules for Rates and Yields

# (f)(1) Rounding
1.
Permissible rounding.
The annual percentage yield, annual percentage yield earned and dividend rate must be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one percentage point (.01%) when disclosed. Examples of permissible rounding are an annual percentage yield calculated to be 5.644%, rounded down and shown as 5.64%; 5.645% would be rounded up and disclosed as 5.65%. For account disclosures, the dividend rate may be expressed to more than two decimal places.

# (f)(2) Accuracy
1.
Annual percentage yield and annual percentage yield earned.
The tolerance for annual percentage yield and annual percentage yield earned calculations is designed to accommodate inadvertent errors. Credit unions may not purposely incorporate the one-twentieth of one percentage point (.05%) tolerance into their calculation of yields.
2.
Dividend rate.
There is no tolerance for an inaccuracy in the dividend rate.

# Section 707.4—Account Disclosures

# (a) Delivery of Account Disclosures

# (a)(1) Account Opening
1.
New accounts.
New account disclosures must be provided when:
i. A term share account that does not automatically rollover is renewed by a member.
ii. A member changes the term for a renewable term share account (from a one-year term share account to a six-month term share account, for instance) (see comment 5(b)-5 regarding disclosure alternatives).
iii. A credit union transfers funds from an account to open a new account not at the member's request, unless the credit union previously gave account disclosures and any change-in-terms notices for the new account (e.g., funds in a money market share account are transferred by a credit union to open a new account for the member, such as a share draft account, because the member exceeded transaction limitations on the money market share account).
iv. A credit union accepts a deposit from a member to an account that the credit union had previously deemed to be “closed,” under applicable federal or state law, for the purpose of treating accrued, but uncredited, dividends as forfeited dividends. New account numbers are not required by this requirement.
2.
Acquired accounts.
New account disclosures need not be given when a credit union acquires an account through an acquisition of, or merger with, another credit union (but see § 707.5(a) regarding advance notice requirements if terms are changed).
3.
Combination disclosures.
New account disclosures need not be given when a member has already received disclosures covering several accounts, and opens a new account properly disclosed by the already received combination disclosures, if the new account is opened within a reasonable amount of time after receipt of the combination disclosures and if the received disclosures and terms are accurate at the time the new account is opened.

# (a)(2) Requests

# (a)(2)(i)
1.
Inquiries versus requests.
A response to an oral inquiry (by telephone or in person) about rates and yields or fees does not trigger the duty to provide account disclosures. But, when a member asks for written information about an account (whether by telephone, in person, or by other means), the credit union must provide disclosures unless the account is no longer offered to the public.
2.
General requests.
When members or potential members request disclosures about a type of account (a share draft account, for example), a credit union that offers several variations may provide disclosures for any one of them. No disclosures need be made to nonmembers, though a credit union may provide disclosures to nonmembers within its sole discretion.
3.
Timing for response.
Ten business days is a reasonable time for responding to requests for account information that members or potential members do not make in person, including requests made by electronic means, such as by electronic mail.
4.
Use of electronic means.
If a member or potential member who is not present at the credit union makes a request for account disclosures, including a request made by telephone, e-mail, or via the credit union's Web site, the credit union may send the disclosures in paper form or, if the member or potential member agrees, may provide the disclosures electronically, such as to an e-mail address that the member or potential member provides for that purpose, or on the credit union's Web site, without regard to the consent or other provisions of the E-Sign Act. The regulation does not require a credit union to provide, nor a member or potential member to agree to receive, the disclosures required by § 707.4(a)(2) in electronic form.

# (a)(2)(ii)(A)(2)
1.
Recent rates.
Credit unions comply with this paragraph if they disclose an interest rate (or dividend rate on a dividend-bearing term share account) and annual percentage yield accurate within the seven calendar days preceding the date they send the disclosures.

# (a)(2)(ii)(B)
1.
Term.
Describing the maturity of a term share account as “1 year” or “6 months,” for example, illustrates a response stating the maturity of a term share account as a term rather than a date (e.g., “June 1, 1995”).

# (b) Content of Account Disclosures

# (b)(1) Rate Information

# (b)(1)(i) Annual Percentage Yield and Dividend Rate
1.
Rate disclosures.
In addition to the dividend rate and annual percentage yield, credit unions may disclose a periodic rate corresponding to the dividend rate. No other rate or yield (such as “tax effective yield”) is permitted. If the annual percentage yield is the same as the dividend rate, credit unions may disclose a single figure but must use both terms.
2.
Fixed-rate accounts.
For fixed-rate term share accounts paying the opening rate until maturity, credit unions may disclose the period of time the dividend rate will be in effect by stating, or cross-referencing, the maturity date. For other fixed-rate accounts, credit unions may use a date (such as “This rate will be in effect through June 30, 1995”) or a period (such as “This rate will be in effect for at least 30 days”).
3.
Tiered-rate accounts.
Each dividend rate, along with the corresponding annual percentage yield for each specified balance level (or range of annual percentage yields, if appropriate), must be disclosed for tiered-rate accounts. (See appendix A, Part I, Paragraph D.)
4.
Stepped-rate accounts.
A single composite annual percentage yield must be disclosed for stepped-rate accounts. (See appendix A, Part I, Paragraph B.) The dividend rates and the period of time each will be in effect also must be provided. When the initial rate offered for a specified time on a variable-rate account is higher or lower than the rate that would otherwise be paid on the account, the calculation of the annual percentage yield must be made as if for a stepped-rate account. (See appendix A, Part I, Paragraph C.)
5.
Minimum balance accounts.
If a credit union sets a minimum balance to earn dividends, the credit union may, but need not, state that the annual percentage yield is 0% for those days the balance in the account drops below the minimum balance level when using the daily balance method. Nor is a disclosure of 0% required for credit unions using the average daily balance method, if the member fails to meet the minimum balance required for the average daily balance period.

# (b)(1)(ii) Variable Rates

# (b)(1)(ii)(B)
1.
Determining dividend rates.
To disclose how the dividend rate is determined, credit unions must:
i. Identify the index and specific margin, if the dividend rate is tied to an index.
ii. State that rate changes are within the credit union's discretion, if the credit union does not tie changes to an index.

# (b)(1)(ii)(C)
1.
Frequency of rate changes.
A credit union reserving the right to change rates at its discretion must state the fact that rates may change at any time.

# (b)(1)(ii)(D)
1.
Limitations.
A floor or ceiling on rates or on the amount the rate may decrease or increase during any time period must be disclosed. Credit unions need not disclose the absence of limitations on rate changes.

# (b)(2) Compounding and Crediting

# (b)(2)(i) Frequency
1.
General.
Descriptions such as “quarterly” or “monthly” are sufficient. Irregular crediting and compounding periods, such as if a cycle is out short at year end for tax reporting purposes, need not be disclosed.
2.
Dividend period.
For dividend-bearing accounts, the dividend period must be disclosed. (A specific example must also be given, see appendix B, § B-1(c).) The dividend period for term share accounts generally may be disclosed as the account's term (e.g., two years).

# (b)(2)(ii) Effect of Closing an Account
1.
Deeming an account closed.
A credit union may, subject to state or other law, provide in account contracts the actions by members that will be treated as closing the account and that will result in the forfeiture of accrued but uncredited dividends. An example is the withdrawal of all funds from the account prior to the date dividends are credited. Credit unions are cautioned that bylaw requirements may prevent a credit union from deeming a member's account closed until certain time periods are extinguished if funds remain in a member's account.
NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws,
Art. III, § 3. Such bylaw requirements may not be overridden without proper agency approval.

# (b)(3) Balance Information

# (b)(3)(i) Minimum Balance Requirements
1.
Par value.
Credit unions must disclose any minimum balance required to open the account, to avoid the imposition of a fee, or to obtain the annual percentage yield. Since members cannot generally maintain any accounts until the par value of the membership share is paid in full, this section requires that credit unions disclose the par value of a share necessary to become a member and maintain accounts at the credit union. The par value of a share and the minimum balance requirement do not have to be the same amount (e.g., a credit union may have a $5 par value for a membership share, in order for accounts to be opened and maintained, and a $100 minimum balance requirement, in order for the account to earn dividends).
2.
Disclosures.
The explanation of minimum balance computation methods may be combined with the balance computation method disclosures (§ 707.4(b)(3)(ii)) if they are the same. If a credit union uses different cycles for determining minimum balance requirements for purposes of assessing fees and for paying dividends, the credit union must disclose the specific cycle or time period used for each purpose (e.g., use of a midmonth statement cycle for determining dividends, and use of a calendar month cycle for determining fees). Credit unions may assess fees by using any method. If fees on one account are tied to the balance in another account, such provision must be explained (e.g., if share draft fees are tied to a minimum balance in the regular share account (or a combination of the share draft and regular share accounts), the share draft account must explain that fact and how the balance in the regular share account (or both accounts) is determined). The fee need not be disclosed in the account disclosures if the fee is not imposed on that account.

# (b)(3)(ii) Balance Computation Method
1.
Methods and periods.
Credit unions may use different methods or periods to calculate minimum balances for purposes of imposing a fee (the daily balance for a calendar month, for example) and accruing dividends (the average daily balance for a statement period, for example). Each method and corresponding period must be disclosed.

# (b)(3)(iii) When dividends begin to accrue
1.
Additional information.
Credit unions must include a statement as to when dividends begin to accrue for noncash deposits. Credit unions may disclose additional information such as the time of day after which deposits are treated as having been received the following business day, and may use additional descriptive terms such as “ledger” or “collected” balances to disclose when dividends begin to accrue. Under the ledger balance method, dividends begin to accrue on the day of deposit. Under the collected balance methods, dividends begin to accrue when provisional credit is received for the item deposited.

# (b)(4) Fees
1.
Types of fees.
Fees related to the routine use of an account must be disclosed. The following are types of fees that must be disclosed in connection with an account:
i. Maintenance fees, such as monthly service fees.
ii. Fees related to share deposits or withdrawals.
iii. Fees for special services, such as stop payment fees, fees for balance inquiries or verification of share and deposits, fees associated with checks returned unpaid, fees for regularly sending to members share drafts that otherwise would be held by the credit union, and overdraft line of credit access fees (if charged against the share account).
iv. Fees to open or to close an account.
v. Fees imposed upon dormant or inactive accounts.
2.
Other fees.
Credit unions need not disclose fees such as the following:
i. Fees for services offered to members and nonmembers alike, such as fees for certain travelers checks, for wire transfers and automated clearinghouse (ACH) transfers, to process credit card cash advances, or to handle U.S. Savings Bond Redemption (even if different amounts are charged to members and nonmembers).
ii. Incidental fees, such as fees associated with state escheat laws, garnishment or attorneys fees, to change names on an account, to generate a midcycle periodic statement, to wrap loose coins, for photocopying, for statements returned to the credit union because of a wrong address, and locator fees.
3.
Amount of fees.
Credit unions are cautioned that merely providing fee information in an account disclosure may not be sufficient to gain the legal right to impose the fee involved under applicable law. Credit unions must state the amount and conditions under which a fee may be imposed. Naming and describing the fee typically satisfies this requirement. Some examples are:
i. “$4.00 monthly service fee”.
ii. $7.00 and up” or “fee depends on style of checks ordered” for check printing fees.
4.
Tied-accounts.
Credit unions must state if fees that may be assessed against an account are tied to other accounts at the credit union. For example, if a credit union ties the fees payable on a share draft account to balances held in the share draft account and in a regular share account, the share draft account disclosures must state that fact and explain how the fee is determined.
5.
Regulation E statements.
Some fees are required to be disclosed under both Regulation E (12 CFR 1005.7) and part 707. If such fees, such as ATM transaction fees, are disclosed on a Regulation E statement, they need not be disclosed again on a periodic statement required under part 707.
6.
Fees for overdrawing an account.
Under § 707.4(b)(4) of this part, credit unions must disclose the conditions under which a fee may be imposed. In satisfying this requirement credit unions must specify the categories of transactions for which an overdraft fee may be imposed. An exhaustive list of transactions is not required. It is sufficient for a credit union to state that the fee applies to overdrafts “created by check, in-person withdrawal, ATM withdrawal, or other electronic means.” Disclosing a fee “for overdraft items” would not be sufficient.

# (b)(5) Transaction Limitations
1.
General rule.
Examples of limitations on the number of dollar amount of share deposits or withdrawals that credit unions must disclose are:
i. Limits on the number of share drafts or checks that may be written on an account for a given time period.
ii. Limits on withdrawals or share deposits during the term of a term share account.
iii. Limitations required by Regulation D, such as the number of withdrawals permitted from money market share accounts by check to third parties each month (credit unions need not disclose reservation of right to require a notice for withdrawals from accounts required by federal or state law).

# (b)(6) Features of Term Share Accounts

# (b)(6)(i) Time Requirements
1.
“Callable” term share accounts.
In addition to the maturity date, credit unions must state the date or the circumstances under which the credit union may redeem a term share account at the credit union's option (a “callable” term share account).

# (b)(6)(ii) Early Withdrawal Penalties
1.
General.
The term “penalty” may, but need not, be used to describe the loss that may be incurred by members for early withdrawal of funds from term share accounts.
2.
Examples.
Examples of early withdrawal penalties are:
i. Monetary penalties, such as a specific dollar amount (
e.g.,
“$10.00”) or a specific days' worth of dividends (
e.g.,
“seven days' dividends plus accrued but uncredited dividends, but only if the account is closed”).
ii. Adverse changes to terms such as the lowering of the dividend rate, annual percentage yield, or reducing the compounding or crediting frequency for funds remaining in shares or on deposit.
iii. Reclamation of bonuses.
3.
Relation to rules for IRAs or similar plans.
Penalties imposed by the Internal Revenue Code for certain withdrawals from IRAs or similar pension or savings plans are not
early withdrawal penalties for purposes of this regulation.
4.
Disclosing penalties.
Penalties may be stated in months, whether credit unions assess the penalty using the actual number of days during the period or using another method such as a number of days that occurs in any actual sequence of the total calendar months involved. For example, stating “one month's dividends” is permissible, whether the credit union assesses 30 days' dividends during the month of April, or selects a time period between 28 and 31 days for calculating the dividends for all early withdrawals regardless of when the penalty is assessed.

# (b)(6)(iv) Renewal Policies
1.
Rollover term share accounts.
Credit unions are not required to provide a grace period, to pay dividends during the grace period, or to disclose whether or not dividends will be paid during the grace period. Credit unions offering a grace period on term share accounts must give the length of the grace period. Commentary, appendix B, Model Clauses, § B-1(i)(iv).
2.
Nonrollover term share accounts.
Credit unions that pay dividends on funds following the maturity of term share accounts that do not renew automatically need not state the rate (or annual percentage yield) that may be paid.

# (b)(7) Bonuses
1.
General.
Credit unions are required to state the amount and type of bonus, and disclose any minimum balance or time requirement to obtain the bonus and when the bonus will be provided. If the minimum balance or time requirement is otherwise required to be disclosed, credit unions need not duplicate the disclosure for purposes of this paragraph.

# (b)(8) Nature of Dividends
1.
General.
Dividends are not payable until declared and unless sufficient current and undivided earnings are available after required transfers to reserves at the close of a dividend period. A disclosure explaining dividends educates members and protects credit unions in the event that a prospective dividend cannot be paid, or is not properly payable. This disclosure is required for all dividend-bearing share accounts. Term share accounts need not include a statement regarding the nature of dividends.
2.
State-chartered credit unions with interest-bearing deposit accounts.
State law controls the nature of accounts (i.e., whether an account is a share account or a deposit account). If a member of a state-chartered credit union is opening only an interest-bearing deposit account, or is requesting account disclosures only for an interest-bearing deposit account (if state law requires the depositor to hold a share account), the disclosures must generally include the following information on any dividend-bearing share portion of the account (e.g., membership share): the par value of a share; a statement that the portion of the deposit that represents the par value of the membership share will earn dividends, and that dividends are paid from current income and available earnings after required transfers to reserves. Further additional disclosures, such as a separate dividend rate and annual percentage yield for the membership share, are not required (if the additional disclosures would agree with the remainder of the account which is invested in an interest-bearing deposit).

# (c) Notice to Existing Accountholders
1.
General.
Only members who receive periodic statements (provided regularly at least four times per year) and who hold accounts of the type offered by the credit union as of the compliance date of part 707 (generally January 1, 1995) must receive the notice. If following receipt of the notice members request disclosures, credit unions have twenty calendar days from receipt of the request to provide the disclosures. Rate and annual percentage yield information in such disclosures must conform to that required for disclosures upon request. As an alternative to including the notice in or on the periodic statement, the final rule permits credit unions to send the account disclosures themselves, as long as they are sent at the same time as the periodic statement (the disclosures may be mailed either with the periodic statement or separately).
2.
Form of the notice.
The notice may be included on the periodic statement, in a member newsletter, or on a statement stuffer or other insert, if it is clear and conspicuous. The notice cannot be sent in a separate mailing from the periodic statement.
3.
Timing.
The notice may accompany the first periodic statement after the compliance date for part 707, or the periodic statement for the first cycle beginning after that date. For example, a credit union's statement cycle is December 15, 1994-January 14, 1995. The statement is mailed on January 15, The next cycle is January 15, 1995 through February 14, 1995, and the statement for that cycle is mailed on February 15. The credit union may provide the notice either on or with the January 15 statement or on or with the February 15 statement, as it covers the first cycle after January 1, 1995.
4.
Early compliance.
Credit unions that provide the notice to existing members prior to the compliance date of part 707, must be prepared to provide accurate and timely disclosures when, following receipt of the notice, members ask for account disclosures. Such disclosures must be provided even if they are requested before the compliance date of part
707. Credit unions who provide early notice to existing members need to comply with other aspects of part 707, but need not provide disclosures already provided in compliance with part 707.

# Section 707.5—Subsequent Disclosures

# (a) Change in Terms

# (a)(1) Advance Notice required
1.
Form of notice.
Credit unions may provide a change-in-term notice on or with a regular periodic statement or in another mailing (such as a highlighted portion of a newsletter or statement stuffer insert). If a credit union provides notice through revised account disclosures, the changed term must be highlighted in some manner. For example, credit unions may state that a particular fee has been changed (also specifying the new amount) or use an accompanying letter that refers to the changed term. Credit unions are cautioned that unless credit unions have reserved the right to change terms in the account agreement or disclosures, a change-in-terms notice may not be sufficient to amend the terms under applicable law.
2.
Effective date.
An example of a language for disclosing the effective date of a change is: “As of May 11, 1995”.
3.
Terms that change upon the occurrence of an event.
A credit union offering terms that will automatically change upon the occurrence of a stated event need not send an advance notice of the change provided the credit union fully describes the conditions of the change in the account opening disclosures (and sends any change-in-term notices regardless of whether the changed term affects that member's account at that time).
4.
Examples.
Examples of changes not requiring an advance change-in-terms notice are:
i. The termination of employment for employee-members for whom account maintenance or activity fees were waived during their employment by the credit union.
ii. The expiration of one year in a promotion described in the account opening disclosures to “waive $4.00 monthly service charges for one year”.

# (a)(2) No Notice Required

# (a)(2)(ii) Check Printing Fees
1.
Increase in fees.
A notice is not required for an increase in fees for printing share drafts (or deposit and withdrawal slips) even if the credit union adds some amount to the price charged by the vendor.

# (b) Notice Before Maturity for Term Share Accounts Longer Than One Month That Renew Automatically.
1.
Maturity dates on nonbusiness days.
In determining the term of a term share account, credit unions may disregard the fact that the term will be extended beyond the disclosed number of days if the maturity date falls on a nonbusiness day. For example, a holiday or weekend may cause a “one-year” term share account to extend beyond 365 days (or 366, in a leap year), or a “one-month” term share account to extend beyond 31 days.
2.
Disclosing when rates will be determined.
Ways to disclose when the annual percentage yield will be available include the use of:
i. A specific date, such as “October 28”.
ii. A date that is easily discernible, such as “the Tuesday prior to the maturity date stated on the notice” or “as of the maturity date stated on this notice”.
3.
Alternative timing rule.
Under the alternative timing rule, a credit union that offers a 10-day grace period would have to provide the disclosures at least 10 calendar days prior to the scheduled maturity date.
4.
Club accounts.
If members have agreed to the transfer of payments from another account to a club term share account for the next club period, the credit union must comply with the requirements for automatically renewable term share accounts—even though members may withdraw funds from the club account at the end of the current club period.
5.
Renewal of a term share account.
In the case of a change-in-terms that becomes effective if a rollover term share account is subsequently renewed:
i. If the change is initiated by the credit union, the disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply. (Section 707.5(a) applies if the change becomes effective prior to the maturity of the existing term share account.)
ii. If the change is initiated by the member, the account opening disclosure requirements of § 707.4(b) apply. (If the notice required by this paragraph has been provided, credit unions may give new account disclosures or disclosures that reflect the new term.)
6.
Example.
If a member receives a notice prior to maturity on a one-year term share account and requests a rollover to a six-month account, the credit union must provide either account opening disclosures including the new maturity date or, if all other terms previously disclosed in the prematurity notice remain the same, only the new maturity date.

# (b)(1) Maturities of Longer Than One Year
1.
Highlighting changed terms.
Credit unions need not highlight terms that have changed since the last account disclosures were provided.

# (c) Notice Before Maturity for Term Share Accounts Longer Than One Year That Do not Renew Automatically
1.
Subsequent account.
When funds are transferred following maturity of a nonrollover term share account, credit unions need not provide account disclosures unless a new account is established.

# Section 707.6—Periodic Statement Disclosures

# (a) Rule When Statement and Crediting Periods Vary
1.
General.
Credit unions are not required to provide periodic statements. If they provide periodic statements, disclosures need only be furnished to the extent applicable. For example, if no dividends are earned for a statement period, credit unions need not state that fact. Or, credit unions may disclose “$0” dividends earned and “0%” annual percentage yield earned.
2.
Regulation E interim statements.
When a credit union provides regular quarterly statements, and in addition provides a monthly interim statement to comply with Regulation E, the interim statement need not comply with this section unless it states dividend or rate information. (See 12 CFR 1005.9). For credit unions that choose not to treat Regulation E activity statements as part 707 periodic statements, the quarterly periodic statement must reflect the annual percentage yield earned and dividends earned for the full quarter. However, credit unions choosing this option need not redisclose fees already disclosed on an interim Regulation E activity statement on the quarterly periodic statement. For credit unions that choose to treat Regulation E activity statements as part 707 periodic statements, the Regulation E statement must meet all part 707 requirements.
3.
Combined statements.
Credit unions may provide certain information about an account (such as a money market share account or regular share account) on the periodic statement for another account (such as a share draft account) without triggering the disclosures required by this section, as long as:
i. The information is limited to information such as the account number, the type of account, balance information, accountholders' names, and social security or tax identification number; and
ii. The credit union also provides members a periodic statement complying with this section for the account (the money market share account or regular share account, in the example).
4.
Other information.
Additional information that may be given on or with a periodic statement, includes:
i. Dividend rates and corresponding periodic rates to the dividend rate applied to balances during the statement period.
ii. The dollar amount of dividends earned year-to-date.
iii. Bonuses paid (or any
de minimis
consideration of $10 or less).
iv. Fees for other products, such as safe deposit boxes.
v. Accounts not covered by the periodic statement disclosure requirements (passbook and term share accounts) may disclose any information on the statement related to such accounts, so long as such information is accurate and not misleading.
5.
When statement and crediting periods vary.
This rule permits credit unions, on dividend-bearing share accounts, to report the annual percentage yield earned and the amount of dividends earned on a statement other than on each periodic statement when the dividend period does not agree with, varies from, or is different than, the statement period. For dividend-bearing share accounts, credit unions may disclose the required information either upon each periodic statement, or on the statement on which dividends are actually earned (credited or posted) to the member's account. In addition, for accounts using the average daily balance method of calculating dividends, when the average daily balance period and the statement periods do not agree, vary or are different, credit unions may also report annual percentage yield earned and the dollar amount of dividends earned on the periodic statement on which the dividends or interest is earned. For example, if a credit union has quarterly dividend periods, or uses a quarterly average daily balance on an account, the first two monthly statements may not state annual percentage yield earned and dividends earned figures; the third “monthly” statement will reflect the dividends earned and the annual percentage yield earned for the entire quarter. The fees imposed disclosure must be given on the periodic statement on which they are imposed.
6.
Length of the period.
Credit unions must disclose the length of both the dividend period (or average daily balance calculation period) and the statement period. For example, a statement could disclose a statement period of April 16 through May 15 and further state that “the dividends earned and the annual percentage yield earned are based on your dividend period (or average daily balance) for the period April 1 through April 30.”
7.
Dividend period more frequent than statement period.
Credit unions that calculate dividends on a monthly basis, but send statements on a quarterly basis, may disclose a single dividend (and annual percentage yield earned) figure. Alternatively, a credit union may disclose three dividends earned and three annual percentage yield earned figures,
one of each month in the quarter, as long as the credit union states the number of days (or beginning and ending date) in each dividend period if it varies from the statement period.
8.
Additional voluntary disclosures.
For credit unions not disclosing the annual percentage yield earned and dividends earned on all periodic statements, credit unions may place a notice on statements without dividends and annual percentage yield earned figures, that the annual percentage yield earned and dollar amount of dividends earned will appear on the first statement at the close of the dividend (or average daily balance) period, or similar wording. Credit unions may also choose to include a telephone number to call for interim information, if desired by a member.

# (b) Statement Disclosures

# (b)(1) Annual Percentage Yield Earned
1.
Ledger and collected balances.
Credit unions that accrue interest using the collected balance method may use either the ledger or collected balance methods to determine the balance used to determine the annual percentage yield earned. Ledger balance means the record of the balance in a member's account, as per the credit union's records. (The ledger balance may reflect additions and deposits for which the credit union has not yet received final payment). Collected balance means the record of balance in a member's account reflecting collected funds, that is, cash or checks deposited in the credit union which have been presented for payment and for which payment has actually been received. (See Regulation CC, 12 CFR 229.14).

# (b)(2) Amount of Dividends or Interest
1.
Definition of earned.
The term “earned” is defined to include dividends and interest either “accrued” or “paid and credited.” Credit unions may use either the “ledger” or the “collected” balance for either option. (See 707.6(b)(1)1. and 707.7(c)2. of this appendix.)
2.
Accrued interest.
Credit unions must state the amount of interest that accrued during the statement period, even if it was not credited.
3.
Terminology.
In disclosing dividends earned for the period, credit unions must use the term “dividends” or terminology such as: “Dividends paid,” to describe dividends that have been credited; “Dividends accrued,” to indicate that dividends are not yet credited.
4.
Closed accounts.
If a member closes an account between crediting periods and forfeits accrued dividends, the credit union may not show any figures for “dividends earned” or annual percentage yield earned for the period (other than zero, at the credit union's option).
5.
Extraordinary dividends.
Extraordinary dividends are not a component of the annual percentage yield earned or the dividend rate, but are an addition to the member's account. The dollar amount of the extraordinary dividends paid, denoted as a separate, identified figure, must be disclosed on the periodic statement on which the extraordinary dividends are earned. A credit union may also disclose information regarding the calculation of the extraordinary dividends, and additional annual percentage yield earned and dividend rate figures taking into account the extraordinary dividend, so long as such information is accurate and not misleading.

# (b)(3) Fees Imposed
1.
General.
Periodic statements must state fees disclosed under § 707.4(b) that were debited to the account during the statement period, even if assessed for an earlier period.
2.
Itemizing fees by type.
In itemizing fees imposed more than once in the period, credit unions may group fees if they are the same type. (
See
§ 707.11(a)(1) of this part regarding certain fees that are required to be grouped.) When fees of the same type are grouped together, the description must make clear that the dollar figure represents more than a single fee, for example, “total fees for checks written this period.” Examples of fees that may not be grouped together are—
i. Monthly maintenance and excess-activity fees.
ii. “Transfer” fees, if different dollar amounts are imposed, such as $.50 for deposits and $1.00 for withdrawals.
iii. Fees for electronic fund transfers and fees for other services, such as balance-inquiry or maintenance fees.
iv. Fees for paying overdrafts and fees for returning checks or other items unpaid.
3.
Identifying fees.
Statement details must enable the member to identify the specific fee. For example:
i. Credit unions may use a code to identify a particular fee if the code is explained on the periodic statement or in documents accompanying the statement.
ii. Credit unions using debit slips may disclose the date the fee was debited on the periodic statement and show the amount and type of fee on the dated debit slip.
4.
Relation to Regulation E.
Disclosure of fees in compliance with Regulation E complies with this section for fees related to electronic fund transfers (for example, totaling all electronic funds transfer fees in a single figure).

# (b)(4) Length of Period
1.
General.
Credit unions providing the beginning and ending dates of the period must make clear whether both dates are included
in the period. For example, stating “April 1 through April 30” would clearly indicate that both April 1 and April 30 are included in the period.
2.
Opening or closing an account mid-cycle.
If an account is opened or closed during the period for which a statement is sent, credit unions must calculate the annual percentage yield earned based on account balances for each day the account was open.

# Section 707.7—Payment of Dividends

# (a) Permissible Methods
1.
Prohibited calculation methods.
Calculation methods that do not comply with the requirement to pay dividends on the full amount of principal in the account each day include:
i. The “rollback” method, also known as the “grace period” or “in by the 10th” method, where credit unions pay dividends on the lowest balance in the account for the period.
ii. The “increments of par value” method, where credit unions only pay dividends on full shares in an account, e.g., a credit union with $5 par value shares pays dividends on $20 of a $24 account balance.
iii. The “ending balance” method, where credit unions pay dividends on the balance in the account at the end of the period.
iv. The “investable balance” method, where credit unions pay dividends on a percentage of the balance, excluding an amount credit unions set aside for reserve requirements.
v. The “low balance” method, where credit unions pay dividends on the lowest balance in the account for any day in that period.
2.
Use of 365-day basis.
Credit unions may apply a daily periodic rate that is greater than
1/365
of the dividend rate—such as
1/360
of the dividend rate—as long as it is applied 365 days a year.
3.
Periodic dividend payments.
A credit union can pay dividends each day on the account and still make uniform dividend payments. For example, for a one-year term share account, a credit union could make monthly dividend payments that are equal to
1/12
of the amount of dividends that will be earned for a 365-day period (or 11 uniform monthly payments—each equal to roughly
1/12
of the total amount of dividends—and one payment that accounts to the remainder of the total amount of dividends earned for the period).
4.
Leap year.
Credit unions may apply a daily rate of
1/366
or
1/365
of the dividend rate for 366 days in a leap year, if the account will earn dividends for February 29.
5.
Maturity of term share accounts.
Credit unions are not required to pay dividends after term share accounts mature. Examples include:
i. During any grace period offered by a credit union for an automatically renewable term share account, if the member decides during that period not to renew the account.
ii. Following the maturity of nonrollover term share accounts.
iii. When the maturity date falls on a holiday, and the member must wait until the next business day to obtain the funds.
6.
Dormant accounts.
Credit unions must pay dividends on funds in an account, even if inactivity or the infrequency of transactions would permit the credit union to consider the account to be “inactive” or “dormant” (or similar status) as defined by state or other law or the account contract.
7.
Insufficient funds.
Credit unions are not required to pay dividends on checks or share drafts deposited to a member's account that are returned for insufficient funds. If a credit union accrues dividends on a check that it later determines is not good, it may deduct from the accrued dividends any dividends attributed to the proceeds of the returned check. If dividends have already been credited before the credit union determines the item has insufficient funds, the credit union may deduct the amount of the check and associated dividends from the account balance. The amount deducted will not be reflected in the dividend amount and annual percentage yield earned reported for the next period.
8.
Account drawn below par value of a share.
If a member draws his or her account below the par value of a share, dividends would continue to accrue on the account so long as any minimum balance requirement is met. However, under the
NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws,
if a member who reduces his or her share balance below the value of a par value share and does not increase the balance within at least six months, the credit union may terminate the member's membership. State-chartered credit unions may have similar termination provisions.

# (a2) Determination of Minimum Balance To Earn Dividends
1.
General.
Credit unions may set minimum balance requirements that must be met in order to earn dividends. However, credit unions must use the same method to determine a minimum balance required to earn dividends as they use to determine the balance upon which dividends will accrue and pay. For example, a credit union that calculates dividends on the daily balance method must use the daily balance method to determine if the minimum balance to earn dividends has been met. Similarly, a credit union that calculates dividends on the average daily balance method must use the average daily balance method to determine if the minimum to earn dividends has been met. Credit unions may have a par value of a share that is different from the minimum balance requirement to earn dividends. (See commentary to § 707.4(b)(3)(i)).
2.
Daily balance accounts.
Credit unions that require a minimum balance to earn dividends may choose not to pay dividends for days when the balance drops below the required minimum balance if they use the daily balance method to calculate dividends. For example, a credit union could set a minimum daily balance level of $200 and pay dividends only those days the $200 daily balance is maintained.
3.
Average daily balance accounts.
Credit unions that require a minimum balance to earn dividends may choose not to pay dividends for the average daily balance calculation period in which the average daily balance drops below the required minimum, if they use the average daily balance method to calculate dividends. For example, a credit union could set a minimum average daily balance level of $200 and pay dividends only if the $200 average daily balance is met for the calculation period.
4.
Beneficial method.
Credit unions may not require members to maintain both a minimum daily balance and a minimum average daily balance to earn dividends, such as by requiring the member to maintain a $500 daily balance and a prescribed average daily balance (whether higher or lower). But a credit union could offer a minimum balance to earn dividends that includes an additional method that is “unequivocally beneficial” to the member such as the following:
i. A credit union using the daily balance method to calculate dividends and requiring a $500 minimum daily balance could choose to pay dividends on the account (for those days the minimum balance is not met) as long as the member maintained an average daily balance throughout the month of $400.
ii. A credit union using the average daily balance method to calculate dividends and requiring a $400 minimum average daily balance could choose to pay dividends on the account as long as the member maintained a daily balance of $500 for at least half of the days in the period.
iii. A credit union using either the daily balance method or average daily balance method to calculate dividends that requires: (A) a $500 daily balance; or (B) a $400 average daily balance to pay dividends on the account.
5.
Paying on full balance.
Credit unions must pay dividends on the full balance in the account that meets the required minimum balance. For example, if $300 is the minimum daily balance required to earn dividends, and a member deposits $500, the credit union must pay the stated dividend rate on the full $500 and not just on the $200.
6.
Negative balances prohibited.
Credit unions must treat a negative account balance as zero to determine:
i. The daily or average daily balance on which dividends will be paid.
ii. Whether any minimum balance to earn dividends is met. (See commentary to appendix A, Part II, which prohibits credit unions from using negative balances in calculating the dividends figure for the annual percentage yield earned.)
7.
Club accounts.
Credit unions offering club accounts (such as a “holiday” or “vacation” club accounts) cannot impose a minimum balance requirement for dividends based on the total number or dollar amount of payments required under the club plan. For example, if a plan calls for $10 weekly payments for 50 weeks, the credit union cannot set a $500 minimum balance and then pay only if the member makes all 50 payments.
8.
Minimum balances not affecting dividends.
Credit unions may use the daily balance, average daily balance, or other computation method to calculate minimum balance requirements not involving the payment of dividends—such as to compute minimum balances for assessing fees.

# (b) Compounding and Crediting Policies
1.
General.
Credit unions choosing to compound dividends may compound or credit dividends annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, daily, continuously, or on any other basis.
2.
Withdrawals prior to crediting date.
If members withdraw funds (without closing the account), prior to a scheduled crediting date, credit unions may delay paying the accrued dividends on the withdrawn amount until the scheduled crediting date, but may not avoid paying dividends.
3.
Closed accounts.
Subject to state or other law, a credit union may choose not to pay accrued dividends if members close an account prior to the date accrued dividends are credited, as long as the credit union has disclosed that fact. If accrued dividends are paid, accrued dividends must be paid on funds up until the account is closed or the account is deemed closed. For example, if an account is closed on a Tuesday, accrued dividends on the funds through Monday would be paid. Whether (and the conditions under which) credit unions are permitted to deem an account closed by a member is determined by state or other law, if any. Credit unions are cautioned that bylaw requirements may prevent a credit union from deeming a member's account closed until certain time periods are extinguished. (See
NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws,
Art. III, § 3. Such bylaw requirements may not be overridden without proper agency approval.)

# (c) Date Dividends Begin To Accrue
1.
Relation to Regulation CC.
Credit unions may rely on the Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA) and Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229) to determine, for example,
when a deposit is considered made for purposes of dividend accrual, or when dividends need not be paid on funds because a deposited check is later returned unpaid.
2.
Ledger and collected balances.
Credit unions may calculate dividends by using a “ledger” balance or “collected” balance method, as long as the crediting requirements of the EFAA are met (12 CFR 229.14).
3.
Withdrawal of principal.
Credit unions must accrue dividends on funds until the funds are withdrawn from the account. For example, if a check is debited to an account on a Tuesday, the credit union must accrue dividends on those funds through Monday.

# Section 707.8—Advertising

# (a) Misleading or Inaccurate Advertisements
1.
General.
All advertisements are subject to the rule against misleading or inaccurate advertisements, even though the disclosure applicable to various media differ. The word “profit” may be used when referring to dividend-bearing share accounts, as it reflects the nature of dividends. The word “profit” may not be used when referring to interest-bearing deposit accounts.
2.
Indoor signs.
An indoor sign advertising an annual percentage yield is not misleading or inaccurate if:
i. For a tiered-rate account, it also provides the upper and lower dollar amounts of the tier corresponding to the advertised annual percentage yield.
ii. For a term share account, it also provides the term required to obtain the advertised annual percentage yield.
3.
“Free” or “no cost” accounts.
For purposes of determining whether an account can be advertised as “free” or “no cost,” maintenance and activity fees include:
i. Any fee imposed if a minimum balance requirement is not met, or if the member exceeds a specified number of transactions.
ii. Transaction and service fees that members reasonably expect to be imposed on an account on a regular basis (see comments 4(b)(4)-1 and 2).
iii. A flat fee, such as a monthly service fee.
iv. Fees imposed to deposit, withdraw or transfer funds, including per-check or per-transaction charges (for example, $.25 for each withdrawal, whether by check, in person).
4.
Other fees.
Examples of fees that are
not
maintenance or activity fees include:
i. Fees that are not required to be disclosed under § 707.4(b)(4).
ii. Check printing fees of any type.
iii. Fees for obtaining copies of checks, whether or not the original checks have been truncated or returned to the member periodically.
iv. Balance inquiry fees.
v. Fees assessed against a dormant account.
vi. Fees for using an ATM.
vii. Fees for electronic transfer services that are not required to obtain an account, such as preauthorized transfers or home electronic credit union services.
viii. Stop payment fees and fees for share drafts or checks returned unpaid.
5.
Similar terms.
An advertisement may not use a term such as “fees waived” if a maintenance or activity fee may be imposed because it is similar to the terms “free” or “no cost.”
6.
Specific account services.
Credit unions may advertise a specific account service or feature as free as long as no fee is imposed for that service or feature. For example, credit unions offering an account that is free of deposit or withdrawal fees could advertise that fact, as long as the advertisement does not mislead members by implying that the account is free and that no other fee (a monthly service fee, for example) may be charged.
7.
Free for limited time.
If an account (or a specific account service) is free only for a limited period of time—for example, for one year following the account opening—the account (or service) may be advertised as free as long as the time period is stated.
8.
Conditions not related to share accounts.
Credit unions may advertise accounts as “free” for members that meet conditions not related to share accounts, such as the member's age. For example, credit unions may advertise a share draft account as “free for persons over 65 years old,” even though a maintenance or activity fee may be assessed on accounts held by members that are 65 or younger.
9.
Electronic advertising.
If an electronic advertisement, such as an advertisement appearing on an internet Web site, displays a triggering term, such as a bonus or annual percentage yield, the advertisement must clearly refer the member to the location where the additional required information begins. For example, an advertisement that includes a bonus or annual percentage yield may be accompanied by a link that directly takes the member to the additional information.
10.
Examples.
Examples of advertisements that would ordinarily be misleading, inaccurate, or misrepresent the deposit contract are:
i. Representing an overdraft service as a “line of credit,” unless the service is subject to 12 CFR part 1026 (Regulation Z).
ii. Representing that the credit union will honor all checks or authorize payment of all transactions that overdraw an account, with or without a specified dollar limit, when the credit union retains discretion at any time not to honor checks or authorize transactions.
iii. Representing that members with an overdrawn account can maintain a negative balance when the terms of the account's overdraft service require members promptly to return the share account to a positive balance.
iv. Describing a credit union's overdraft service solely as protection against bounced checks when the credit union also permits overdrafts for a fee for overdrawing their accounts by other means, such as ATM withdrawals, debit card transactions, or other electronic fund transfers.
v. Advertising an account-related service for which the credit union charges a fee in an advertisement that also uses the word “free” or “no cost” or a similar term to describe the account, unless the advertisement clearly and conspicuously indicates that there is a cost associated with the service. If the fee is a maintenance or activity fee under § 707.8(a)(2) of this part, however, an advertisement may not describe the account as “free” or “no cost” or contain a similar term even if the fee is disclosed in the advertisement.
11.
Additional disclosures in connection with the payment of overdrafts.
The rule in § 707.3(a), providing that disclosures required by § 707.8 may be provided to the member in electronic form without regard to E-Sign Act requirements, applies to the disclosures described in § 707.11(b), which are incorporated by reference in § 707.8(f).

# (b) Permissible Rates
1.
Tiered-rate accounts.
An advertisement for a tiered-rate account that states an annual percentage yield must also state the annual percentage yield for each tier, along with corresponding minimum balance requirements. Any dividend rates stated must appear in conjunction with the annual percentage yields for each tier.
2.
Stepped-rate accounts.
An advertisement that states a dividend rate for a stepped-rate account must state all the dividend rates and the time period that each rate is in effect.
3.
Representative examples.
An advertisement that states an annual percentage yield for a type of account (such as a term share account for a specified term) need not state the annual percentage yield applicable to every variation offered by the credit union or indicate that other maturity terms are available. In an advertisement stating that rates for an account may vary depending on the amount of the initial deposit or the term of a term share account, credit unions need not list each balance level and term offered. Instead, the advertisement may:
i. Provide a representative example of the annual percentage yields offered, clearly described as such. For example, if a credit union offers a $25 bonus on all term share accounts and the annual percentage yield will vary depending on the term selected, the credit union may provide a disclosure of the annual percentage yield as follows: “For example, our 6-month share certificate currently pays a 3.15% annual percentage yield.”
ii. Indicate that various rates are available, such as by stating short-term and longer-term maturities along with the applicable annual percentage yields: “We offer share certificates with annual percentage yields that depend on the maturity you choose. For example, our one-month share certificate earns a 2.75% APY. Or, earn a 5.25% APY for a three-year share certificate.”

# (c) When Additional Disclosures are Required
1.
Trigger terms.
The following are examples of information stated in advertisements that are not “trigger” terms:
i. “One, three, and five year share certificates available”.
ii. “Bonus rates available”.
iii. “1% over our current rate,” so long as the rates are not determinable from the advertisement.

# (c)(2) Time Annual Percentage Yield is Offered
1.
Specified recent date.
If an advertisement discloses an annual percentage yield as of a specified date, that date must be recent in relation to the publication or broadcast frequency of the media used. For example, the printing date of a brochure printed once for an account promotion that will be in effect for six months would be considered “recent,” even though rates change during the six-month period. Dividend rates published in a daily newspaper or on television must be a rate offered shortly before (or on) the date the rates are published or broadcast. Similarly, dividend rates published in a daily newspaper or on television must be a rate reflecting either the preceding dividend period, or a prospective rate, and the option chosen should be noted.
2.
Reference to date of publication.
An advertisement may refer to the annual percentage yield as being accurate as of the date of publication, if the date is on the publication itself. For instance, an advertisement in a periodical may state that a rate is “current through the date of this issue,” if the periodical shows the date.

# (c)(5) Effect of Fees
1.
Scope.
This requirement applies only to maintenance or activity fees as described in paragraph 8(a).

# (c)(6) Features of Term Share Accounts

# (c)(6)(i) Time Requirements
1.
Club accounts.
If a club account has a maturity date, but the term may vary depending on when the account is opened, credit unions may use a phrase such as: “The maturity date of this club account is November 15; its term varies depending on when the account is opened.”

# (c)(6)(ii) Early Withdrawal Penalties
1.
Discretionary penalties.
Credit unions imposing early withdrawal penalties on a case-by-case basis may disclose that they “may” (rather than “will”) impose a penalty if that accurately describes the account terms.

# (d) Bonuses
1.
General reference to “bonus.”
General statements such as “bonus checking” or “get a bonus when you open a checking account” do not trigger the bonus disclosures.

# (e) Exemption for Certain Advertisements

# (e)(1) Certain Media

# (e)(1)(i)
1.
Internet advertisements.
The exemption for advertisements made through broadcast or electronic media does not extend to advertisements posted on the internet or sent by e-mail.
2.
Internet advertisements.
The exemption for advertisements made through broadcast or electronic media does not extend to advertisements made by electronic communication, such as advertisements posted on the Internet or sent by e-mail.

# (e)(1)(iii)
1.
Tiered-rate accounts.
Solicitations for tiered-rate accounts made through telephone response machines must provide all annual percentage yields and the balance requirements applicable to each tier.

# (e)(2) Indoor Signs

# (e)(2)(i)
1.
General.
Indoor signs include advertisements displayed on computer screens, banners, preprinted posters, and chalk or peg boards. Any advertisement inside the premises that can be retained by a member (such as a brochure or a printout from a computer) is not an indoor sign.

# (e)(3) Newsletters
1.
General.
The partial exemption applies to all credit union newsletters, whether instituted before or after the compliance date of part 707. Nor must a newsletter be of any particular circulation frequency (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, biannually, annually, or irregularly) or of any certain format (e.g. magazine, bulletin, broadside, circular, mimeograph, letter, or pamphlet) in order to be eligible for the partial advertising exemption.
2.
Permissible Distribution.
In order for newsletters to retain the partial advertising exemption, newsletters can be sent to existing credit union members only. Any distribution reasonably calculated to reach only members is also acceptable, such as:
i. Mailing newsletters to existing members.
ii. Distributing newsletters at a function reasonably limited to members, such as an annual meeting or member picnic.
iii. Displaying or offering newsletters at a credit union lobby, branch, or office.
3.
Impermissible Distribution.
Distributing a newsletter in a place open to nonmembers, such as a sponsor's lunch room, is not reasonably calculated to reach only members, and such newsletter would be subject to all applicable advertising rules.

# Section 707.9—Enforcement and Record Retention

# (c) Record Retention
1.
Evidence of required actions.
Credit unions comply with the regulation by demonstrating they have done the following:
i. Established and maintained procedures for paying dividends and providing timely disclosures as required by the regulation, and
ii. Retained sample disclosures for each type of account offered to members, such as account-opening disclosures, copies of advertisements, and change-in-term notices; and information regarding the dividend rates and annual percentage yields offered.
2.
Methods of retaining evidence.
Credit unions must be able to reconstruct the required disclosures or other actions. They need not keep disclosures or other business records in hard copy. Records evidencing compliance may be retained on microfilm, microfiche, or by other methods that reproduce records accurately (including computer files). Credit unions must retain copies of all printed advertisements and the text of all advertisements conveyed by electronic or broadcast media, and newsletters.
3.
Payment of dividends.
Credit unions must retain sufficient rate and balance information to permit the verification of dividends paid on an account, including the payment of dividends on the full principal balance.

# Section 707.10 [Reserved]

# Section 707.11—Additional Disclosures Regarding the Payment of Overdrafts

# (a) Disclosure of total fees on periodic statements

# (a)(1)
General.
1.
Transfer services.
The overdraft services covered by § 707.11(a)(1) of this part do not include a service providing for the transfer of funds from another share account of the member to permit the payment of items without creating an overdraft, even if a fee is charged for the transfer.
2.
Examples of credit unions advertising the payment of overdrafts.
A credit union would trigger the periodic statement disclosures if it:
i. Promotes the credit union's policy or practice of paying some overdrafts, unless the service would be subject to 12 CFR part 1026 (Regulation Z), in advertisements using broadcast media, brochures, telephone solicitations ,or electronic mail, or on Internet sites, ATM screens or receipts, billboards, or indoor signs. But see, Sec. 707.11(a)(2) of this part regarding communications about the payment of overdrafts that would not trigger periodic statement disclosures;
ii. Includes a message on a periodic statement informing the member of an overdraft limit or the amount of funds available for overdrafts. For example, a credit union that includes a message on a periodic statement informing the member of a $500 overdraft limit or that the member has $300 remaining on the overdraft limit, is promoting an overdraft service;
iii. Discloses an overdraft limit or includes the dollar amount of an overdraft limit in a balance disclosed by any means, including on an ATM receipt or on an automated system, such as a telephone response machine, ATM screen, or the credit union's Internet site.
3.
Fees for paying overdrafts.
Credit unions must disclose on periodic statements a total dollar amount for all fees or charges imposed on the account for paying overdrafts. The credit union must disclose separate totals for the statement period and for the calendar year-to-date. The total dollar amount for each of these periods includes per-item fees as well as interest charges, daily or other periodic fees, or fees charged for maintaining an account in overdraft status, whether the overdraft is by check, debit card transaction, or by any other transaction type. It also includes fees charged when there are insufficient funds because previously deposited funds are subject to a hold or are uncollected. It does not include fees for transferring funds from another account of the member to avoid an overdraft, or fees charged under a service subject to Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026).
See also
comment 11(c)-2. Under § 707.11(a)(1)(i), the disclosure must describe the total dollar amount for all fees or charges imposed on the account for the statement period and calendar year-to-date for paying overdrafts using the term “Total Overdraft Fees.” This requirement applies notwithstanding comment 3(a)-2.
4.
Fees for returning items unpaid.
The total dollar amount for all fees for returning items unpaid must include all fees charged to the account for dishonoring or returning checks or other items drawn on the account. The credit union must disclose separate totals for the statement period and for the calendar year-to-date. Fees imposed when deposited items are returned are not included. Credit unions may use terminology such as “returned item fee” or “NSF fee” to describe fees for returning items unpaid.
5.
Waived fees.
In some cases, a credit union may provide a statement for the current period reflecting that fees imposed during a previous period were waived and credited to the account. Credit unions may, but are not required to, reflect the adjustment in the total for the calendar year-to-date and in the applicable statement period. For example, if a credit union assesses a fee in January and refunds the fee in February, the credit union could disclose a year-to-date total reflecting the amount credited, but it should not affect the total disclosed for the February statement period, because the fee was not assessed in the February statement period. If a credit union assesses and then waives and credits a fee within the same cycle, the credit union may, at its option, reflect the adjustment in the total disclosed for fees imposed during the current statement period and for the total for the calendar year-to-date. Thus, if the credit union assesses and waives the fee in the February statement period, the February fee total could reflect a total net of the waived fee.
6.
Totals for the calendar year to date.
Some credit unions' statement periods do not coincide with the calendar month. In such cases, the credit union may disclose a calendar year-to-date total by aggregating fees for 12 monthly cycles, starting with the period that begins during January and finishing with the period that begins during December. For example, if statement periods begin on the 10th day of each month, the statement covering December 10, 2006 through January 9, 2007 may disclose the year-to-date total for fees imposed from January 10, 2006 through January 9, 2007. Alternatively, the credit union could provide a statement for the cycle ending January 9, 2007, showing the year-to-date total for fees imposed January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006.
7.
Itemization of fees.
A credit union may itemize each fee in addition to providing the disclosures required by § 707.11(a)(1) of this part.

# (a)(3) Time period covered by disclosures
1.
Periodic statement disclosures.
The disclosures under § 707.11(a) must be included on periodic statements provided by a credit union starting with the first statement period that begins after January 1, 2010. For example, if a member's statement period typically closes on the 15th of each month, a credit union must provide the disclosures required by § 707.11(a)(1) on subsequent periodic statements for that member beginning with the statement reflecting the period from January 16, 2010 to February 15, 2010.

# (a)(5) Acquired accounts

# (b) Advertising disclosures in connection with overdraft services
1.
Examples of credit unions promoting the payment of overdrafts.
A credit union must include the advertising disclosures in § 707.11(b)(1) of this part if the credit union:
i. Promotes the credit union's policy or practice of paying overdrafts, unless the service would be subject to 12 CFR part 1026 (Regulation Z). This includes advertisements using print media such as newspapers or brochures, telephone solicitations, electronic mail, or messages posted on an Internet site. But see, § 707.11(b)(2) of this part for communications that are not subject to the additional advertising disclosures;
ii. Includes a message on a periodic statement informing the member of an overdraft limit or the amount of funds available for overdrafts. For example, a credit union that includes a message on a periodic statement informing the member of a $500 overdraft limit or that the member has $300 remaining on the overdraft limit, is promoting an overdraft service.
iii. Discloses an overdraft limit or includes the dollar amount of an overdraft limit in a balance disclosed on an automated system, such as a telephone response machine, ATM screen, or the credit union's Internet site. See, however, § 707.11(b)(3) of this part.
2.
Transfer services.
The overdraft services covered by § 707.11(b)(1) of this part do not include a service providing for the transfer of funds from another share account of the member to permit the payment of items without creating an overdraft, even if a fee is charged for the transfer.
3.
Electronic media.
The exception for advertisements made through broadcast or electronic media, such as television or radio, does not apply to advertisements posted on a credit union's Internet site, on an ATM screen, provided on telephone response machines, or sent by electronic mail.
4.
Fees.
The fees that must be disclosed under § 707.11(b)(1) of this part include per-item fees as well as interest charges, daily or other periodic fees, and fees charged for maintaining an account in overdraft status, whether the overdraft is by check or by other means. The fees also include fees charged when there are insufficient funds because previously deposited funds are subject to a hold or are uncollected. The fees do not include fees for transferring funds from another account to avoid an overdraft or fees charged when the credit union has previously agreed in writing to pay items that overdraw the account and the service is subject to 12 CFR part 1026 (Regulation Z).
5.
Categories of transactions.
An exhaustive list of transactions is not required. Disclosing that a fee may be imposed for covering overdrafts created by check, in-person withdrawal, ATM withdrawal, or other electronic means would satisfy the requirements of § 707.11(b)(1)(ii) of this part where the fee may be imposed in these circumstances. See comment 4(b)(4)-5 of this part.
6.
Time period to repay.
If a credit union reserves the right to require a member to pay an overdraft immediately or on demand instead of affording members a specific time period to establish a positive balance in the account, a credit union may comply with § 707.11(b)(1)(iii) of this part by disclosing this fact.
7.
Circumstances for nonpayment.
A credit union must describe the circumstances under which it will not pay an overdraft. It is sufficient to state, as applicable: “Whether your overdrafts will be paid is discretionary and we reserve the right not to pay. For example, we typically do not pay overdrafts if your account is not in good standing, or you are not making regular deposits, or you have too many overdrafts.”
8.
Advertising an account as “free.”
If the advertised account-related service is an overdraft service subject to the requirements of § 707.11(b)(1) of this part, credit unions must disclose the fee or fees for the payment of each overdraft, not merely that a cost is associated with the overdraft service, as well as other required information. Compliance with comment 8(a)—10.v is not sufficient.

# (c) Disclosure of account balances
1.
Balance that does not include additional amounts.
For purposes of the balance disclosure requirement in § 707.11(c), if a credit union discloses balance information to a member through an automated system, it must disclose a balance that excludes any funds the credit union may provide to cover an overdraft pursuant to a discretionary overdraft service that will be paid by the credit union under a service subject to part 1026 of this title (Regulation Z) or that will be transferred from another account held individually or jointly by a member. The balance may, but need not, include funds that are deposited in the member's account, such as from a check, that are not yet made available for withdrawal in accordance with the funds availability rules under part 229 of the
title (Regulation CC). In addition, the balance may, but need not, include funds that are held by the credit union to satisfy a prior obligation of the member, for example, to cover a hold for an ATM or debit card transaction that has been authorized but for which the credit union has not settled.
2.
Retail sweep programs.
In a retail sweep program, a credit union establishes two legally distinct subaccounts, a share draft subaccount and a share savings subaccount, which together make up the member's account. The credit union allocates and transfers funds between the two subaccounts in order to maximize the balance in the share savings account while complying with the monthly limitations on transfers out of savings accounts under the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation D, 12 CFR 204.2(d)(2). Retail sweep programs are generally not established for the purpose of covering overdrafts. Rather, credit unions typically establish retail sweep programs by agreement with the member in order for the credit union to minimize its transaction account reserve requirements and, in some cases, to provide a higher interest rate than the member would earn on a share draft account alone. Section 707.11(c) does not require a credit union to exclude funds from the member's balance that may be transferred from another account pursuant to a retail sweep program that is established for such purposes and that has the following characteristics:
i. The account involved complies with the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation D, 12 CFR 204.2(d)(2),
ii. The member does not have direct access to the share savings subaccount that is part of the retail sweep program, and
iii. The member's periodic statements show the account balance as the combined balance in the subaccounts.
3.
Additional balance.
The credit union may disclose additional balances supplemented by funds that may be provided by the credit union to cover an overdraft, whether pursuant to a discretionary overdraft service, a service subject to Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026), or a service that transfers funds from another account held individually or jointly by the member, so long as the credit union prominently states that any additional balance includes these additional overdraft amounts. The credit union may not simply state, for instance, that the second balance is the members “available balance,” or contains “available funds.” Rather, the credit union should provide enough information to convey that the second balance includes these amounts. For example, the credit union may state that the balance includes “overdraft funds.” Where a member has not opted into, or as applicable, has opted out of the credit union's discretionary overdraft service, any additional balance disclosed should not include funds that otherwise might be available under that service. Where a member has not opted into, or as applicable, has opted out of, the credit union's discretionary overdraft service for some, but not all transactions (
e.g.,
the member has not opted into overdraft services for ATM and one-time debit card transactions), a credit union that includes these additional overdraft funds in the second balance should convey that the overdraft funds are not available for all transactions. For example, the credit union could state that overdraft funds are not available for ATM and one-time (or everyday) debit card transactions. Similarly, if funds are not available for all transactions pursuant to a service subject to Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026) or a service that transfers funds from another account, a second balance that includes such funds should also indicate this fact.
4.
Automated systems.
The balance disclosure requirement in § 707.11(c) applies to any automated system through which the member requests a balance, including, but not limited to, a telephone response system, the credit union's Internet site, or an ATM. The requirement applies whether the credit union discloses a balance through an ATM owned or operated by the credit union or through an ATM not owned or operated by the credit union, including an ATM operated by an entity that is not a financial institution. If the balance is obtained at an ATM, the requirement also applies whether the balance is disclosed on the ATM screen or on a paper receipt.

# Appendix A to Part 707—Annual Percentage Yield Calculation

# Part I. Annual Percentage Yield for Account Disclosures and Advertising Purposes
1.
Rounding for calculations.
The following are examples of permissible rounding rules for calculating dividends and the annual percentage yield:
i. The daily rate applied to a balance carried to five or more decimals. For example; .008219178%, 3.00% for a 365 day year, would be rounded to no less than .00822%.
ii. The daily dividends or interest earned carried to five or more decimals. For example; $.08219178082, daily dividends on $1,000 at 3% for a 365 day year, would be rounded to no less than $.08219.
2.
Exponents in a leap year.
The annual percentage yield formula's exponent numerator will remain 365 in leap years. The “days in term” figure used in the denominator should be consistent with the length of term used in the dividends calculation.
3.
First tier of a tiered-rate account.
When credit unions use a rate table, the first tier of a tiered rate account is to be disclosed and advertised; “Up to but not exceeding * * * ”, “$.01 to * * * ”, or similar language.
4.
Term Share Accounts Opened in Midterm.
For club accounts that meet the definition of a term share account, the annual percentage yield is based on the maximum number of days in the term not to exceed 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year).

# Part II. Annual Percentage Yield Earned for Periodic Statements
1.
Balance method.
The dividend or interest figure used in the calculation of the annual percentage yield earned may be derived from the daily balance method or the average daily balance method. Regardless of the dividend calculation method, the balance used in the annual percentage yield earned formula is the average daily balance. The average daily balance calculation is the sum of the balances for each day in the period divided by the number of days in the period. The balance for each day is based on a point in time; i.e. beginning of day balance, end of day balance, closing of day balance, etc. Each day's balance, for dividend accrual and payment purposes, must be based on the same point in time and cannot be based on the day's low balance.
2.
Negative balances prohibited.
Credit unions must treat a negative account balance as zero to determine the balance on which the annual percentage yield earned is calculated. (See commentary to § 707.7(a)(2).)

# A. General Formula
1.
Accrued but uncredited dividends.
To calculate the annual percentage yield earned, accrued but uncredited dividends:
i. May not be included in the balance for statements that are issued at the same time or less frequently than the account's compounding and crediting frequency. For example, if monthly statements are sent for an account that compounds dividends daily and credits dividends monthly, the balance may not be increased each day to reflect the effect of daily compounding. Assume a credit union will pay $13.70 in dividends on $100,000 for the first day, $6.85 in dividends on $50,013.70 for the second day, and $3.43 in dividends on $25,020.55 for the third day. The sum of each days balance is $175,000 (does not include accrued, but uncredited, dividends amounts $13.70, $6.85, and $3.43), thereby resulting in an average daily balance for the three days of $58,333.33.
ii. Must be included in the balance for succeeding statements if a statement is issued more frequently than compounded dividends is credited on an account. For example, if monthly statements are sent for an account that compounds dividends daily and credits dividends quarterly, the balance for the second monthly statement would include dividends that had accrued for the prior month. Assume a credit union will pay $411.78 in dividends on 30 days of $100,000, $427.28 in dividends on 31 days of $100,411.78, and $415.23 in dividends on 30 days of $100,839.06. The balance (average daily balance in the account for the period) for the second 31 days is $100,411.78.
2.
Rounding.
The dividends earned figure used to calculate the annual percentage yield earned must be rounded to two decimals to reflect the amount actually paid. For example, if the dividends earned for a statement period is $20.074 and the credit union pays the member $20.07, the credit union must use $20.07 (not $20.074) to calculate the annual percentage yield earned. For accounts that pay dividends based on the daily balance method, compound and credit dividends or interest quarterly, and send monthly statements, the credit union may, but need not, round accrued dividends to two decimals for calculating the “projected” or “anticipated” annual percentage yield earned on the first two monthly statements issued during the quarter. However, on the quarterly statement the dividends earned figure must reflect the amount actually paid.
3.
Compounding frequency using the average daily balance method.
Any compounding frequency, including daily compounding, can be used when calculating dividends using the average daily balance method. (See comment 707.7(b), which does not require credit unions to compound or credit dividends at any particular frequency).

# B. Special Formula for Use Where Periodic Statement is Sent More Often Than the Period for Which Dividends are Compounded
1.
Statements triggered by Regulation E.
Credit unions may, but need not, use this formula to calculate the annual percentage yield earned for accounts that receive quarterly statements and that are subject to Regulation E's rule calling for monthly statements when an electronic fund transfer has occurred. They may do so even though no monthly statement was issued during a specific quarter. This formula must be used for accounts that compound and credit dividends quarterly and that receive monthly statements, triggered by Regulation E, which comply with the provisions of § 707.6.
2.
Days in compounding period.
Credit unions using the special annual percentage yield earned formula must use the actual number of days in the compounding period.

# Appendix B to Part 707—Model Clauses and Sample Forms
1.
Modifications.
Credit unions that modify the model clauses will be deemed in compliance as long as they do not delete information required by TISA or regulation or rearrange the format so as to affect the substance or clarity of the disclosures.
2.
Format.
Credit unions may use inserts to a document (see Sample Form B-11) or fill-in blanks (see Sample Forms B-4 and B-5, which use double underlining to indicate terms that have been filled in) to show current rates, fees or other terms.
3.
Disclosures for opening accounts.
The sample forms illustrate the information that must be provided to a member when an account is opened, as required by § 707.4(a)(1). (See § 707.4(a)(2), which states the requirements for disclosing the annual percentage yield, the dividend rate, and the maturity of a term share account in responding to a member's request.)
4.
Compliance with Regulation E.
Credit unions may satisfy certain requirements under Part 707 with disclosures that meet the requirements of Regulation E. (See § 707.3(c).) The model clauses and sample forms do not give examples of disclosures that would be covered by both this regulation and Regulation E (such as disclosing the amount of a fee for ATM usage). Credit unions should consult appendix A to Regulation E for appropriate model clauses.
5.
Duplicate disclosures.
If a requirement such as a minimum balance applies to more than one account term (to obtain a bonus and determine the annual percentage yield, for example), credit unions need not repeat the requirement for each term, as long as it is clear which terms the requirement applies to.
6.
Guide to model clauses.
In the model clauses, italicized words indicate the type of disclosure a credit union should insert in the space provided (for example, a credit union might insert “March 25, 1995” in the blank for “(date)” disclosure). Brackets and diagonals (“/”) indicate a credit union must choose the alternative that describes its practice (for example, [daily balance/average daily balance]).
7.
Sample forms.
The sample forms (B-4 through B-11) serve a purpose different from the model clauses. They illustrate various ways of adapting the model clauses to specific accounts. The clauses shown relate only to the specific transactions described.

[71 FR 77167, Dec. 22, 2006. Redesignated at 75 FR 81386, Dec. 28, 2010]
§ 708a.104
Disclosures and communications to members.
(a) After the board of directors has complied with § 708a.103 and approves a conversion proposal, the credit union must provide written notice of its intent to convert to each member who is eligible to vote on the conversion. The notice to members must be submitted 90 calendar days, 60 calendar days, and 30 calendar days before the date of the membership vote on the conversion. A ballot must be included in the same envelope as the 30-day notice and only in the 30-day notice. A converting credit union may not distribute ballots with either the 90-day or 60-day notice, in any other written communications, or in person before the 30-day notice is sent.
(b)(1) The notice to members must adequately describe the purpose and subject matter of the vote to be taken at the special meeting or by submission of the written ballot. The notice must clearly inform members that they may vote at the special meeting or by submitting the written ballot. The notice must state the date, time, and place of the meeting.
(2) The notices that are submitted 90 and 60 days before the membership vote on the conversion must state in a clear and conspicuous fashion that a written ballot will be mailed together with another notice 30 days before the date of the membership vote on conversion. The notice submitted 30 days before the membership vote on the conversion must state in a clear and conspicuous fashion that a written ballot is included in the same envelope as the 30-day notice materials.
(3) For purposes of facilitating the member-to-member contact described in paragraph (f) of this section, the 90-day notice must indicate the number of credit union members eligible to vote on the conversion proposal and state how many members have agreed to accept communications from the credit union in electronic form. The 90-day notice must also include the information listed in paragraph (f)(9) of this section.
(4) The member ballot must include:
(i) A brief description of the proposal (e.g., “Proposal: Approval of the Plan of Charter Conversion by which (insert
name of credit union) will convert its charter to that of a federal mutual savings bank.”);
(ii) Two blocks marked respectively as “FOR” and “AGAINST;” and
(iii) The following language: “A vote FOR the proposal means that you want your credit union to become a mutual savings bank. A vote AGAINST the proposal means that you want your credit union to remain a credit union.” This language must be displayed in a clear and conspicuous fashion immediately beneath the FOR and AGAINST blocks.
(5) The ballot may also include voting instructions and the recommendation of the board of directors (i.e., “Your Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the Plan of Conversion”) but may not include any further information without the prior written approval of the Regional Director.
(c) An adequate description of the purpose and subject matter of the member vote on conversion, as required by paragraph (b) of this section, must include:
(1) A clear and conspicuous disclosure that the conversion from a credit union to a mutual savings bank could lead to members losing their ownership interests in the credit union if the mutual savings bank subsequently converts to a stock institution and the members do not become stockholders;
(2) A clear and conspicuous disclosure of how a conversion from a credit union to a mutual savings bank will affect members' voting rights and if the mutual savings bank intends to base voting rights on account balances;
(3) A clear and conspicuous disclosure of any conversion-related economic benefit a director or senior management official will or may receive including receipt of or an increase in compensation and an explanation of any foreseeable stock-related benefits associated with a subsequent conversion to a stock institution or mutual holding company structure. The explanation of stock-related benefits must include a comparison of the opportunities to acquire stock available to officials and employees with those opportunities available to the general membership;
(4) An affirmative statement that, at the time of conversion to a mutual savings bank, the credit union does or does not intend to convert to a stock institution or a mutual holding company structure;
(5) A clear and conspicuous disclosure of the estimated, itemized cost of the proposed conversion, including printing fees, postage fees, advertising, consulting and professional fees, legal fees, staff time, the cost of holding a special meeting, other costs of conducting the vote, and any other conversion-related expenses;
(6) A clear and conspicuous disclosure of how the conversion from a credit union to a mutual savings bank will affect the institution's ability to make non-housing-related consumer loans because of a mutual savings bank's obligations to satisfy certain lending requirements as a mutual savings bank. This disclosure should specify possible reductions in some kinds of loans to members;
(7) A clear and conspicuous disclosure that the National Credit Union Administration does not approve or disapprove of the conversion proposal or the reasons advanced in support of and the reasons against the proposal; and
(8) A clear and conspicuous disclosure of how the conversion from a credit union to a mutual savings bank is likely to affect the availability of facilities and services. At a minimum, this disclosure should include the name and location of any branches, including shared branches, and automatic teller networks, to which members may lose access as a result of the conversion. This disclosure must be based on research and analysis completed before the date the board of directors votes to adopt the conversion proposal.
(d)(1) A converting credit union must provide the following disclosures in a clear and conspicuous fashion with the 90-, 60-, and 30-day notices it sends to its members regarding the conversion:
IMPORTANT REGULATORY DISCLOSURE ABOUT YOUR VOTE
The National Credit Union Administration, the federal government agency that supervises credit unions, requires [insert name of credit union] to provide the following disclosures:
1. LOSS OF CREDIT UNION MEMBERSHIP. A vote “FOR” the proposed conversion means you want your credit union to become a mutual savings bank. A vote “AGAINST” the proposed conversion means you want your credit union to remain a credit union.
2. RATES ON LOANS AND SAVINGS. If your credit union converts to a bank, you may experience changes in your loan and savings rates. Available historic data indicates that, for most loan products, credit unions on average charge lower rates than banks. For most savings products, credit unions on average pay higher rates than banks.
3. POTENTIAL PROFITS BY OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. Conversion to a mutual savings bank is often the first step in a two-step process to convert to a stock-issuing bank or holding company structure. In such a scenario, the officers and directors of the institution often profit by obtaining stock in excess of that available to other members.
(2) This text must be placed in a box, must be the only text on the front side of a single piece of paper, and must be placed so that the member will see the text after reading the credit union's cover letter but before reading any other part of the member notice. The back side of the paper must be blank. A converting credit union may modify this text only with the prior written consent of the Regional Director and, in the case of a state-chartered credit union, the appropriate state regulatory agency.
(e) All written communications from a converting credit union to its members regarding the conversion must be written in a manner that is simple and easy to understand. Simple and easy to understand means the communications are written in plain language designed to be understood by ordinary consumers and use clear and concise sentences, paragraphs, and sections. For purposes of this part, examples of factors to be considered in determining whether a communication is in plain language and uses clear and concise sentences, paragraphs and sections include the use of short explanatory sentences; use of definite, concrete, everyday words; use of active voice; avoidance of multiple negatives; avoidance of legal and technical business terminology; avoidance of explanations that are imprecise and reasonably subject to different interpretations; and use of language that is not misleading.
(f)(1) A converting credit union must mail or e-mail a requesting member's proper conversion-related materials to other members eligible to vote if:
(i) A credit union's board of directors has adopted a proposal to convert;
(ii) A member makes a written request that the credit union mail or e-mail materials for the member;
(iii) The request is received by the credit union no later than 35 days after it sends out the 90-day member notice; and
(iv) The requesting member agrees to reimburse the credit union for the reasonable expenses, excluding overhead, of mailing or e-mailing the materials and also provides the credit union with an appropriate advance payment.
(2) A member's request must indicate if the member wants the materials mailed or e-mailed. If a member requests that the materials be mailed, the credit union will mail the materials to all eligible voters. If a member requests the materials be e-mailed, the credit union will e-mail the materials to all members who have agreed to accept communications electronically from the credit union. The subject line of the credit union's e-mail will be “Proposed Credit Union Conversion to a Bank—Views of Member (insert member name).”
(3) (i) A converting credit union may, at its option, include the following statement with a member's material:
On (date), the board of directors of (name of converting credit union) adopted a proposal to convert from a credit union to a mutual savings bank. Credit union members who wish to express their opinions about the proposed conversion to other members may provide those opinions to (name of credit union). By law, the credit union, at the requesting members' expense, must then send those opinions to the other members. The attached document represents the opinion of a member of this credit union. This opinion is a personal opinion and does not necessarily reflect the views of the management or directors of the credit union.
(ii) A converting credit union may not add anything other than this statement to a member's material without the prior approval of the Regional Director.
(4) The term “proper conversion-related materials” does not include materials that:
(i) Due to size or similar reasons are impracticable to mail or e-mail;
(ii) Are false or misleading with respect to any material fact;
(iii) Omit a material fact necessary to make the statements in the material not false or misleading;
(iv) Relate to a personal claim or a personal grievance, or solicit personal gain or business advantage by or on behalf of any party;
(v) Relate to any matter, including a general economic, political, racial, religious, social, or similar cause, that is not significantly related to the proposed conversion;
(vi) Directly or indirectly and without expressed factual foundation impugn a person's character, integrity, or reputation;
(vii) Directly or indirectly and without expressed factual foundation make charges concerning improper, illegal, or immoral conduct; or
(viii) Directly or indirectly and without expressed factual foundation make statements impugning the stability and soundness of the credit union.
(5) If a converting credit union believes some or all of a member's request is not proper it must submit the member materials to the Regional Director within seven days of receipt. The credit union must include with its transmittal letter a specific statement of why the materials are not proper and a specific recommendation for how the materials should be modified, if possible, to make them proper. The Regional Director will review the communication, communicate with the requesting member, and respond to the credit union within seven days with a determination on the propriety of the materials. The credit union must then immediately mail or e-mail the material to the members if so directed by NCUA.
(6) A credit union must ensure that its members receive all materials that meet the requirements of § 708a.104(f) on or before the date the members receive the 30-day notice and associated ballot. If a credit union cannot meet this delivery requirement, it must postpone mailing the 30-day notice until it can deliver the member materials. If a credit union postpones the mailing of the 30-day notice, it must also postpone the special meeting by the same number of days. When the credit union has completed the delivery, it must inform the requesting member that the delivery was completed and provide the number of recipients.
(7) The term “appropriate advance payment” means:
(i) For requests to mail materials to all eligible voters, a payment in the amount of 150% of the first class postage rate times the number of mailings, and
(ii) For requests to e-mail materials only to members that have agreed to accept electronic communications, a payment in the amount of 200 dollars.
(8) If a credit union posts conversion-related information or material on its Web site, then it must simultaneously make a portion of its Web site available free of charge to its members to post and share their opinions on the conversion. A link to the portion of the Web site available to members to post their views on the conversion must be marked “Members: Share your views on the proposed conversion and see other members views” and the link must also be visible on all pages on which the credit union posts its own conversion-related information or material, as well as on the credit union's homepage. If a credit union believes a particular member submission is not proper for posting, it will provide that submission to the Regional Director for review as described in paragraph (f)(5) of this section. The credit union may also post a content-neutral disclaimer using language similar to the language in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section.
(9) A converting credit union must inform members with the 90-day notice that if they wish to provide their opinions about the proposed conversion to other members they can submit their opinions in writing to the credit union no later than 35 days from the date of
the notice and the credit union will forward those opinions to other members. The 90-day notice will provide a contact at the credit union for delivery of communications, will explain that members must agree to reimburse the credit union's costs of transmitting the communication including providing an advance payment, and will refer members to this section of NCUA's rules for further information about the communication process. The credit union, at its option, may include additional factual information about the communication process with its 90-day notice.
(10) A group of members may make a joint request that the credit union send its materials to other members. For purposes of paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section, the credit union will use the group name provided by the group.
[71 FR 77167, Dec. 22, 2006, as amended at 75 FR 34621, June 18, 2010. Redesignated and amended at 75 FR 81386, Dec. 28, 2010; 84 FR 1607, Feb. 5, 2019]
§ 708a.105
Notice to NCUA.
(a) If a converting credit union's board of directors approves a proposal to convert, it must provide the Regional Director with notice of its intent to convert during the 90 calendar day period preceding the date of the membership vote on the conversion.
(1) A credit union must give notice to the Regional Director of its intent to convert by providing a letter describing the material features of the conversion or a copy of the filing the credit union has made or intends to make with another federal or state regulatory agency in which the credit union seeks that agency's approval of the conversion. A credit union must include with the notice to the Regional Director copies of the notices the credit union has provided or intends to provide to members under §§ 708a.103 and 708a.104. The credit union must also include a copy of the ballot form and all written materials the credit union has distributed or intends to distribute to members. The term “written materials” includes written documentation or information of any sort, including electronic communications posted on a Web site or transmitted by electronic mail.
(2) As part of its notice to NCUA of intent to convert, the credit union's board of directors must provide the Regional Director with a certification of its support for the conversion proposal and plan. Each director who voted in favor of the conversion proposal must sign the certification. The certification must contain the following:
(i) A statement that each director signing the certification supports the proposed conversion and believes the proposed conversion is in the best interests of the members of the credit union;
(ii) A description of all materials submitted to the Regional Director with the notice and certification;
(iii) A statement that each board member signing the certification has examined all these materials carefully and these materials are true, correct, current, and complete as of the date of submission; and
(iv) An acknowledgement that federal law (18 U.S.C. 1001) prohibits any misrepresentations or omissions of material facts, or false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations made with respect to the certification or the materials provided to the Regional Director or any other documents or information provided to the members of the credit union or NCUA in connection with the conversion.
(3) A state-chartered credit union must state as part of the notice required by § 708a.105(a) if its state chartering law permits it to convert to a mutual savings bank and provide the specific legal citation. A state-chartered credit union will remain subject to any state law requirements for conversion that are more stringent than those this part imposes, including any internal governance requirements, such as the requisite membership vote for conversion and the determination of a member's eligibility to vote. If a state-chartered credit union relies for its authority to convert to a mutual savings bank on a state law parity provision, meaning a provision in state law permitting a state-chartered credit union to operate with the same or similar authority as a federal credit union, it must:
(i) Include in its notice a statement that its state regulatory authority
agrees that it may rely on the state law parity provision as authority to convert; and
(ii) Indicate its state regulatory authority's position as to whether federal law and regulations or state law will control internal governance issues in the conversion such as the requisite membership vote for conversion and the determination of a member's eligibility to vote.
(b) If it chooses, a credit union may seek a preliminary determination from the Regional Director regarding any of the notices required under this part and its proposed methods and procedures applicable to the membership conversion vote. The Regional Director will make a preliminary determination regarding the notices and methods and procedures applicable to the membership vote within 30 calendar days of receipt of a credit union's request for review unless the Regional Director extends the period as necessary to request additional information or review a credit union's submission. A credit union's prior submission of any notice or proposed voting procedures does not relieve the credit union of its obligation to certify the results of the membership vote required by § 708a.106 or eliminate the right of the Regional Director to disapprove the actual methods and procedures applicable to the membership vote if the credit union fails to conduct the membership vote in a fair and legal manner consistent with the Federal Credit Union Act and these rules.
(c) After receiving the notice described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Regional Director will contact and consult with the appropriate State Supervisory Authority.

§ 708a.106
Membership approval of a proposal to convert.
(a) A proposal for conversion approved by a board of directors requires approval by a majority of the members who vote on the proposal.
(b) The board of directors must set a voting record date to determine member voting eligibility that is at least one day before the publication of notice required in § 708a.103.
(c) A member may vote on a proposal to convert in person at a special meeting held on the date set for the vote or by written ballot filed by the member. The vote on the conversion proposal must be by secret ballot and conducted by an independent entity. The independent entity must be a company with experience in conducting corporate elections. No official or senior management official of the credit union or the immediate family members of any official or senior management official may have any ownership interest in or be employed by the independent entity.

§ 708a.107
Certification of vote on conversion proposal.
(a) The board of directors of the converting credit union must certify the results of the membership vote to the Regional Director within 14 calendar days after the vote is taken.
(b) The certification must also include a statement that the notice, ballot and other written materials provided to members were identical to those submitted to NCUA pursuant to § 708a.105. If the board cannot certify this, the board must provide copies of any new or revised materials and an explanation of the reasons for any changes.
(c) The certification must be accompanied by copies of all correspondence between the credit union and any Federal banking agency whose approval is required for the conversion.
[71 FR 77167, Dec. 22, 2006. Redesignated at 75 FR 81386, Dec. 28, 2010, as amended at 75 FR 81387, Dec. 28, 2010; 84 FR 1607, Feb. 5, 2019]
§ 708a.108
NCUA oversight of methods and procedures of membership vote.
(a) The Regional Director will review the methods by which the membership vote was taken and the procedures applicable to the membership vote. The Regional Director will determine: if the notices and other communications to members were accurate, not misleading, and timely; the membership
vote was conducted in a fair and legal manner; and the credit union has otherwise complied with part 708a.
(b) After completion of this review, the Regional Director will issue a determination that the methods and procedures applicable to the membership vote are approved or disapproved. The Regional Director will issue this determination within 30 calendar days of receipt from the credit union of the certification of the result of the membership vote required under § 708a.107 unless the Regional Director extends the period as necessary to request additional information or review the credit union's submission. Approval of the methods and procedures under this paragraph remains subject to a credit union fulfilling the requirements in § 708a.110 for timely completion of the conversion.
(c) If the Regional Director disapproves the methods by which the membership vote was taken or the procedures applicable to the membership vote, the Regional Director may direct that a new vote be taken.
(d) A converting credit union may request the regional director to reconsider a determination regarding the methods and procedures of the membership vote and/or file an appeal with the NCUA Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart B to part 746 of this chapter.
[71 FR 77167, Dec. 22, 2006. Redesignated at 75 FR 81386, Dec. 28, 2010, as amended at 82 FR 50293, Oct. 30, 2017; 84 FR 1607, Feb. 5, 2019]
§ 708a.109
Other regulatory oversight of methods and procedures of membership vote.
The federal or state regulatory agency that will have jurisdiction over the financial institution after conversion must verify the membership vote and may direct that a new vote be taken, if it disapproves of the methods by which the membership vote was taken or the procedures applicable to the membership vote.
[71 FR 77167, Dec. 22, 2006. Redesignated at 75 FR 81386, Dec. 28, 2010]
§ 708a.110
Completion of conversion.
(a) After receipt of the approvals under §§ 708a.108 and 708a.109 the credit union may complete the conversion.
(b) The credit union must complete the conversion within one year of the date of receipt of NCUA approval under § 708a.108. If a credit union fails to complete the conversion within one year the Regional Director will disapprove of the methods and procedures. The credit union's board of directors must then adopt a new conversion proposal and solicit another member vote if it still desires to convert.
(c) The Regional Director may, upon timely request and for good cause, extend the one year completion period for an additional six months.
(d) After notification by the board of directors of the mutual savings bank or mutual savings association that the conversion has been completed, the NCUA will cancel the insurance certificate of the credit union and, if applicable, the charter of a federal credit union.

§ 708a.111
Limit on compensation of officials.
No director or senior management official of an insured credit union may receive any economic benefit in connection with the conversion of a credit union other than compensation and other benefits paid to directors or senior management officials of the converted institution in the ordinary course of business.
[71 FR 77167, Dec. 22, 2006. Redesignated at 75 FR 81386, Dec. 28, 2010]
§ 708a.112
Voting incentives.
If a converting credit union offers an incentive to encourage members to participate in the vote, including a prize raffle, every reference to such incentive made by the credit union in a written communication to its members must also state that members are eligible for the incentive regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed conversion.
[71 FR 77167, Dec. 22, 2006. Redesignated at 75 FR 81386, Dec. 28, 2010]
§ 708a.113
Voting guidelines.
A converting credit union must conduct its member vote on conversion in
a fair and legal manner. NCUA provides the following guidelines as suggestions to help a credit union obtain a fair and legal vote and otherwise fulfill its regulatory obligations. These guidelines are not an exhaustive checklist and do not by themselves guarantee a fair and legal vote.
(a)
Applicability of state law.
While NCUA's conversion rule applies to all conversions of federally insured credit unions, federally insured state-chartered credit unions (FISCUs) are also subject to state law on conversions. NCUA's position is that a state legislature or state supervisory authority may impose conversion requirements more stringent or restrictive than NCUA's. States that permit this kind of conversion may have substantive and procedural requirements that vary from federal law. For example, there may be different voting standards for approving a vote. While the Federal Credit Union Act requires a simple majority of those who vote to approve a conversion, some states have higher voting standards requiring two-thirds or more of those who vote. A FISCU should be careful to understand both federal and state law to navigate the conversion process and conduct a proper vote.
(b)
Eligibility to vote.
(1) Determining who is eligible to cast a ballot is fundamental to any vote. No conversion vote can be fair and legal if some members are improperly excluded. A converting credit union should be cautious to identify all eligible members and make certain they are included on its voting list. NCUA recommends that a converting credit union establish internal procedures to manage this task.
(2) A converting credit union should be careful to make certain its member list is accurate and complete. For example, when a credit union converts from paper recordkeeping to computer recordkeeping, some member names may not transfer unless the credit union is careful in this regard. This same problem can arise when a credit union converts from one computer system to another where the software is not completely compatible.
(3) Problems with keeping track of who is eligible to vote can also arise when a credit union converts from a federal charter to a state charter or vice versa. NCUA is aware of an instance where a federal credit union used membership materials allowing two or more individuals to open a joint account and also allowed each to become a member. The federal credit union later converted to a state-chartered credit union that, like most other state-chartered credit unions in its state, used membership materials allowing two or more individuals to open a joint account but only allowed the first person listed on the account to become a member. The other individuals did not become members as a result of their joint account, but were required to open another account where they were the first or only person listed on the account. Over time, some individuals who became members of the federal credit union as the second person listed on a joint account were treated like those individuals who were listed as the second person on a joint account opened directly with the state-chartered credit union. Specifically, both of those groups were treated as non-members not entitled to vote. This example makes the point that a credit union must be diligent in maintaining a reliable membership list.
(c)
Scheduling the special meeting.
NCUA's conversion rule requires a converting credit union to permit members to vote by written mail ballot or in person at a special meeting held for the purpose of voting on the conversion. Although most members may choose to vote by mail, a significant number may choose to vote in person. As a result, a converting credit union should be careful to conduct its special meeting in a manner conducive to accommodating all members wishing to attend, including selecting a meeting location that can accommodate the anticipated number of attendees and is conveniently located. The meeting should also be held on a day and time suitable to most members' schedules. A credit union should conduct its meeting in accordance with applicable federal and state law, its bylaws, Robert's Rules of Order or other appropriate parliamentary procedures, and determine before the meeting the nature
and scope of any discussion to be permitted.
(d)
Voting incentives.
Some credit unions may wish to offer incentives to members, such as entry to a prize raffle, to encourage participation in the conversion vote. The credit union must exercise care in the design and execution of such incentives.
(1) The credit union should ensure that the incentive complies with all applicable state, federal, and local laws.
(2) The incentive should not be unreasonable in size. The cost of the incentive should have a negligible impact on the credit union's net worth ratio and the incentive should not be so large that it distracts the member from the purpose of the vote. If the board desires to use such incentives, the cost of the incentive should be included in the directors' deliberation and determination that the conversion is in the best interests of the credit union's members.
(3) The credit union should ensure that the incentive is available to every member that votes regardless of how or when he or she votes. All of the credit union's written materials promoting the incentive to the membership must disclose to the members, as required by § 708a.112, that they have an equal opportunity to participate in the incentive program regardless of whether they vote for or against the conversion. The credit union should also design its incentives so that they are available equally to all members who vote, regardless of whether they vote by mail or in person at the special meeting.
(e)
Solicitation of votes.
Some credit unions may wish to contact members who have not voted and encourage them to vote on the conversion proposal. NCUA believes, however, that using credit union employees to solicit votes is problematic. Employees directed to solicit votes could easily neglect everyday duties critical to the credit union's safe and sound operation. Also, employees may very well feel pressured to solicit votes for the conversion, regardless of whether or not they support the conversion. Accordingly, NCUA strongly encourages converting credit unions to use an independent third party to solicit votes rather than diverting credit union employees from their usual duties.

be received upon completion of the merger.
Federal banking agencies
have the same meaning as in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.
Merger
means any transaction in which a credit union transfers all, or substantially all, of its assets to a bank. The term
merger
includes any purported conversion of a credit union to a bank if the purported conversion is conducted pursuant to an agreement between a preexisting bank and the credit union that provides—
(1) The credit union will not conduct business as a stand-alone bank, and
(2) The purported conversion will be followed by the transfer of all, or substantially all, of the credit union's assets to the preexisting bank.
Merger value
or
merger valuation
is the amount that a stock bank would pay in an arm's-length transaction to purchase the credit union's assets and assume its liabilities and shares (deposits).

§ 708a.302
Authority to merge.
A credit union, with the approval of its members, may merge into a bank only with the prior approval of NCUA, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the regulator of the bank. If the credit union is State chartered, it also needs the prior approval of its State regulator.
§ 708a.303
Board of directors' approval and members' opportunity to comment.
(a)
Merger valuation.
Before selecting a bank merger partner and voting on a proposal to merge, a credit union's board of directors must determine, as part of its due diligence, the merger value of the credit union. In making its determination of the merger value of the credit union, the credit union must either:
(1) Conduct a well-publicized merger auction and obtain purchase quotations from at least three banks, two or more of which must be stock banks; or
(2) Retain a qualified appraisal entity to analyze and estimate the merger value of the credit union.
(b)
Advance notice.
A credit union that does not conduct a public auction as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must comply with the following notice requirements before voting on a proposal to merge.
(1) No later than 30 days before a board of directors votes on a proposal to merge, it must publish a notice in a general circulation newspaper, or in multiple newspapers if necessary, serving all areas where the credit union has an office, branch, or service center. It must also post the notice in a clear and conspicuous fashion in the lobby of the credit union's home office and branch offices and on the credit union's Web site, if it has one. If the notice is not on the home page of the Web site, the home page must have a clear and conspicuous link, visible on a standard monitor without scrolling, to the notice.
(2) The public notice must include the following:
(i) The name and address of the credit union;
(ii) The name and type of institution into which the credit union's board is considering a proposal to merge;
(iii) A brief statement of why the board is considering the merger and the major positive and negative effects of the proposed merger;
(iv) A statement that directs members to submit any comments on the proposal to the credit union's board of directors by regular mail, electronic mail, or facsimile;
(v) The date on which the board plans to vote on the proposal and the date by which members must submit their comments for consideration; which submission date may not be more than 5 days before the board vote;
(vi) The street address, electronic mail address, and facsimile number of the credit union where members may submit comments; and
(vii) A statement that, in the event the board approves the proposal to merge, the proposal will be submitted to the membership of the credit union for a vote following a notice period that is no shorter than 90 days.
(3) The board of directors must approve publication of the notice.
(c)
Member comments.
A credit union must collect and review any member comments about the merger received during the merger process. The credit union must retain the comments until the merger is consummated.
(d)
Approval of proposal to merge.
The merger proposal may only be approved by an affirmative vote of a majority of board members who have determined:
(1) A merger with a bank is in the best interests of the members, and
(2) The merger partner selected by the directors is the best choice for the members, taking into account the merger value of the credit union and the amount that the selected merger partner is willing to pay the credit union's members to effect the merger.
§ 708a.304
Notice to NCUA and request to proceed with member vote.
(a)
NIMRA.
If a credit union's board of directors adopts a proposal to merge, it must, within 30 days of the adoption, provide the Regional Director with a Notice of its Intent to Merge and Request for NCUA Authorization (NIMRA) to conduct a member vote. The NIMRA must include the following:

(12) Copies of all contracts reflecting any merger-related compensation or other benefit to be received by any director or senior management official of the credit union;
(13) If the merging credit union's assets on its latest call report are equal to or greater than the threshold amount established annually by the Federal Trade Commission under 15 U.S.C. 18a(a)(2)(B)(i), a statement about whether the two institutions intend to make a Hart-Scott-Rodino Act premerger notification filing with the Federal Trade Commission and, if not, an explanation why not;
(14) Copies of any filings the credit union or bank intends to make with another Federal or State regulatory
agency in which the credit union or bank seeks that agency's approval of the merger; and

(6) Explanation of any changes relative to insurance such as life savings and loan protection insurance and insurance of member accounts.
(c)
Director certification.
The NIMRA must include a certification by the credit union's board of directors of their support for the merger proposal and plan. Each director who voted in favor of the merger proposal must sign the certification. The certification must contain the following:
(1) A statement that each director signing the certification supports the proposed merger and believes the proposed merger, and the selected bank merger partner, are both in the best interests of the members of the credit union;
(2) A description of all materials submitted to the Regional Director with the notice and certification;
(3) A statement that each board member signing the certification has examined all these materials carefully and these materials are true, correct, current, and complete as of the date of submission; and
(4) An acknowledgement that Federal law (18 U.S.C. 1001) prohibits any misrepresentations or omissions of material facts, or false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations made with respect to the certification or the materials provided to the Regional Director or any other documents or information provided to the members of the credit union or NCUA in connection with the merger.
(d)
Due diligence.
The NIMRA must include a description of all the credit union's due diligence in determining that the merger satisfies the factors contained in section 205(c) of the Act. In particular, the NIMRA must describe how the board located the merger partner, how the board negotiated the merger agreement, and how the board determined that this merger was in the best interests of the credit union's members. The description must include all information relied upon by the credit union in determining the merger value of the credit union, the amount of any payment to be made by the bank to the credit union's members (the “merger payment”), and, if that merger payment is less than the merger value of the credit union, an explanation why the merger and the merger partner selected is in the best interests of the members. The description must include an explanation of the distribution formula by which the merger payment will be distributed among the credit union's members.
(e)
State chartered credit unions.
A State chartered credit union must state as part of its NIMRA if its State chartering law permits it to merge into a bank and provide the specific legal citation. A State chartered credit union will remain subject to any State law requirements for merger that are more stringent than those this part imposes, including any internal governance requirements, such as the requisite membership vote for merger and the determination of a member's eligibility to vote. If a State chartered credit union relies for its authority to merge into a bank on a State law parity provision, meaning a provision in State law permitting a State chartered credit union to operate with the same or similar authority as a Federal credit union, it must:
(1) Include in its notice a statement that its State regulatory authority agrees that it may rely on the State law parity provision as authority to merge; and
(2) Indicate its State regulatory authority's position as to whether Federal law and regulations or State law
will control internal governance issues in the merger such as the requisite membership vote for merger and the determination of a member's eligibility to vote.
(f)
Consultation with State authorities.
After receiving a NIMRA from a State chartered credit union, the Regional Director will consult with the appropriate State supervisory authority.
(g)
Regional Director approval.
After receiving a NIMRA, the Regional Director will either disapprove the proposed merger or authorize the credit union to proceed with its membership vote.
(1) The Regional Director will disapprove the proposed merger if the NIMRA either lacks the documentation required by this section or lacks substantial evidence to support each of the factors in section 205(c) of the Act. As part of this determination, the Regional Director must disapprove the proposed merger if:
(i) The merger payment offered by the bank to the members is less than the merger valuation, absent some additional, quantifiable benefit to the members from the selected merger partner; or
(ii) The NIMRA fails to adequately explain the nature and amount of any compensation to be received by the credit union's directors or senior management officials in connection with the merger or to justify that compensation.
(2) NCUA's authorization to proceed with the member vote does not mean NCUA has approved of the merger proposal.
(h)
Appeal of adverse decision.
If the Regional Director disapproves a merger proposal, the credit union may request reconsideration and/or file an appeal with the NCUA Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart B to part 746 of this chapter.
[75 FR 81387, Dec. 28, 2010, as amended at 82 FR 50293, Oct. 30, 2017; 85 FR 62213, Oct. 2, 2020]
§ 708a.305
Disclosures and communications to members.
(a) After the board of directors approves a merger proposal and receives NCUA's authorization as described in §§ 708a.303 and 708a.304, the credit union must provide written notice of its intent to merge to each member who is eligible to vote on the merger. The notice to members must be mailed 90 calendar days and 30 calendar days before the date of the membership vote on the merger. A ballot must be included in the same envelope as the 30-day notice and only with the 30-day notice. A merging credit union may not distribute ballots with the 90-day notice, in any other written communications, or in person before the 30-day notice is sent.
(b)(1) The notice to members must adequately describe the purpose and subject matter of the vote and clearly inform members that they may vote at the special meeting or by submitting the written ballot. The notice must state the date, time, and place of the meeting.
(2) The 90-day notice must state in a clear and conspicuous fashion that a written ballot will be mailed together with another notice 30 days before the date of the membership vote on merger. The 30-day notice must state in a clear and conspicuous fashion that a written ballot is included in the same envelope as the 30-day notice materials.
(3) For purposes of facilitating the member-to-member contact described in paragraph (f) of this section, the 90-day notice must indicate the number of credit union members eligible to vote on the merger proposal and state how many members have agreed to accept communications from the credit union in electronic form. The 90-day notice must also include the information listed in paragraph (g)(9) of this section.
(4) The member ballot must include:
(i) A brief description of the proposal (
e.g.,
“Proposal: Approval of the Plan of Merger by which [insert name of credit union] will merge with a bank”);
(ii) Two blocks marked respectively as “FOR” and “AGAINST;” and
(iii) The following language: “A vote FOR the proposal means that you want your credit union to merge with and become a bank. A vote AGAINST the proposal means that you want your credit union to remain a credit union.” This language must be displayed in a
clear and conspicuous fashion immediately beneath the FOR and AGAINST blocks.
(5) The ballot may also include voting instructions and the recommendation of the board of directors (
i.e.,
“Your Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the Plan of Merger”) but may not include any further information without the prior written approval of the Regional Director.
(c) For mergers into stock banks, an adequate description of the purpose and subject matter of the member vote on merger, as required by paragraph (b) of this section, must include:
(1) A clear and conspicuous disclosure that if the merger is approved the members will lose all of their ownership interests in the institution, including the right to vote, the right to share in the value of the institution should it be liquidated, the right to share in any extraordinary dividends, and the right to have the net worth of the institution managed in their best interests;
(2) A clear and conspicuous disclosure of any post-merger employment or consulting relationships offered by the bank to any of the credit union's directors and senior management officials and the amount of the associated compensation;
(3) A clear and conspicuous disclosure of how the merger of the credit union will affect the members' ability to obtain non-housing-related consumer loans from the bank because of the bank's obligations to satisfy statutory or regulatory lending requirements (if any). This disclosure should specify possible reductions in some kinds of loans to members;

(e)(1) A merging credit union must provide the following disclosures in a clear and conspicuous fashion with the 90-day and 30-day notices it sends to its members regarding the merger:
IMPORTANT REGULATORY DISCLOSURE ABOUT YOUR VOTE
The National Credit Union Administration, the Federal government agency that supervises credit unions, requires [insert name of credit union] to provide the following disclosures:
1. LOSS OF CREDIT UNION MEMBERSHIP. A vote “FOR” the proposed merger means you want your credit union to merge with and become a bank. A vote “AGAINST” the proposed merger means you want your credit union to remain a credit union.
2. [For Mergers into Stock Banks Only]. LOSS OF OWNERSHIP INTERESTS. If your credit union merges into the bank, you will lose all the ownership interests you currently have in the credit union and you will become a customer of the bank. The bank's stockholders own the bank, and the directors of the bank have a fiduciary responsibility to run the bank in the best interests of the stockholders, not the customers.
2. [For Mergers into Mutual Banks Only]. POTENTIAL PROFITS BY OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. Merger into a mutual savings bank is often the first step in a two-step process to convert to a stock-issuing bank or holding company structure. In such a scenario, the officers and directors of the bank often profit by obtaining stock in excess of that available to other members.
3. RATES ON LOANS AND SAVINGS. If your credit union merges into the bank, you may experience changes in your loan and savings rates. Available historic data indicates that, for most loan products, credit unions on average charge lower rates than banks. For most savings products, credit unions on average pay higher rates than banks.
