# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 202.21
Purpose and scope.
(a) This subpart sets forth the procedures to be followed when a subpoena, order, or other demand (hereinafter referred to as a “demand”) of a court or other authority is issued for the production or disclosure of (1) any material contained in the files of the Department of Energy (DOE), (2) any information relating to material contained in the files of the DOE, or (3) any information or material acquired by any person while such person was an employee of the DOE as a part of the performance of his official duties or because of his official status.
(b) For purposes of this subpart, the term “Employee of the DOE” includes all officers and employees of the United States appointed by, or subject to the supervision, jurisdiction, or control of, the Administrator of DOE.
§ 202.22
Production or disclosure prohibited unless approved by appropriate DOE official.
No employee or former employee of the DOE shall, in response to a demand of a court or other authority, produce any material contained in the file of the DOE or disclose any information relating to material contained in the files of the DOE, or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as part of the performance of his official duties or because of his official status without prior approval of the General Counsel of DOE.
§ 202.23
Procedure in the event of a demand for production or disclosure.
(a) Whenever a demand is made upon an employee or former employee of the DOE for the production of material or the disclosure of information described in § 202.21(a), he shall immediately notify the Regional Counsel for the region where the issuing authority is located. The Regional Counsel shall immediately request instructions from the General Counsel of DOE.
(b) If oral testimony is sought by the demand, an affidavit, or, if that is not feasible, a statement by the party seeking the testimony or his attorney, setting forth a summary of the testimony desired, must be furnished for submission by the Regional Counsel to the General Counsel.
§ 202.24
Final action by the appropriate DOE official.
If the General Counsel approves a demand for the production of material or disclosure of information, he shall so notify the Regional Counsel and such other persons as circumstances may warrant.
§ 202.25
Procedure where a decision concerning a demand is not made prior to the time a response to the demand is required.
If response to the demand is required before the instructions from the General Counsel are received, a U.S. attorney or DOE attorney designated for the purpose shall appear with the employee or former employee of the DOE upon whom the demand has been made, and shall furnish the court or other authority with a copy of the regulations contained in this subpart and inform the court or other authority that the demand has been, or is being, as the case may be, referred for the prompt consideration of the appropriate DOE official and shall respectfully request the court or authority to stay the demand pending receipt of the requested instructions.
§ 202.26
Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.
If the court or other authority declines to stay the effect of the demand in response to a request made in accordance with § 202.25 pending receipt of instructions, of if the court or other authority rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of instructions not to produce the material or disclose the information sought, the employee or former employee upon whom the demand has been made shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand. “United States ex rel Touhy v. Ragen,” 340 U.S. 462.

§ 205.80
Purpose and scope.
(a) This subpart establishes the procedures for the filing of a formal request for an interpretation and for the consideration of such request. Responses, which may include verbal or written responses to general inquiries or to other than formal written requests for interpretation filed with the General Counsel or his delegate or a Regional Counsel, are not interpretations and merely provide general information.

§ 205.83
Contents.
(a) The request shall contain a full and complete statement of all relevant facts pertaining to the circumstances,
act or transaction that is the subject of the request and to the DOE action sought. Such facts shall include the names and addresses of all affected persons (if reasonably ascertainable) and a full discussion of the pertinent provisions and relevant facts contained in the documents submitted with the request. Copies of all relevant contracts, agreements, leases, instruments, and other documents shall be submitted with the request. When the request pertains to only one step of a larger integrated transaction, the facts, circumstances, and other relevant information pertaining to the entire transaction must be submitted.
(b) The request for interpretation shall include a discussion of all relevant authorities, including, but not limited to, DOE rulings, regulations, interpretations and decisions on appeals and exceptions relied upon to support the particular interpretation sought therein.
§ 205.84
DOE evaluation.
(a)
Processing.
(1) The DOE may initiate an investigation of any statement in a request and utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts obtained by such investigation. The DOE may accept submissions from third persons relevant to any request for interpretation provided that the person making the request is afforded an opportunity to respond to all third person submissions. In evaluating a request for interpretation, the DOE may consider any other source of information. The DOE on its own initiative may convene a conference, if, in its discretion, it considers that such conference will advance its evaluation of the request.
(2) The DOE shall issue its interpretation on the basis of the information provided in the request, unless that information is supplemented by other information brought to the attention of the General Counsel or a Regional Counsel during the proceeding. The interpretation shall, therefore, depend for its authority on the accuracy of the factual statement and may be relied upon only to the extent that the facts of the actual situation correspond to those upon which the interpretation was based.
(3) If the DOE determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision and if upon request additional information is not submitted by the person requesting the interpretation, the DOE may refuse to issue an interpretation.
(b)
Criteria.
(1) The DOE shall base an interpretation on the FEA and EPAA and the regulations and published rulings of the DOE as applied to the specific factual situation.
(2) The DOE shall take into consideration previously issued interpretations dealing with the same or a related issue.
§ 205.85
Decision and effect.
(a) An interpretation may be issued after consideration of the request for interpretation and other relevant information received or obtained during the proceeding.
(b) The interpretation shall contain a statement of the information upon which it is based and a legal analysis of and conclusions regarding the application of rulings, regulations and other precedent to the situation presented in the request.
(c) Only those persons to whom an interpretation is specifically addressed and other persons upon whom the DOE serves the interpretation and who are directly involved in the same transaction or act may rely upon it. No person entitled to rely upon an interpretation shall be subject to civil or criminal penalties stated in subpart P of this part for any act taken in reliance upon the interpretation, notwithstanding that the interpretation shall thereafter be declared by judicial or other competent authority to be invalid.
(d) An interpretation may be rescinded or modified at any time. Rescission or modification may be effected by notifying persons entitled to rely on the interpretation that it is rescinded or modified. This notification shall include a statement of the reasons for the recision or modification and, in the case of a modification, a restatement of the interpretation as modified.
(e) An interpretation is modified by a subsequent amendment to the regulations or ruling to the extent that it is
inconsistent with the amended regulation or ruling.
(f)(1) Any person aggrieved by an interpretation may submit a petition for reconsideration to the General Counsel within 30 days of service of the interpretation from which the reconsideration is sought. There has not been an exhaustion of administrative remedies until a period of 30 days from the date of service of the interpretation has elapsed without receipt by the General Counsel of a petition for reconsideration or, if a petition for reconsideration of the interpretation has been filed in a timely manner, until that petition has been acted on by the General Counsel. However, a petition to which the General Counsel does not respond within 60 days of the date of receipt thereof, or within such extended time as the General Counsel may prescribe by written notice to the petitioner concerned within that 60 day period, shall be considered denied.
(2) A petition for reconsideration may be summarily denied if—
(i) It is not filed in a timely manner, unless good cause is shown; or
(ii) It is defective on its face for failure to state, and to present facts and legal argument in support thereof, that the interpretation was erroneous in fact or in law, or that it was arbitrary or capricious.
(3) The General Counsel may deny any petition for reconsideration if the petitioner does not establish that—
(i) The petition was filed by a person aggrieved by an interpretation;
(ii) The interpretation was erroneous in fact or in law; or
(iii) The interpretation was arbitrary or capricious. The denial of a petition shall be a final order of which the petitioner may seek judicial review.

§ 205.171
Conferences.
(a) The DOE in its discretion may direct that a conference be convened, on its own initiative or upon request by a person, when it appears that such conference will materially advance the proceeding. The determination as to who may attend a conference convened under this subpart shall be in the discretion of the DOE, but a conference will usually not be open to the public.
(b) A conference may be requested in connection with any proceeding of the DOE by any person who might be aggrieved by that proceeding. The request may be made in writing or verbally, but must include a specific showing as to why such conference will materially advance the proceeding. The request shall be addressed to the DOE office that is conducting the proceeding.
(c) A conference may only be convened after actual notice of the time, place, and nature of the conference is provided to the person who requested the conference.
(d) When a conference is convened in accordance with this section, each person may present views as to the issue or issues involved. Documentary evidence may be presented at the conference, but will be treated as if submitted in the regular course of the proceedings. A transcript of the conference will not usually be prepared. However, the DOE in its discretion may have a verbatim transcript prepared.
(e) Because a conference is solely for the exchange of views incident to a proceeding, there will be no formal reports or findings unless the DOE in its discretion determines that such would be advisable.
§ 205.172
Hearings.
(a) The DOE in its discretion may direct that a hearing be convened on its own initiative or upon request by a person, when it appears that such hearing will materially advance the proceedings. The determination as to who may attend a hearing convened under this subpart shall be in the discretion of DOE, but a hearing will usually not be open to the public.

(d) A hearing may only be convened after actual notice of the time, place, and nature of the hearing is provided both to the applicant or appellant and to any other person readily identifiable by the DOE as one who will be aggrieved by the DOE action involved. The notice shall include, as appropriate:
(1) A statement that such person may participate in the hearing; or
(2) A statement that such person may request a separate conference or hearing regarding the application or appeal.
(e) When a hearing is convened in accordance with this section, each person may present views as to the issue or issues involved. Documentary evidence may be presented at the hearing, but will be treated as if submitted in the regular course of the proceedings. A transcript of the hearing will not usually be prepared. However, the DOE in its discretion may have a verbatim transcript prepared.
(f) The official conducting the hearing may administer oaths and affirmations, rule on the presentation of information, receive relevant information, dispose of procedural requests, determine the format of the hearing, and otherwise regulate the course of the hearing.
(g) Because a hearing is solely for the exchange of views incident to a proceeding, there will be no formal reports or findings unless the DOE in its discretion determines that such would be advisable.

§ 205.190
Purpose and scope.
(a) This subpart establishes the procedures for determining the nature and extent of violations of the DOE regulations in parts 210, 211, and 212 and the procedures for issuance of a Notice of Probable Violation, a Proposed Remedial Order, a Remedial Order, an Interim Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, a Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, a Notice of Probable Disallowance, a Proposed Order of Disallowance, an Order of Disallowance, or a Consent Order. Nothing in these regulations shall affect the authority of DOE enforcement officials in coordination with the Department of Justice to initiate appropriate civil or criminal enforcement actions in court at any time.
(b) When any report required by the ERA or any audit or investigation discloses, or the ERA otherwise discovers, that there is reason to believe a violation of any provision of this chapter, or any order issued thereunder, has occurred, is continuing or is about to occur, the ERA may conduct an inquiry to determine the nature and extent of the violation. A Remedial Order or Order of Disallowance may be issued thereafter by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The ERA may commence enforcement proceedings by serving a Notice of Probable Violation, a Notice of Probable Disallowance, a Proposed Remedial Order, a Proposed Order of Disallowance, or an Interim Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance.

§ 205.192
Proposed remedial order.
(a) If the ERA finds, after the 30-day or other period authorized for reply to the Notice of Probable Violation, that a violation has occurred, is continuing, or is about to occur, it may issue a Proposed Remedial Order, which shall set forth the relevant facts and law.
(b) The ERA may issue a Proposed Remedial Order at any time it finds that a violation has occurred, is continuing, or is about to occur even if it has not previously issued a Notice of Probable Violation.
(c) The ERA shall serve a copy of the Proposed Remedial Order upon the person to whom it is directed. The ERA shall promptly publish a notice in the
Federal Register
which states the person to whom the Proposed Remedial Order is directed, his address, and the products, dollar amounts, time period, and geographical area specified in the Proposed Remedial Order. The notice shall indicate that a copy of the Proposed Remedial Order with confidential information, if any, deleted may be obtained from the ERA and that within 15 days after the date of publication any aggrieved person may file a Notice of Objection with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of accordance with § 205.193. The ERA shall mail copies of the
Federal Register
notice to all readily identifiable persons who are likely to be aggrieved by issuance of the Proposed Remedial Order as a final order.
(d) The Proposed Remedial Order shall set forth the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which it is based. It shall also include a discussion of the relevant authorities which support the position asserted, including rules, regulations, rulings, interpretations and previous decisions issued by DOE or its predecessor agencies. The Proposed Remedial Order shall be accompanied by a declaration executed by the DOE employee primarily knowledgeable about the facts of the case stating that, to the best of declarant's knowledge and belief, the findings of fact are correct.
(e) The ERA may amend or withdraw a Proposed Remedial Order at its discretion prior to the date of service of a Statement of Objections in that proceeding. The date of service of the amended documents shall be considered the date of service of the Proposed Remedial Order in calculating the time periods specified in this part 205.
§ 205.192A
Burden of proof.
(a) In a Proposed Remedial Order proceeding the ERA has the burden of establishing a prima facie case as to the validity of the findings of fact and conclusions of law asserted therein. The ERA shall be deemed to meet this burden by the service of a Proposed Remedial Order that meets the requirements of § 205.192(d) and any supplemental information that may be made available under § 205.193A.
(b) Once a prima facie case has been established, a person who objects to a finding of fact or conclusion of law in the Proposed Remedial Order has the burden of going forward with the evidence. Furthermore, the proponent of additional factual representations has the burden of going forward with the evidence.
(c) Unless otherwise specified by the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee, the proponent of an order or a motion or additional factual representations has the ultimate burden of persuasion.
§ 205.193
Notice of Objection.
(a) Within 15 days after publication of the notice of a Proposed Remedial Order in the
Federal Register
any aggrieved person may file a Notice of Objection to the Proposed Remedial Order with the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The Notice shall be filed in duplicate, shall briefly describe how the person would be aggrieved by issuance of the Proposed Remedial Order as a final order and shall state the person's intention to file a Statement of Objections. No confidential information shall be included in a Notice of Objection. The DOE shall place one copy of the Notice in the Office of Hearings and Appeals Public Docket Room.
(b) A person who fails to file a timely Notice of Objection shall be deemed to have admitted the findings of fact and conclusions of law as stated in the Proposed Remedial Order. If a Notice of Objection is not filed as provided by paragraph (a) of this section, the Proposed Remedial Order may be issued as a final order.
(c) A person who files a Notice of Objection shall on the same day serve a copy of the Notice upon the person to whom the Proposed Remedial Order is directed, the DOE Office that issued the Proposed Remedial Order, and the DOE Assistant General Counsel for Administrative Litigation.
(d) The Notice shall include a certification of compliance with the provisions of this section, the names and addresses of each person served with a copy of the Notice, and the date and manner of service.
(e) If no person files a timely Notice of Objection, ERA may request the Office of Hearings and Appeals to issue the Proposed Remedial Order as a final Remedial Order.
(f) In order to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to a Remedial Order proceeding, a person must file a timely Notice of Objection and Statement of Objections with the Office of Hearings and Appeals.
§ 205.193A
Submission of ERA supplemental information.
Within 20 days after service of a Notice of Objection to a Proposed Remedial Order the ERA may serve, upon the person to whom the Proposed Remedial Order was directed, supplemental information relating to the calculations and determinations which support the findings of fact set forth in the Proposed Remedial Order.
§ 205.194
Participants; official service list.
(a) Upon receipt of a Notice of Objection, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall publish a notice in the
Federal Register
which states the person to whom the Proposed Remedial Order is directed, his address and the products, dollar amounts, time period, and geographical area specified in the Proposed Remedial Order. The notice shall state that any person who wishes to participate in the proceeding must file an appropriate request with the Office of Hearings and Appeals.
(b) The Office that issued the Proposed Remedial Order and the person to whom the Order is directed shall be considered participants before the Office of Hearings and Appeals at all stages of an enforcement proceeding.

The request shall contain
(1) The person's name, address, and telephone number and similar information concerning his duly authorized representative, if any;
(2) A detailed description of the person's interest in the proceeding;
(3) The specific reasons why the person's active involvement in the proceeding will substantially contribute to a complete resolution of the issues to be considered in the proceeding;

(c) After considering the requests submitted pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall determine those persons who may participate on an active basis in the proceeding and the nature of their participation. Participants with similar interests may be required to consolidate their submissions and to appear in the proceeding through a common representative.
(d) Within 30 days after publication of the notice referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall prepare an official service list for the proceeding. Within the same 30 day period the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall mail the official service list to all persons who filed requests to participate. For good cause shown a person may be placed on the official service list as a non-participant, for the receipt of documents only. An opportunity shall be afforded to participants to oppose the placement of a non-participant on the official service list.
(e) A person requesting to participate after the period for submitting requests has expired must show good cause for failure to file a request within the prescribed time period.
(f) The Office of Hearings and Appeals may limit the nature of a person's participation in the proceeding, if it finds that the facts upon which the person's request was based have changed or were incorrect when stated or that the person has not been actively participating or has engaged in disruptive or dilatory conduct. The action referred to in this provision shall be taken only after notice and an opportunity to be heard are afforded.

Service shall be made in accordance with § 205.7 and may also be made by deposit in the regular United States mail, properly stamped and addressed, when accompanied by proof of service consisting of a certificate of counsel or an affidavit of the person making the service. If any filing arguably contains confidential information, a person may serve copies with the confidential information deleted upon all persons on the official service list except DOE offices, which shall be served both an original filing and one with deletions.
(2) A DOE office shall on the date it files a submission serve all persons on the official service list, unless the filing arguably contains confidential information. In that case the DOE office shall notify the person to whom the information relates of the opportunity to identify and delete the confidential information. The DOE Office may delay the service of a submission containing arguably confidential information upon all persons other than the possessor of the confidential information and other DOE offices up to 14 days. The possessor of the confidential information shall serve the filing with any
deletions upon all persons on the official service list within such time period.
(c) Any filing made under this section shall include a certification of compliance by the filer with the provisions of this subpart. The person serving a document shall file a certificate of service, which includes the date and manner of service for each person on the official service list.

The Statement shall set forth the findings of fact contained in the Proposed Remedial Order which are alleged to be erroneous, the factual basis for such allegations, and any alternative findings which are sought. The Statement shall include a discussion of all relevant authorities which support the position asserted. The Statement may include additional factual representations which are not referred to in the Proposed Remedial Order and which the person contends are material and relevant to the compliance proceeding. For each additional factual representation which the person asserts should be made, the Statement shall include reasons why the factual representation is relevant and material, and the manner in which its validity is or will be established. The person shall also specify the manner in which each additional issue of fact was raised in any prior administrative proceeding which led to issuance of the Proposed Remedial Order, or the reasons why it was not raised.
(c) A Statement of Objections that is filed by the person to whom a Proposed Remedial Order is directed shall include a copy of any relevant Notice of Probable Violation, each Response thereto, the Proposed Remedial Order, and any relevant work papers or supplemental information previously provided by ERA. Copies of this material must also be included with the copy of the Statement of Objections served upon the DOE Assistant General Counsel for Administrative Litigation. All other persons on the official service list must be notified that such materials are available from the notifier upon written request.

All Motions for Discovery and related filings must be served upon the person to whom the discovery is directed. If the person to whom the discovery is directed is not on the official service list, the documents served upon him shall include a copy of this section, the address of the Office of Hearings and Appeals and a statement that objections to the Motion may be filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals.
(b) A Motion for Discovery may request that:

A participant who has unsuccessfully attempted in writing to obtain information that another participant claims is confidential may file a Motion for Discovery and Protective Order. This motion shall meet the requirements of § 205.198 and shall specify the particular confidential information that the movant seeks and the reasons why the information is necessary to adequately present the movant's position in the proceeding. A copy of the written request for information, a certification concerning when and to whom it was served and a copy of the response, if any, shall be appended to the motion. The motion must give the possessor of the information notice that a Response to the Motion must be filed within ten days. The Response shall specify the safeguards, if any, that should be imposed if the information is ordered to be released. The Office of Hearings and Appeals may issue a Protective Order upon consideration of the Motion and the Response.
§ 205.199
Evidentiary hearing.
(a)
Filing Requirements.
At the time a person files a Statement of Objections he may also file a motion requesting an evidentiary hearing be convened. A motion requesting an evidentiary hearing may be filed by any other participant within 30 days after that participant is served with a Statement of Objections.
(b)
Contents of Motion for Evidentiary Hearing.
A Motion for Evidentiary Hearing shall specify each disputed issue of fact and the bases for the alternative findings the movant asserts. The movant shall also describe the manner in which each disputed issue of fact was raised in any prior administrative proceeding which led to issuance of the Proposed Remedial Order, or why it was not raised. The movant shall with respect to each disputed or alternative finding of fact:
(1) As specifically as possible, identify the witnesses whose testimony is required;
(2) State the reasons why the testimony of the witnesses is necessary; and
(3) State the reasons why the asserted position can be effectively established only through the direct questioning of witnesses at an evidentiary hearing.
(c)
Response to Motion for Evidentiary Hearing.
Within 20 days after service of any Motion for Evidentiary Hearing, the Office that issued the Proposed Remedial Order shall, and any other participant may file a Response with the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The Response shall specify:

(2) Each particular factual representation which is denied;
(3) Each particular factual representation which the participant is not in a position to accept or deny;
(4) Each particular factual representation which is not accepted and the participant wishes proven by the submission of evidence;
(5) Each particular factual representation which the participant is prepared to dispute through the testimony of witnesses or the submission of verified documents; and
(6) Each particular factual representation which the participant asserts should be dismissed as immaterial or irrelevant.
(d)
Prehearing Conferences.
After all submissions with respect to a Motion for Evidentiary Hearing are filed, the Office of Hearings and Appeals may conduct conferences or hearings to resolve differences of view among the participants.
(e)
Decision on Motion for Evidentiary Hearing.
After considering all relevant information received in connection with the Motion, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall enter an Order. In the Order the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall direct that an evidentiary hearing be convened if it concludes that a genuine dispute exists as to relevant and material issues of fact and an evidentiary hearing would substantially assist it in making findings of fact in an effective manner. If the Motion for Evidentiary Hearing is granted in whole or in part, the Order shall specify the parties to the hearing, any limitations on the participation of a party, and the issues of fact set forth for the evidentiary hearing. The Order may also require parties that have adopted similar positions to consolidate their presentations and to appear at the evidentiary hearing through a common representative. If the Motion is denied, the Order may allow the movant to file affidavits and other documents in support of his asserted findings of fact.
(f)
Review of Decision.
The Order of the Office of Hearings and Appeals with respect to a Motion for Evidentiary Hearing shall be subject to further administrative review or appeal only upon issuance of the determination referred to in § 205.199B.
(g)
Conduct of Evidentiary Hearing.
All evidentiary hearings convened pursuant to this section shall be conducted by the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee. At any evidentiary hearing the parties shall have the opportunity to present material evidence which directly relates to a particular issue of fact set forth for hearing. The presiding officer shall afford the parties an opportunity to cross examine all witnesses. The presiding officer may administer oaths and affirmations, rule on objections to the presentation of evidence, receive relevant material, rule on any motion to conform the Proposed Remedial Order to the evidence presented, rule on motions for continuance, dispose of procedural requests, determine the format of the hearing, modify any order granting a Motion for Evidentiary Hearing, direct that written motions or briefs be provided with respect to issues raised during the course of the hearing, issue subpoenas, and otherwise regulate the conduct of the hearing. The presiding officer may take reasonable measures to exclude duplicative material from the hearing, and may place appropriate limitations on the number of witnesses that may be called by a party. The presiding officer may also require that evidence be submitted through affidavits or other documents if the direct testimony of witnesses will unduly delay the orderly
progress of the hearing and would not contribute to resolving the issues involved in the hearing. The provisions of § 205.8 which relate to subpoenas and witness fees shall apply to any evidentiary hearing, except that subsection § 205.8(h) (2), (3), and (4) shall not apply.
§ 205.199A
Hearing for the purpose of oral argument only.
(a) A participant is entitled upon timely request to a hearing to present oral argument with respect to the Proposed Remedial Order, whether or not an evidentiary hearing is requested or convened. A participant's request shall normally be considered untimely, if made more than 10 days after service of a determination regarding any motion filed by the requestor or, if no motions were filed by him, if made after the date for filing his Reply or his Response to a Statement of Objections.
(b) If an evidentiary hearing is convened, and a hearing for oral argument is requested, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall determine whether the hearing for oral argument shall be held in conjunction with the evidentiary hearing or at a separate time.
(c) A hearing for the purpose of receiving oral argument will generally be conducted only after the issues involved in the proceeding have been delineated, and any written material which the Office of Hearings and Appeals has requested to supplement a Statement of Objections or Responses has been submitted. The presiding officer may require further written submissions in support of any position advanced or issued at the hearing, and shall allow responses any such submissions.
§ 205.199B
Remedial order.
(a) After considering all information received during the proceeding, the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee may issue a final Remedial Order. The Remedial Order may adopt the findings and conclusions contained in the Proposed Remedial Order or may modify or rescind any such finding or conclusion to conform the Order to the evidence or on the basis of a determination that the finding or conclusion is erroneous in fact or law or is arbitrary or capricious. In the alternative, the Office of Hearings and Appeals may determine that no Remedial Order should be issued or may remand all or a portion of the Proposed Remedial Order to the issuing DOE office for further consideration or modification. Every determination made pursuant to this section shall state the relevant facts and legal bases supporting the determination.
(b) The DOE shall serve a copy of any determination issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section upon the person to whom it is directed, any person who was served with a copy of the Proposed Remedial Order, the DOE office that issued the Proposed Remedial Order, the DOE Assistant General Counsel for Administrative Litigation and any other person on the official service list. Appropriate deletions may be made in the determinations to ensure that confidentiality of information protected from disclosure under 18 U.S.C. 1905 and 5 U.S.C. 552. A copy of the determination with appropriate deletions to protect confidential and proprietary data shall be placed in the Office of Hearings and Appeals Public Docket Room.
§ 205.199C
Appeals of remedial order to FERC.
(a) The person to whom a Remedial Order is issued by the Office of Hearings and Appeals may file an administrative appeal if the Remedial Order proceeding was initiated by a Notice of Probable Violation issued after October 1, 1977, or, in those situations in which no Notice of Probable Violation was issued, if the proceeding was initiated by a Proposed Remedial Order issued after October 1, 1977.
(b) Any such appeal must be initiated within 30 days after service of the Order by giving written notice to the Office of Hearings and Appeals that the person to whom a Remedial Order is issued wishes to contest the Order.
(c) The Office of Hearings and Appeals shall promptly advise the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of its receipt of a notice described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d) The Office of Hearings and Appeals may, on a case by case basis, set reasonable time limits for the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission to complete its action on such an appeal proceeding.
(e) In order to exhaust administrative remedies, a person who is entitled to appeal a Remedial Order issued by the Office of Hearings and Appeals must file a timely appeal and await a decision on the merits. Any Remedial Order that is not appealed within the 30-day period shall become effective as a final Order of the DOE and is not subject to review by any court.
§§ 205.199D-205.199E
[Reserved]
§ 205.199F
Ex parte communications.
(a) No person who is not employed or otherwise supervised by the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall submit ex parte communications to the Director or any person employed or otherwise supervised by the Office with respect to any matter involved in Remedial Order or Order of Disallowance proceedings.
(1) Ex parte communications include any ex parte oral or written communications relative to the merits of a Proposed Remedial Order, Interim Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, or Proposed Order of Disallowance proceeding pending before the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The term shall not, however, include requests for status reports, inquiries as to procedures, or the submission of proprietary or confidential information. Notice that proprietary or confidential submissions have been made shall be given to all persons on the official service list.
(b) If any communication occurs that violates the provisions of this section, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall promptly make the substance of the communication available to the public and serve a copy of a written communication or a memorandum summarizing an oral communication to all participants in the affected proceeding. The Office of Hearings and Appeals may also take any other appropriate action to mitigate the adverse impact to any person whose interest may be affected by the ex parte contact.
§ 205.199G
Extension of time; Interim and Ancillary Orders.
The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee may permit upon motion any document or submission referred to in this subpart other than appeals to FERC to be amended or withdrawn after it has been filed or to be filed within a time period different from that specified in this subpart. The Director or his designee may upon motion or on his own initiative issue any interim or ancillary Orders, reconsider any determinations, or make any rulings or determinations that are deemed necessary to ensure that the proceedings specified in this subpart are conducted in an appropriate manner and are not unduly delayed.
§ 205.199H
Actions not subject to administrative appeal.
A Notice of Probable Violation, Notice of Proposed Disallowance, Proposed Remedial Order or Interim Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance issued pursuant to this subpart shall not be an action from which there may be an administrative appeal pursuant to subpart H. In addition, a determination by the Office of Hearings and Appeals that a Remedial Order, an Order of Disallowance, or a Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance should not be issued shall not be appealable pursuant to subpart H.
§ 205.199I
Remedies.
(a) A Remedial Order, a Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, an Order of Disallowance, or a Consent Order may require the person to whom it is directed to roll back prices, to make refunds equal to the amount (plus interest) charged in excess of those amounts permitted under DOE Regulations, to make appropriate compensation to third persons for administrative expenses of effectuating appropriate remedies, and to take such other action as the DOE determines is necessary to eliminate or to compensate for the effects of a violation or any cost disallowance pursuant to § 212.83 or § 212.84. Such action may include a direction to the person to whom the Order is issued to establish an escrow account or take other measures to
make refunds directly to purchasers of the products involved, notwithstanding the fact that those purchasers obtained such products from an intermediate distributor of such person's products, and may require as part of the remedy that the person to whom the Order is issued maintain his prices at certain designated levels, notwithstanding the presence or absence of other regulatory controls on such person's prices. In cases where purchasers cannot be reasonably identified or paid or where the amount of each purchaser's overcharge is incapable of reasonable determination, the DOE may refund the amounts received in such cases directly to the Treasury of the United States on behalf of such purchasers.
(b) The DOE may, when appropriate, issue final Orders ancillary to a Remedial Order, Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, Order of Disallowance, or Consent Order requiring that a direct or indirect recipient of a refund pass through, by such means as the DOE deems appropriate, including those described in paragraph (a) of this section, all or a portion of the refund, on a pro rata basis, to those customers of the recipient who were adversely affected by the initial overcharge. Ancillary Orders may be appealed to the Office of Hearings and Appeals only pursuant to subpart H.
§ 205.199J
Consent order.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, the DOE may at any time resolve an outstanding compliance investigation or proceeding, or a proceeding involving the disallowance of costs pursuant to § 205.199E with a Consent Order. A Consent Order must be signed by the person to whom it is issued, or a duly authorized representative, and must indicate agreement to the terms contained therein. A Consent Order need not constitute an admission by any person that DOE regulations have been violated, nor need it constitute a finding by the DOE that such person has violated DOE regulations. A Consent Order shall, however, set forth the relevant facts which form the basis for the Order.
(b) A Consent Order is a final Order of the DOE having the same force and effect as a Remedial Order issued pursuant to § 205.199B or an Order of Disallowance issued pursuant to § 205.199E, and may require one or more of the remedies authorized by § 205.199I and § 212.84(d)(3). A Consent Order becomes effective no sooner than 30 days after publication under paragraph (c) of this section, unless (1) the DOE makes a Consent Order effective immediately, because it expressly deems it necessary in the public interest, or (2) the Consent Order involves a sum of less than $500,000 in the aggregate, excluding penalties and interest, in which case it will be effective when signed both by the person to whom it is issued and the DOE, and will not be subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section unless the DOE determines otherwise. A Consent Order shall not be appealable pursuant to the provisions of § 205.199C or § 205.199D and subpart H, and shall contain an express waiver of such appeal or judicial review rights as might otherwise attach to a final Order of the DOE.
(c) When a Consent Order has been signed, both by the person to whom it is issued and the DOE, the DOE will publish notice of such Consent Order in the
Federal Register
and in a press release to be issued simultaneously therewith. The
Federal Register
notice and the press release will state at a minimum the name of the company concerned, a brief summary of the Consent Order and other facts or allegations relevant thereto, the address and telephone number of the DOE office at which copies of the Consent Order will be available free of charge, the address to which comments on the Consent Order will be received by the DOE, and the date by which such comments should be submitted, which date will not be less than 30 days after publication of the
Federal Register
notice. After the expiration of the comment period the DOE may withdraw its agreement to the Consent Order, attempt to negotiate a modification of the Consent Order, or issue the Consent Order as signed. The DOE will publish in the
Federal Register,
and by press release, notice of any action taken on a Consent Order and such explanation of
the action taken as deemed appropriate. The provisions of this paragraph shall be applicable notwithstanding the fact that a Consent Order may have been made immediately effective pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section (except in cases where the Consent Order involves sums of less than $500,000 in the aggregate, excluding penalties and interest).
(d) At any time and in accordance with the procedures of subpart J, a Consent Order may be modified or rescinded, upon petition by the person to whom the Consent Order was issued, and may be rescinded by the DOE upon discovery of new evidence which is materially inconsistent with evidence upon which the DOE's acceptance of the Consent Order was based. Modifications of a Consent Order which is subject to public comment under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, which in the opinion of the DOE significantly change the terms or the impact of the original Order, shall be republished under the provisions of that paragraph.
(e) Notwithstanding the issuance of a Consent Order, the DOE may seek civil or criminal penalties or compromise civil penalties pursuant to subpart P concerning matters encompassed by the Consent Order, unless the Consent Order by its terms expressly precludes the DOE from so doing.
(f) If at any time after a Consent Order becomes effective it appears to the DOE that the terms of the Consent Order have been violated, the DOE may refer such violations to the Department of Justice for appropriate action in accordance with subpart P.

§ 205.280
Purpose and scope.
This subpart establishes special procedures pursuant to which refunds may be made to injured persons in order to remedy the effects of a violation of the regulations of the Department of Energy. This subpart shall be applicable to those situations in which the Department of Energy is unable to readily identify persons who are entitled to
refunds specified in a Remedial Order, a Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, an Order of Disallowance or a Consent Order, or to readily ascertain the amounts that such persons are entitled to receive.
§ 205.281
Petition for implementation of special refund procedures.
(a) At any time after the issuance of a Remedial Order (including for purposes of this subpart a Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance and an Order of Disallowance), or a Consent Order, the Special Counsel of the Department of Energy, the ERA Office of Enforcement, or any other enforcement official of the Department of Energy may file with the Office of Hearings and Appeals a Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures.
(b) The Petition shall state that the person filing it has been unable readily either to identify the persons who are entitled to refunds to be remitted pursuant to a Remedial Order or a Consent Order or to ascertain the amounts of refunds that such persons are entitled to receive. The Petition shall request that the Office of Hearings and Appeals institute appropriate proceedings under this subpart to distribute the funds referred to in the enforcement documents.
(c) The Petition shall contain a copy of each relevant enforcement document, shall be filed in duplicate, and shall meet the requirements of § 205.9 of this part.
§ 205.282
Evaluation of petition by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.
(a) After considering the Petition, the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee shall issue a Proposed Decision and Order. The Proposed Decision and Order shall generally describe the nature of the particular refund proceeding and shall set forth the standards and procedures that the Office of Hearings and Appeals intends to apply in evaluating refund claims.
(b) The Proposed Decision and Order shall be published in the
Federal Register
together with a statement that any member of the public may submit written comments to the Office of Hearings and Appeals with respect to the matter. At least 30 days following publication in the
Federal Register
shall be provided for the submission of comments.
(c) After considering the comments submitted, the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee shall issue a final Decision and Order which shall govern the disposition of the refunds. The final Decision and Order shall also be published in the
Federal Register.
(d) The final Decision and Order shall set forth the standards and procedures that will be used in evaluating individual Applications for Refunds and distributing the refund amount. Those standards and procedures shall be consistent with the provisions of this subpart.
(e) In establishing standards and procedures for implementing refund distributions, the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall take into account the desirability of distributing the refunds in an efficient, effective and equitable manner and resolving to the maximum extent practicable all outstanding claims. In order to do so, the standards for evaluation of individual claims may be based upon appropriate presumptions.
§ 205.283
Applications for refund.
(a) Any person entitled to a refund pursuant to a final Decision and Order issued pursuant to § 205.282 may file an Application for Refund. All Applications must be signed by the applicant and specify the DOE order to which they pertain. Any Application for a refund in excess of $100 must be file in duplicate, and a copy of that Application will be available for public inspection in the DOE Public Docket Room at 2000 M Street, NW., Washington, DC. Any applicant who believes that his Application contains confidential information must so indicate on the first page of his Application and submit two additional copies of his Application from which the information that the applicant claims is confidential has been deleted, together with a statement specifying why any such information is privileged or confidential.
(b) The contents of an Application for Refund shall be specified in the final
Decision and Order referred to in § 205.282(c). A filing deadline for Applications shall also be specified in the final Decision and Order, and shall be no less than 90 days after the publication of the Order in the
Federal Register.
(c) Each Application shall be in writing and signed by the applicant, and shall indicate whether the applicant or any person acting on his instructions has filed or intends to file any other Application or claim of whatever nature regarding the matters at issue in the underlying enforcement proceeding. Each Application shall also include a sworn statement by the applicant that all information in his Application is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief.
§ 205.284
Processing of applications.
(a) The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals may appoint an administrator to evaluate Applications under guidelines established by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The administrator, if he is not a Federal Government employee, may be compensated from the funds referred to in the Remedial Order or Consent Order. The administrator may design and distribute an optional application form for the convenience of the applicants.
(b) The Office of Hearings and Appeals or its designee may initiate an investigation of any statement made in an Application and may require verification of any document submitted in support of a claim. In evaluating an Application, the Office of Hearings and Appeals or its designee may solicit and consider information obtained from any source and may on its own initiative convene a hearing or conference, if it determines that a hearing or conference will advance its evaluation of an Application.
(c) The Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee shall conduct any hearing or conference convened with respect to an Application for Refund and shall specify the time and place for the hearing or conference and notify the applicant. The official conducting the hearing may administer oaths and affirmations, rule on the presentation of information, receive relevant information, dispose of procedural requests, determine the format of the hearing and otherwise regulate the course of the hearing. The provisions of § 205.8 of this part which relate to subpoenas and witness fees shall apply to any hearing convened with respect to an application for refund, except that § 205.8(h) (2), (3) and (4) shall not apply.
(d) Upon consideration of an Application and other relevant information received during the course of a refund proceeding, the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee shall issue an order granting or denying the Application. The order shall contain a concise statement of the relevant facts and the legal basis for the order. A copy of the order, with such modification as is necessary to ensure the confidentiality of information protected from public disclosure by 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be obtained upon request by an applicant or any other person who participated in the proceeding.
§ 205.285
Effect of failure to file a timely application.
An Application for Refund must be filed no later than the date that the Office of Hearings and Appeals establishes pursuant to § 205.283(b). Any Application that is not filed on a timely basis may be summarily dismissed. The Office of Hearings and Appeals or its designee may, however, grant extensions of time for good cause shown.

ERA will determine whether an environmental assessment (EA) or EIS is required within 45 days of the receipt of the Presidential Permit application and of environmental information submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 205.322 (c) and (d). ERA will use these and other sources of information as the basis for making the environmental determination:
(1) If an EIS is determined to be necessary, the applicant shall enter into a contract with an independent third party, which may be a Government-owned, contractor-operated National Laboratory, or a qualified private entity selected by ERA. The third party contractor must be qualified to conduct an environmental review and prepare an EIS, as appropriate, under the supervision of ERA, and may not have a financial or other interest in the outcome of the proceedings. The NEPA process must be completed and approved before ERA will issue a Presidential Permit.
(2) If an EA is determined to be necessary, the applicant may be permitted to prepare an environmental assessment pursuant to 10 CFR 1506.5(b) for review and adoption by ERA, or the applicant may enter into a third party contract as set forth in this section.
(b)
Environmental Review Procedure.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section, environmental documents, including the EIS, where necessary, will be prepared utilizing the process set forth above. ERA, the applicant, and the independent third party, which may be a Government-owned, contractor-operated National Laboratory or a private entity, shall enter into an agreement in which the applicant will engage and pay directly for the services of the qualified third party to prepare the necessary environmental documents. The agreement shall outline the responsibilities of each party and its relationship to the other two parties regarding the work to be done or supervised. ERA shall approve the information to be developed and supervise the gathering, analysis
and presentation of the information. In addition, ERA will have the authority to approve and modify any statement, analysis, and conclusion contained in the environmental documents prepared by the third party. Before commencing preparation of the environmental document the third party will execute an ERA-prepared disclosure document stating that it does not have any conflict of interest, financial or otherwise, in the outcome of either the environmental process or the Permit application.
(c)
Financial Hardship.
Whenever ERA determines that a project is no longer economically feasible, or that a substantial financial burden would be imposed by the applicant bearing all of the costs of the NEPA studies, ERA may waive the requirement set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and perform the necessary environmental review, completely or in part, with its own resources.
(d)
Discussions Prior to Filing.
Prior to the preparation of any Presidential Permit application and environmental report, a potential applicant is encouraged to contact ERA and each affected State public utility regulatory agency to discuss the scope of the proposed project and the potential for joint State and Federal environmental review.

ERA will use these and other sources of information as the basis for making the environmental determination.
(2) If an EIS is determined to be necessary, ERA will notify the applicant of the fee for completing the EIS within 90 days after the submission of the application and environmental information. The fee shall be based on the expenses estimated to be incurred by DOE in contracting to prepare the EIS (
i.e.,
the estimated fee charges to ERA by the contractor). DOE employee salaries and other fixed costs, as set forth in OMB Circular A-25, shall not be included in the applicant's fee. Fee payment shall be by check, draft, or money order payable to the Treasurer of the United States, and shall be submitted to ERA. Upon submission of fifty percent of the environmental fee, ERA will provide to the applicant a tentative schedule for completion of the EIS.

(1) 50 percent of the total amount due to be paid within 30 days of receipt of the fee information from DOE;
(2) 25 percent to be paid upon publication of the draft EIS; and
(3) 25 percent to be paid upon publication of the final EIS.
If costs are less than the amount collected, ERA will refund to the applicant the excess fee collected. If costs exceed the initial fee, ERA will fund the balance, unless the increase in costs is caused by actions or inactions of the applicant, such as the applicant's failure to submit necessary environmental information in a timely fashion. If the application is withdrawn at any stage prior to issuance of the final EIS, the fee will be adjusted to reflect the costs actually incurred; payment shall be made by the applicant within 30 days of above referenced events.
(e)
Federal Exemption.
Upon a showing by the applicant that it is engaged in the transaction of official business of the Federal Government in filing an application pursuant to 10 CFR 205.320

Sections 205.370 through 205.379 appear at 46 FR 39987, Aug. 6, 1981, unless otherwise noted.
§ 205.370
Applicability.
Sections 202(c) and 202(d) of the Federal Power Act are applicable to any “entity” which owns or operates electric power generation, transmission or distribution facilities. An “entity” is a private or public corporation (utility), a governmental agency, a municipality, a cooperative or a lawful association of the foregoing. Under this section, the DOE has the authority to order the temporary connection of facilities, or the generation or delivery of electricity, which it deems necessary to alleviate an emergency. Such orders shall be effective for the time specified and will be subject to the terms and conditions the DOE specifies. The DOE retains the right to cancel, modify or otherwise change any order, with or without notice, hearing, or report. Requests for action under these regulations will be accepted from any “entity,” State Public Utility Commission, State Energy Agency, or State Governor. Actions under these regulations also may be initiated by the DOE on its own motion. Orders under this authority may be made effective without prior notice.
§ 205.371
Definition of emergency.
“Emergency,” as used herein, is defined as an unexpected inadequate supply of electric energy which may result from the unexpected outage or breakdown of facilities for the generation, transmission or distribution of electric power. Such events may be the result of weather conditions, acts of God, or unforeseen occurrences not reasonably within the power of the affected “entity” to prevent. An emergency also can result from a sudden increase in customer demand, an inability to obtain adequate amounts of the necessary fuels to generate electricity, or a regulatory action which prohibits the use of certain electric power supply facilities. Actions under this authority are envisioned as meeting a specific inadequate power supply situation. Extended periods of insufficient power supply as a result of inadequate planning or the failure to construct necessary facilities can result in an emergency as contemplated in these regulations. In such cases, the impacted “entity” will be expected to make firm arrangements to resolve the problem until new facilities become available, so that a continuing emergency order is not needed. Situations where a shortage of electric energy is projected due solely to the failure of parties to agree to terms, conditions or other economic factors relating to service, generally will not be considered as emergencies unless the inability to supply electric service is imminent. Where an electricity outage or service inadequacy qualifies for a section 202(c) order, contractual difficulties alone will not be sufficient to preclude the issuance of an emergency order.
§ 205.372
Filing procedures; number of copies.
An original and two conformed copies of the applications and reports required under §§ 205.370 through 205.379 shall be filed with the Division of Power Supply and Reliability, Department of Energy. Copies of all documents also shall be served on:

(n) An estimate of the construction costs of any proposed temporary facilities and a statement estimating the expected operation and maintenance costs on an annualized basis. (Not required on section 202(d) applications.)
(o) Applicants may be required to furnish such supplemental information as the DOE may deem pertinent.
§ 205.374
Responses from “entities” designated in the application.
Each “entity” designated as a potential source of emergency assistance or as a potential supplier of transmission services and which has received a copy of the application under § 205.373, shall have three (3) calendar days from the time of receipt of the application to file the information designated below with the DOE. The DOE will grant extensions of the filing period when appropriate. The designated “entities” shall provide an analysis of the impact the requested action would have on its system reliability and its ability to supply its own interruptible and firm customers. The effects of the requested action on the ability to serve firm loads shall be clearly distinguished from the ability to serve contractually interruptible loads. The designated “entity” also may provide other information relevant to the requested action, which is not included in the reliability analysis. Copies of any response shall be provided to the applicant, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any State Regulatory Agency having responsibility for service standards or rates of any “entity” that may be directly involved in the proposed action, and the appropriate Regional Electric Reliability Council. Pursuant to section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, DOE may issue an emergency order even though a designated “entity” has failed to file a timely response.
§ 205.375
Guidelines defining inadequate fuel or energy supply.
An inadequate utility system fuel inventory or energy supply is a matter of managerial and engineering judgment based on such factors as fuels in stock, fuels en route, transportation time, and constraints on available storage facilities. A system may be considered to have an inadequate fuel or energy supply capability when, combined with other conditions, the projected energy deficiency upon the applicant's system without emergency action by the DOE, will equal or exceed 10 percent of the applicant's then normal daily net energy for load, or will cause the applicant to be unable to meet its normal peak load requirements based upon use of all of its otherwise available resources so that it is unable to supply adequate electric service to its ultimate customers. The following conditions will be considered in determining that a system has inadequate fuel or energy supply capability:
(1) System coal stocks are reduced to 30 days (or less) of normal burn days and a continued downward trend in stock is projected;
(2) System residual oil stocks are reduced to 15 days (or less) of normal burn days and a continued downward trend in stocks is projected;
(3) System distillate oil stocks which cannot be replaced by alternate fuels are reduced to 15 days (or less) of normal burn days and a continued downward trend in stocks is projected;
(4) System natural gas deliveries which cannot be replaced by alternate fuels have been or will be reduced 20 percent below normal requirements and no improvement in natural gas deliveries is projected within 30 days;
(5) Delays in nuclear fuel deliveries will extend a scheduled refueling shutdown by more than 30 days; and
(6) Water supplies required for power generation have been reduced to the level where the future adequacy of the power supply may be endangered and no near term improvement in water supplies is projected.
The use of the prescribed criteria does not preclude an applicant from claiming the existence of an emergency when its stocks of fuel or water exceed the amounts and time frames specified above.
§ 205.376
Rates and charges.
The applicant and the generating or transmitting systems from which emergency service is requested are encouraged to utilize the rates and charges contained in approved existing rate schedules or to negotiate mutually satisfactory rates for the proposed
transactions. In the event that the DOE determines that an emergency exists under section 202(c), and the “entities” are unable to agree on the rates to be charged, the DOE shall prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issues to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for determination by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures.
§ 205.377
Reports.
In addition to the information specified below, the DOE may require additional reports as it deems necessary.
(a) Where the DOE has authorized the temporary connection of transmission facilities, all “entities” whose transmission facilities are thus temporarily interconnected shall report the following information to the DOE within 15 days following completion of the interconnection:
(1) The date the temporary interconnection was completed;
(2) The location of the interconnection;
(3) A description of the interconnection; and
(4) A one-line electric diagram of the interconnection.
(b) Where the DOE orders the transfer of power, the “entity” receiving such service shall report the following information to the DOE by the 10th of each month for the preceding month's activity for as long as such order shall remain in effect:
(1) Amounts of capacity and/or energy received each day;
(2) The name of the supplier;
(3) The name of any “entity” supplying transmission services; and
(4) Preliminary estimates of the associated costs.
(c) Where the DOE has approved the installation of permanent facilities that will be used only during emergencies, any use of such facilities shall be reported to the DOE within 24 hours. Details of such usage shall be furnished as deemed appropriate by the DOE after such notification.
(d) Any substantial change in the information provided under § 205.373 shall be promptly reported to the DOE.

§ 205.378
Disconnection of temporary facilities.
Upon the termination of any emergency for the mitigation of which the DOE ordered the construction of temporary facilities, such facilities shall be disconnected and any temporary construction removed or otherwise disposed of, unless application is made as provided in § 205.379 for permanent connection for emergency use. This disconnection and removal of temporary facilities shall be accomplished within 30 days of the termination of the emergency unless an extension is granted by the DOE. The DOE shall be notified promptly when such removal of facilities is completed.
§ 205.379
Application for approval of the installation of permanent facilities for emergency use only.
Application for DOE approval of a permanent connection for emergency use only shall conform with the requirements in § 205.373. However, the baseline data specified in § 205.373(d) need not be included in an application made under this section. In addition, the application shall state in full the reasons why such permanent connection for emergency use is in the public interest.

(a)
Purpose and scope.
(1) This section establishes the procedures for determining the nature and extent of violations of this subpart and the procedures for issuance of a notice of probable violation, a remedial order or a remedial order for immediate compliance.
(2) When the DOE discovers that there is reason to believe a violation of any provision of this subpart, or any order issued thereunder, has occurred, is continuing or is about to occur, the DOE may conduct proceedings to determine the nature and extent of the violation and may issue a remedial order thereafter. The DOE may commence such proceeding by serving a notice of probable violation or by issuing a remedial order for immediate compliance.
(b)
Notice of probable violation.
(1) The DOE may begin a proceeding under this subpart by issuing a notice of probable violation if the DOE has reason to believe that a violation has occurred, is continuing, or is about to occur.
(2) Within 10 days of the service of a notice of probable violation, the person upon whom the notice is served may file a reply with the DOE office that issued the notice of probable violation at the address provided in § 205.12 of this chapter. The DOE may extend the 10-day period for good cause shown.
(3) The reply shall be in writing and signed by the person filing it. The reply shall contain a full and complete statement of all relevant facts pertaining to the act or transaction that is the subject of the notice of probable violation. Such facts shall include a complete statement of the business or other reasons that justify the act or transaction, it appropriate; a detailed description of the act or transaction; and a full discussion of the pertinent provisions and relevant facts reflected in any documents submitted with the reply. Copies of all relevant documents shall be submitted with the reply.
(4) The reply shall include a discussion of all relevant authorities, including, but not limited to, DOE rulings, regulations, interpretations, and decisions on appeals and exceptions relied upon to support the particular position taken.
(5) The reply should indicate whether the person requests or intends to request a conference regarding the notice. Any request not made at the time of the reply shall be made as soon thereafter as possible to insure that the conference is held when it will be most beneficial. A request for a conference must conform to the requirements of subpart M of part 205 of this chapter.
(6) If a person has not filed a reply with the DOE within the 10-day period provided, and the DOE has not extended the 10-day period, the person shall be deemed to have conceded the accuracy of the factual allegations and legal conclusions stated in the notice of probable violation.
(7) If the DOE finds, after the 10-day period provided in § 207.6(b)(2), that no violation has occurred, is continuing, or is about to occur, or that for any reason the issuance of a remedial order would not be appropriate, it shall notify, in writing, the person to whom a notice of probable violation has been issued that the notice is rescinded.
(c)
Remedial order.
(1) If the DOE finds, after the 10-day period provided in § 207.6(b)(2), that a violation has occurred, is continuing, or is about to occur, the DOE may issue a remedial
order. The order shall include a written opinion setting forth the relevant facts and the legal basis of the remedial order.
(2) A remedial order issued under this subpart shall be effective upon issuance, in accordance with its terms, until stayed, suspended, modified or rescinded. The DOE may stay, suspend, modify or rescind a remedial order on its own initiative or upon application by the person to whom the remedial order is issued. Such action and application shall be in accordance with the procedures for such proceedings provided for in part 205 of this chapter.
(3) A remedial order may be referred at any time to the Department of Justice for appropriate action in accordance with § 207.7.
(d)
Remedial order for immediate compliance.
(1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the DOE may issue a remedial order for immediate compliance, which shall be effective upon issuance and until rescinded or suspended, if it finds:
(i) There is a strong probability that a violation has occurred, is continuing or is about to occur;
(ii) Irreparable harm will occur unless the violation is remedied immediately; and
(iii) The public interest requires the avoidance of such irreparable harm through immediate compliance and waiver of the procedures afforded under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(2) A remedial order for immediate compliance shall be served promptly upon the person against whom such order is issued by telex or telegram, with a copy served by registered or certified mail. The copy shall contain a written statement of the relevant facts and the legal basis for the remedial order for immediate compliance, including the findings required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(3) The DOE may rescind or suspend a remedial order for immediate compliance if it appears that the criteria set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section are no longer satisfied. When appropriate, however, such a suspension or rescission may be accompanied by a notice of probable violation issued under paragraph (b) of this section.
(4) If at any time in the course of a proceeding commenced by a notice of probable violation the criteria set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section are satisfied, the DOE may issue a remedial order for immediate compliance, even if the 10-day period for reply specified in § 207.6(b)(2) of this part has not expired.
(5) At any time after a remedial order for immediate compliance has become effective the DOE may refer such order to the Department of Justice for appropriate action in accordance with § 207.7 of this part.
(e)
Remedies.
A remedial order or a remedial order for immediate compliance may require the person to whom it is directed to take such action as the DOE determines is necessary to eliminate or to compensate for the effects of a violation.
(f)
Appeal.
(1) No notice of probable violation issued pursuant to this subpart shall be deemed to be an action of which there may be an administrative appeal.
(2) Any person to whom a remedial order or a remedial order for immediate compliance is issued under this subpart may file an appeal with the DOE Office of Exceptions and Appeals in accordance with the procedures for such appeal provided in subpart H of part 205 of this chapter. The appeal must be filed within 10 days of service of the order from which the appeal is taken.
§ 207.7
Sanctions.
(a)
General.
(1) Penalties and sanctions shall be deemed cumulative and not mutually exclusive.
(2) Each day that a violation of the provisions of this subpart or any order issued pursuant thereto continues shall be deemed to constitute a separate violation within the meaning of the provisions of this subpart relating to criminal fines and civil penalties.
(b)
Criminal penalties.
Any person who willfully violates any provision of this subpart or any order issued pursuant thereto shall be subject to a fine of not more than $5,000 for each violation. Criminal violations are prosecuted by the Department of Justice upon referral by the DOE.

(b)
Injunctions.

However, after completing all such payments, a firm shall maintain all records described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section until one of the following: Six months after the firm completes all such payments, unless this period is extended on a firm-by-firm basis; the end of the individual firm's extension; or the firm is notified in writing that its records are no longer needed.
(3)(i) Those firms with completed audits in which DOE has not yet made a determination to initiate a formal enforcement action and firms under audit which do not have outstanding subpoenas. Any such firm shall maintain all records for the period covered by the audit including all records necessary to establish historical prices or volumes which serve as the basis for determining the lawful prices or volumes for any subsequent regulated transaction which is subject to audit, until one of the following: June 30, 1985, unless this period is extended on a firm-by-firm basis; the end of the individual firm's extension; or the firm is notified in writing by DOE that its records are no longer needed. However, if a firm in this group shall become a party in litigation, the firm shall then be subject to the recordkeeping requirements for firms in litigation set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(ii) Those firms under audit which have outstanding subpoenas on February 5, 1985, or which receive subpoenas at any time thereafter or which have supplied records for an audit as the result of a subpoena enforced after November 1, 1983. Any such firm shall remain subject to paragraph (a) of this section until two years after ERA has notified the firm in writing that is in full compliance with the subpoena or until ERA has received from the firm a sworn certification of compliance with the subpoena as required by 10 CFR 205.8. However, if a firm in this group shall become a party in litigation, the firm shall then be subject to the recordkeeping requirements for firms in litigation set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(4) Those firms which are subject to requests for data necessary to verify that crude oil qualifies as “newly discovered” crude oil under 10 CFR 212.79. Any such firm shall maintain the records evidencing such data until one
of the following: June 30, 1985, unless this period is extended on a firm-by-firm basis; the end of an individual firm's extension; or the firm is notified in writing by DOE that its records are no longer needed. However, if a firm in this group shall become a party in litigation, the firm shall then be subject to the recordkeeping requirements for firms in litigation set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(5) Those firms whose records are determined by DOE as necessary to complete the enforcement activity relating to another firm which is also subject to paragraph (a) of this section unless such firms required to keep records have received certified notice letters specifically describing the records determined as necessary. At that time, the specific notice will control the recordkeeping requirements. These firms have been identified in appendix A. Any such firm shall maintain these records until one of the following: June 30, 1985, unless this period is extended on a firm-by-firm basis; the end of the individual firm's extension; or the firm is notified in writing by DOE that its records are no longer needed.
(6) Those firms which participated in the Entitlements program. Any such firm shall maintain its Entitlements-related records until six months after the final judicial resolution (including any and all appeals) of
Texaco
v.
DOE,
Nos. 84-391, 84-410, and 84-456 (D. Del.), or the firm is notified by DOE that its records are no longer needed, whichever occurs first.
(c) For purposes of this section:
(1) A firm is “a party in litigation” if:
(i)(A) The firm has received a Notice of Probable Violation, a Notice of Probable Disallowance, a Proposed Remedial Order, or a Proposed Order of Disallowance; or
(B) The firm and DOE are parties in a lawsuit arising under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, as amended (15 U.S.C. 751

(ii)(A) There has been no final (that is, non-appealable) administrative or judicial resolution, or
(B) DOE has not informed the firm in writing that the Department has completed its review of the matter.
(2) A firm means any association, company, corporation, estate, individual, joint-venture, partnership, or sole proprietorship, or any other entity, however organized, including charitable, educational, or other eleemosynary institutions, and state and local governments. A firm includes a parent and the consolidated and unconsolidated entities (if any) which it directly or indirectly controls.

§ 216.1
Introduction.
(a) This part describes and establishes the procedures to be used by the Department of Energy (DOE) in considering and making certain findings required by section 101(c)(2)(A) of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, 50 U.S.C. app. 2071(c)(2)(A) (DPA). Section 101(c) authorizes the allocation of, or priority performance under contracts or orders (other than contracts of employment) relating to, materials and equipment, services, or facilities in order to maximize domestic energy supplies if the findings described in section 101(c)(2) are made. Among these findings are that such supplies of materials and equipment, services, or facilities are critical and essential to maintain or further exploration, production, refining, transportation or the conservation of energy supplies or for the construction or maintenance of energy facilities. The function of finding that supplies are critical and essential was delegated to the Secretary of Energy pursuant to E.O. 12919 (59 FR 29525, June 7, 1994) and Department of Commerce Defense Priorities and Allocations System Delegation No. 2, 15 CFR part 700.
(b) The purpose of these regulations is to establish the procedures and criteria to be used by DOE in determining whether programs or projects maximize domestic energy supplies and whether or not supplies of materials and equipment, services, or facilities are critical and essential, as required by DPA section 101(c)(2)(A). The critical and essential finding will be made only for supplies of materials and equipment, services, or facilities related to those programs or projects determined by DOE to maximize domestic energy supplies. These regulations do not require or imply that the findings, on which the exercise of such authority is conditioned, will be made in any particular case.
(c) If DOE determines that a program or project maximizes domestic energy supplies and finds that supplies of materials and equipment, services, or facilities are critical and essential to maintain or further the exploration, production, refining, transportation or conservation of energy supplies or for the construction or maintenance of energy facilities, such determination and finding will be communicated to the Department of Commerce (DOC). If not, the applicant will be so informed. If the determination and finding described in this paragraph are made, DOC, pursuant to DPA section 101(c) and section 203 of E.O. 12919, will find whether or not: The supplies of materials and equipment, services, or facilities in question are scarce; and maintenance or furtherance of exploration, production, refining, transportation, or conservation of energy supplies or the construction or maintenance of energy facilities cannot be reasonably accomplished without exercising the authority specified in DPA section 101(c). If these additional two findings are made, DOC will notify DOE, and DOE will inform the applicant that it has been granted the right to use priority ratings under the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) regulation established by the DOC, 15 CFR part 700.

# Subpart C—Placement of Rated Orders
§ 217.30
Delegations of authority.
(a) The priorities and allocations authorities of the President under Title I of the Defense Production Act with respect to all forms of energy have been delegated to the Secretary of Energy under E.O. 12919 of June 3, 1994 (59 FR 29525).
(b) The Department of Commerce has delegated authority to the Department of Energy to provide for extension of priority ratings for “industrial resources,” as provided in § 261.35 of this part, to support rated orders for all forms of energy.
§ 217.31
Priority ratings.
(a) Levels of priority.
(1) There are two levels of priority established by the Energy Priorities and Allocations System regulations, identified by the rating symbols “DO” and “DX”.
(2) All DO-rated orders have equal priority with each other and take precedence over unrated orders. All DX-rated orders have equal priority with each other and take precedence over DO-rated orders and unrated orders. (For resolution of conflicts among rated orders of equal priority, see § 217.34(c).)
(3) In addition, a Directive regarding priority treatment for a given item issued by the Department of Energy for that item takes precedence over any DX-rated order, DO-rated order, or unrated order, as stipulated in the Directive. (For a full discussion of Directives, see § 217.62.)
(b) Program identification symbols. Program identification symbols indicate which approved program is being supported by a rated order. The list of currently approved programs and their identification symbols are listed in Schedule 1, set forth as an appendix to 15 CFR part 700. For example, DO-F3 identifies a domestic energy construction program. Additional programs may be approved under the procedures of E.O. 12919 at any time. Program identification symbols do not connote any priority.
(c) Priority ratings. A priority rating consists of the rating symbol—DO or DX—and the program identification symbol, such as F1, F2, or F3. Thus, a contract for a domestic energy construction program will contain a DO-F3 or DX-F3 priority rating.
§ 217.32
Elements of a rated order.
Each rated order must include:
(a) The appropriate priority rating (
e.g.
DO-F1 or DX-F1)
(b) A required delivery date or dates. The words “immediately” or “as soon as possible” do not constitute a delivery date. A “requirements contract”,
“basic ordering agreement”, “prime vendor contract”, or similar procurement document bearing a priority rating may contain no specific delivery date or dates and may provide for the furnishing of items or service from time to time or within a stated period against specific purchase orders, such as “calls”, “requisitions”, and “delivery orders”. These purchase orders must specify a required delivery date or dates and are to be considered as rated as of the date of their receipt by the supplier and not as of the date of the original procurement document;
(c) The written signature on a manually placed order, or the digital signature or name on an electronically placed order, of an individual authorized to sign rated orders for the person placing the order. The signature or use of the name certifies that the rated order is authorized under this part and that the requirements of this part are being followed; and
(d)(1) A statement that reads in substance:
This is a rated order certified for national defense use, and you are required to follow all the provisions of the Energy Priorities and Allocations System regulation at 10 CFR part 217.
(2) If the rated order is placed in support of emergency preparedness requirements and expedited action is necessary and appropriate to meet these requirements, the following sentences should be added following the statement set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section:
This rated order is placed for the purpose of emergency preparedness. It must be accepted or rejected within 2 days after receipt of the order if (1) The order is issued in response to a hazard that has occurred; or
(2) If the order is issued to prepare for an imminent hazard, as specified in EPAS Section 217.33(e), 10 CFR 217.33(e).
§ 217.33
Acceptance and rejection of rated orders.
(a)
Mandatory acceptance.
(1) Except as otherwise specified in this section, a person shall accept every rated order received and must fill such orders regardless of any other rated or unrated orders that have been accepted.
(2) A person shall not discriminate against rated orders in any manner such as by charging higher prices or by imposing different terms and conditions than for comparable unrated orders.
(b)
Mandatory rejection.
Unless otherwise directed by the Department of Energy for a rated order involving all forms of energy:
(1) A person shall not accept a rated order for delivery on a specific date if unable to fill the order by that date. However, the person must inform the customer of the earliest date on which delivery can be made and offer to accept the order on the basis of that date. Scheduling conflicts with previously accepted lower rated or unrated orders are not sufficient reason for rejection under this section.
(2) A person shall not accept a DO-rated order for delivery on a date which would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DO- or DX-rated orders. However, the person must offer to accept the order based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.
(3) A person shall not accept a DX-rated order for delivery on a date which would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DX-rated orders, but must offer to accept the order based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.
(4) If a person is unable to fill all of the rated orders of equal priority status received on the same day, the person must accept, based upon the earliest delivery dates, only those orders which can be filled, and reject the other orders. For example, a person must accept order A requiring delivery on December 15 before accepting order B requiring delivery on December 31. However, the person must offer to accept the rejected orders based on the earliest delivery dates otherwise possible.
(c)
Optional rejection.
Unless otherwise directed by the Department of Energy for a rated order involving all forms of energy, rated orders may be rejected in any of the following cases as long as a supplier does not discriminate among customers:
(1) If the person placing the order is unwilling or unable to meet regularly established terms of sale or payment;
(2) If the order is for an item not supplied or for a service not capable of being performed;
(3) If the order is for an item or service produced, acquired, or provided only for the supplier's own use for which no orders have been filled for two years prior to the date of receipt of the rated order. If, however, a supplier has sold some of these items or provided similar services, the supplier is obligated to accept rated orders up to that quantity or portion of production or service, whichever is greater, sold or provided within the past two years;
(4) If the person placing the rated order, other than the U.S. Government, makes the item or performs the service being ordered;
(5) If acceptance of a rated order or performance against a rated order would violate any other regulation, official action, or order of the Department of Energy, issued under the authority of the Defense Production Act or another relevant statute.
(d)
Customer notification requirements.
(1) Except as provided in this paragraph, a person must accept or reject a rated order in writing or electronically within fifteen (15) working days after receipt of a DO rated order and within ten (10) working days after receipt of a DX rated order. If the order is rejected, the person must give reasons in writing or electronically for the rejection.
(2) If a person has accepted a rated order and subsequently finds that shipment or performance will be delayed, the person must notify the customer immediately, give the reasons for the delay, and advise of a new shipment or performance date. If notification is given verbally, written or electronic confirmation must be provided within five (5) working days.
(e)
Exception for emergency preparedness conditions.
If the rated order is placed for the purpose of emergency preparedness, a person must accept or reject a rated order and transmit the acceptance or rejection in writing or in an electronic format within 2 days after receipt of the order if:
(1) The order is issued in response to a hazard that has occurred; or
(2) The order is issued to prepare for an imminent hazard.
§ 217.34
Preferential scheduling.
(a) A person must schedule operations, including the acquisition of all needed production items or services, in a timely manner to satisfy the delivery requirements of each rated order. Modifying production or delivery schedules is necessary only when required delivery dates for rated orders cannot otherwise be met.
(b) DO-rated orders must be given production preference over unrated orders, if necessary to meet required delivery dates, even if this requires the diversion of items being processed or ready for delivery or services being performed against unrated orders. Similarly, DX-rated orders must be given preference over DO-rated orders and unrated orders. (Examples: If a person receives a DO-rated order with a delivery date of June 3 and if meeting that date would mean delaying production or delivery of an item for an unrated order, the unrated order must be delayed. If a DX-rated order is received calling for delivery on July 15 and a person has a DO-rated order requiring delivery on June 2 and operations can be scheduled to meet both deliveries, there is no need to alter production schedules to give any additional preference to the DX-rated order.)
(c) Conflicting rated orders.
(1) If a person finds that delivery or performance against any accepted rated orders conflicts with the delivery or performance against other accepted rated orders of equal priority status, the person shall give precedence to the conflicting orders in the sequence in which they are to be delivered or performed (not to the receipt dates). If the conflicting orders are scheduled to be delivered or performed on the same day, the person shall give precedence to those orders that have the earliest receipt dates.
(2) If a person is unable to resolve rated order delivery or performance conflicts under this section, the person should promptly seek special priorities assistance as provided in §§ 217.40 through 217.44. If the person's customer objects to the rescheduling of delivery
or performance of a rated order, the customer should promptly seek special priorities assistance as provided in §§ 217.40 through 217.44. For any rated order against which delivery or performance will be delayed, the person must notify the customer as provided in § 217.33.
(d) If a person is unable to purchase needed production items in time to fill a rated order by its required delivery date, the person must fill the rated order by using inventoried production items. A person who uses inventoried items to fill a rated order may replace those items with the use of a rated order as provided in § 217.37(b).
§ 217.35
Extension of priority ratings.
(a) A person must use rated orders with suppliers to obtain items or services needed to fill a rated order. The person must use the priority rating indicated on the customer's rated order, except as otherwise provided in this part or as directed by the Department of Energy. For example, if a person is in receipt of a DO-F1 rated order for an electric power sub-station, and needs to purchase a transformer for its manufacture, that person must use a DO-F1 rated order to obtain the needed transformer.
(b) The priority rating must be included on each successive order placed to obtain items or services needed to fill a customer's rated order. This continues from contractor to subcontractor to supplier throughout the entire procurement chain.
§ 217.36
Changes or cancellations of priority ratings and rated orders.
(a) The priority rating on a rated order may be changed or canceled by:
(1) An official action of the Department of Energy; or
(2) Written notification from the person who placed the rated order.
(b) If an unrated order is amended so as to make it a rated order, or a DO rating is changed to a DX rating, the supplier must give the appropriate preferential treatment to the order as of the date the change is received by the supplier.
(c) An amendment to a rated order that significantly alters a supplier's original production or delivery schedule shall constitute a new rated order as of the date of its receipt. The supplier must accept or reject the amended order according to the provisions of § 217.33.
(d) The following amendments do not constitute a new rated order: a change in shipping destination; a reduction in the total amount of the order; an increase in the total amount of the order which has negligible impact upon deliveries; a minor variation in size or design; or a change which is agreed upon between the supplier and the customer.
(e) If a person no longer needs items or services to fill a rated order, any rated orders placed with suppliers for the items or services, or the priority rating on those orders, must be canceled.
(f) When a priority rating is added to an unrated order, or is changed or canceled, all suppliers must be promptly notified in writing.
§ 217.37
Use of rated orders.
(a) A person must use rated orders to obtain:
(1) Items which will be physically incorporated into other items to fill rated orders, including that portion of such items normally consumed or converted into scrap or by-products in the course of processing;
(2) Containers or other packaging materials required to make delivery of the finished items against rated orders;
(3) Services, other than contracts of employment, needed to fill rated orders; and
(4) MRO needed to produce the finished items to fill rated orders.
(b) A person may use a rated order to replace inventoried items (including finished items) if such items were used to fill rated orders, as follows:
(1) The order must be placed within 90 days of the date of use of the inventory.
(2) A DO rating and the program identification symbol indicated on the customer's rated order must be used on the order. A DX rating may not be used even if the inventory was used to fill a DX-rated order.
(3) If the priority ratings on rated orders from one customer or several customers contain different program identification symbols, the rated orders
may be combined. In this case, the program identification symbol “H1” must be used (
i.e.,
DO-H1).
(c) A person may combine DX- and DO-rated orders from one customer or several customers if the items or services covered by each level of priority are identified separately and clearly. If different program identification symbols are indicated on those rated orders of equal priority, the person must use the program identification symbol “H1” (
i.e.,
DO-H1 or DX-H1).
(d) Combining rated and unrated orders.
(1) A person may combine rated and unrated order quantities on one purchase order provided that:
(i) The rated quantities are separately and clearly identified; and
(ii) The four elements of a rated order, as required by § 217.32, are included on the order with the statement required in § 217.32(d) modified to read in substance:
This purchase order contains rated order quantities certified for national defense use, and you are required to follow all applicable provisions of the Energy Priorities and Allocations System regulations at 10 CFR part 217 only as it pertains to the rated quantities.
(2) A supplier must accept or reject the rated portion of the purchase order as provided in § 217.33 and give preferential treatment only to the rated quantities as required by this part. This part may not be used to require preferential treatment for the unrated portion of the order.
(3) Any supplier who believes that rated and unrated orders are being combined in a manner contrary to the intent of this part or in a fashion that causes undue or exceptional hardship may submit a request for adjustment or exception under § 217.80.
(e) A person may place a rated order for the minimum commercially procurable quantity even if the quantity needed to fill a rated order is less than that minimum. However, a person must combine rated orders as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if possible, to obtain minimum procurable quantities.
(f) A person is not required to place a priority rating on an order for less than $50,000, or one-half of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (as established in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (see FAR section 2.101) or in other authorized acquisition regulatory or management systems) whichever amount is greater, provided that delivery can be obtained in a timely fashion without the use of the priority rating.
§ 217.38
Limitations on placing rated orders.
(a) General limitations.
(1) A person may not place a DO- or DX-rated order unless entitled to do so under this part.
(2) Rated orders may not be used to obtain:
(i) Delivery on a date earlier than needed;
(ii) A greater quantity of the item or services than needed, except to obtain a minimum procurable quantity. Separate rated orders may not be placed solely for the purpose of obtaining minimum procurable quantities on each order;
(iii) Items or services in advance of the receipt of a rated order, except as specifically authorized by the Department of Energy (see § 217.41(c) for information on obtaining authorization for a priority rating in advance of a rated order);
(iv) Items that are not needed to fill a rated order, except as specifically authorized by the Department of Energy, or as otherwise permitted by this part; or
(v) Any of the following items unless specific priority rating authority has been obtained from the Department of Energy, a Delegate Agency, or the Department of Commerce, as appropriate:
(A) Items for plant improvement, expansion, or construction, unless they will be physically incorporated into a construction project covered by a rated order; and
(B) Production or construction equipment or items to be used for the manufacture of production equipment. [For information on requesting priority rating authority, see § 217.21.]
(vi) Any items related to the development of chemical or biological warfare capabilities or the production of chemical or biological weapons, unless such development or production has been
authorized by the President or the Secretary of Defense.
(b) Jurisdictional limitations.
(1) Unless authorized by the resource agency with jurisdiction, the provisions of this part are not applicable to the following resources:
(i) Food resources, food resource facilities, and the domestic distribution of farm equipment and commercial fertilizer (Resource agency with jurisdiction—Department of Agriculture);
(ii) Health resources (Resource agency with jurisdiction—Department of Health and Human Services);
(iii) All forms of civil transportation (Resource agency with jurisdiction—Department of Transportation);
(iv) Water resources (Resource agency with jurisdiction—Department of Defense/U.S. Army Corps of Engineers); and
(v) Communications services (Resource agency with jurisdiction—National Communications System under E. O. 12472 of April 3, 1984).

# Subpart D—Special Priorities Assistance
§ 217.40
General provisions.
(a) The EPAS is designed to be largely self-executing. However, from time-to-time production or delivery problems will arise. In this event, a person should immediately contact the Office of Electricity, for guidance or assistance (Contact the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Department of Energy overseeing the Defense Production Act program, as listed in § 217.93). If the problem(s) cannot otherwise be resolved, special priorities assistance should be sought from the Department of Energy through the Office of Electricity (Contact the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Department of Energy overseeing the Defense Production Act program, as listed in § 217.93). If the Department of Energy is unable to resolve the problem or to authorize the use of a priority rating and believes additional assistance is warranted, the Department of Energy may forward the request to another agency with resource jurisdiction, as appropriate, for action. Special priorities assistance is provided to alleviate problems that do arise.
(b) Special priorities assistance is available for any reason consistent with this part. Generally, special priorities assistance is provided to expedite deliveries, resolve delivery conflicts, place rated orders, locate suppliers, or to verify information supplied by customers and vendors. Special priorities assistance may also be used to request rating authority for items that are not normally eligible for priority treatment.
(c) A request for special priorities assistance or priority rating authority must be submitted on Form DOE F 544 (05-11) (OMB control number 1910-5159) to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Department of Energy overseeing the Defense Production Act program, as listed in § 217.93. Form DOE F 544 (05-11) may be obtained from the Department of Energy or a Delegate Agency. A sample Form DOE F 544 (05-11) is attached at appendix I to this part.
[76 FR 33619, June 9, 2011, as amended at 85 FR 31670, May 27, 2020]
§ 217.41
Requests for priority rating authority.
(a) If a rated order is likely to be delayed because a person is unable to obtain items or services not normally rated under this part, the person may request the authority to use a priority rating in ordering the needed items or services.
(b) Rating authority for production or construction equipment.
(1) A request for priority rating authority for production or construction equipment must be submitted to the U.S. Department of Commerce on Form BIS-999.
(2) When the use of a priority rating is authorized for the procurement of production or construction equipment, a rated order may be used either to purchase or to lease such equipment. However, in the latter case, the equipment may be leased only from a person engaged in the business of leasing such equipment or from a person willing to lease rather than sell.
(c) Rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract. (1) In certain
cases and upon specific request, the Department of Energy, in order to promote the national defense, may authorize or request the Department of Commerce to authorize, as appropriate, a person to place a priority rating on an order to a supplier in advance of the issuance of a rated prime contract. In these instances, the person requesting advance rating authority must obtain sponsorship of the request from the Department of Energy or the appropriate Delegate Agency. The person shall also assume any business risk associated with the placing of rated orders in the event the rated prime contract is not issued.
(2) The person must state the following in the request:
It is understood that the authorization of a priority rating in advance of our receiving a rated prime contract from the Department of Energy and our use of that priority rating with our suppliers in no way commits the Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce, or any other government agency to enter into a contract or order or to expend funds. Further, we understand that the Federal Government shall not be liable for any cancellation charges, termination costs, or other damages that may accrue if a rated prime contract is not eventually placed and, as a result, we must subsequently cancel orders placed with the use of the priority rating authorized as a result of this request.
(3) In reviewing requests for rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract, the Department of Energy or the Department of Commerce, as appropriate, will consider, among other things, the following criteria:
(i) The probability that the prime contract will be awarded;
(ii) The impact of the resulting rated orders on suppliers and on other authorized programs;
(iii) Whether the contractor is the sole source;
(iv) Whether the item being produced has a long lead time;
(v) The time period for which the rating is being requested.
(4) The Department of Energy or the Department of Commerce, as appropriate, may require periodic reports on the use of the rating authority granted under paragraph (c) of this section.
(5) If a rated prime contract is not issued, the person shall promptly notify all suppliers who have received rated orders pursuant to the advanced rating authority that the priority rating on those orders is cancelled.
§ 217.42
Examples of assistance.
(a) While special priorities assistance may be provided for any reason in support of this part, it is usually provided in situations where:
(1) A person is experiencing difficulty in obtaining delivery against a rated order by the required delivery date; or
(2) A person cannot locate a supplier for an item or service needed to fill a rated order.
(b) Other examples of special priorities assistance include:
(1) Ensuring that rated orders receive preferential treatment by suppliers;
(2) Resolving production or delivery conflicts between various rated orders;
(3) Assisting in placing rated orders with suppliers;
(4) Verifying the urgency of rated orders; and
(5) Determining the validity of rated orders.
§ 217.43
Criteria for assistance.
Requests for special priorities assistance should be timely,
i.e.,
the request has been submitted promptly and enough time exists for the Department of Energy, the Delegate Agency, or the Department of Commerce for industrial resources to effect a meaningful resolution to the problem, and must establish that:
(a) There is an urgent need for the item; and
(b) The applicant has made a reasonable effort to resolve the problem.
§ 217.44
Instances where assistance may not be provided.
Special priorities assistance is provided at the discretion of the Department of Energy, the Delegate Agencies, or the Department of Commerce when it is determined that such assistance is warranted to meet the objectives of this part. Examples where assistance may not be provided include situations when a person is attempting to:
(a) Secure a price advantage;
(b) Obtain delivery prior to the time required to fill a rated order;
(c) Gain competitive advantage;
(d) Disrupt an industry apportionment program in a manner designed to provide a person with an unwarranted share of scarce items; or
(e) Overcome a supplier's regularly established terms of sale or conditions of doing business.

# Subpart E—Allocation Actions
§ 217.50
Policy.
(a) It is the policy of the Federal Government that the allocations authority under title I of the Defense Production Act may:
(1) Only be used when there is insufficient supply of a material, service, or facility to satisfy national defense supply requirements through the use of the priorities authority or when the use of the priorities authority would cause a severe and prolonged disruption in the supply of materials, services, or facilities available to support normal U.S. economic activities; and
(2) Not be used to ration materials or services at the retail level.
(b) Allocation orders, when used, will be distributed equitably among the suppliers of the materials, services, or facilities being allocated and not require any person to relinquish a disproportionate share of the civilian market.
§ 217.51
General procedures.
When the Department of Energy plans to execute its allocations authority to address a supply problem within its resource jurisdiction, the Department shall develop a plan that includes the following information:
(a) A copy of the written determination made, in accordance with section 202 of E.O. 12919, that the program or programs that would be supported by the allocation action are necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense;
(b) A detailed description of the situation to include any unusual events or circumstances that have created the requirement for an allocation action;
(c) A statement of the specific objective(s) of the allocation action;
(d) A list of the materials, services, or facilities to be allocated;
(e) A list of the sources of the materials, services, or facilities that will be subject to the allocation action;
(f) A detailed description of the provisions that will be included in the allocation orders, including the type(s) of allocation orders, the percentages or quantity of capacity or output to be allocated for each purpose, and the duration of the allocation action (
i.e.,
anticipated start and end dates);
(g) An evaluation of the impact of the proposed allocation action on the civilian market; and
(h) Proposed actions, if any, to mitigate disruptions to civilian market operations.
§ 217.52
Controlling the general distribution of a material in the civilian market.
No allocation action by the Department of Energy may be used to control the general distribution of a material in the civilian market, unless the Secretary of the Department of Energy has:
(a) Made a written finding that:
(1) Such material is a scarce and critical material essential to the national defense, and
(2) The requirements of the national defense for such material cannot otherwise be met without creating a significant dislocation of the normal distribution of such material in the civilian market to such a degree as to create appreciable hardship;
(b) Submitted the finding for the President's approval through the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs; and
(c) The President has approved the finding.
§ 217.53
Types of allocation orders.
There are three types of allocation orders available for communicating allocation actions. These are:
(a)

The DOE may solicit and accept submissions from third parties relevant to any application for review provided that the applicant is afforded an opportunity to respond to all third party submissions. In evaluating an application for review, the DOE may convene a conference, on its own initiative, if, in its discretion, it considers that a conference will advance its evaluation of the application.
(ii) If the DOE determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision and if upon request the necessary additional information is not submitted, the DOE may dismiss the application without prejudice. If the failure to supply additional information is repeated or willful, the DOE may dismiss the application with prejudice. If the applicant fails to provide the notice required by paragraph (e) of this section, the DOE may dismiss the application without prejudice.
(iii) An order dismissing an application for any of the reasons specified in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section shall contain a statement of the grounds for the dismissal. The order shall become final within 5 days of its service upon the applicant, unless within such 5-day period the applicant files an amendment correcting the deficiencies identified in the order. Within 5 days of the filing of such amendment, the DOE shall notify the applicant whether the amendment corrects the specified deficiencies. If the amendment does not correct the deficiencies specified in the order, the order shall become a final order of the DOE of which the applicant may seek judicial review.
(2) An application for review of an order shall be processed only if the applicant demonstrates that—
(i) There is probable cause to believe that the supply order is erroneous, inequitable, or unduly burdensome; or
(ii) There has been discovered a law, regulation, interpretation, ruling, order or decision that was in effect at the time of the application which, if it had been made known to the DOE, would have been relevant to the supply order and would have substantially altered the supply order; or
(iii) There has been a substantial change in the facts or circumstances affecting the applicant, which change has occurred during the interval between issuance of the supply order and the date of the application and was caused by forces or circumstances beyond the control of the applicant.
(h)
Decision.
(1) Upon consideration of the application and other relevant information received or obtained during the proceeding, the DOE shall issue an order granting or denying the modification or rescission of the supply order requested in the application for review.
(2) The DOE shall process applications for review as expeditiously as possible. When administratively feasible, the DOE shall issue an order granting or denying the application within 20 business days after receipt of the application.
(3) The order shall include a written statement setting forth the relevant facts and the legal basis of the order. The order shall state that it is a final order of which the applicant may seek judicial review.
(4) The DOE shall serve a copy of the order upon the applicant and any other party who participated in the proceeding.
§ 218.33
Stay.
(a) The DOE may issue an order granting a stay if the DOE determines that an applicant has made a compelling showing that it would incur serious and irreparable injury unless immediate stay relief is granted pending determination of an application for review pursuant to this subpart. An application for a stay shall be labeled as
such on the application and on the outside of the envelope in which the application is transmitted, and shall be in writing and signed by the firm filing the application. It shall include a description of the proceeding incident to which the stay is being sought and of the facts and circumstances which support the applicant's claim that it will incur irreparable injury unless immediate stay relief is granted. The applicant shall comply with the general filing requirements stated in 10 CFR 205.9 in addition to the requirements stated in this section. The DOE on its own initiative may also issue an order granting a stay upon a finding that a firm will incur irreparable injury if such an order is not granted.
(b) An order granting a stay shall expire by its terms within such time after issuance, not to exceed 30 days as the DOE specifies in the order, except that it shall expire automatically 5 days following its issuance if the applicant fails within that period to file an application for review unless within that period the DOE for good cause shown, extends the time during which the applicant may file an application for review.
(c) The order granting or denying a stay is not an order of the DOE subject to administrative review.
§ 218.34
Addresses.
All correspondence, petitions, and any information required by this part shall be submitted to: Administrator, Economic Regulatory Administration, Department of Energy, 2000 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20461, and to the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy, 2000 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20461.

71 FR 20805, Apr. 21, 2006, unless otherwise noted.
§ 300.1
General.
(a)
Purpose.
The General Guidelines in this part and the Technical Guidelines incorporated by reference in § 300.13 govern the Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program authorized by section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13385(b)). The purpose of the guidelines is to establish the procedures and requirements for filing voluntary reports, and to encourage corporations, government agencies, non-profit organizations, households and other private and public entities to submit annual reports of their greenhouse gas emissions, emission reductions, and sequestration activities that are complete, reliable and consistent. Over time, it is anticipated that these reports will provide a reliable record of the contributions reporting entities have made toward reducing their greenhouse gas emissions.
(b)
Reporting under the program.
(1) Each reporting entity, whether or not it intends to register emissions as described in paragraph (c) of this section, must:
(i) File an entity statement that meets the appropriate requirements in § 300.5(d) through (f) of this part;
(ii) Use appropriate emission inventory and emission reduction calculation methods specified in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13), and calculate and report the weighted average quality rating of any emission inventories it reports;
(iii) Comply with the record keeping requirements in § 300.9 of this part; and
(iv) Comply with the certification requirements in § 300.10 of this part;
(2) Each reporting entity, whether or not it intends to register emissions as described in paragraph (c) of this section, may report offset reductions achieved by other entities outside their boundaries as long as such reductions are reported separately and calculated in accordance with methods specified in the Technical Guidelines. The third-party entity that achieved these reductions must agree to their being reported as offset reductions, and must also meet all of the requirements of reporting that would apply if the third-party entity reported directly under the 1605(b) program.
(3) An entity that intends to register emissions and emission reductions must meet the additional requirements referenced in paragraph (c) of this section.
(4) An entity that does not intend to register emissions and emission reductions may choose to report its emissions and/or emission reductions on an entity-wide basis or for selected elements of the entity, selected gases or selected sources.
(5) An entity that does not intend to register emissions may report emission inventories for any year back to 1990 and may report emission reductions for any year back to 1991, relative to a base period of one to four years, ending no earlier than 1990.
(c)
Registration requirements.
Entities that seek to register reductions must meet the additional requirements in this paragraph; although these requirements differ depending on whether the entity is a large or small emitter.
(1) To be eligible for registration, a reduction must have been achieved after 2002, unless the entity has committed under the Climate Leaders or
Climate VISION programs to reduce its entity-wide emissions relative to a base period that ends earlier 2002, but no earlier than 2000.
(2) A large emitter must submit an entity-wide emission inventory that meets or exceeds the minimum quality requirements specified in § 300.6(b) and the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13). Registered reductions of a large emitter must be based on an entity-wide assessment of net emission reductions, determined in accordance with § 300.8 and the Technical Guidelines.
(3) A small emitter must also submit an emission inventory that meets minimum quality requirements specified in § 300.6(b) and the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13) and base its registered reductions on an assessment of annual changes in net emissions. A small emitter, however, may restrict its inventory and assessment to a single type of activity, such as forest management, building operations or agricultural tillage.
(4) Reporting entities may, under certain conditions, register reductions achieved by other entities:
(i) Reporting entities that have met the requirements for registering their own reductions may also register offset reductions achieved by other entities if:
(A) They have an agreement with the third-party entities to do so and these third-party entities have met all of the requirements for registration; or
(B) They were the result of qualified demand management or other programs and are calculated in accordance with the action-specific method identified in § 300.8(h)(5).
(ii) Small emitters that serve as an aggregator may register offset reductions achieved by non-reporting entities without reporting on their own emissions, as long as they have an agreement with the third-party entities to do so and these third-party entities have met all of the requirements for registration.
(d)
Forms.
Annual reports of greenhouse gas emissions, emission reductions, and sequestration must be made on forms or software made available by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy (EIA).
(e)
Status of reports under previous guidelines.
EIA continues to maintain in its Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases database all reports received pursuant to DOE's October 1994 guidelines. Those guidelines are available from EIA at
http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/guidelns.html.
(f)
Periodic review and updating of General and Technical Guidelines.
DOE intends periodically to review the General Guidelines and the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13) to determine whether any changes are warranted; DOE anticipates these reviews will occur approximately once every three years. These reviews will consider any new developments in climate science or policy, the participation rates of large and small emitters in the 1605(b) program, the general quality of the data submitted by different participants, and any changes to other emissions reporting protocols. Possible changes may include, but are not limited to:
(1) The addition of greenhouse gases that have been demonstrated to have significant, quantifiable climate forcing effects when released to the atmosphere in significant quantities;
(2) Changes to the minimum, quantity-weighted quality rating for emission inventories;
(3) Updates to emission inventory methods, emission factors and other provisions that are contained in industry protocols or standards. The review may also consider updates to any government-developed and consensus-based emission factors for which automatic updating is not provided in the Technical Guidelines;
(4) Modifications to the benchmarks or emission conversion factors used to calculate avoided and indirect emissions; and
(5) Changes in the minimum requirements for registered emission reductions.
§ 300.2
Definitions.
This section provides definitions for commonly used terms in this part.
Activity of a small emitter
means, with respect to a small emitter, any single category of anthropogenic production,
consumption or other action that releases emissions or results in sequestration, the annual changes of which can be assessed generally by using a single calculation method.
Aggregator
means an entity that reports to the 1605(b) program on behalf of non-reporting entities. An aggregator may be a large or small emitter, such as a trade association, non-profit organization or public agency.
Anthropogenic
means greenhouse gas emissions and removals that are a direct result of human activities or are the result of natural processes that have been affected by human activities.
Avoided emissions
means the greenhouse gas emission reductions that occur outside the organizational boundary of the reporting entity as a direct consequence of changes in the entity's activity, including but not necessarily limited to the emission reductions associated with increases in the generation and sale of electricity, steam, hot water or chilled water produced from energy sources that emit fewer greenhouse gases per unit than other competing sources of these forms of distributed energy.
Base period
means a period of 1-4 years used to derive the average annual base emissions, emissions intensity or other values from which emission reductions are calculated.
Base value
means the value from which emission reductions are calculated for an entity or subentity. The value may be annual emissions, emissions intensity, kilowatt-hours generated, or other value specified in the 1605(b) guidelines. It is usually derived from actual emissions and/or activity data derived from the base period.
Biogenic emissions
mean emissions that are naturally occurring and are not significantly affected by human actions or activity.
Boundary
means the actual or virtual line that encompasses all the emissions and carbon stocks that are to be quantified and reported in an entity's greenhouse gas inventory, including
de minimis
emissions. Entities may use financial control or another classification method based on ownership or control as the means of determining which sources or carbon stocks fall within this organizational boundary.
Carbon dioxide equivalent
means the amount of carbon dioxide by weight emitted into the atmosphere that would produce the same estimated radiative forcing as a given weight of another radiatively active gas. Carbon dioxide equivalents are computed by multiplying the weight of the gas being measured by its estimated global warming potential.
Carbon stocks
mean the quantity of carbon stored in biological and physical systems including: trees, products of harvested trees, agricultural crops, plants, wood and paper products and other terrestrial biosphere sinks, soils, oceans, and sedimentary and geological sinks.
Climate Leaders
means the EPA sponsored industry-government partnership that works with individual companies to develop long-term comprehensive climate change strategies. Certain Climate Leaders Partners have, working with EPA, set a corporate-wide greenhouse gas reduction goal and have inventoried their emissions to measure progress towards their goal.
Climate VISION
means the public-private partnership initiated pursuant to a Presidential directive issued in 2002 that aims to contribute to the President's goal of reducing greenhouse gas intensity through voluntary frameworks with industry. Climate VISION partners have signed an agreement with DOE to implement various climate-related actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
De minimis emissions
means emissions from one or more sources and of one or more greenhouse gases that, in aggregate, are less than or equal to 3 percent of the total annual carbon dioxide (CO
2
) equivalent emissions of a reporting entity.
Department
or
DOE
means the U.S. Department of Energy.
Direct emissions
are emissions from sources within the organizational boundaries of an entity.
Distributed energy
means electrical or thermal energy generated by an entity that is sold or otherwise exported outside of the entity's boundaries for use by another entity.
EIA
means the Energy Information Administration within the U.S. Department of Energy.
Emissions
means the direct release of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere from any anthropogenic (human induced) source and certain indirect emissions (releases) specified in this part.
Emissions intensity
means emissions per unit of output, where output is defined as the quantity of physical output, or a non-physical indicator of an entity's or subentity's productive activity.
Entity
means the whole or part of any business, institution, organization, government agency or corporation, or household that:
(1) Is recognized under any U.S. Federal, State or local law that applies to it;
(2) Is located and operates, at least in part, in the United States; and
(3) The emissions of such operations are released, at least in part, in the United States.
First reduction year
means the first year for which an entity intends to register emission reductions; it is the year that immediately follows the start year.
Fugitive emissions
means uncontrolled releases to the atmosphere of greenhouse gases from the processing, transmission, and/or transportation of fossil fuels or other materials, such as HFC leaks from refrigeration, SF6 from electrical power distributors, and methane from solid waste landfills, among others, that are not emitted via an exhaust pipe(s) or stack(s).
Greenhouse gases
means the gases that may be reported to the Department of Energy under this program. They are:
(1) Carbon dioxide (CO

(8) Other gases or particles that have been demonstrated to have significant, quantifiable climate forcing effects when released to the atmosphere in significant quantities and for which DOE has established or approved methods for estimating emissions and reductions. (
Note:
As provided in § 300.6(i), chlorofluorcarbons and other gases with quantifiable climate forcing effects may be reported to the 1605(b) program if DOE has established an appropriate emission inventory or emission reduction calculation method, but reductions of these gases may not be registered.)
Incidental lands
are entity landholdings that are a minor component of an entity's operations and are not actively managed for production of goods and services, including:
(1) Transmission, pipeline, or transportation right of ways that are not managed for timber production;
(2) Land surrounding commercial enterprises or facilities; and
(3) Land where carbon stock changes are determined by natural factors.
Indirect emissions
means greenhouse gas emissions from stationary or mobile sources outside the organizational boundary that occur as a direct consequence of an entity's activity, including but not necessarily limited to the emissions associated with the generation of electricity, steam and hot/chilled water used by the entity.
Large emitter
means an entity whose annual emissions are more than 10,000 metric tons of CO
2
equivalent, as determined in accordance with § 300.5(c).
Net emission reductions
means the sum of all annual changes in emissions, eligible avoided emissions and sequestration of the greenhouse gases specifically identified in § 300.6(i), and determined to be in conformance with §§ 300.7 and 300.8 of this part.
Offset
means an emission reduction that is included in a 1605(b) report and
meets the requirements of this part, but is achieved by an entity other than the reporting entity. Offset reductions must not be reported or registered by any other entity and must appear as a separate and distinct component of an entity's report. Offsets are not integrated into the reporting entity's emissions or net emission reductions.
Registration
means the reporting of emission reductions that the EIA has determined meet the qualifications for registered emission reductions set forth in the guidelines.
Reporting entity
means an entity that has submitted a report under the 1605(b) program that has been accepted by the Energy Information Administration.
Reporting year
means the year that is the subject of a report to DOE.
Sequestration
means the process by which CO
2
is removed from the atmosphere, either through biologic processes or physical processes.
Simplified Emission Inventory Tool (SEIT)
is a computer-based method, to be developed and made readily accessible by EIA, for translating common physical indicators into an estimate of greenhouse gas emissions.
Sink
means an identifiable discrete location, set of locations, or area in which CO
2
or some other greenhouse gas is sequestered.
Small emitter
means an entity whose annual emissions are less than or equal to 10,000 metric tons of CO
2
equivalent, as determined in accordance with § 300.5(c), and that chooses to be treated as a small emitter under the guidelines.
Source
means any land, facility, process, vehicle or activity that releases a greenhouse gas.
Start year
means the year upon which the initial entity statement is based and the last year of the initial base period(s).
Subentity
means a component of any entity, such as a discrete business line, facility, plant, vehicle fleet, or energy using system, which has associated with it emissions of greenhouse gases that can be distinguished from the emissions of all other components of the same entity and, when summed with the emissions of all other subentities, equal the entity's total emissions.
Total emissions
means the total annual contribution of the greenhouse gases (as defined in this section) to the atmosphere by an entity, including both direct and indirect entity-wide emissions.
United States
or
U.S.
means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and any other territory of the United States.
§ 300.3
Guidance for defining and naming the reporting entity.
(a) A reporting entity must be composed of one or more businesses, public or private institutions or organizations, households, or other entities having operations that annually release emissions, at least in part, in the United States. Entities may be defined by, as appropriate, a certificate of incorporation, corporate charter, corporate filings, tax identification number, or other legal basis of identification recognized under any Federal, State or local law or regulation. If a reporting entity is composed of more than one entity, all of the entities included must be responsible to the same management hierarchy and all entities that have the same management hierarchy must be included in the reporting entity.
(b) All reporting entities are strongly encouraged to define themselves at the highest level of aggregation. To achieve this objective, DOE suggests the use of a corporate-level definition of the entity, based on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or institutional charters. While reporting at the highest level of aggregation is encouraged, DOE recognizes that certain businesses and institutions may conclude that reporting at some lower level is desirable. Federal agencies are encouraged to report at the agency or departmental level, but distinct organizational units (such as a Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuge) may report directly if authorized by their department or agency. Once an entity has determined the level of corporate or institutional management at which it will report (
e.g.
, the holding
company, subsidiary, regulated stationary source, state government, agency, refuge, etc.), the entity must include all elements of the organization encompassed by that management level and exclude any organizations that are managed separately. For example, if two subsidiaries of a parent company are to be covered by a single report, then all subsidiaries of that parent company must also be included. Similarly, if a company decides to report on the U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries of its North American operations unit, it must also report on any other subsidiaries of its North American unit, such as a Mexican subsidiary.
(c) A name for the defined entity must be specified by all reporters. For entities that intend to register reductions, this should be the name commonly used to represent the activities being reported, as long as it is not also used to refer to substantial activities not covered by the entity's reports. While DOE believes entities should be given considerable flexibility in defining themselves at an appropriate level of aggregation, it is essential that the name assigned to an entity that intends to register reductions corresponds closely to the scope of the operations and emissions covered by its report. If, for example, an individual plant or operating unit is reporting as an entity, it should be given a name that corresponds to the specific plant or unit, and not to the responsible subsidiary or corporate entity. In order to distinguish a parent company from its subsidiaries, the name of the parent company generally should not be incorporated into the name of the reporting subsidiary, but if it is, the name of the parent company usually should be secondary.
§ 300.4
Selecting organizational boundaries.
(a) Each reporting entity must disclose in its entity statement the approach used to establish its organizational boundaries, which should be consistent with the following guidelines:
(1) In general, entities should use financial control as the primary basis for determining their organizational boundaries, with financial control meaning the ability to direct the financial and operating policies of all elements of the entity with a view to gaining economic or other benefits from its activities over a period of many years. This approach should ensure that all sources, including those controlled by subsidiaries, that are wholly or largely owned by the entity are covered by its reports. Sources that are under long-term lease of the entity may, depending on the provisions of such leases, also be considered to be under the entity's financial control. Sources that are temporarily leased or operated by an entity generally would not be considered to be under its financial control.
(2) Entities may establish organizational boundaries using approaches other than financial control, such as equity share or operational control, but must disclose how the use of these other approaches results in organizational boundaries that differ from those resulting from using the financial control approach.
(3) Emissions from facilities or vehicles that are partially-owned or leased may be included at the entity's discretion, provided that the entity has taken reasonable steps to assure that doing so does not result in the double counting of emissions, sequestration or emission reductions. Emissions reductions or sequestration associated with land, facilities or other sources not owned or leased by an entity may not be included in the entity's reports under the program unless the entity has long-term control over the emissions or sequestration of the source and the owner of the source has agreed that the emissions or sequestration may be included in the entity's report.
(4) If the scope of a defined entity extends beyond the United States, the reporting entity should use the same approach to determining its organizational boundaries in the U.S. and outside the U.S.
(b) Each reporting entity must keep separate reports on emissions or emission reductions that occur within its defined boundaries and those that occur outside its defined boundaries. Entities must also keep separate reports on emissions and emission reductions that occur outside the United
States and those that occur within the United States.
(c) An entity that intends to register its entity-wide emissions reductions must document and maintain its organizational boundary for accounting and reporting purposes.
§ 300.5
Submission of an entity statement.
(a)
Determining the type of reporting entity.
The entity statement requirements vary by type of reporting entity. For the purposes of these guidelines, there are three types of entities:
(1) Large emitters that intend to register emission reductions;
(2) Small emitters that intend to register emission reductions; and
(3) Emitters that intend to report, but not register emission reductions.
(b)
Choosing a start year.
The first entity statement describes the make-up, operations and boundaries of the entity, as they existed in the start year.
(1) For all entities, it is the year immediately preceding the first year for which the entity intends to register emission reductions and the last year of the initial base period(s).
(2) For entities intending to register emission reductions, the start year may be no earlier than 2002, unless the entity has made a commitment to reduce its entity-wide emissions under the Climate Leaders or Climate VISION program. An entity that has made such a commitment may establish a start year derived from the base period of the commitment, as long as it is no earlier than 2000.
(i) For a large emitter, the start year is the first year for which the entity submits a complete emissions inventory under the 1605(b) program.
(ii) The entity's emissions in its start year or its average annual emissions over a period of up to four years ending in the start year determine whether it qualifies to begin reporting as a small emitter.
(3) For entities not intending to register reductions, the start year may be no earlier than 1990.
(c)
Determining and maintaining large or small emitter reporting status.
(1) Any entity that intends to register emission reductions can choose to participate as a large emitter, but only an entity that has demonstrated that its annual emissions are less than or equal to 10,000 metric tons of CO
2
equivalent may participate as a small emitter. To demonstrate that its annual emissions are less than or equal to 10,000 metric tons of CO
2
equivalent, an entity must submit either an estimate of its emissions during its chosen start year or an estimate of its average annual emissions over a continuous period not to exceed four years of time ending in its chosen start year, as long as the operations and boundaries of the entity have not changed significantly during that period.
(2) An entity must estimate its total emissions using methods specified in Chapter 1 of the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13) or by using the Simplified Emission Inventory Tool (SEIT) provided by EIA and also discussed in Chapter 1. The results of this estimate must be reported to EIA. [
Note:
emission estimates developed using SEIT may not be used to prepare, in whole or part, entity-wide emission inventories required for the registration of reductions.]
(3) After starting to report, each small emitter must annually certify that the emissions-related operations and boundaries of the entity have not changed significantly since the previous report. A new estimate of total emissions must be submitted after any significant increase in emissions, any change in the operations or boundaries of the small emitter, or every five years, whichever occurs first. Small emitters with estimated annual emissions of over 9,000 metric tons of CO
2
equivalent should re-estimate and submit their emissions annually. If an entity determines that it must report as a large emitter, then it must continue to report as a large emitter in all future years in order to ensure a consistent time series of reports. Once a small emitter becomes a large emitter, it must begin reporting in conformity with the reporting requirements for large emitters.
(d)
Entity statements for large emitters intending to register reductions.
When a large emitter intending to register emission reductions first reports under these guidelines, it must provide the
following information in its entity statement:
(1) The name to be used to identify the participating entity;
(2) The legal basis of the named entity;
(3) The criteria used to determine:
(i) The organizational boundaries of the entity, if other than financial control; and
(ii) The sources of emissions included or excluded from the entity's reports, such as sources excluded as
de minimis
emissions;
(4) The names of any parent or holding companies the activities of which will not be covered comprehensively by the entity's reports;
(5) The names of any large subsidiaries or organizational units covered comprehensively by the entity's reports. All subsidiaries of the entity must be covered by the entity's reports, but only large subsidiaries must be specifically identified in the entity statement;
(6) A list of each country where operations occur, if the entity is including any non-U.S. operations in its report;
(7) A description of the entity and its primary U.S. economic activities, such as electricity generation, product manufacturing, service provider or freight transport; for each country listed under paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the large emitter should describe the economic activity in that country.
(8) A description of the types of emission sources or sinks to be covered in the entity's emission inventories, such as fossil fuel power plants, manufacturing facilities, commercial office buildings or heavy-duty vehicles;
(9) The names of other entities that substantially share the ownership or operational control of sources that represent a significant part of the reporting entity's emission inventories, and a certification that, to the best of the certifier's knowledge, the direct greenhouse gas emissions and sequestration in the entity's report are not included in reports filed by any of these other entities to the 1605(b) program; and
(10) Identification of the start year.
(e)
Entity statements for small emitters intending to register reductions.
When a small emitter intending to register emission reductions first reports under these guidelines, it must provide the following information in its entity statement:
(1) The name to be used to identify the participating entity;
(2) The legal basis of the named entity;
(3) An identification of the entity's control over the activities covered by the entity's reports, if other than financial control;
(4) The names of any parent or holding companies the activities of which will not be covered comprehensively by the entity's reports;
(5) An identification or description of the primary economic activities of the entity, such as agricultural production, forest management or household operation; if any of the economic activities covered by the entity's reports occur outside the U.S., a listing of each country in which such activities occur;
(6) An identification or description of the specific activity (or activities) and the emissions, avoided emissions or sequestration covered by the entity's report, such as landfill gas recovery or forest sequestration;
(7) A certification that, to the best of the certifier's knowledge, the direct greenhouse gas emissions and sequestration in the entity's report are not included in reports filed by any other entities reporting to the 1605(b) program; and
(8) Identification of the start year.
(f)
Entity statements for reporting entities not registering reductions.
When a participant not intending to register emission reductions first reports under this part, it must, at a minimum, provide the following information in its entity statement:
(1) The name to be used to identify the reporting entity;
(2) The legal basis of the entity;
(3) An identification of the entity's control over the activities covered by the entity's reports, if other than financial control;
(4) A description of the entity and its primary economic activities, such as electricity generation, product manufacturing, service provider, freight transport, agricultural production, forest management or household operation; if any of the economic activities covered by the entity's reports occur
outside the United States, a listing of each country in which such activities occur; and
(5) A description of the types of emission sources or sinks, such as fossil fuel power plants, manufacturing facilities, commercial office buildings or heavy-duty vehicles, covered in the entity's reports of emissions or emission reductions.
(g)
Changing entity statements.
(1) Reporting entities are required to annually review and, if necessary, update their entity statements.
(2) From time to time, a reporting entity may choose to change the scope of activities included within the entity's reports or the level at which the entity wishes to report. A reporting entity may also choose to change its organizational boundaries, its base period, or other elements of its entity statement. For example, companies buy and sell business units, or equity share arrangements may change. In general, DOE encourages changes in the scope of reporting that expand the coverage of an entity's report and discourages changes that reduce the coverage of such reports unless they are caused by divestitures or plant closures. Any such changes should be reported in amendments to the entity statement, and major changes may warrant or require changes in the base values used to calculate emission reductions and, in some cases, the entity's base periods. Changes in the scope of reporting made on or before May 31 of a given calendar year must be reflected in the report submitted covering emissions and reductions for the following calendar year. Reporting entities may choose to postpone incorporating changes in the scope of reporting made after May 31 until submitting the report covering emissions and reductions for the year after the following calendar year. However, in no case should there be an interruption in the annual reports of entities registering emission reductions. Chapter 2 of the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13) provides more specific guidance on how such changes should be reflected in entity statements, reports, and emission reduction calculations.
(h)
Documenting changes in amended entity statements.
A reporting entity's entity statement in subsequent reports should focus primarily on changes since the previous report. Specifically, the subsequent entity statement should report the following information:
(1) For significant changes in the reporting entity's scope or organizational boundaries, the entity should document:
(i) The acquisition or divestiture of discrete business units, subsidiaries, facilities, and plants;
(ii) The closure or opening of significant facilities;
(iii) The transfer of economic activity to or from specific subentities covered by the entity's reports, such as the transfer of operations to non-U.S. subsidiaries;
(iv) Significant changes in land holdings (applies to entities reporting on greenhouse gas emissions or sequestration related to land use, land use change, or forestry);
(v) Whether the reporting entity is reporting at a higher level of aggregation than it did in the previous report, and if so, a listing of the subsidiary entities that are now aggregated under a revised conglomerated entity, including a listing of any non-U.S. operations to be added and the specific countries in which these operations are located; and
(vi) Changes in its activities or operations (
e.g.
, changes in output, contractual arrangements, equipment and processes, outsourcing or insourcing of significant activities) that are likely to have a significant effect on emissions, together with an explanation of how it believes the changes in economic activity influenced its reported emissions or sequestrations.
§ 300.6
Emissions inventories.
(a)
General.
The objective of an emission inventory is to provide a full accounting of an entity's emissions for a particular year, including direct emissions of the first six categories of gases listed in the definition of “greenhouse gases” in § 300.2, indirect emissions specified in paragraph (e) of this section, and all sequestration or other changes in carbon stocks. An emission
inventory must be prepared in accordance with Chapter 1 of the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13). An inventory does not include avoided emissions or any offset reductions, and is not subsequently adjusted to reflect future acquisitions, divestitures or other changes to the reporting entity (although a reporting entity often makes these types of adjustments when calculating emission reductions under the guidelines). Entity-wide inventories are a prerequisite for the registration of emission reductions by entities with average annual emissions of more than 10,000 metric tons of CO
2
equivalent. Entities that have average annual emissions of less than or equal to 10,000 metric tons of CO
2
equivalent are eligible to register emission reductions associated with specific activities without also reporting an inventory of the total emissions, but such entities should inventory and report the emissions associated with the specific activity(ies) they do cover in their reports.
(b)
Quality requirements for emission inventories.
The Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13) usually identify more than one acceptable method of measuring or estimating greenhouse gas emissions. Each acceptable method is rated A, B, C or D, with A methods usually corresponding to the highest quality method available and D methods representing the lowest quality method that may be used. Each letter is assigned a numerical rating reflecting its relative quality, 4 for A methods, 3 for B methods, 2 for C methods and 1 for D methods. Entities that intend to register emission reductions must use emission inventory methods that result in a quantity-weighted average quality rating of at least 3.0.
(1) Entities may at any time choose to modify the measurement or estimation methods that they use for their current or future year emission inventories. Such modifications would enable entities to gradually improve the quality of the ratings over time, but prior year inventories may be modified only to correct significant errors.
(2) Entities that have had their emission quantities and the quantity-weighted quality rating of their emissions inventory independently verified may report their emissions and average quality ratings by greenhouse gas, indirect emissions and sequestration, rather than by source or sink category.
(3) Entities that certify that they have used only A or B methods, may forego indicating in their reports the quality ratings of the methods used and may forego calculating the quantity-weighted average quality of their emission inventories.
(c)
Using estimation methods not included in the Technical Guidelines.
An entity may obtain DOE approval for the use of an estimation method not included in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13) if the method covers sources not described in the Technical Guidelines, or if the method provides more accurate results for the entity's specific circumstances than the methods described in the Technical Guidelines. If an entity wishes to propose the use of a method that is not described in the Technical Guidelines, the entity must provide a written description of the method, an explanation of how the method is implemented (including data requirements), empirical evidence of the method's validity and accuracy, and a suggested rating for the method to DOE's Office of Policy and International Affairs (with a copy to EIA). DOE reserves the right to deny the request, or to assign its own rating to the method. By submitting this information, the entity grants permission to DOE to incorporate the method in a future revision of the Technical Guidelines.
(d)
Direct emissions inventories.
Direct greenhouse gas emissions that must be reported are the emissions resulting from stationary or mobile sources within the organizational boundaries of an entity, including but not limited to emissions resulting from combustion of fossil fuels, process emissions, and fugitive emissions. Process emissions (
e.g.
, PFC emissions from aluminum production) must be reported along with fugitive emissions (
e.g.
, leakage of greenhouse gases from equipment).
(e)
Inventories of indirect emissions associated with purchased energy.
(1) To provide a clear incentive for the users
of electricity and other forms of purchased energy to reduce demand, an entity must include the indirect emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, and hot or chilled water in the entity's inventory as indirect emissions. To avoid double counting among entities, the entity must report all indirect emissions separately from its direct emissions. Entities should use the methods for quantifying indirect emissions specified in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13).
(2) Entities may choose to report other forms of indirect emissions, such as emissions associated with employee commuting, materials consumed or products produced, although such other indirect emissions may not be included in the entity's emission inventory and may not be the basis for registered emission reductions. All such reports of other forms of indirect emissions must be distinct from reports of indirect emissions associated with purchased energy and must be based on emission measurement or estimation methods identified in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13) or approved by DOE.
(f)
Entity-level inventories of changes in terrestrial carbon stocks.
Annual changes in managed terrestrial carbon stocks should be comprehensively assessed and reported across the entity, and the net emissions resulting from such changes included in the entity's emissions inventory. Entities should use the methods for estimating changes in managed terrestrial carbon stocks specified in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13).
(g)
Treatment of de minimis emissions and sequestration.
(1) Although the goal of the entity-wide reporting requirement is to provide an accurate and comprehensive estimate of total emissions, there may be small emissions from certain sources that are unduly costly or otherwise difficult to measure or reliably estimate annually. An entity may exclude particular sources of emissions or sequestration if the total quantities excluded represent less than or equal to 3 percent of the total annual CO
2
equivalent emissions of the entity. The entity must identify the types of emissions excluded and provide an estimate of the annual quantity of such emissions using methods specified in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13) or by using the Simplified Emissions Inventory Tool (SEIT). The results of this estimate of the entity's total excluded annual emissions must be reported to DOE together with the entity's initial entity statement.
(2) After starting to report, each reporting entity that excludes from its annual reports any
de minimis
emissions must re-estimate the quantity of excluded emissions after any significant increase in such emissions, or every five years, whichever occurs sooner.
(h)
Separate reporting of domestic and international emissions.
Non-U.S. emissions included in an entity's emission inventory must be separately reported and clearly distinguished from emissions originating in the U.S. Entities must identify any country-specific factors used in the preparation of such reports.
(i)
Covered gases.
Entity-wide emissions inventories must include the emissions of the first six categories of named gases listed in the definition of “greenhouse gases” in § 300.2. Entities may report chlorofluorocarbons and other greenhouse gases with quantifiable climate forcing effects as long as DOE has established a method for doing so, but such gases must be reported separately and emission reductions, if any, associated with such other gases are not eligible for registration.
(j)
Units for reporting.
Emissions and sequestration should be reported in terms of the mass (not volume) of each gas, using metric units (
e.g.
, metric tons of methane). Entity-wide and subentity summations of emissions and reductions from multiple sources must be converted into CO
2
equivalent units using the global warming potentials for each gas in the International Panel on Climate Change's Third Assessment (or most recent) Report, as specified in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13). Entities should specify the units used (
e.g.
, kilograms, or metric tons). Entities may need to use the standard conversion factors specified in the Technical Guidelines to
convert existing data into the common units required in the entity-level report. Emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity must be calculated by region (from the list provided by DOE in the Technical Guidelines) or country, if outside the United States. Consumption of purchased steam or chilled/hot water must be reported according to the type of system and fuel used to generate it (from the list provided by DOE in the Technical Guidelines). Entities must convert purchased energy to CO
2
equivalents using the conversion factors in the Technical Guidelines. Entities should also provide the physical quantities of each type of purchased energy covered by their reports.
§ 300.7
Net emission reductions.
(a) Entities that intend to register emission reductions achieved must comply with the requirements of this section. Entities may voluntarily follow these procedures if they want to demonstrate the achievement of net, entity-wide reductions for years prior to the earliest year permitted for registration. Only large emitters must follow the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, but small emitters may do so voluntarily. Only entities that qualify as small emitters may use the special procedures in paragraph (c) of this section. Entities seeking to register emission reductions achieved by other entities (offsets) must certify that these emission reductions were calculated in a manner consistent with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section and use the emission reduction calculation methods identified in § 300.8. All entities seeking to register emission reductions must comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. Only reductions in the emissions of the first six categories of gases listed in the definition of “greenhouse gases” in § 300.2 are eligible for registration.
(b)
Assessing net emission reductions for large emitters.
(1) Entity-wide reporting is a prerequisite for registering emission reductions by entities with average annual emissions of more than 10,000 metric tons of CO
2
equivalent. Net annual entity-wide emission reductions must be based, to the maximum extent practicable, on a full assessment and sum total of all changes in an entity's emissions, eligible avoided emissions and sequestration relative to the entity's established base period(s). This assessment must include all entity emissions, including the emissions associated with any non-U.S. operations covered by the entity statement, although the reductions achieved by non-U.S. operations must be separately totaled prior to being integrated with the net emission reductions achieved by U.S. operations. It must include the annual changes in the total emissions of the entity, including the total emissions of each of the subentities identified in its entity statement. All changes in emissions, avoided emissions, and sequestration must be determined using methods that are consistent with the guidelines described in § 300.8 of this part.
(2) If it is not practicable to assess the changes in net emissions resulting from certain entity activities using at least one of the methods described in § 300.8 of this part, the entity may exclude them from its estimate of net emission reductions. The entity must identify as one or more distinct subentities the sources of emissions excluded for this reason and describe the reasons why it was not practicable to assess the changes that had occurred. DOE believes that few emission sources will be excluded for this reason, but has identified at least two situations where such an exclusion would be warranted. For example, it is likely to be impossible to assess the emission changes associated with a new manufacturing plant that produces a product for which the entity has no historical record of emissions or emissions intensity (emissions per unit of product output). However, once the new plant has been operational for at least a full year, a base period and base value(s) for the new plant could be established and its emission changes assessed in the following year. Until the emission changes of this new subentity can be assessed, it should be identified in the entity's report as a subentity for which no assessment of emission changes is practicable. The other example involves a subentity that has reduced its
output below the levels of its base period. In such a case, the subentity could not use the absolute emissions method and may also be unable to identify an effective intensity metric or other method.
(3) In calculating its net annual emission reductions, an entity should exclude any emissions or sequestration that have been excluded from the entity's inventory. The entity should also exclude all
de minimis
and biogenic emissions that are excluded from the entity's inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from its assessments of emission changes.
(c)
Assessing emission reductions for entities with small emissions.
(1) Entities with average annual emissions of less than or equal to 10,000 metric tons of CO
2
equivalent are not required to inventory their total emissions or assess all changes in their emissions, eligible avoided emissions and sequestration to qualify for registered reductions. These entities may register emission reductions that have occurred since 2002 and that are associated with one or more specific activities, as long as they:
(i) Perform a complete assessment of the annual emissions and sequestration associated with each of the activities upon which they report, using methods that meet the same quality requirements applicable to entity-wide emission inventories; and
(ii) Determine the changes in the emissions, eligible avoided emissions or sequestration associated with each of these activities.
(2) An entity reporting as a small emitter must report on one or more specific activities and is encouraged, but not required to report on all activities occurring within the entity boundary. Examples of small emitter activities include: vehicle operations; product manufacturing processes; building operations or a distinct part thereof, such as lighting; livestock operations; crop management; and power generation. For example, a farmer managing several woodlots and also producing a wheat crop may report emission reductions associated with managing an individual woodlot. However, the farmer must also assess and report the net sequestration resulting from managing all the woodlots within the entity's boundary. The small emitter is not required to report on emissions or reductions associated with growing the wheat crop.
(3) A small emitter must certify that the reductions reported were not caused by actions likely to cause increases in emissions elsewhere within the entity's operations. This certification should be based on an assessment of the likely direct and indirect effects of the actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
(d)
Net emission reductions achieved by other entities (offset reductions or emission reductions submitted by aggregators).
A reporting entity or aggregator under certain conditions may report or register all or some of the net emission reductions achieved by entities that choose not to report under the section 1605(b) program. In all cases, an agreement must exist between the reporting entity or aggregator and the other entity that specifies the quantity of the emission reductions (or increases) achieved by the other entity that may be reported or registered as an offset reduction by the reporting entity or aggregator. A large emitter that is reporting on behalf of other entities must meet all of the requirements applicable to large emitters, including submission of an entity statement, an emissions inventory, and an entity-wide assessment of emission reductions. If an aggregator is a small emitter, it may choose to report only on the activities, emissions and emission reductions of the entities on behalf of which it is reporting and not to report on any of its own activities or emission reductions. The reporting entity or aggregator must include in its report all of the information on the other entity, including an entity statement, an emissions inventory (when required), and an assessment of emission reductions that would be required if the other entity were directly reporting to EIA. The net emissions reductions (or increases) of each other entity will be evaluated separately by EIA to determine whether they are eligible for registration in accordance with the guidelines of this part. Those registered reductions (or increases) assigned by the
other entity, by agreement, to a reporting entity or aggregator will be included in EIA's summary of all registered offset reductions for that entity or aggregator. If the agreement between the reporting entity and other entity is discontinued, for any reason, the reporting entity must inform EIA and must identify any emission reductions previously reported that could be attributable to an increase in the carbon stocks of the other entity. Such reductions will be removed by EIA from the records of the reporting entity's offset reductions.
(e)
Net emission reductions to be reported by other entities as offset reductions.
Entities must identify in their report the quantity of any net emission reductions covered by the report, if any, that another entity will report as an offset reduction, including the name of the other entity;
(f)
Adjusting for year-to-year increases in net emissions.
(1) Normally, net annual emission reductions for an entity are calculated by summing the net annual changes in emissions, eligible avoided emissions and sequestration, as determined using the calculation methods identified in § 300.8 and according to the procedures described in paragraph (b) of this section for large emitters, paragraph (c) for small emitters of this section for small emitters, and paragraph (d) of this section for offsets. However, if the entity experienced a net increase in emissions for one or more years, these increases must be reported and taken into account in calculating any future year reductions. If the entity subsequently achieves net annual emission reductions, the net increases experienced in the preceding year(s) must be more than offset by these reductions before the entity can once again register emission reductions. For example, if an entity achieved a net emission reduction of 5,000 metric tons of CO
2
equivalent in its first year, a net increase of 2,000 metric tons in its second year, and a net reduction of 3,000 metric tons in its third year, it would be able to register a 5,000 metric ton reduction in its first year, no reduction in its second year, and a 1,000 metric ton reduction in its third year (3,000-2,000). The entity must file full reports for each of these three years. Its report for the second year would indicate the net increase in emissions and this increase would be noted in EIA's summary of the entity's report for that year and for any future year, until the emissions increase was entirely offset by subsequent emission reductions. If this same entity achieved a net reduction of only 1,000 metric tons in its third year, it would not be able to register additional reductions until it had, in some future year, offset more than its second year increase of 2,000 metric tons.
(2) [Reserved]
§ 300.8
Calculating emission reductions.
(a)
Choosing appropriate emission reduction calculation methods.
(1) An entity must choose the method or methods it will use to calculate emission reductions from the list provided in paragraph (h) of this section. Each of the calculation methods has special characteristics that make it applicable to only certain types of emissions and activities. An entity should select the appropriate calculation method based on several factors, including:
(i) How the entity's subentities are defined;
(ii) How the reporter will gather and report emissions data; and
(iii) The availability of other types of data that might be needed, such as production or output data.
(2) For some entities, a single calculation method will be sufficient, but many entities may need to apply more than one method because discrete components of the entity require different calculation methods. In such a case, the entity will need to select a method for each subentity (or discrete component of the entity with identifiable emission or reductions). The emissions and output measure (generally a physical measure) of each subentity must be clearly distinguished and reported separately. Guidance on the selection and specification of calculation methods is provided in Chapter 2 of the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13).
(b)
Identifying subentities for calculating reductions.
If more than one calculation method is to be used, an entity must specify the portion of the entity (the subentity) to which each method will be applied. Each subentity must be clearly identified. From time to time, it may be necessary to modify existing or create new subentities. The entity must provide to EIA a full description of such changes, together with an explanation of why they were required.
(c)
Choosing a base period for calculating reductions.
In general, the base period used in calculating emission reductions is the single year or up to four-year period average immediately preceding the first year of calculated emission reductions.
(d)
Establishing base values.
To calculate emission reductions, an entity must establish a base value against which to compare reporting year performance. The minimum requirements for base values for each type of calculation method are specified in Chapter 2 of the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13). In most cases, an historic base value, derived from emissions or other data gathered during the base period, is the minimum requirement specified. Entities may, however, choose to establish base values that are more stringent than the base values derived from the methods specified in Chapter 2 of the Technical Guidelines as long as their report indicates the rationale for the alternative base value and demonstrates that it would result in a smaller quantity of emission reductions.
(e)
Emission reduction and subentity statements.
For each subentity, an entity must submit to EIA the following information:
(1) An identification and description of the method used to calculate emission reductions, including:
(i) The type of calculation method;
(ii) The measure of output used (if any); and
(iii) The method-specific base period for which any required base value will be calculated.
(2) The base period used in calculating reductions. When an entity starts to report, the base period used in calculating reductions must end in the start year. However, over time the reporting entity may find it necessary to revise or establish new base periods and base values in response to significant changes in processes or output of the subentity.
(3) A description of the subentity and its primary economic activity or activities, such as electricity generation, product manufacturing, service provider, freight transport, or household operation; and
(4) A description of the emission sources or sinks covered, such as fossil fuel power plants, manufacturing facilities, commercial office buildings or heavy-duty vehicles.
(f)
Changes in calculation methods, base periods and base values.
When significant changes occur in the composition or output of reporting entities, a reporting entity may need to change previously specified calculation methods, base periods or base values. A reporting entity should make such changes only if necessary and it should fully document the reasons for any changes. The Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13) describe when such changes should be made and what information on such changes must be provided to DOE. In general, such changes should not result in any alterations to previously reported or registered emission reductions. A reporting entity may alter previously reported or registered emission reductions only if necessary to correct significant errors.
(g)
Continuous reporting.
To ensure that the summation of entity annual reports accurately represents net, multi-year emission reductions, an entity must submit a report every year, beginning with the first reduction year. An entity may use a specific base period to determine emission reductions in a given future year only if the entity has submitted qualified reports for each intervening year. If an interruption occurs in the annual reports of an entity, the entity must subsequently report on all missing years prior to qualifying for the registration of additional emission reductions.
(h)
Calculation methods.
An entity must calculate any change in emissions, avoided emissions or sequestration using one or more of the methods described in this paragraph and in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13).
(1)
Changes in emissions intensity.
An entity may use emissions intensity as a basis for determining emission reductions as long as the entity selects a measure of output that is:
(i) A reasonable indicator of the output produced by the entity;
(ii) A reliable indicator of changes in the entity's activities;
(iii) Related to emissions levels; and
(iv) Any appropriate adjustments for acquisitions, divestitures, insourcing, outsourcing, or changes in products have been made, as described in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13).
(2)
Changes in absolute emissions.
An entity may use changes in the absolute (actual) emissions (direct and/or indirect) as a basis for determining net emission reductions as long as the entity makes only those adjustments required by the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13). An entity intending to register emission reductions may use this method only if the entity demonstrates in its report that any reductions derived from such changes were not achieved as a result of reductions in the output of the entity, and certifies that emission reductions are not the result of major shifts in the types of products or services produced. Entities may report, but not register, such reductions even if the output associated with such emissions is declining.
(3)
Changes in carbon storage (for actions within entity boundaries).
An entity may use changes in carbon storage as a basis for determining net emission reductions as long as the entity uses estimation and measurement methods that comply with the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13), and has included an assessment of the net changes in all sinks in its inventory.
(4)
Changes in avoided emissions (for actions within entity boundaries).
An entity may use changes in avoided emissions to determine its emission reductions. Avoided emissions eligible to be included in the calculation of net emission reductions that qualify for registration include those associated with the sale of electricity, steam, hot water or chilled water generated from non-emitting or low-emitting sources as a basis for determining net emission reductions as long as:
(i) The measurement and calculation methods used comply with the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13);
(ii) The entity certifies that any increased sales were not attributable to the acquisition of a generating facility that had been previously operated, unless the entity's base period includes generation values from the acquired facility's operation prior to its acquisition; and
(iii) Generators of distributed energy that have net emissions in their base period and intend to report reductions resulting from changes in eligible avoided emissions, use a method specified in the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13) that integrates the calculation of reductions resulting from both changes in emissions intensity and changes in avoided emissions.
(5)
Action-specific emission reductions (for actions within entity boundaries).
A number of source- or situation-specific methods are provided in the Technical Guidelines and these methods must be used to assess the annual changes in emissions for the specific sources or situation addressed by these methods. In addition, a generic action-specific method is identified in the Technical Guidelines. An entity intending to register reductions may use the generic action-specific approach only if it is not possible to measure accurately emission changes by using one of the methods identified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (h)(4) of this section. Entities that intend to register reductions and that use the generic action-specific approach must explain why it is not possible to use any of these other methods. An entity not intending to register reductions may use the generic action-specific method to determine emission reductions, as long as the entity demonstrates that the estimate is based on analysis that:
(i) Uses output, utilization and other factors that are consistent, to the maximum extent practicable, with the action's actual performance in the year for which reductions are being reported;
(ii) Excludes any emission reductions that might have resulted from reduced output or were caused by actions likely to be associated with increases in emissions elsewhere within the entity's operations; and
(iii) Uses methods that are in compliance with the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13).
(i)
Summary description of actions taken to reduce emissions.
Each reported emission reduction must be accompanied by an identification of the types of actions that were the likely cause of the reductions achieved. Entities are also encouraged to include in their reports information on the benefits and costs of the actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as the expected rates of return, life cycle costs or benefit to cost ratios, using appropriate discount rates.
(j)
Emission reductions associated with plant closings, voluntary actions and government (including non-U.S. regulatory regimes) requirements.
(1) Each report of emission reductions must indicate whether the reported emission reductions were the result, in whole or in part, of plant closings, voluntary actions, or government requirements. EIA will presume that reductions that were not the result of plant closings or government requirements are the result of voluntary actions.
(2) If emission reductions were, in whole or in part, the direct result of plant closings that caused a decline in output, the report must identify the reductions as such; these reductions do not qualify for registration. EIA will presume that reductions calculated using the emissions intensity method do not result from a decline in output.
(3) If the reductions were associated, in whole or part, with U.S. or non-U.S. government requirements, the report should identify the government requirement involved and the effect these requirements had on the reported emission reductions. If, as a result of the reduction, a non-U.S. government issued to the reporting entity a credit or other financial benefit or regulatory relief, the report should identify the government requirement involved and describe the specific form of benefit or relief provided.
(k)
Determining the entity responsible for emission reductions.
The entity that EIA will presume to be responsible for emission reduction, avoided emission or sequestered carbon is the entity with financial control of the facility, land or vehicle which generated the reported emissions, generated the energy that was sold so as to avoid other emissions, or was the place where the sequestration action occurred. If control is shared, reporting of the associated emission reductions should be determined by agreement between the entities involved so as to avoid double-counting; this agreement must be reflected in the entity statement and in any report of emission reductions. EIA will presume that an entity is not responsible for any emission reductions associated with a facility, property or vehicle excluded from its entity statement.
§ 300.9
Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
(a)
Starting to report under the guidelines.
An entity may report emissions and sequestration on an annual basis beginning in any year, but no earlier than the base period of 1987-1990 specified in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. To be recognized under these guidelines, all reports must conform to the measurement methods established by the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13).
(b)
Revisions to reports submitted under the guidelines.
(1) Once EIA has accepted a report under this part, it may be revised by the reporting entity only under the circumstances specified in this paragraph and related provisions of the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13). In general:
(i) Revised reports may be submitted to correct errors that have a significant effect on previously estimated emissions or emission reductions; and
(ii) Emission inventories may be revised in order to create a consistent time series based on improvements in
the emission estimation or measurement techniques used.
(2) Reporting entities must provide the corrected or improved data to EIA, together with an explanation of the significance of the change and its justification.
(3) If a change in calculation methods (for inventories or reductions) is made for a particular year, the reporting entity must, if feasible, revise its base value to assure methodological consistency with the reporting year value.
(c)
Definition and deadline for annual reports.
Entities must report emissions on a calendar year basis, from January 1 to December 31. To be included in the earliest possible EIA annual report of greenhouse gas emissions reported under this part, entity reports that have not been independently verified must be submitted to DOE no later than July 1 for emissions occurring during the previous calendar year. Reports that have been independently verified must be submitted by September 1 for emissions occurring during the previous year.
(d)
Recordkeeping.
Entities intending to register reductions must maintain adequate supporting records of base period data for the duration of their participation in the 1605(b) program. Supporting records for all reporting year data must be maintained for at least three years subsequent to the relevant reporting year to enable verification of all information reported. The records should document the basis for the entity's report to EIA, including:
(1) The content of entity statements, including the identification of the specific facilities, buildings, land holding and other operations or emission sources covered by the entity's reports and the legal, equity, operational and other bases for their inclusion;
(2) Information on the identification and assessment of changes in entity boundaries, processes or products that might have to be reported to EIA;
(3) Any agreements or relevant communications with other entities or third parties regarding the reporting of emissions or emission reductions associated with sources the ownership or operational control of which is shared;
(4) Information on the methods used to measure or estimate emissions, and the data collection and management systems used to gather and prepare this data for inclusion in reports;
(5) Information on the methods used to calculate emission reductions, including the basis for:
(i) The selection of the specific output measures used, and the data collection and management systems used to gather and prepare output data for use in the calculation of emission reductions;
(ii) The selection and modification of all base years, base periods and baselines used in the calculation of emission reductions;
(iii) Any baseline adjustments made to reflect acquisitions, divestitures or other changes;
(iv) Any models or other estimation methods used; and
(v) Any internal or independent verification procedures undertaken.
(e)
Confidentiality.
DOE will protect trade secret and commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential as provided in 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). An entity must clearly indicate in its 1605(b) report the information for which it requests confidentiality. DOE will handle requests for confidentiality of information submitted in 1605(b) reports in accordance with the process established in DOE's Freedom of Information regulations at 10 CFR § 1004.11.
§ 300.10
Certification of reports.
(a)
General requirement and certifying official
: All reports submitted to EIA must include a certification statement, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, signed by a certifying official of the reporting entity. A household report may be certified by one of its members. All other reports must be certified by the chief executive officer, agency head, or an officer or employee of the entity who is responsible for reporting the entity's compliance with environmental regulations.
(b)
Certification statement requirements.
All entities, whether reporting or registering reductions, must certify the following:
(1) The information reported is accurate and complete;
(2) The information reported has been compiled in accordance with this part; and
(3) The information reported is consistent with information submitted in prior years, if any, or any inconsistencies with prior year's information are documented and explained in the entity statement.
(c)
Additional requirements for registering.
The certification statement of an entity registering reductions must also certify that:
(1) The entity took reasonable steps to ensure that direct emissions, emission reductions, and/or sequestration reported are neither double counted nor reported by any other entity. Reasonable steps include telephone, fax, letter, or e-mail communications to ensure that another entity does not intend to report the same emissions, emission reductions, and/or sequestration to DOE. Direct communications of this kind with participants in demand-side management or other programs directed at very small emitters are not required;
(2) Any emission reductions reported or registered by the entity that were achieved by another entity (other than a very small emitter that participated in a demand-side management or other program) are included in the entity's report only if:
(i) The other entity does not intend to report or register theses reductions directly;
(ii) There exists a written agreement with each other entity providing that the reporting entity is the entity entitled to report or register these emission reductions; and
(iii) The information reported on the other entity would meet the requirements of this part if the entity were reporting directly to DOE;
(3) None of the emissions, emission reductions, or sequestration reported were produced by shifting emissions to other entities or to non-reporting parts of the entity;
(4) None of any reported changes in avoided emissions associated with the sale of electricity, steam, hot or chilled water generated from non-emitting or low-emitting sources are attributable to the acquisition of a generating facility that has been previously operated, unless the entity's base period includes generation values from the acquiring facility's operation prior to its acquisition;
(5) The entity maintains records documenting the analysis and calculations underpinning the data reported on this form and records documenting the analysis and calculations underpinning the base values used in calculating annual reductions are maintained in accordance with § 300.9(d) of this part; and
(6) The entity has, or has not, obtained independent verification of the report, as described in § 300.11.
§ 300.11
Independent verification.
(a)
General.
Entities are encouraged to have their annual reports reviewed by independent and qualified auditors, as described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (f) of this section.
(b)
Qualifications of verifiers.
(1) DOE envisions that independent verification will be performed by professional verifiers (
i.e.,
individuals or companies that provide verification or “attestation” services). EIA will consider a report to the program to be independently verified if:
(i) The lead individual verifier and other members of the verification team are accredited by one or more independent and nationally-recognized accreditation programs, described in paragraph (c) of this section, for the types of professionals needed to determine compliance with DOE's 1605(b) guidelines;
(ii) The lead verifier has experience managing an auditing or verification process, including the recruitment and allocation of other individual verifiers, and has been empowered to make decisions relevant to the provision of a verification statement; and
(iii) All members of a verification team have education, training and/or professional experience that matches the tasks performed by the individual verifiers, as deemed necessary by the verifier accreditation program.
(2) As further guidance, all members of the verification team should be familiar with:
(i) The subject matter covered by the scope of the verification;
(ii) The requirements of this part;
(iii) Greenhouse gas emission and emission reduction quantification;
(iv) Data and information auditing sampling methods; and
(v) Risk assessment and methodologies and materiality analysis procedures outlined by other domestic and international standards.
(3) An individual verifier should have a professional degree or accreditation in engineering (environmental, industrial, chemical), accounting, economics, or a related field, supplemented by specific training and/or experience in emissions reporting and accounting, and should have his or her qualifications and continuing education periodically reviewed by an accreditation program. The skills required for verification are often cross-disciplinary. For example, an individual verifier reviewing a coal electric utility should be knowledgeable about mass balance calculations, fuel purchasing accounting, flows and stocks of coals, coal-fired boiler operation, and issues of entity definition.
(4) Companies that provide verification services must use professionals that possess the necessary skills and proficiency levels for the types of entities for which they provide verification services. Continuing training may be required to ensure all individuals have up-to-date knowledge regarding the tasks they perform.
(c)
Qualifications of organizations accrediting verifiers.
Organizations that accredit individual verifiers must be nationally recognized certification programs. They may include, but are not limited to the: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants; American National Standards Institute's Registrar Accreditation Board program for Environmental Management System auditors (ANSI-RAB-EMS); Board of Environmental, Health and Safety Auditor Certification: California Climate Action Registry; Clean Development Mechanism Executive Board; and the United Kingdom Accreditation Scheme.
(d)
Scope of verification.
(1) As part of any independent verification, qualified verifiers must use their expertise and professional judgment to verify for accuracy, completeness and consistency with DOE's guidelines of:
(i) The content of entity statements, annual reports and the supporting records maintained by the entity;
(ii) The representation in entity statements (or lack thereof) of any significant changes in entity boundaries, products, or processes;
(iii) The procedures and methods used to collect emissions and output data, and calculate emission reductions (for entities with widely dispersed operations, this process should include on-site reviews of a sample of the facilities);
(iv) Relevant personnel training and management systems; and
(v) Relevant quality assurance/quality control procedures.
(2) DOE expects qualified verifiers to refer to the growing body of literature on methods of evaluating the elements listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, such as the California Climate Action Registry Certification Protocol, the Climate Leaders Inventory Management Plan Checklist, and the draft ISO 14064.3 Protocol for Validation, Verification and Certification.
(e)
Verification statement.
Both the verifier and, if relevant, an officer of the company providing the verification service must sign the verification statement. The verification statement shall attest to the following:
(1) The verifier has examined all components listed in paragraph (d) of this section;
(2) The information reported in the verified entity report and this verification statement is accurate and complete;
(3) The information reported by the entity has been compiled in accordance with this part;
(4) The information reported on the entity report is consistent with information submitted in prior years, if any, or any inconsistencies with prior year's information are documented and explained in the entity statement;
(5) The verifier used due diligence to assure that direct emissions, emission reductions, and/or sequestration reported are not reported by any other entity;
(6) Any emissions, emission reductions, or sequestration that were
achieved by a third-party entity are included in this report only if there exists a written agreement with each third party indicating that they have agreed that the reporting entity should be recognized as the entity entitled to report these emissions, emission reductions, or sequestration;
(7) None of the emissions, emission reductions, or sequestration reported was produced by shifting emissions to other entities or to non-reporting parts of the entity;
(8) No reported changes in avoided emissions associated with the sale of electricity, steam, hot or chilled water generated from non-emitting or low-emitting sources are attributable to the acquisition of a generating facility that has been previously operated, unless the base year generation values are derived from records of the facility's operation prior to its acquisition;
(9) The verifying entity has procedures in place for the maintenance of records that are sufficient to document the analysis and calculations underpinning this verification. The verifying entity shall maintain such records related to base period data submitted by the reporting entity for the duration of the reporting entity's participation in the 1605(b) program and records related to all other verified data for a period of no less than three years; and
(10) The independent verifier is not owned in whole or part by the reporting entity, nor provides any ongoing operational or support services to the entity, except services consistent with independent financial accounting or independent certification of compliance with government or private standards.
(f)
Qualifying as an independent verifier.
An independent verifier may not be owned in whole or part by the reporting entity, nor may it provide any ongoing operational or support services to the entity, except services consistent with independent financial accounting or independent certification of compliance with government or private standards.
§ 300.12
Acceptance of reports and registration of entity emission reductions.
(a)
Acceptance of reports.
EIA will review all reports to ensure they are consistent with this part and with the Technical Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 300.13). EIA will also review all reports for completeness, internal consistency, arithmetic accuracy and plausibility. Subject to the availability of adequate resources, EIA intends to notify entities of the acceptance or rejection of any report within six months of its receipt.
(b)
Registration of emission reductions.
EIA will review each accepted report to determine if emission reductions were calculated using an acceptable base period (usually ending no earlier than 2002), and to confirm that the report complies with the other provisions of this part. EIA will also review its records to verify that the reporting entity has submitted accepted annual reports for each year between the establishment of its base period and the year covered by the current report. EIA will notify the entity that reductions meeting these requirements have been credited to the entity as “registered reductions” which can be held by the reporting entity for use (including transfer to other entities) in the event a future program that recognizes such reductions is enacted into law.
(c)
Rejection of reports.
If EIA does not accept a report or if it determines that emission reductions intended for registration do not qualify, EIA will return the report to the sender with an explanation of its inadequacies. The reporting entity may resubmit a modified report for further consideration at any time.
(d)
EIA database and summary reports.
The Administrator of EIA will establish a publicly accessible database composed of all reports that meet the definitional, measurement, calculation, and certification requirements of these guidelines. EIA will maintain separate subtotals of direct emissions, indirect emissions and carbon fluxes. A portion of the database will provide summary information on the emissions and registered emission reductions of each reporting entity.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 429.1
Purpose and scope.
This part sets forth the procedures for certification, determination and enforcement of compliance of covered products and covered equipment with the applicable energy conservation standards set forth in parts 430 and 431 of this subchapter.
[87 FR 63646, Oct. 19, 2022]
§ 429.2
Definitions.
(a) The definitions found in 10 CFR parts 430 and 431 apply for purposes of this part.
(b) The following definitions apply for the purposes of this part. Any words or terms defined in this section or elsewhere in this part shall be defined as provided in sections 321 and 340 of the Energy Policy Conservation Act, as amended, hereinafter referred to as “the Act.”
Energy conservation standard
means any standards meeting the definitions of that term in 42 U.S.C. 6291(6) and 42 U.S.C. 6311(18) as well as any other water conservation standards and design requirements found in this part or parts 430 or 431.
Engineered-to-order
means a basic model of commercial water heating equipment, commercial packaged boiler, commercial heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment, or commercial refrigeration equipment that is: Not listed in any catalogs or marketing literature and designed and built to specific customer requirements. A unit of an engineered-to-order basic model is not offered as a set of options (e.g., configure-to-order, menu-system).
Independent
means, in the context of a nationally recognized certification program, or accreditation program for electric motors, an entity that is not controlled by, or under common control with, electric motor manufacturers, importers, private labelers, or vendors, and that has no affiliation, financial ties, or contractual agreements, apparently or otherwise, with such entities that would:
(i) Hinder the ability of the program to evaluate fully or report the measured or calculated energy efficiency of any electric motor, or
(ii) Create any potential or actual conflict of interest that would undermine the validity of said evaluation. For purposes of this definition, financial ties or contractual agreements between an electric motor manufacturer, importer, private labeler or vendor and a nationally recognized certification program, or accreditation program exclusively for certification or accreditation services does not negate an otherwise independent relationship.
Manufacturer's model number
means the identifier used by a manufacturer to uniquely identify the group of identical or essentially identical covered products or covered equipment to which a particular unit belongs. The manufacturer's model number typically appears on the product nameplates, in product catalogs and in other product advertising literature.

# Subpart B—Certification
§ 429.10
Purpose and scope.
This subpart sets forth the procedures for manufacturers to certify that their covered products and covered equipment comply with the applicable energy conservation standards.
§ 429.11
General sampling requirements for selecting units to be tested.
(a) When testing of covered products or covered equipment is required to comply with section 323(c) of the Act, or to comply with rules prescribed under sections 324, 325, 342, 344, 345 or 346 of the Act, a sample comprised of production units (or units representative of production units) of the basic model being tested must be selected at random and tested and must meet the criteria found in §§ 429.14 through 429.69 and § 429.76. Components of similar design may be substituted without additional testing if the substitution does not affect energy or water consumption. Any represented values of measures of energy efficiency, water efficiency, energy consumption, or water consumption for all individual models represented by a given basic model must be the same, except for central air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps, as specified in § 429.16; and
(b) The minimum number of units tested shall be no less than two, except where:
(1) A different minimum limit is specified in §§ 429.14 through 429.69 and § 429.76; or
(2) Only one unit of the basic model is produced, in which case, that unit must be tested and the test results must demonstrate that the basic model performs at or better than the applicable standard(s). If one or more units of the basic model are manufactured subsequently, compliance with the default sampling and representations provisions is required.

(1) Compartment volume used to determine product category shall be, for each compartment, the mean of the volumes of that specific compartment for the sample of tested units of the basic model, measured according to the provisions in section 4.1 of appendix A of subpart B of part 430 of this chapter for refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers and section 4.1 of appendix B of subpart B of part 430 of this chapter for freezers, or, for each compartment, the volume of that specific compartment calculated for the basic model in accordance with § 429.72(c).
(2) Determination of the compartment temperature ranges shall be based on operation under the conditions specified and using measurement of compartment temperature as specified in appendix A of subpart B of part 430 of this chapter for refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers and appendix B of subpart B of part 430 of this chapter for freezers. The determination of compartment status may require evaluation of a model at the extremes of the range of user-selectable temperature control settings. If the temperature ranges for the same compartment of multiple units of a sample are different, the maximum and minimum compartment temperatures for compartment status determination shall be based on the mean measurements for the units in the sample.

(2)
P
W,OFF.
If individual models of single-package systems or individual combinations (or “tested combinations”) of split systems that are otherwise identical are offered with multiple options for off mode-related components, determine the represented value for the individual model/combination with the crankcase heater and controls that are the most consumptive. A manufacturer may also determine represented values for individual models/combinations with less consumptive off mode options; however, all such options must be identified with different model numbers for single-package systems or for outdoor units (in the case of split systems).
(3)
Refrigerants.
(i) If a model of outdoor unit (used in a single-split, multi-split, multi-circuit, multi-head mini-split, and/or outdoor unit with no match system) is distributed in commerce and approved for use with multiple refrigerants, a manufacturer must determine all represented values for that model using each refrigerant that can be used in an individual combination of the basic model (including outdoor units with no match or “tested combinations”). This requirement may apply across the listed categories in the table in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. A refrigerant is considered approved for use if it is listed on the nameplate of the outdoor unit. If any
of the refrigerants approved for use is HCFC-22 or has a 95 °F midpoint saturation absolute pressure that is ± 18 percent of the 95 °F saturation absolute pressure for HCFC-22, or if there are no refrigerants designated as approved for use, a manufacturer must determine represented values (including SEER, EER, HSPF, SEER2, EER2, HSPF2, P
W,OFF
, cooling capacity, and heating capacity, as applicable) for, at a minimum, an outdoor unit with no match. If a model of outdoor unit is not charged with a specified refrigerant from the point of manufacture or if the unit is shipped requiring the addition of more than two pounds of refrigerant to meet the charge required for testing per section 2.2.5 of appendix M or appendix M1 (unless either (a) the factory charge is equal to or greater than 70% of the outdoor unit internal volume times the liquid density of refrigerant at 95 °F or (b) an A2L refrigerant is approved for use and listed in the certification report), a manufacturer must determine represented values (including SEER, EER, HSPF, SEER2, EER2, HSPF2, P
W,OFF
, cooling capacity, and heating capacity, as applicable) for, at a minimum, an outdoor unit with no match.
(ii) If a model is approved for use with multiple refrigerants, a manufacturer may make multiple separate representations for the performance of that model (all within the same individual combination or outdoor unit with no match) using the multiple approved refrigerants. In the alternative, manufacturers may certify the model (all within the same individual combination or outdoor unit with no match) with a single representation, provided that the represented value is no more efficient than its performance using the least-efficient refrigerant. If a manufacturer certifies a single model with multiple representations for the different approved refrigerants, it may use an AEDM to determine the represented values for all other refrigerants besides the refrigerant used for testing. A single representation made for multiple refrigerants may not include equipment in multiple categories or equipment subcategories listed in the table in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(4)
Limitations for represented values of individual combinations.
The following paragraphs explains the limitations for represented values of individual combinations (or “tested combinations”).
(i)
Regional.
A basic model (model of outdoor unit) may only be certified as compliant with a regional standard if all individual combinations within that basic model meet the regional standard for which it is certified, including the coil-only combination as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, as applicable. A model of outdoor unit that is certified below a regional standard can only be rated and certified as compliant with a regional standard if the model of outdoor unit has a unique model number and has been certified as a different basic model for distribution in each region, where the basic model(s) certified as compliant with a regional standard meet the requirements of the first sentence. An ICM cannot certify an individual combination with a rating that is compliant with a regional standard if the individual combination includes a model of outdoor unit that the OUM has certified with a rating that is not compliant with a regional standard. Conversely, an ICM cannot certify an individual combination with a rating that is not compliant with a regional standard if the individual combination includes a model of outdoor unit that an OUM has certified with a rating that is compliant with a regional standard.
(ii)
Multiple product classes.
Models of outdoor units that are rated and distributed in individual combinations that span multiple product classes must be tested, rated, and certified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section as compliant with the applicable standard for each product class. This includes multi-split systems, multi-circuit systems, and multi-head mini-split systems with a represented value for a mixed combination including both SDHV and either non-ducted or ducted indoor units.
(5)
Requirements.
All represented values under paragraph (a) of this section must be based on testing in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section or the application of an AEDM or other methodology as allowed in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Units tested
—(1)
General.
The general requirements of § 429.11 apply to central air conditioners and heat pumps; and
(2)
Individual model/combination selection for testing.
(i) The table identifies the minimum testing requirements for each basic model that includes multiple individual models/combinations; if a basic model spans multiple categories or subcategories listed in the table, multiple testing requirements apply. For each basic model that includes only one individual model/combination, test that individual model/combination. For single-split-system non-space-constrained air conditioners and heat pumps, when testing is required in accordance with 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, appendix M1, these requirements do not apply until July 1, 2024, provided that the manufacturer is certifying compliance of all basic models using an AEDM in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section and paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of § 429.70.

A higher-static condenser fan/motor assembly designed for external ducting of condenser air that provides greater pressure rise and has a higher rated motor horsepower than the condenser fan provided as a standard component with the equipment.
Non-Standard High-Static Indoor Fan Motors
The standard indoor fan motor is the motor specified in the manufacturer's installation instructions for testing and shall be distributed in commerce as part of a particular model. A non-standard motor is an indoor fan motor that is not the standard indoor fan motor and that is distributed in commerce as part of an individual model within the same basic model.
For a non-standard high-static indoor fan motor(s) to be considered a specific component for a basic model (and thus subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(vi)(A)(
2
) of this section), the following provisions must be met:
(1) Non-standard high-static indoor fan motor(s) must meet the minimum allowable efficiency determined per section D.3.1 of AHRI 1340-2023 (incorporated by reference, see § 429.4) for non-standard high-static indoor fan motors or per section D.3.2 of AHRI 1340-2023 for non-standard high-static indoor integrated fan and motor combinations.
(2) If the standard indoor fan motor can vary fan speed through control system adjustment of motor speed, all non-standard high-static indoor fan motors must also allow speed control (including with the use of variable-frequency drive).
Powered Exhaust/Powered Return Air Fans
A powered exhaust fan is a fan that transfers directly to the outside a portion of the building air that is returning to the unit, rather than allowing it to recirculate to the indoor coil and back to the building. A powered return fan is a fan that draws building air into the equipment.
Process Heat recovery/Reclaim Coils/Thermal Storage
A heat exchanger located inside the unit that conditions the equipment's supply air using energy transferred from an external source using a vapor, gas, or liquid.
Refrigerant Reheat Coils
A heat exchanger located downstream of the indoor coil that heats the supply air during cooling operation using high pressure refrigerant in order to increase the ratio of moisture removal to cooling capacity provided by the equipment.
Sound Traps/Sound Attenuators
An assembly of structures through which the supply air passes before leaving the equipment or through which the return air from the building passes immediately after entering the equipment for which the sound insertion loss is at least 6 dB for the 125 Hz octave band frequency range.
Steam/Hydronic Heat Coils
Coils used to provide supplemental heating.
Ventilation Energy Recovery System (VERS)
An assembly that preconditions outdoor air entering the equipment through direct or indirect thermal and/or moisture exchange with the exhaust air, which is defined as the building air being exhausted to the outside from the equipment.

Alternative efficiency determination method.
In lieu of testing, the represented value of nominal full-load efficiency for a basic model of electric motor must be determined through the application of an AEDM pursuant to the requirements of § 429.70(j) and the provisions of this paragraph (b) and paragraph (c) of this section, where:
(i) The average full-load efficiency of any basic model used to validate an AEDM must be calculated under paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii) The represented value is the nominal full-load efficiency of a basic model of electric motor and is to be used in marketing materials and all public representations, as the certified value of efficiency, and on the nameplate. (
See
§ 431.31(a) of this subchapter.) Determine the nominal full-load efficiency by selecting a value from the “Nominal Full-Load Efficiency” table in appendix B to subpart B of this part that is no greater than the simulated full-load efficiency predicted by the AEDM for the basic model.
(3)
Use of a certification program or accredited laboratory.
(i) A manufacturer may have a certification program, that DOE has classified as nationally recognized under § 429.73, certify the nominal full-load efficiency of a basic model of electric motor, and issue a certificate of conformity for the motor.
(ii) For each basic model for which a certification program is not used as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, any testing of the motor pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section to determine its energy efficiency must be carried out in an accredited laboratory that meets the requirements of § 431.18 of this subchapter;
(c)
Additional testing requirements applicable when a certification program is not used
—(1)
Selection of units for testing.
For each basic model selected for testing, a sample of units shall be selected at random and tested. Components of similar design may be substituted without requiring additional testing if the represented measures of energy consumption continue to satisfy the applicable sampling provision.
(2)
Sampling requirements.
The sample shall be comprised of production units of the basic model, or units that are representative of such production units. The sample size shall be not
fewer than five units, except that when fewer than five units of a basic model would be produced over a reasonable period of time (approximately 180 days), then each unit shall be tested. In a test of compliance with a represented average or nominal efficiency:
(i) The average full-load efficiency of the sample, which is defined by:
ER19OC22.000
where
x
i
is the measured full-load efficiency of unit

Refrigerants.
(i) If a model of outdoor unit (used in a single-split, multi-split, multi-circuit, multi-head mini-split, and/or outdoor unit with no match system) is distributed in commerce and approved for use with multiple refrigerants, a manufacturer must determine all represented values for that model using each refrigerant that can be used in an individual combination of the basic model (including outdoor units with no match or “tested combinations”). This requirement may apply across the listed categories in table 1 to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A refrigerant is considered approved for use if it is listed on the nameplate of the outdoor unit. If any of the refrigerants approved for use is HCFC-22 or has a 95 °F midpoint saturation absolute pressure that is ±18 percent of the 95 °F saturation absolute
pressure for HCFC-22, or if there are no refrigerants designated as approved for use, a manufacturer must determine represented values (including SEER2, HSPF2, cooling capacity, and heating capacity, as applicable) for, at a minimum, an outdoor unit with no match. If a model of outdoor unit is not charged with a specified refrigerant from the point of manufacture or if the unit is shipped requiring the addition of more than two pounds of refrigerant to meet the charge required for testing per Section 5.1.8 of AHRI 210/240-2023 (incorporated by reference, see § 429.4) (unless either {a} the factory charge is equal to or greater than 70 percent of the outdoor unit internal volume multiplied by the liquid density of refrigerant at 95 °F or {b} an A2L refrigerant is approved for use and listed in the certification report), a manufacturer must determine represented values (including SEER2, HSPF2, cooling capacity, and heating capacity, as applicable) for, at a minimum, an outdoor unit with no match.
(ii) If a model is approved for use with multiple refrigerants, a manufacturer may make multiple separate representations for the performance of that model (all within the same individual combination or outdoor unit with no match) using the multiple approved refrigerants. In the alternative, manufacturers may certify the model (all within the same individual combination or outdoor unit with no match) with a single representation, provided that the represented value is no more efficient than its performance using the least-efficient refrigerant. A single representation made for multiple refrigerants may not include equipment in multiple categories or equipment subcategories listed in table 1 to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

For multi-split systems, multi-circuit systems, and multi-head mini-split systems.
The following applies:
(i) For each non-SDHV basic model, at a minimum, a manufacturer must test the model of outdoor unit with a
“tested combination” composed entirely of non-ducted indoor units. For any models of outdoor units also sold with models of ducted indoor units, a manufacturer must test a second “tested combination” composed entirely of ducted indoor units (in addition to the non-ducted combination). The ducted “tested combination” must comprise the highest static variety of ducted indoor unit distributed in commerce (
i.e.,
conventional, mid-static, or low-static).

i.e.,
conventional, low static, or mid-static) other than a variety for which a representation is required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section the manufacturer must conduct testing of a tested combination according to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(iii) For basic models that include mixed combinations of indoor units (
i.e.,
combinations that are comprised of any two of the following varieties—non-ducted, low-static, mid-static, and conventional ducted indoor units), the represented value for the mixed combination is the mean of the represented values for the individual component combinations as determined in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) and (d)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(iv) For each SDHV basic model distributed in commerce by an OUM, the OUM must, at a minimum, test the model of outdoor unit with a “tested combination” composed entirely of SDHV indoor units. For each SDHV basic model distributed in commerce by an ICM, the ICM must test the model of indoor unit with a “tested combination” composed entirely of SDHV indoor units, where the outdoor unit is the least efficient model of outdoor unit with which the SDHV indoor unit will be paired. The least efficient model of outdoor unit is the model of outdoor unit in the lowest SEER2 combination as certified by the outdoor unit manufacturer. If there are multiple outdoor unit models with the same lowest SEER2 represented value, the indoor coil manufacturer may select one for testing purposes.
(v) For basic models that include SDHV and an indoor unit of another variety (
i.e.,
non-ducted, low-static, mid-static, and conventional ducted), the represented value for the mixed SDHV/other combination is the mean of the represented values for the SDHV and other tested combination as determined in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) and paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (ii) of this section.
(vi) All other individual combinations of models of indoor units for the same model of outdoor unit for which the manufacturer chooses to make representations must be rated as separate basic models, and the provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) and (d)(3)(i) through (v) of this section apply.

§ 429.70
Alternative methods for determining energy efficiency and energy use.
(a)
General.
A manufacturer of covered products or covered equipment explicitly authorized to use an AEDM in §§ 429.14 through 429.69 may not distribute any basic model of such product or equipment in commerce unless the manufacturer has determined the energy consumption or energy efficiency of the basic model, either from testing the basic model in conjunction with DOE's certification sampling plans and statistics or from applying an alternative method for determining energy efficiency or energy use (
i.e.,
AEDM) to the basic model, in accordance with the requirements of this section. In instances where a manufacturer has tested a basic model to validate the AEDM, the represented value of energy consumption or efficiency of that basic model must be determined and certified according to results from actual testing in conjunction with 10 CFR part 429, subpart B certification sampling plans and statistics. In addition, a manufacturer may not knowingly use an AEDM to overrate the efficiency of a basic model.
(b)
Testing.
Testing for each covered product or covered equipment must be done in accordance with the sampling plan provisions established in § 429.11 and the testing procedures in parts 430 and 431 of this chapter.

Before using an AEDM, the manufacturer must validate the AEDM's accuracy and reliability as follows:
(i) The manufacturer must select at least the minimum number of basic models for each validation class specified in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section to which the particular AEDM applies. Using the AEDM, calculate the energy use or efficiency for each of the selected basic models.
(A) Except for variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps (other than air-cooled with rated cooling capacity less than 65,000 btu/h) when certifying to standards in terms of IEER, test a single unit of each selected basic model in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. Compare the results from the single unit test and the AEDM energy use or efficiency output according to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The manufacturer is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the AEDM.
(B) For variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps (other than air-cooled with rated cooling capacity less than 65,000 btu/h) when certifying to standards in terms of IEER, the following provisions apply.
(
1
) If a manufacturer makes representations for a single type of indoor unit combination (
i.e.,
only ducted, non-ducted, or SDHV indoor unit combinations) across all the basic models for which an AEDM applies, the manufacturer must test at least a single tested combination of that type of indoor unit combination for each selected basic model in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
(
2
) If a manufacturer makes representations for two types of indoor unit combinations (
i.e.,
ducted, non-ducted, and/or SDHV) within or across all the basic models for which the AEDM applies, the manufacturer must test at least a single tested combination of a selected basic model for one of those two types of indoor unit combination, and at least a single tested combination of a different selected basic model for the other of those two types of indoor unit combination, each tested in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
(
3
) If a manufacturer makes representations for all three types of indoor unit combinations (
i.e.,
ducted, non-ducted, and SDHV) within or across basic models for which the AEDM applies, the manufacturer must test at least a single tested combination of a selected basic model as a non-ducted tested combination and a single tested combination of a different selected basic model as a ducted tested combination, each in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
(
4
) In all cases, compare the results from each tested basic model and the AEDM energy use or efficiency output according to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The manufacturer is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the AEDM.
(ii)
Individual model tolerances.
(A) For those covered products with an energy-efficiency metric, the predicted efficiency for each model calculated by applying the AEDM may not be more than five percent greater than the efficiency determined from the corresponding test of the model.
(B) For those covered products with an energy-consumption metric, the predicted energy consumption for each
model, calculated by applying the AEDM, may not be more than five percent less than the energy consumption determined from the corresponding test of the model.
(C) For all covered products, the predicted energy efficiency or consumption for each model calculated by applying the AEDM must meet or exceed the applicable federal energy conservation performance standard.
(D) An AEDM that is validated based on test results obtained from one or more field tests (pursuant to § 431.86(c)) can only be used to certify the performance of basic models of commercial packaged boilers with a certified rated input greater than 5,000,000 Btu/h.
(iii)
Additional test unit requirements.
(A) Each AEDM must be supported by test data obtained from physical tests of current models; and

The minimum number of tests indicated above must be comprised of a transparent model, a solid model, a vertical model, a semi-vertical model, a horizontal model, and a service-over-the counter model, as applicable based on the equipment offering. However, manufacturers do not need to include all types of these models if it will increase the minimum number of tests that need to be conducted.
(3)
AEDM records retention requirements.
If a manufacturer has used an AEDM to determine representative values pursuant to this section, the manufacturer must have available upon request for inspection by the Department records showing:
(i) The AEDM, including the mathematical model, the engineering or statistical analysis, and/or computer simulation or modeling that is the basis of the AEDM;
(ii) Product information, complete test data, AEDM calculations, and the statistical comparisons from the units tested that were used to validate the AEDM pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and
(iii) Product information and AEDM calculations for each basic model to which the AEDM has been applied.
(4)
Additional AEDM requirements.
If requested by the Department and at DOE's discretion, the manufacturer must perform at least one of the following:
(i) Conduct simulations before representatives of the Department to predict the performance of particular basic models of the product to which the AEDM was applied;
(ii) Provide analyses of previous simulations conducted by the manufacturer; or
(iii) Conduct certification testing of basic models selected by the Department.
(5)
AEDM verification testing.
DOE may use the test data for a given individual model generated pursuant to § 429.104 to verify the certified rating determined by an AEDM as long as the following process is followed:
(i)
Selection of units.
DOE will obtain units for test from retail, where available. If units cannot be obtained from retail, DOE will request that a unit be provided by the manufacturer;
(ii)
Lab requirements.
DOE will conduct testing at an independent, third-party testing facility of its choosing. In cases where no third-party laboratory is capable of testing the equipment, it may be tested at a manufacturer's facility upon DOE's request.
(iii)
Manufacturer participation.
(A) Except when testing variable refrigerant flow systems (which are governed by the rules found at § 431.96(f)), testing will be completed without a manufacturer representative on-site. In limited instances further described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, a manufacturer and DOE representative may be present to witness the test set-up.
(B) A manufacturer's representative may request to be on-site to witness the test set-up if:
(
1
) The installation manual for the basic model specifically requires it to be started only by a factory-trained installer; or
(
2
) The manufacturer has elected, as part of the certification of that basic model, to have the opportunity to witness the test set-up. A manufacturer may elect to witness the test set-up for the initial verification test for no more than 10 percent of the manufacturer's basic models submitted for certification and rated with an AEDM per validation class specified in section (c)(2)(iv) of this paragraph. The 10-percent limit applies to all of the eligible basic models submitted for certification by a given manufacturer no matter how many AEDMs a manufacturer has used to develop its ratings. The 10-percent limit is determined by first calculating 10 percent of the total number of basic models rated with an AEDM per validation class, and then truncating the resulting product. Manufacturers who have submitted fewer than 10 basic models rated with an AEDM for certification may elect to have the opportunity to witness the test set-up of one basic model. A manufacturer must identify the basic models it wishes to witness as part of its certification report(s) prior to the basic model being selected for verification testing.
(
3
) In those instances in which a manufacturer has not provided the required information as specified in § 429.12(b)(13) for a given basic model that has been rated and certified as compliant with the applicable standards, a manufacturer is precluded from witnessing the testing set up for that basic model.
(C) A DOE representative will be present for the test set-up in all cases where a manufacturer representative requests to be on-site for the test set-up. The manufacturer's representative cannot communicate with a lab representative outside of the DOE representative's presence.
(D) If DOE has obtained through retail channels a unit for test that meets either of the conditions in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, DOE will notify the manufacturer that the basic model was selected for testing and that the manufacturer may have a representative present for the test set-up. If the manufacturer does not respond within five calendar days of receipt of that notification, the manufacturer waives the option to be present for test set-up, and DOE will proceed with the test set-up without a manufacturer's representative present.
(E) If DOE has obtained directly from the manufacturer a unit for test that meets either of the conditions in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, DOE will notify the manufacturer of the option to be present for the test set-up at the time the unit is purchased. DOE will specify the date (not less than five calendar days) by which the manufacturer must notify DOE whether a manufacturer's representative will be present. If the manufacturer does not notify DOE by the date specified, the manufacturer waives the option to be present for the test set-up, and DOE will proceed with the test set-up without a manufacturer's representative present.
(F) DOE will review the certification submissions from the manufacturer that were on file as of the date DOE purchased a basic model (under paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(D) of this section) or the date DOE notifies the manufacturer that the basic model has been selected for testing (under paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(E) of this section) to determine if the manufacturer has indicated that it intends to witness the test set-up of the selected basic model. DOE will also verify that the manufacturer has not exceeded the allowable limit of witness testing selections as specified in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B)(
2
) of this section. If DOE discovers that the manufacturer exceeded the limits specified in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B)(
2
), DOE will notify the manufacturer of this fact and deny its request to be present for the test set-up of the selected basic model. The manufacturer must update its certification submission to ensure it has not exceeded the allowable limit of witness testing selections as specified in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B)(
2
) to be present at set-up for future selections. At this time DOE will also review the supplemental PDF submission(s) for the selected basic model to determine that all necessary information has been provided to the Department.
(G) If DOE determines, pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, that
the model should be tested at the manufacturer's facility, a DOE representative will be present on site to observe the test set-up and testing with the manufacturer's representative. All testing will be conducted at DOE's direction, which may include DOE-contracted personnel from a third-party lab, as well as the manufacturer's technicians.
(H) As further explained in paragraph (c)(5)(v)(B) of this section, if a manufacturer's representative is present for the initial test set-up for any reason, the manufacturer forfeits any opportunity to request a retest of the basic model. Furthermore, if the manufacturer requests to be on-site for test set-up pursuant to paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section but is not present on site, the manufacturer forfeits any opportunity to request a retest of the basic model.
(iv)
Testing.
At no time during verification testing may the lab and the manufacturer communicate without DOE authorization. All verification testing will be conducted in accordance with the applicable DOE test procedure, as well as each of the following to the extent that they apply:
(A) Any active test procedure waivers that have been granted for the basic model;
(B) Any test procedure guidance that has been issued by DOE;
(C) The installation and operations manual that is shipped with the unit;
(D) Any additional information that was provided by the manufacturer at the time of certification (prior to DOE obtaining the unit for test); and
(E) If during test set-up or testing, the lab indicates to DOE that it needs additional information regarding a given basic model in order to test in accordance with the applicable DOE test procedure, DOE may organize a meeting between DOE, the manufacturer and the lab to provide such information.
(v)
Failure to meet certified rating.
If a model tests worse than its certified rating by an amount exceeding the tolerance prescribed in paragraph (c)(5)(vi) of this section, DOE will notify the manufacturer. DOE will provide the manufacturer with all documentation related to the test set up, test conditions, and test results for the unit. Within the timeframe allotted by DOE, the manufacturer may then:
(A) Present all claims regarding testing validity; and
(B) If the manufacturer was not on site for the initial test set-up, request a retest of the previously tested unit with manufacturer and DOE representatives on-site for the test set-up. DOE will not conduct the retest using a different unit of the same basic model unless DOE and the manufacturer determine it is necessary based on the test results, claims presented, and DOE regulations.
(vi)
Tolerances.
(A) For consumption metrics, the result from a DOE verification test must be less than or equal to the certified rating × (1 + the applicable tolerance).
(B) For efficiency metrics, the result from a DOE verification test must be greater than or equal to the certified rating × (1 − the applicable tolerance).

Invalid rating.
If, following discussions with the manufacturer and a retest where applicable, DOE determines that the verification testing was conducted appropriately in accordance with the DOE test procedure, DOE will issue a determination that the rating for the model is invalid. The manufacturer must elect, within 15 days, one of the following to be completed in a time frame specified by DOE, which is never to exceed 180 days:
(A) Re-rate and re-certify the model based on DOE's test data alone; or
(B) Discontinue the model through the certification process; or
(C) Conduct additional testing and re-rate and re-certify the basic model based on all test data collected, including DOE's test data.
(viii)
AEDM use.
(A) If DOE has determined that a manufacturer made invalid ratings on two or more models rated using the same AEDM within a 24 month period, the manufacturer must take the action listed in the table corresponding to the number of invalid certified ratings. The twenty-four month period begins with a DOE determination that a rating is invalid through the process outlined above. Additional invalid ratings apply for the purposes of determining the appropriate consequences if the subsequent determination(s) is based on selection of a unit for testing within the twenty-four month period (i.e., subsequent determinations need not be made within 24 months).

Required manufacturer actions
2
Submit different test data and reports from testing to validate that AEDM within the validation classes to which it is applied.
1
Adjust the ratings as appropriate.
4
Conduct double the minimum number of validation tests for the validation classes to which the AEDM is applied. Note, the tests required under this paragraph (c)(5)(viii) must be performed on different models than the original tests required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
6
Conduct the minimum number of validation tests for the validation classes to which the AEDM is applied at a third-part test facility; And
Conduct addition testing, which is equal to
1/2
the minimum number of validation tests for the validation classes to which the AEDM is applied , at either the manufacturer's facility or a third-party test facility, at the manufacturer's discretion.
Note, the tests required under this paragraph (c)(5)(viii) must be performed on different models than the original tests performed under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
= 8
Manufacturer has lost privilege to use AEDM. All ratings for models within the validation classes to which the AEDM applied should be rated via testing. Distribution cannot continue until certification(s) are corrected to reflect actual test data.
1
A manufacturer may discuss with DOE's Office of Enforcement whether existing test data on different basic models within the validation classes to which that specific AEDM was applied may be used to meet this requirement.
2
The “same AEDM” means a computer simulation or mathematical model that is identified by the manufacturer at the time of certification as having been used to rate a model or group of models.
3
The twenty-four month period begins with a DOE determination that a rating is invalid through the process outlined above. Additional invalid ratings apply for the purposes of determining the appropriate consequences if the subsequent determination(s) is based on testing of a unit that was selected for testing within the twenty-four month period (i.e., subsequent determinations need not be made within 24 months).
(B) If, as a result of eight or more invalid ratings, a manufacturer has lost the privilege of using an AEDM for rating, the manufacturer may regain the ability to use an AEDM by:
(
1
) Investigating and identifying cause(s) for failures;
(
2
) Taking corrective action to address cause(s);
(
3
) Performing six new tests per validation class, a minimum of two of which must be performed by an independent, third-party laboratory to validate the AEDM; and
(
4
) Obtaining DOE authorization to resume use of the AEDM.
(d)
Alternative efficiency determination method for distribution transformers.
A manufacturer may use an AEDM to determine the efficiency of one or more of its untested basic models only if it determines the efficiency of at least five of its other basic models (selected in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section) through actual testing.

(iii) The manufacturer has substantiated the AEDM, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, by applying it to, and testing, at least five other basic models of the same type,
i.e.,
low-voltage dry-type distribution transformers, medium-voltage dry-type distribution transformers, or liquid-immersed distribution transformers.
(2)
Substantiation of an AEDM.
Before using an AEDM, the manufacturer must substantiate the AEDM's accuracy and reliability as follows:

(ii) Test at least five units of each of these basic models in accordance with the applicable test procedure and § 429.47, and determine the power loss for each of these basic models;
(iii) The predicted total power loss for each of these basic models, calculated by applying the AEDM pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, must be within plus or minus five percent of the mean total power loss determined from the testing of that basic model pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section; and
(iv) Calculate for each of these basic models the percentage that its power loss calculated pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is of its power loss determined from testing pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, compute the average of these percentages, and that calculated average power loss, expressed as a percentage of the average power loss determined from testing, must be no less than 97 percent and no greater than 103 percent.
(3)
Additional testing requirements.
(i) A manufacturer must select basic models for testing in accordance with the following criteria:
(A) Two of the basic models must be among the five basic models with the highest unit volumes of production by the manufacturer in the prior year, or during the prior 12-calendar-month period beginning in 2003,
1
whichever is later;
1
When identifying these five basic models, any basic model that does not comply with Federal energy conservation standards for distribution transformers that may be in effect shall be excluded from consideration.
(B) No two basic models should have the same combination of power and voltage ratings; and
(C) At least one basic model should be single-phase and at least one should be three-phase.
(ii) In any instance where it is impossible for a manufacturer to select basic models for testing in accordance with all of these criteria, the criteria shall be given priority in the order in which they are listed. Within the limits imposed by the criteria, basic models shall be selected randomly.
(4)

A manufacturer may not apply an AEDM to an individual model/combination to determine its represented values (SEER, EER, HSPF, SEER2, EER2, HSPF2, and/or P
W,OFF
) pursuant to this section unless authorized pursuant to § 429.16(d) and:
(i) The AEDM is derived from a mathematical model that estimates the energy efficiency or energy consumption characteristics of the individual model or combination (SEER, EER, HSPF, SEER2, EER2, HSPF2, and/or P
W,OFF
) as measured by the applicable DOE test procedure; and
(ii) The manufacturer has validated the AEDM in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(2)
Validation of an AEDM.
Before using an AEDM, the manufacturer must validate the AEDM's accuracy and reliability as follows:

(
1
) For non-space-constrained single-split system air conditioners and heat pumps rated based on testing in accordance with appendix M to subpart B of part 430, the manufacturer must test each basic model as required under § 429.16(b)(2). Until July 1, 2024, for non-space-constrained single-split-system air conditioners and heat pumps rated based on testing in accordance with appendix M1 to subpart B of part 430, the manufacturer must test a single-unit sample from 20 percent of the basic models distributed in commerce to validate the AEDM. On or after July 1, 2024, for non-space-constrained single-split-system air conditioners and heat pumps rated based on testing in accordance with appendix M1 to subpart B of part 430, the manufacturer must complete testing of each basic model as required under § 429.16(b)(2).
(
2
) For other than non-space-constrained single-split-system air conditioners and heat pumps, the manufacturer must test each basic model as required under § 429.16(b)(2).
(B) Using the AEDM, calculate the energy use or efficiency for each of the tested individual models/combinations within each basic model. Compare the represented value based on testing and the AEDM energy use or efficiency output according to paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. The manufacturer is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the AEDM and that their representations are appropriate and the models being distributed in commerce meet the applicable standards, regardless of the amount of testing required in paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A) and (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
(ii)
Individual model/combination tolerances.
This paragraph (e)(2)(ii) provides the tolerances applicable to individual models/combinations rated using an AEDM.
(A) The predicted represented values for each individual model/combination calculated by applying the AEDM may not be more than four percent greater (for measures of efficiency) or less (for measures of consumption) than the values determined from the corresponding test of the individual model/combination.
(B) The predicted energy efficiency or consumption for each individual model/combination calculated by applying the AEDM must meet or exceed the applicable federal energy conservation standard.
(iii)
Additional test unit requirements.

(iii) Product information and AEDM calculations for each individual model/combination to which the AEDM has been applied.
(4)
Additional AEDM requirements.
If requested by the Department, the manufacturer must:
(i) Conduct simulations before representatives of the Department to predict the performance of particular individual models/combinations;
(ii) Provide analyses of previous simulations conducted by the manufacturer; and/or
(iii) Conduct certification testing of individual models or combinations selected by the Department.
(5)
AEDM verification testing.
DOE may use the test data for a given individual model/combination generated pursuant to § 429.104 to verify the represented value determined by an AEDM as long as the following process is followed:
(i)
Selection of units.
DOE will obtain one or more units for test from retail, if available. If units cannot be obtained from retail, DOE will request that a unit be provided by the manufacturer;
(ii)
Lab requirements.
DOE will conduct testing at an independent, third-party testing facility of its choosing. In cases where no third-party laboratory is capable of testing the equipment, testing may be conducted at a manufacturer's facility upon DOE's request.
(iii)
Testing.
At no time during verification testing may the lab and the manufacturer communicate without DOE authorization. If during test set-up or testing, the lab indicates to
DOE that it needs additional information regarding a given individual model or combination in order to test in accordance with the applicable DOE test procedure, DOE may organize a meeting between DOE, the manufacturer and the lab to provide such information.
(iv)
Failure to meet certified value.
If an individual model/combination tests worse than its certified value (
i.e.,
lower than the certified efficiency value or higher than the certified consumption value) by more than 5 percent, or the test results in cooling capacity that is lower than its certified cooling capacity, DOE will notify the manufacturer. DOE will provide the manufacturer with all documentation related to the test set up, test conditions, and test results for the unit. Within the timeframe allotted by DOE, the manufacturer may present any and all claims regarding testing validity.
(v)
Tolerances.
This paragraph specifies the tolerances DOE will permit when conducting verification testing.
(A) For consumption metrics, the result from a DOE verification test must be less than or equal to 1.05 multiplied by the certified represented value.
(B) For efficiency metrics, the result from a DOE verification test must be greater than or equal to 0.95 multiplied by the certified represented value.
(vi)
Invalid represented value.
If, following discussions with the manufacturer and a retest where applicable, DOE determines that the verification testing was conducted appropriately in accordance with the DOE test procedure, DOE will issue a determination that the represented values for the basic model are invalid. The manufacturer must conduct additional testing and re-rate and re-certify the individual models/combinations within the basic model that were rated using the AEDM based on all test data collected, including DOE's test data.
(vii)
AEDM use.
This paragraph (e)(5)(vii) specifies when a manufacturer's use of an AEDM may be restricted due to prior invalid represented values.
(A) If DOE has determined that a manufacturer made invalid represented values on individual models/combinations within two or more basic models rated using the manufacturer's AEDM within a 24 month period, the manufacturer must test the least efficient and most efficient individual model/combination within each basic model in addition to the individual model/combination specified in § 429.16(b)(2). The twenty-four month period begins with a DOE determination that a represented value is invalid through the process outlined above.
(B) If DOE has determined that a manufacturer made invalid represented values on more than four basic models rated using the manufacturer's AEDM within a 24-month period, the manufacturer may no longer use an AEDM.
(C) If a manufacturer has lost the privilege of using an AEDM, the manufacturer may regain the ability to use an AEDM by:
(
1
) Investigating and identifying cause(s) for failures;
(
2
) Taking corrective action to address cause(s);
(
3
) Performing six new tests per basic model, a minimum of two of which must be performed by an independent, third-party laboratory from units obtained from retail to validate the AEDM; and
(

models for each validation class specified in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section to which the particular AEDM applies. Test a single unit of each basic model in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section. Using the AEDM, calculate the energy use or energy efficiency for each of the selected basic models.

That is, if the test results used to validate the AEDM are for either a unit cooler only or a condensing unit only, the AEDM must estimate the system rating using the nominal values specified in the DOE test procedure for the other part of the refrigeration system.
(E) For rating doors, an AEDM may not simulate or model components of the door that are not required to be tested by the DOE test procedure. That is, if the test results used to validate the AEDM are for the U-factor test of the door, the AEDM must estimate the daily energy consumption, specifically the conduction thermal load, and the direct and indirect electrical energy consumption, using the nominal values and calculation procedure specified in the DOE test procedure.

The storage volume of a commercial instantaneous water heater (other than storage-type instantaneous water heaters) or a hot water supply boiler basic model may be determined by performing a calculation of the stored water volume based upon design drawings (including computer-aided design (CAD) models) or physical dimensions of the basic model. Any value of storage volume of a basic model reported to DOE in a certification of compliance in accordance
with § 429.44(c)(2)(iv) through (vii) must be calculated using the design drawings or physical dimensions or measured as per the applicable provisions in the test procedures in § 431.106 of this chapter. Calculations to determine storage volume must include all water contained within the water heater from the inlet connection(s) to the outlet connection(s). The storage volume of water contained in the water heater must then be computed in gallons.
(f)
Commercial refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerator-freezers.
The volume of a basic model of a commercial refrigerator, refrigerator-freezer, or freezer may be determined by performing a calculation of the volume based upon computer-aided design (CAD) models of the basic model in lieu of physical measurements of a production unit of the basic model. If volume is determined by performing a calculation of volume based on CAD drawings, any value of volume of the basic model reported to DOE in a certification of compliance in accordance with § 429.42(b)(2)(iii) must be calculated using the CAD-derived volume(s) and the applicable provisions in the test procedures in 10 CFR part 431.64 for measuring volume.
