§ 319.10
Requirements for substitute standardized meat food products named by use of an expressed nutrient content claim and a standardized term.
(a)
Description.
The meat food products prescribed by this general definition and standard of identity are those products that substitute, in accordance with § 317.313(d), for a standardized product defined in this part and use the name of that standardized product in their statements of identity, but that do not comply with the established standard because of a compositional deviation that results from reduction of a constituent that is described by an expressed nutrient content claim that has been defined by regulation in part 317, subpart B, of this subchapter. The expressed nutrient content claim shall comply with the requirements of § 317.313 of this subchapter and with the requirements of part 317, subpart B, of this subchapter which define the particular nutrient content claim that is used. The meat food product shall comply with the relevant standard in this part in all other respects, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(b)
Performance characteristics.
The performance characteristics, such as physical properties, functional properties, and shelf-life, of the meat food product shall be similar to those of the standardized meat food product produced under this part. If there is a significant difference in a performance characteristic that materially limits the use of the product compared to the use of the standardized product defined in this part, the label shall include a statement in accordance with § 317.313(d)(1) and (2) of this subchapter that informs the consumer of such differences (
e.g.
, if appropriate, “not recommended for frozen storage” or “not suitable for roller grilling”). Deviations from the ingredient provisions of the standard must be the minimum necessary to qualify for the nutrient content claim, while maintaining similar performance characteristics.
(c)
Ingredients used in substitute products.
(1) Ingredients used in the product shall be those ingredients provided for in the standard as defined in this part, except that safe and suitable ingredients permitted for use in meat food products as provided in a regulation permitting that use in this subchapter or in 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter E, or in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B, may be used at the minimum level necessary to improve texture and prevent syneresis, so that the substitute product is not inferior in performance characteristics from the standardized product defined in this part for which it is a substitute.
(2) An ingredient that is specifically required by the standard prescribed in this part shall not be replaced or exchanged with a similar ingredient from another source, for example, turnip chunks shall not replace potatoes in corned beef hash.
(3) An ingredient that is specifically prohibited from use in any meat food product by this part shall not be added to the substitute meat food product under this section.
(4) Unless otherwise specified in this part, a substitute meat food product must meet all other requirements of the applicable standards of identity or composition.
(5) Water and fat-replacers (
e.g.
, binders), in combination, may be added to replace fat in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(6) Textured vegetable protein may be used by itself or in combination with other binders and water as a fat replacer in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(d)
Nomenclature.
The name of a substitute meat food product that complies with all parts of this section is the appropriate expressed nutrient content claim and the applicable standardized term.
(e)
Label declaration.
(1) Each of the ingredients used in the substitute meat food product shall be declared on the
label as required by this section and part 317 of this subchapter.
(2) Ingredients not provided for, and ingredients used in excess of those levels provided for, by the standard as defined in this part, shall be identified as such with an asterisk in the ingredients statement. The statement “*Ingredients not in regular ________” (the blank shall be filled in with the name of the traditional standardized product) or “**Ingredients in excess of amounts permitted in regular ________” (the blank shall be filled in with the name of the traditional standardized product), or both, as appropriate, shall immediately follow the ingredients statement in the same type and size.

§ 321.1
Assistance to State and Territorial programs.
(a) The Administrator is authorized under paragraph (a) of section 301 of the Act, when he determines it would effectuate the purposes of the Act, to cooperate with any State (including Puerto Rico) or any organized Territory in developing and administering the meat inspection program of such jurisdiction with a view to assuring that it imposes and enforces requirements at least equal to those under Titles I and IV of the Act, with respect to establishments at which products are prepared for use as human food solely for distribution within such jurisdiction, and with respect to the products of such establishments. Such cooperation is authorized if the jurisdiction has enacted a law imposing mandatory ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection, reinspection, and sanitation requirements at least equal to the Federal requirements with respect to all or certain classes of persons engaged in slaughtering livestock or otherwise preparing products solely for distribution within such jurisdiction.
(b) The Administrator is also authorized under paragraph (a) of section 301 of the Act to cooperate with any State (including Puerto Rico) or any organized Territory in developing and administering programs under the laws of such jurisdiction containing authorities at least equal to those in Title II of the Act (relating to records; registration of specified classes of operators; dead, dying, disabled, or diseased livestock; and products not intended for human food), when he determines that such cooperation would effectuate the purposes of the Act.
(c) Such cooperation may include advisory assistance, technical and laboratory assistance and training, and financial aid. The Federal contribution to any State (or Territory) may not exceed 50 percent of the estimated total cost of the cooperative State (or Territorial) program. A cooperative program under this section is called a State-Federal program.
[35 FR 15604, Oct. 3, 1970]
§ 321.2
Cooperation of States in Federal programs.
Under the “Talmadge-Aiken Act” of September 28, 1962 (7 U.S.C. 450), the Administrator is authorized to utilize employees and facilities of any State in carrying out Federal functions under the Federal Meat Inspection Act. A cooperative program for this purpose is called a Federal-State program.

§ 321.3
Cooperation of States for the interstate shipment of carcasses, parts of carcasses, meat, and meat food products.
(a) The Administrator is authorized under 21 U.S.C. 683(b) to coordinate with States that have meat inspection programs as provided in § 321.1 of this part to select certain establishments operating under these programs to participate in a cooperative program to ship carcasses, parts of carcasses,
meat, and meat food products in interstate commerce. A cooperative program for this purpose is called a “cooperative interstate shipment program.”
(b) Establishments selected to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program described in this section must receive inspection services from designated State personnel that have been trained in the enforcement of the Act. If the designated personnel determine that the carcasses, parts of carcasses, meat, and meat food products prepared in establishments selected to participate in the cooperative interstate shipment program comply with all requirements under the Act, these items will bear an official Federal mark of inspection and may be shipped in interstate commerce. The Administrator will assign an FSIS “selected establishment coordinator,” who will be an FSIS employee, to each State that participates in a cooperative interstate shipment program to provide Federal oversight of the program and enforcement of the program's requirements. The Federal contribution for inspection services provided by States that enter into a cooperative interstate shipment program under this section will be at least 60 percent of eligible State costs. Eligible State costs are those costs that a State has justified and FSIS has approved as necessary for the State to provide inspection services to selected establishments in the State.
(c) Part 332 of this subchapter prescribes conditions under which States and establishments may participate in the cooperative interstate shipment program.
(d) The Administrator will terminate a cooperative interstate shipment agreement with a State if the Administrator determines that the State is not conducting inspection at selected establishments in a manner that complies with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter.

§ 325.1
Transactions in commerce prohibited without official inspection legend or certificate when required; exceptions; and vehicle sanitation requirements.
(a) No person shall sell, transport, offer for sale or transportation, or receive for transportation, in commerce, any product which is capable of use as human food unless the product and its container, if any, bear the official inspection legend as required under parts 316 and 317 of this subchapter or such product is exempted from the requirement of inspection under part 303 of this subchapter.
(b)(1) No carrier shall transport or receive for transportation in commerce (including transportation in the course of importation) and no person shall offer for transportation any carcass, part thereof, meat or meat food product until a certificate, if required for such transportation by this part, is made and furnished to the carrier in one of the forms prescribed in this part.
(2) Product imported into the United States may be transported and offerred or received for transportation if such product is conveyed in railroad cars, trucks or other means of conveyance, prior to inspection, to an authorized place of inspection, as provided in § 327.6 of this part.
(c) No person, engaged in the business of buying, selling, freezing, storing, or transporting, in or for commerce, meat or meat food products capable of use as human food, or importing such articles, shall transport, offer for transportation, or receive for transportation in commerce or in any State designated under § 331.2 of this subchapter, any such meat or meat food product which is capable of use as human food and is not wrapped, packaged, or otherwise enclosed to prevent adulteration by airborne contaminants, unless the railroad car, truck, or other means of conveyance in which the product is contained or transported is completely enclosed with tight fitting doors or other covers for all openings. In all cases, the means of conveyance shall be reasonably free of foreign matter (such as dust, dirt, rust, or other articles or residues), and free of chemical residues, so that product placed therein will not become adulterated. Any cleaning compound, lye, soda solution, or other chemical used in cleaning the means of conveyance must be thoroughly removed from the means of conveyance prior to its use. Such means of conveyance onto which product is loaded, being loaded, or intended to be loaded, shall be subject to inspection by an inspector at any official establishment. The decision whether or not to inspect a means of conveyance in a specific case, and the type and extent of such inspection shall be at the Program's discretion and shall be adequate to determine if product in such conveyance is, or when moved could become, adulterated. Circumstances of transport that can be reasonably anticipated shall be considered in making said determination. These include, but are not limited to, weather conditions, duration and distance of trip, nature of product covering, and effect of restowage at stops en route. Any means of
conveyance found upon such inspection to be in such condition that product placed therein could become adulterated shall not be used until such condition which could cause adulteration is corrected. Product placed in any means of conveyance that is found by the inspector to be in such condition that the product may have become adulterated shall be removed from the means of conveyance and handled in accordance with § 318.2(d) of this subchapter.

§ 325.10
Handling of products which may have become adulterated or misbranded; authorization and other requirements.
(a) When it is claimed that any inspected and passed product, marked with an inspection legend, has become adulterated or misbranded after it has been transported from an official establishment, such product may be transported in commerce to an official establishment after oral permission is obtained from the area supervisor of the area in which that offical establishment is located. The transportation of the product may be to the official establishment from which it had been transported or to another official establishment designated by the person
desiring to handle the product. The transportation shall be authorized only for the purpose of officially determining if the product has become adulterated or misbranded and making the appropriate disposition. The area supervisor shall make a record of the authorization and such other information which will effectively identify the shipment and shall provide a copy of the record to the inspector at the establishment receiving the product. The shipper shall be furnished a copy of the authorization record upon request.
(b) Upon the arrival of the shipment at the official establishment, a careful inspection shall be made of the product by a Program inspector, and if it is found that the article is not adulterated, the same may be received into the establishment; but if the article is found to be adulterated, it shall at once be stamped “U.S. inspected and condemned” and disposed of in accordance with part 314 of this subchapter, and if it is found to be misbranded, it shall be handled in accordance with § 318.2(d) of this subchapter:
Provided,
That when a product is found to be affected with one of the correctable conditions specified in § 318.2(d) of this subchapter, in respect to which rehandling is permitted, it may be transported from the official establishment to another official establishment for such rehandling as is necessary to assure that the product is not adulterated or misbranded when finally released. The transportation of such a product from an official establishment shall be done in a manner prescribed in each specific case by the Administrator.

§ 325.11
Inedible articles: denaturing and other means of identification; exceptions.
(a) Except as provided in § 325.8 and § 325.10, no carcass, part of a carcass, rendered grease, tallow, or other fat derived from the carcasses of livestock, or other meat food product, that has not been inspected and passed at an official establishment under the provisions of this subchapter and is not exempted from such inspection, and no carcass, part of a carcass, fat or other meat food product that is adulterated or misbranded, shall be offered for transportation in commerce by any person unless it is handled in accordance with paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section or is denatured or otherwise identified as prescribed in § 325.13, § 314.1, § 314.3, § 314.9, § 314.10, or § 314.11 of this subchapter.
(b) Inedible rendered animal fats from official or other establishments in the United States having the physical characteristics of a meat food product fit for human food may be transported in commerce without denaturing, if the following conditions are met:
(1) Such inedible rendered fat shall not be bought, sold, transported, or offered for sale or offered for transportation in commerce, or imported, except by rendering companies, dealers, brokers, or others who obtain a numbered permit for such activities from the Regional Director.
(2) Such inedible rendered animal fat may be so distributed only if consigned to a domestic manufacturer of technical articles other than for human food or to an export terminal for exportation or storage for exportation as an inedible article, and provided, in the case of such fat consigned to a domestic manufacturer, the product is for use solely by the consignee for manufacturing purposes of nonhuman food articles and may not be further sold or shipped without first receiving approval of the Regional Director:
And provided further,
That such fat intended for export and stored at a terminal point prior to export will be subject to review by Program employees to assure that it is exported as inedible.
(3) When transported in commerce, or imported, such inedible rendered fat shall be marked conspicuously with the words “technical animal fat not intended for human food” on the ends of the shipping containers, in letters not less than 2 inches high; in the case of shipping containers such as drums, tierces, barrels, and half barrels, and not less than 4 inches high in the case of tank cars and trucks. All shipping containers shall have both ends painted with a durable paint, if necessary, to provide a contrasting background for the required marking.
(4) Such inedible rendered fat shall be transported only in sealed shipping
containers bearing unofficial seals applied by the shipper, which shall include the identification number assigned by said Director for the permit holder. The number shall appear on the bill of lading or other transportation documents for the shipment. The consignees in the United States must retain the seals in their records as prescribed in part 320 of this subchapter.
(5) Any diversion or effort to divert inedible rendered fat contrary to the provisions of this paragraph (b) or other violation of the provisions of this section may result in the revocation of the permit for shipment of technical animal fat at the discretion of the Administrator.
(c) Inedible rendered animal fat derived from condemned or other inedible materials at official or other establishments in the United States may be transported in commerce if mixed with low grade offal or other materials which render the fat readily distinguishable from an article of human food, and if the outside container bears the word “inedible.”
(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2), (3), and (4) of this section, or in §§ 314.10 and 314.11 of this subchapter, no animal food prepared, in whole or in part, from materials derived from the carcasses of livestock in an official establishment or elsewhere, shall be bought, sold, transported, offered for sale or transportation, or received for transportation, in commerce, or imported, unless:
(i) It is properly identified as animal food;
(ii) It is not represented as being a human food; and
(iii) It has been denatured as prescribed in § 325.13(a)(2) so as to be readily distinguishable from an article of human food.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an animal food that consists of less than 5 percent of parts or products of the carcasses of livestock and that is not represented by labeling or appearance or otherwise as being a human food or as a product of the meat food industry need not be denatured in accordance with § 325.13(a)(2).
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, animal food packed in hermetically sealed, retort processed, conventional retail-size containers, and retail-size packages of semi-moist animal food need not be denatured in accordance with § 325.13(a)(2) if the name of the article clearly conveys the article's intended use for animal food and appeared on the label in a conspicuous manner.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii) of paragraph (d)(3), the name of the article must be stated on the label as “Animal Food,” “Pet Food,” or “(name of species) Food” (e.g., “Dog Food” or “Cat Food”). To be considered conspicuous, the name of the article, wherever it appears on the label, must be in letters at least twice as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence in the article of any ingredients derived from the carcasses of livestock.
(ii) Notwithstanding the provisons of paragraph (i) of this paragraph (d)(3), the article's name may be stated on the label to show that it is or contains livestock-source material and that the article is for animals; e.g., “Horsemeat for Pets” or “Beef Stew for Dogs”:
Provided,
That the entire name of the article is stated, wherever it appears on the label, as an individual, contiguous unit, whether stated on a single line or more than one line, and the letters denoting the article's intended use for animal food are at least as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence of material derived from any livestock carcass. However, when the label bears on its principal display panel a vignette which pictures, in clearly recognizable form and size, one or more animals of the species for which the article's name indicates the article is intended, the letters used to state the article's intended use shall be at least one-half as high, wide, and thick as the letters used in the article's name or other letters indicating the presence of material derived from any livestock carcass, but shall not be less than
1/8
inches high. The letters used to state the article's intended use may be separated from the article's name by the vignette.
(iii) Letters used to denote the intended use of the article must contrast as markedly with their background as the letters indicating the presence in
the article of livestock carcass-source material contrast with their background.
(4) The requirements of this part do not apply to livestock or poultry feeds manufactured from processed livestock byproducts (such as meat meal tankage, meat and bone meal, blood meal, and feed grade animal fat), or to processed dry animal food.
(e) Except for inedible rendered animal fats and lungs or lung lobes, inedible products (including condemned products only if condemned for causes specified in § 314.11 of this subchapter) which were prepared at any official establishment, or at any State inspected establishment in any State not listed in § 331.2 of this subchapter, and which have the physical characteristics of a product fit for human food, may be transported from an official establishment or in commerce, without denaturing as required by this subchapter, if the following conditions are met:
(1) The shipper must have obtained a numbered permit for such activity from the appropriate Regional Director, as identified in § 301.2 of this subchapter. Such permit may be obtained upon written application to the appropriate Regional Director and his determination that the proposed transportation would be authorized under this paragraph (e). The application shall state the name and address of the applicant, a description of the type of his business operations, and the purpose of making such application.
(2) Such inedible products may be transported under this paragraph (e) only if consigned to a manufacturer in the United States of articles other than for human food and if the product is for use solely by the consignee for manufacturing articles not for human food. Such products may not be transported in commerce to any consignee other than the one to which they were originally shipped unless prior notice of the diversion is given to the appropriate Regional Director and a record identifying the new consignee is maintained by the shipper as required by § 320.1 of this subchapter.
(3) When transported from an official establishment or in commerce under this paragraph (e), the outside container of such inedible products shall be marked conspicuously with the words “Inedible—Not Intended for Human Food” in letters not less than 2 inches high, in the case of containers, such as cartons, drums, tierces, barrels, and half barrels, and not less than 4 inches high in the case of tank cars and trucks used to transport such products not in other containers.
(4) Such inedible products shall be transported from an official establishment or in commerce under this paragraph (e) only in railroad cars, trucks, or containers which bear unofficial seals applied by the shipper, which shall include the identification number assigned to the permit holder and an individual seal serial number assigned by the shipper; and the product so transported shall be accompanied by an invoice or bill of lading specifying the permit holder's identification number. The consignee in the United States must retain a record of the identification and serial numbers shown on the seals in his records as prescribed in part 320 of this subchapter.
(5) Any diversion, or effort to divert, undenatured, inedible product contrary to the provisions of this paragraph (e) or other violation of the provisions of this section may result in the revocation of the permit for shipment of inedible products under this paragraph (e), at the discretion of the Administrator.

C yellow No. 5 coloring;
(4) Meat may be denatured by dipping it in a solution of 0.0625 percent tannic acid, followed by immersion in a water bath, then dipping it in a solution of 0.0625 percent ferric acid; and
(5) When meat, meat byproducts, or meat food products are in ground form, 4 percent by weight of coarsely ground hard bone, which shall be in pieces no smaller than the opening size specified for No. 5 mesh in the standards issued by the U.S. Bureau of Standards or 6 percent by weight of coarsely ground hard bone, which shall be in pieces no smaller than the opening size specified for No. 8 mesh in said Standards, uniformly incorporated with the product may be used in lieu of the agents prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(6) Before the denaturing agents are applied to articles in pieces more than 4 inches in diameter, the pieces shall be freely slashed or sectioned. (If the articles are in pieces not more than 4 inches in diameter, slashing or sectioning will not be necessary.) The application of any of the denaturing agents listed in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section to the outer surface of molds or blocks of boneless meat, meat byproducts, or meat food products shall not be adequate. The denaturing agent must be mixed intimately with all of the material to be denatured, and must be applied in such quantity and manner that it cannot easily and readily be removed by washing or soaking. A sufficient amount of the appropriate agent shall be used to give the material a distinctive color, odor, or taste so that such material cannot be confused with an article of human food.
(7) Carcasses (other than viscera), parts thereof, cuts of meat, and unground pieces of meat darkened by charcoal or other black dyes shall be deemed to be denatured pursuant to this section only if they contain at least that degree of darkness depicted by diagram 1 of the Meat Denaturing Guide (MP Form 91).

§ 327.2
Eligibility of foreign countries for importation of products into the United States.
(a)(1) Whenever it shall be determined by the Administrator that the system of meat inspection maintained by any foreign country, with respect to establishments preparing products in such country for export to the United States, insures compliance of such establishments and their products with requirements equivalent to all the inspection, building construction standards, and all other provisions of the Act and the regulations in this subchapter which are applied to official establishments in the United States, and their products, and that reliance can be placed upon certificates required under this part from authorities of such foreign country, notice of that fact will be given in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Thereafter, products prepared in such establishments which are certified and approved in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, shall be eligible so far as this subchapter is concerned for importation into the United States from such foreign country after applicable requirements of this subchapter have been met.
(2) The determination of acceptability of a foreign meat inspection system for purposes of this section shall be based on an evaluation of the foreign program in accordance with the following requirements and procedures:
(i) The system shall have a program organized and administered by the national government of the foreign country. The system as implemented must provide standards equivalent to those of the Federal system of meat inspection in the United States with respect to:
(A) Organizational structure and staffing, so as to insure uniform enforcement of the requisite laws and regulations in all establishments throughout the system at which products are prepared for export to the United States;
(B) Ultimate control and supervision by the national government over the official activities of all employees or licensees of the system;
(C) The assignment of competent, qualified inspectors;
(D) Authority and responsibility of national inspection officials to enforce the requisite laws and regulations governing meat inspection and to certify or refuse to certify products intended for export;
(E) Adequate administrative and technical support;
(F) The inspection, sanitation, quality, species verification, and residue standards applied to products produced in the United States.
(G) Other requirements of adequate inspection service as required by the regulations in this subchapter.
(ii) The legal authority for the system and the regulations thereunder shall impose requirements equivalent to those governing the system of meat inspection organized and maintained in the United States with respect to:
(A) Ante-mortem inspection of animals for slaughter and inspection of methods of slaughtering and handling in connection with slaughtering which shall be performed by veterinarians or by other employees or licensees of the system under the direct supervision of the veterinarians;
(B) Post-mortem inspection of carcasses and parts thereof at time of slaughter, performed by veterinarians or other employees or licensees of the system under the direct supervision of veterinarians;
(C) Official controls by the national government over establishment construction, facilities, and equipment;
(D) Direct and continuous official supervision of slaughtering and preparation of product, by the assignment of inspectors to establishments certified under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, to assure that adulterated or misbranded product is not prepared for export to the United States;
(E) Complete separation of establishments certified under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph from establishments not certified and the maintenance of a single standard of inspection and sanitation throughout all certified establishments;
(F) Requirements for sanitation at certified establishments and for sanitary handling of product;
(G) Official controls over condemned material until destroyed or removed and thereafter excluded from the establishment;
(H) A Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, as set forth in part 417 of this chapter.
(I) Other matters for which requirements are contained in the Act or regulations in this subchapter.
(iii) Countries desiring to establish eligibility for importation of product into the United States may request a determination of eligibility by presenting copies of the laws and regulations on which the foreign meat inspection system is based and such other information as the Administrator may require with respect to matters enumerated in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. Determination of eligibility is based on a study of the documents and other information presented and an initial review of the system in operation by a representative of the Department using the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. Maintenance of eligibility of a country for importation of products into the United States depends on the results of periodic reviews of the foreign meat inspection system in operation by a representative of the Department, and the timely submission of such documents and other information related to the conduct of the foreign inspection system, including information required by paragraph (e) of section 20 of the Act, as the Administrator may find pertinent to and necessary for the determinations required by this section of the regulations.
(iv) The foreign inspection system must maintain a program to assure that the requirements referred to in this section, equivalent to those of the Federal system of meat inspection in the United States, are being met. The program as implemented must provide for the following:
(A) Periodic supervisory visits by a representative of the foreign inspection system to each establishment certified in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section to ensure that requirements referred to in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) through (H) of this section are being met: Provided, That such visits are not required with respect to any establishment during a period when the establishment is not operating or is not engaged in producing products for exportation to the United States;
(B) Written reports prepared by the representative of the foreign inspection
system who has conducted a supervisory visit, documenting his or her findings with respect to the requirements referred to in (A) through (H) of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, copies of which shall be made available to the representative of the Department at the time of that representative's review upon request by that representative to a responsible foreign meat inspection official:
Provided,
That such reports are not required with respect to any establishment during a period when the establishment is not operating or is not engaged in producing products for exportation to the United States; and
(C) Random sampling of internal organs and fat of carcasses at the point of slaughter and the testing of such organs and fat, for such residues having been identified by the exporting country's meat inspection authorities or by this Agency as potential contaminants, in accordance with sampling and analytical techniques approved by the Administrator:
Provided,
That such testing is required only on samples taken from carcasses from which meat or meat food products intended for importation into the United States are produced.
(3) Only those establishments that are determined and certified to the Agency by a responsible official of the foreign meat inspection system as fully meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are eligible to have their products imported into the United States. Establishment eligibility is subject to review by the Agency (including observations of the establishments by Program representatives at times prearranged with the foreign meat inspection system officials). Foreign establishment certifications must be renewed annually. Notwithstanding certification by a foreign official, the Administrator may terminate the eligibility of any foreign establishment for the importation of its products into the United States if it does not comply with the requirements listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, or if current establishment information cannot be obtained. The Administrator will provide reasonable notice to the foreign government of the proposed termination of any foreign establishment, unless a delay in terminating its eligibility could result in the importation of adulterated or misbranded product.
(i) For a new establishment, or any establishment for which information from last year's electronic certification or paper certificate has changed, the certification or certificate must contain: The date; the foreign country; the foreign establishment's name, address, and foreign establishment number; the foreign official's title and signature (for paper certificates only); the type of operations conducted at the establishment (e.g., slaughter, processing, storage, exporting warehouse); and the establishment's eligibility status (e.g., new or relisted (if previously delisted)). Slaughter and processing establishment certifications must address the species and type of products produced at the establishment (e.g., the process category).
(ii) If the establishment information provided on the preceding year's electronic foreign establishment certification or paper certificate, as required in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, has not changed, the certification or certificate must contain: The date, the foreign country, the foreign establishment's name, and the foreign official's title and signature (for paper certificates only).
(4) Meat and meat food products from foreign countries not deemed eligible in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section are not eligible for importation into the United States, except as provided by § 327.16 or § 327.17. Eligibility of any foreign country under this section may be withdrawn whenever the Administrator determines that the system of meat inspection maintained by such foreign country does not assure compliance with requirements equivalent to all the inspection, building construction standards, and other requirements of the Act and the regulations in this subchapter as applied to official establishments in the United States; or that reliance cannot be placed upon certificates required under this part from authorities of such foreign country; or that, for lack of current information concerning the system of meat inspection being maintained by such foreign country, such foreign country
should be required to reestablish its eligibility.
(b) A list of countries eligible to export specific process categories of meat and meat food products is maintained at
http://www.fsis.usda.gov/importlibrary.
Meat and meat food products from listed countries must be accompanied by foreign inspection certificates of the country of origin, as required by § 327.4, and are eligible under the regulations in this subchapter for entry into the United States after inspection and marking as required by the applicable provisions of this part. Fresh, chilled, or frozen or other product from countries in which rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease or African swine fever exist, as provided in part 94 of this title, are ineligible for importation into the United States.

§ 327.13
Foreign products offered for importation; reporting of findings to customs; handling of articles refused entry.
(a)(1) Program inspectors shall report their findings as to any product which has been inspected in accordance with this part, to the Director of Customs at the original port of entry where the same is offered for clearance through Customs inspection.
(2) When product has been identified as “U.S. refused entry, ” the inspector shall request the Director of Customs to refuse admission to such product and to direct that it be exported by the owner or consignee within the time specified in this section, unless the owner or consignee, within the specified time, causes it to be destroyed by disposing of it under the supervision of a Program employee so that the product can no longer be used as human food, or by converting it to animal food uses, if permitted by the Food and Drug Administration. The owner or consignee of the refused entry product shall not transfer legal title to such product, except to a foreign consignee for direct and immediate exportation, or to an end user, e.g., an animal food manufacturer or a renderer, for destruction for human food purposes. “Refused entry” product must be delivered to and used by the manufacturer or renderer within the 45-day time limit. Even if such title is illegally transferred, the subsequent purchaser will still be required to export the product or have it destroyed as specified in the notice under paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
(3) No lot of product which has been refused entry may be subdivided during disposition pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, except that removal and destruction of any damaged or otherwise unsound product from a lot destined for reexportation is permitted under supervision of USDA prior to exportation. Additionally, such refused entry lot may not be shipped for export from any port other than that through which the product came into the United States, without the expressed consent of the Administrator based on full information concerning the product's disposition, including the name of the vessel and the date of export. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “lot” shall refer to that product indentified on MP Form 410 in the original request for inspection for importation pursuant to § 327.5.
(4) Product which has been refused entry solely because of misbranding, in lieu of exportation or destruction pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, may be brought into compliance with the requirements of this part, under supervision of an authorized representative of the Administrator.
(5) The owner or consignee shall have 45 days after notice is given by FSIS to the Director of Customs at the original port of entry to take the action required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for “refused entry” product. Extension beyond the 45-day period may be granted by the Administrator when extreme circumstances warrant it; e.g., a dock workers' strike or an unforeseeable vessel delay.
(6) If the owner or consignee fails to take the required action within the time specified under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the Department will take such action as may be necessary to effectuate its order to have the product destroyed for human food purposes. The Department shall seek court costs and fees, storage, and proper expense in the appropriate legal forum.
(7) No product which has been refused entry and exported to another country pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be returned to the United States under any circumstance. Any such product so returned to the United States shall be subject to administrative detention in accordance with section 402 of the Act and seizure and condemnation in accordance with section 403 of the Act.
(b) Upon the request of the Director of Customs at the port where a product is offered for clearance through the customs, the consignee of the product shall, at the consignee's own expense, immediately return to the Director any product which has been delivered to consignee under § 327.7 and subsequently designated “U.S. Refused Entry” or found in any respect not to comply with the requirements in this part.
(c) All charges for storage, cartage, and labor with respect to any product which was imported contrary to the Act shall be paid by the owner or consignee, and in default of such payment shall constitute a lien against such
product and any other product thereafter imported by or for such owner or consignee.

§ 327.14
Marking of products and labeling of immediate containers thereof for importation.
(a) Product which is offered for importation, and which is susceptible of marking, shall, whether or not enclosed in an immediate container, bear the name of the country of origin, preceded by the words “product of”; the establishment number assigned by the foreign meat inspection system and certified to the Program; and such other markings as are necessary for compliance with part 316 of this subchapter. When such markings are imprints of stamps or brands made with branding ink, such ink shall be harmless and shall create permanent imprints. In case the name of the country of origin appears as part of an official mark of the national foreign government and such name is prominently and legibly displayed, the words “product of” may be omitted.
(b) In addition to the marking of products required under paragraph (a) of this section, the immediate container of any product offered for importation:
(1) Shall bear a label showing in accordance with § 317.2 of this subchapter all information required by that section (except that the establishment number assigned by the foreign meat inspection system and certified to the Program and the official inspection mark of the foreign meat inspection system shall be shown instead of the official inspection legend of the United States) and in addition the name of the country of origin preceded by the words “product of,” immediately under the name or descriptive designation of the product as required by § 317.2:
Provided,
That such establishment number may be omitted from a label lithographed directly on a can if said number is lithographed or embossed elsewhere on the can; and
(2) Shall, if such immediate container is a sealed metal container, have the establishment number assigned by the foreign meat inspection authority and certified by the Program embossed or lithographed on the sealed metal container, and such establishment number shall not be covered or obscured by any label or other means.
(c) All marks and other labeling for use on or with immediate containers, as well as private brands on carcasses or parts of carcasses, must be approved by the Food Safety and Inspection Service in accordance with part 412 of this chapter before products bearing such marks, labeling, or brands will be entered into the United States. The marks of inspection of foreign systems embossed on metal containers or branded on carcasses or parts thereof need not be submitted to the Food Safety and Inspection Service for approval, and such marks of inspection put on stencils, box dies, labels, and brands may be used on such immediate containers as tierces, barrels, drums, boxes, crates, and large-size fiberboard containers of foreign products without such marks of inspection being submitted for approval, provided the markings made by such articles are applicable to the product and are not false or misleading.

§ 327.21
Inspection procedures for chilled fresh and frozen boneless manufacturing meat.
(a)
Definitions; sampling; standards.
(1) Frozen boneless manufacturing meat is meat, frozen in the fresh state from cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, or other equines that has all bone removed and is cut into pieces or trimmings, frozen into a compact block of any shape and suitable for
slicing or chopping in the manufacturing of meat food products. As used in this section, the term “frozen” includes “chilled fresh,” and “lot” means any amount of frozen boneless manufacturing meat of one species, similarly packaged, shipped from one establishment, and offered for import inspection under one or more foreign inspection certificates.
(2) Imported frozen boneless manufacturing meat shall be sampled as required by § 327.6(a) of this part, and the samples defrosted for inspection. The Program import inspector, or in the case of Canadian product subject to procedures described in § 327.5(d)(1), the Canadian representative will select from a lot the appropriate number of cartons specified by the table of sampling plans. The total sample for inspection will consist of the necessary number of 12-pound units drawn from these cartons. The 12-pound units selected will be completely defrosted and examined.
(b)
Lots refused entry.
Reinspection (including resampling) will be provided for any lot of frozen boneless manufacturing meat which was refused entry under this section on the basis of the original evaluation of the sample thereof, upon appeal from the inspector's initial decision.
[35 FR 15610, Oct. 3, 1970, as amended at 49 FR 36819, Sept. 20, 1984; 51 FR 44901, Dec. 15, 1986; 54 FR 275, Jan. 5, 1989; 57 FR 27906, June 23, 1992]
§ 327.22
[Reserved]
§ 327.23
Compliance procedure for cured pork products offered for entry.
(a)
Definitions.
For the purposes of this section:
(1) A
Product
is that cured pork article which is contained within one Group as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and which purports to meet the criteria for a single product designated under the heading “Product Name and Qualifying Statements” in the chart in § 319.104 or § 319.105 of this subchapter.
(2) A
Product Group
or a
Group
means one of the following:
(i) Group I, consisting of cured pork products which have been cooked while imperviously encased. Any product that fits into the Group shall be placed in this Group regardless of any other considerations.
(ii) Group II, consisting of cured pork products which have been water cooked. Any product that does not fit into Group I but does fit into Group II shall be placed into Group II regardless of any other considerations.
(iii) Group III, consisting of boneless, smokehouse heated cured pork products. Any boneless product that does not fit into Group I or II shall be placed in Group III.
(iv) Group IV, consisting of bone-in or semi-boneless smokehouse heated cured pork products. Any product that is not completely boneless or still contains all the bone which is traditional for bone-in product and does not fit into Group I, II, or III shall be placed in this Group.
(3)
Protein Fat-Free Percentage, Protein Fat-Free Content, PFF Percentage, PFF Content or PFF
of a product means the meat protein (indigenous to the raw, unprocessed pork cut) content expressed as a percent of the non-fat portion of the finished product.
(4) A
PFF Standardized Difference
is the PFF of the sample minus the minimum PFF requirement, set forth in § 319.104 and § 319.105 of this subchapter, for the product being analyzed, divided by the Appropriate Standard Deviation for the product group.
(5) The
Absolute Minimum PFF Requirement
is that no laboratory result of an individual sample for PFF content be below the applicable minimum requirement of § 319.104 or § 319.105 of this subchapter by 2.3 or more percentage points for a Group I or II product or 2.7 or more percentage points for a Group III or IV product.
(6) A
PFF Standardized Arithmetic Average of the Country's Products
is the arithmetic average of PFF Standardized Differences from either 36 or 100 consecutively sampled lots of product entering the United States from a given producing country.
(7) A
PFF Standardized Weighted Average of the Country's Products
is an estimate of the average of the PFF Standardized Differences from either 36 or
100 consecutively sampled lots, adjusted for the size of the lot, of different types of cured pork product entering the United States from a given producing country. A Standardized Weighted Average is computed by multiplying the PFF Standardized Difference calculated for each lot by the number of pounds of product in each lot, adding those results together, and dividing the sum by the total weight of product from all the lots making up the average.
(8) The
Appropriate Standard Deviation
is based on within lot variability. That assigned to Groups I and II = 0.75 percent PFF and that assigned to Groups III and IV = 0.91 percent PFF.
(9) A
Lot
is all product of one type from one establishment presented by an importer as the unit for inspection at the Port of Entry.
(b)
Normal monitoring procedures.
Except for product imported from Canada, the Department shall collect sample(s) of cured pork product on a random basis from lots offered for entry at the Port of Entry and, after analyzing the sample for fat and indigenous protein content, calculate the PFF percentage. The product shall not be held pending laboratory results during the monitoring phase. The PFF percentage for each sample shall be considered along with the cumulative results of prior samples to assess the effectiveness of a country's overall compliance program and to determine the course of action for subsequent lots of product.
(1) Factors determining whether a country's inspection system is functioning adequately:
(i) The PFF percentage for each sample must not be below the minimum PFF requirement by 2.3 percentage points for cured pork products in Groups I and II or 2.7 percentage points for cured pork products in Groups III and IV.
(ii) Both of the PFF Standardized Averages, Arithmetic and Weighted, for the last 100 consecutive lots of all cured pork products from the country must be equal to or greater than zero. The count for the 100 consecutive lots starts with the lots arriving from that country after April 15, 1985.
(iii) Both of the PFF Standardized Averages, Arithmetic and Weighted, for the last 36 consecutive lots of all cured pork products from the country must be above the lowest 5 percent of the Normal distribution. This minimum value is minus 0.28 (−0.28) for the Arithmetic Average and depends on the production volume for the Weighted Average.
(2) Actions when calculations indicate that processing procedures in a country are out-of-compliance:
(i) If the PFF level of a sample taken during normal monitoring procedures is found to be as low as the Absolute Minimum PFF Requirement, the country of origin shall be notified; the lot involved shall be retained if still available in an official establishment or subject to detention or other actions pursuant to the Act; and all subsequently presented lots of that cured pork product from the same foreign establishment shall be held under retention until the provisions of paragraph (c) are satisfied.
(ii) If either of the PFF Standardized Averages, Arithmetic or Weighted, for the last 100 consecutive lots falls below zero or either of the PFF Standardized Averages for the last 36 consecutive lots falls below the upper 95 percent of the Normal distribution, all available cured pork product from the foreign country shall be subject to administrative retention and all subsequently presented lots of cured pork product from the foreign country shall be held under retention until the provisions of paragraph (c) are satisfied. The country of origin shall be notified, and shall be subject to other actions pursuant to the Act.
(c)
Retention.
When lots of cured pork product are under retention they shall be refused entry and reexported in accordance with § 327.13 of this subchapter unless they can be released in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(1), establishments may be returned to normal monitoring procedures in accordance with paragraph (c)(2), and countries may be returned to normal monitoring procedures in accordance with paragraph (c)(3).
(1) If a lot is subject to retention procedures under this section, the Department shall collect five randomly selected sample units from each lot and determine the PFF of each sample
unit. The lot may be released into commerce if:
(i) The average PFF percentage of the five randomly selected sample units is equal to or greater than the applicable minimum PFF percentage required by § 319.104 or § 319.105 of this subchapter, or
(ii) The product is relabeled under the supervision of a program employee so that it conforms to the provisions of § 319.104 or § 319.105 of this subchapter.
(2) If product from a foreign establishment is subject to retention procedures under this section, the foreign establishment may be returned to normal monitoring procedures when:
(i) Ten consecutively presented lots of that cured pork product from that establishment have been sampled as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the average of each set of five sample units representing each lot have been found to be equal to or greater than the required minimum PFF percentage; and
(ii) The PFF percentage of each sample unit (50 in all) is above the Absolute Minimum PFF Percentage.
(3) If a country is subject to retention procedures under this section, the country shall be returned to normal monitoring procedures when:
(i) Twenty-five consecutively presented lots of cured pork product have been sampled as required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the average of each set of five sample units representing each lot have been found to be equal to or greater than the required minimum PFF percentage; and
(ii) The PFF percentage of each sample unit (125 in all) is above the Absolute Minimum PFF Percentage; and
(iii) Both of the PFF Standardized Averages for 36 consecutive lots are in the required percentage of the Normal distribution; and
(iv) Both of the PFF Standardized Averages for 100 consecutive lots are zero or higher.
(4) The sample units collected under retention procedures as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section will not be included in the PFF standardized averages for 36 and 100 consecutive lots.
(d)
Adulterated and Misbranded Products.
Products not meeting specified PFF requirements, determined according to procedures set forth in this section, may be deemed adulterated under section 1(m)(8) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 601(m)(8)) and misbranded under section 1(n) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 601(n)).
(e) Activities requiring additional inspectional supervision, such as relabeling, shall be at the importer's expense. In addition, if the importer wishes, he or she may have samples analyzed at an accredited laboratory.

Copies of MP Form 91 may be obtained, without charge, by writing to the Administrative Operations Branch, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 123 East Grant Street, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55403. Diagrams 2 and 3 of the Meat Denaturing Guide are for comparison purposes only. The Meat Denaturing Guide has been approved for incorporation by reference by the Director, Office of the Federal Register, and is on file at the Federal Register Library.
(3) Tripe may be denatured by dipping it in a 6 percent solution of tannic acid for 1 minute followed by immersion in a water bath, then immersing it for 1 minute in a solution of 0.022 percent FD
C yellow No. 5 coloring.
(4) When meat, meat byproducts, or meat food products are in ground form, 4 percent by weight of coarsely ground hard done, which shall be in pieces no smaller than the opening size specified for No. 5 mesh in the standards issued by the U.S. Bureau of Standards or 6 percent by weight of coarsely ground hard bone, which shall be in pieces no smaller than the opening size specified for No. 8 mesh in said Standards, uniformly incorporated with the product, may be used in lieu of the agents prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(5) Before the denaturing agents are applied to articles in pieces more than 4 inches in diameter, the pieces shall be freely slashed or sectioned. (If the articles are in pieces not more than 4 inches in diameter, slashing or sectioning will not be necessary.) The application of any of the denaturing agents listed in paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section to the outer surface of molds or blocks or boneless meat, meat by-products, or meat food products shall not be adequate. The denaturing agent must be mixed intimately with all the material to be denatured, and must be applied in such quantity and manner that it cannot easily and readily be removed by washing or soaking. A sufficient amount of the appropriate agent shall be used to give the material a distinctive color, odor, or taste so that such material cannot be confused with an article of human food.
(b) Inedible rendered animal fats shall be denatured by thoroughly mixing therein denaturing oil, No. 2 fuel oil, brucine dissolved in a mixture of alcohol and pine oil or oil of rosemary, finely powdered charcoal, or any proprietary denaturing agent approved for the purpose by the Administrator in specific cases. The charcoal shall be used in no less quantity than 100 parts per million and shall be of such character that it will remain suspended indefinitely in the liquid fat. Sufficient of the chosen identifying agents shall be used to give the rendered fat so distinctive a color, odor, or taste that it cannot be confused with an article of human food.

§ 331.3
States designated under paragraph 301(c) of the Act; application of regulations.
The provisions of the regulations in this subchapter apply to operations and transactions wholly within each State designated in § 331.2 under paragraph 301(c) of the Act, except as otherwise provided in this section. (The provisions of the regulations apply in all respects to operations and transactions in or for commerce.)
(a) Each establishment located in such a designated State shall be granted inspection required under
§ 302.1(a)(2) of this subchapter only if it is found, upon a combined evaluation of its premises, facilities, and operating procedures, to be capable of producing products that are not adulterated or misbranded.
(b) Section 305.2 of this subchapter will apply to establishments required to have inspection under § 302.1(a)(2) of this subchapter, except that existing interconnections between official and unofficial establishments will be permitted if it is determined in specific cases that the interconnections are such that transfer of inedible product into the official establishment would be difficult or unusual, and any such transfers are strictly prohibited, except as permitted under other provisions of this subchapter. It is essential that separation of facilities be maintained to the extent necessary to assure that inedible product does not enter the official establishment contrary to the regulations in this subchapter.
(c) Sections 416.2(c), (d), (e), (f), and (h) of this chapter shall apply to such establishments.
(d) Section 314.2 of this subchapter shall apply to such establishments, except that a separate room or compartment need not be provided for inedible products if they can be handled so that they do not create insanitary conditions in any room or compartment used for edible products or otherwise render any edible products adulterated and do not interfere with the conduct of inspection. For example, intestines, paunch contents, feet, and hides might be accumulated on the kill floor in clean, watertight drums with close fitting covers if there is sufficient space to store them out of the way until the close of the day's operation.
(e) Sections 316.7, 317.3, and 412.1 of this chapter apply to such establishments, except as provided in this paragraph (e).
(1) The operator of each such establishment will, prior to the inauguration of inspection, identify all labeling and marking devices in use, or proposed for use, (upon the date of inauguration of inspection) to the Front Line Supervisor of the circuit in which the establishment is located. Temporary approval, pending formal approval under §§ 316.7, 317.3, and 412.1 of this chapter, will be granted by the Front Line Supervisor for labeling and marking devices that he determines are neither false nor misleading, provided the official inspection legend bearing the official establishment number is applied to the principal display panel of each label, either by a mechanical printing device or a self-destructive pressure sensitive sticker, and provided the label shows the true product name, an accurate ingredient statement, the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, and any other features required by section 1(n) of the Act.
(2) The circuit supervisor will forward one copy of each item of labeling and a description of each marking device for which he has granted temporary approval to the Washington, DC, office of the Labeling and Packaging Staff and will retain one copy in a temporary approval file for the establishment.
(3) The operator of the official establishment shall promptly forward a copy of each item of labeling and a description of each marking device for which temporary approval has been granted by the Front Line Supervisor (showing any modifications required by the Front Line Supervisor) to the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff, accompanied by the formula and details of preparation and packaging for each product. Within 90 days after inauguration of inspection, all labeling material and marking devices temporarily approved by the Front Line Supervisor must receive approval as required by §§ 316.7, 317.3, and 412.1 of this chapter, or their use must be discontinued.
(4) The circuit supervisor will also review all shipping containers to insure that they do not have any false or misleading labeling and are otherwise not misbranded. Modifications of unacceptable information on labeling material by the use of self-destructive pressure sensitive tape or by blocking out with an ink stamp will be authorized on a temporary basis to permit the maximum allowable use of all labeling materials on hand. All unacceptable labeling material which is not modified to comply with the requirements of this subchapter must be destroyed or removed from the official establishment.
(f) Sections 320.1, 320.2, 320.3, 320.4, 320.5, 325.20, and 325.21 apply to operations and transactions not in or for commerce in a State designated under paragraph 301(c) only if the State is also designated under section 205 of the Act and if such provisions are applicable as shown in § 331.6.
(g) Section 321.1(a) of this subchapter will not apply to States designated under paragraph 301(c) of the Act.
(h) Parts 322 and 327 and § 325.3 of this subchapter relating to exports and imports do not apply to operations and transactions solely in or for intrastate commerce.
(i) Part 325 of this subchapter will apply to establishments required to have inspection under § 302.1(a)(2) of this subchapter and to operations and transactions solely in or for intrastate commerce, except as provided in paragraphs (h) and (j) of this section.
(j) Sections 325.4, 325.15, and 325.1(b) of this subchapter will not apply to require a certificate, or evidence thereof, for the distribution solely within any designated State of products that are U.S. inspected and passed and so marked.

§ 331.4
Control and disposal of non-federally-inspected products in States designated under paragraph 301(c) of the Act.
Upon the effective date of designation of a State under paragraph 301(c) of the Act, no products can be prepared within the State unless they are prepared under inspection pursuant to the regulations in this subchapter or are exempted from the requirement of inspection under § 303.1 of this subchapter, and no unexempted products which were prepared without any inspection can lawfully be distributed within the State. For a period of 90 days from the effective date of such designation, products which were prepared and inspected and passed under the supervision of a responsible State or local inspection agency can be distributed solely within the State, provided they are not adulterated or misbranded, except that the official inspection legend is not required. Within the 90-day period, products that have been inspected by the State or local inspection agency may be further prepared and otherwise handled in official establishments required to have inspection under § 302.1(a)(2) of this subchapter or at establishments exempted from the requirements of such inspection under § 303.1 of this subchapter, and may be distributed as provided in this section but otherwise shall be handled in accordance with § 305.4 of this subchapter. Such products shall not bear any [Federal] official inspection legends. After said 90-day period, only federally inspected and passed products may be distributed within the designated State, except as provided in § 303.1 of this subchapter.
§ 331.5
Criteria and procedure for designating establishments with operations which would clearly endanger the public health; disposition of products; application of regulations.
(a) An establishment preparing products solely for distribution within any State shall be designated as one producing adulterated products which would clearly endanger the public health, if:
(1) Any meat or meat food product prepared at the establishment is adulterated in any of the following respects:
(i) It bears or contains a pesticide chemical, food additive, or color additive, that is “unsafe” within the meaning of sections 408, 409, or 706 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or was intentionally subjected to radiation in a manner not permitted under section 409 of said Act; or if it bears or contains any other added poisonous or added deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health or make it unfit for human food; or
(ii) It consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance or is for any other reason unsound, unhealthful, or unwholesome or otherwise unfit for human food (for example, it was prepared from meat or other ingredients exhibiting spoilage characteristics; or it is, or was prepared from, a carcass affected with a disease transmissible to humans and its condemnation would be required
under part 309 or 310 of the Federal Meat Inspection regulations (9 CFR parts 309, 310) at federally inspected establishments; or
(iii) It has been prepared, packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth or may have been rendered injurious to health (for example if insects or vermin are not effectively controlled at the establishments, or insanitary water is used in preparing meat or meat food products for human food); or
(iv) It is, in whole or in part, the product of an animal that died otherwise than by slaughter; or
(v) Its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health; and
(2) Such adulterated articles are intended to be or are distributed from the establishment while capable of use as human food.
(b) When any such establishment is identified by a Program Inspector as one producing adulterated product, which would clearly endanger public health under the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section, the following procedure will be followed:
(1) The Program Inspector will informally advise the operator of the establishment concerning the deficiencies found by him and report his findings to the appropriate Regional Director for the Program. When it is determined by the Regional Director that any establishment preparing products solely for distribution within any State is producing adulterated products for distribution within such State which would clearly endanger the public health, written notification thereof will be issued to the appropriate State officials, including the Governor of the State and the appropriate Advisory Committee, for effective action under State or local law to prevent such endangering of the public health. Such written notification shall clearly specify the deficiencies deemed to result in the production of adulterated products and shall specify a reasonable time for such action under State or local law.
(2) If effective action is not taken under State or local law within the specified time, written notification shall be issued by the Regional Director to the operator of the establishment, specifying the deficiencies involved and allowing him ten days to present his views or make the necessary corrections, and notifying him that failure to correct such deficiencies may result in designation of the establishment and operator thereof as subject to the provisions of titles I and IV of the Act as though engaged in commerce.
(3) Thereafter the Program Inspector shall survey the establishment and designate it if he determines, in consultation with the Regional Director, that it is producing adulterated products, which would clearly endanger the public health, and formal notice of such designation will be issued to the operator of the establishment by the Regional Director.
(c) Products on hand at the time of designation of an establishment under this section are subject to detention, seizure and condemnation in accordance with part 329 of this subchapter:
Provided,
That products that have been federally inspected and so identified and that have not been further prepared at any nonfederally inspected establishment may be released for distribution if the products appear to be not adulterated or misbranded at the time of such release.
(d) No establishment designated under this section can lawfully prepare any products unless it first obtains inspection or qualifies for exemption under § 303.1 of this subchapter. All of the provisions of the regulations shall apply to establishments designated under this section, except that the exceptions provided for in § 331.3 of this part shall apply to such establishments.

§ 332.4
State request for cooperative agreement.
(a) State participation in a cooperative interstate shipment program under this part is limited to States that have implemented cooperative State meat inspection programs.
(b) To request an agreement for a cooperative interstate shipment program under this part, a State must submit a written request to the Administrator through the FSIS District Office for the FSIS District in which the State is located. In the request the State must:
(1) Identify establishments in the State that have requested to be selected for the program that the State recommends for initial selection into the program, if any;
(2) Demonstrate that the State is able to provide the necessary inspection services to selected establishments in the State and conduct any related activities that would be required under a cooperative interstate shipment program established under this part; and
(3) Agree that, if the State enters into an agreement with FSIS for a cooperative interstate shipment program, the State will:
(i) Provide FSIS with access to the results of all laboratory analyses conducted on product samples from selected establishments in the State;

(iii) When necessary, cooperate with FSIS to transition selected establishments in the State that have been deselected from a cooperative interstate shipment program to become official establishments.
(c) If the Administrator determines that a State that has submitted a request to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program qualifies to enter into a cooperative agreement for such a program, the Administrator and the State will sign a cooperative agreement that sets forth the terms and conditions under which each party will cooperate to provide inspection services to selected establishments located in the State.
(d) After the Administrator and a State have signed an agreement for a cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator will:

(c) Carcasses, parts of carcasses, meat, and meat food products prepared in a selected establishment and inspected and passed by designated State personnel must bear an official Federal mark, stamp, tag, or label of inspection in the appropriate form prescribed in
part 312 of this subchapter that includes the information specified in § 332.5(c) of this part.

(a) The FSIS selected establishment coordinator for a State that has entered into an agreement for a cooperative interstate shipment program will visit each selected establishment in the State on a regular basis to verify that the establishment is operating in a manner that is consistent with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter. The frequency with which the SEC will visit selected establishments under the SEC's jurisdiction will be based on factors that include, but are not limited to, the complexity of the operations conducted at the selected establishment, the establishment's schedule of operations, and the establishment's performance under the cooperative interstate shipment program. If necessary, the selected establishment coordinator, in consultation with the District Manager that covers the State, may designate qualified FSIS personnel to visit a selected establishment on behalf of the selected establishment coordinator.
(b) The selected establishment coordinator, in coordination with the State, will verify that selected establishments in the State are receiving the necessary inspection services from designated personnel, and that these establishments are eligible, and remain eligible, to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program. The selected establishment coordinator's verification activities may include:
(1) Verifying that each selected establishment employs, and continues to employ, 25 or fewer employees, on average, as required under § 332.3(a) of this part, unless the establishment is transitioning to become an official establishment;
(2) Verifying that the designated personnel are providing inspection services to selected establishments in a manner that complies with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter;

(c) If the selected establishment coordinator determines that designated personnel are providing inspection services to selected establishments in the State in a manner that is inconsistent with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter, the Administrator will provide an opportunity for the State to develop and implement a corrective action plan to address inspection deficiencies identified by the selected establishment coordinator. If the State fails to develop a corrective action plan, or the selected establishment coordinator for the State determines that the corrective action plan is inadequate, the Administrator will terminate the agreement for the cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in § 321.3(d) of this chapter.
§ 332.8
Quarterly reports.
(a) The selected establishment coordinator will prepare a report on a quarterly basis that describes the status of each selected establishment under his or her jurisdiction.
(b) The quarterly report required in paragraph (a) of this section will:
(1) Include the selected establishment coordinator's assessment of the performance of the designated personnel in conducting inspection activities at selected establishments and
(2) Identify those selected establishments that the selected establishment coordinator has verified are in compliance with the Act and implementing regulations in this chapter, those that have been deselected under § 332.10 of this part, and those that are transitioning to become official establishments under § 332.11 of this part.
(c) The selected establishment coordinator is to submit the quarterly report to the Administrator through the District Manager for the State where
the selected establishments identified in the report are located.
§ 332.9
Enforcement authority.

The Administrator may deselect any selected establishment that refuses to comply with this paragraph.
(b) Selected establishment coordinators may initiate any appropriate enforcement action provided for in part 500 of this chapter if they determine that a selected establishment under their jurisdiction is operating in a manner that is inconsistent with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter.

(c) If inspection at a selected establishment is suspended for any of the reasons specified in § 500.3 or § 500.4 of this chapter, FSIS will:
(1) Provide an opportunity for the establishment to implement corrective actions and remain in the cooperative interstate shipment program, or
(2) Move to deselect the establishment as provided in § 332.10 of this part.
(d) The decision to deselect a selected establishment under a suspension will be made on a case-by-case basis. In making this decision, FSIS, in consultation with the State where the selected establishment is located, will consider, among other factors:
(1) The non-compliance that led to the suspension;
(2) The selected establishment's compliance history; and
(3) The corrective actions proposed by the selected establishment.
§ 332.10
Deselection of ineligible establishments.
(a) The Administrator will deselect a selected establishment that becomes ineligible to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program for any reason listed under § 332.3(c) of this part.
(b) An establishment that has been deselected must transition to become an official establishment as provided in § 332.11 of this part.
§ 332.11
Transition to official establishment.
(a) If an establishment is deselected from a cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in § 332.10 of this part, FSIS, in coordination with the State where the establishment is located, will develop and implement a plan to transition the establishment to become an official establishment. Except that an establishment that was deselected from a cooperative interstate shipment program because it is located in a State whose agreement for such a program was terminated may either transition to become an official establishment or transition to become a State-inspected establishment under the cooperative State meat inspection program.
(b) An establishment that has been deselected from a cooperative interstate shipment program and successfully transitioned to become an official establishment may withdraw from the Federal inspection program and resume operations under the cooperative State meat inspection program after operating as an official establishment in full compliance with the Act for a year.
§ 332.12
Transition grants.
(a) Transition grants are funds that a State participating in a cooperative interstate shipment program under this part may apply for to reimburse selected establishments in the State for the cost to train one individual in the seven HACCP principles for meat or poultry processing as required under § 417.7 of this chapter and associated training in the development of sanitation standard operating procedures required under part 416 of this chapter.
(b) A State participating in a cooperative interstate shipment program that receives a transition grant must use grant funds to reimburse the training costs of one employee per each selected
establishment in the State. Any other use of such funds is prohibited.
§ 332.13
Separation of operations.
A selected establishment may conduct operations under the cooperative State meat inspection program if the establishment implements and maintains written procedures for complete physical separation of product and process for each operation by time or space.
§ 332.14
Voluntary withdrawal.
A selected establishment that is in full compliance with the requirements in this part may voluntarily end its participation in a cooperative interstate shipment program and operate under the cooperative State meat inspection program.

# Inspection Procedures; Ante-Mortem Inspections
§ 354.120
Manner of handling products in an official plant.
Unless otherwise specified in the regulations in this part or by the Administrator, products which are to be further processed under inspection in an official plant shall be prepared and handled in such official plant under the supervision of an inspector.
§ 354.121
Ante-mortem inspection.
An ante-mortem inspection of rabbits shall, where and to the extent considered necessary by the Administrator and under such instructions as he may issue from time to time, be made of rabbits on the day of slaughter in any official plant processing rabbits under inspection pursuant to the regulations in this part.
§ 354.122
Condemnation on ante-mortem inspection.
Rabbits found in a dying condition on premises of an official plant shall be immediately destroyed and, together with any rabbits found dead on such premises, shall be disposed of in accordance with § 354.132. Rabbits plainly showing, on ante-mortem inspection, any disease or condition, that under §§ 354.129 to 354.131, inclusive, would cause condemnation of their carcasses on post-mortem inspection, shall be condemned. Rabbits which, on ante-mortem inspection, are condemned shall not be dressed, nor shall they be conveyed into any department of the plant where rabbit products are prepared or held. Rabbits which have been condemned on ante-mortem inspection and have been killed shall, under the supervision of an inspector of the Inspection Service, receive treatment as provided in § 354.132.
§ 354.123
Segregation of suspects on ante-mortem inspection.
All rabbits which, on ante-mortem inspection, do not plainly show, but are suspected of being affected with any disease or condition that under §§ 354.129 to 354.131, inclusive, may cause condemnation in whole or in part on post-mortem inspection, shall be segregated from the other rabbits and held for separate slaughter, evisceration, and post-mortem inspection. The inspector shall be notified when such segregated lots are presented for post-mortem inspection and inspection of such rabbits shall be conducted separately. Such procedure for the correlation of ante-mortem and post-mortem findings by the inspector, as may be prescribed or approved by the Administrator, shall be carried out.
§ 354.124
Quarantine of diseased rabbits.
If live rabbits, which are affected by any contagious disease which is transmissible to man, are brought into an official establishment, such rabbits shall be segregated. The slaughtering of such rabbits shall be deferred and they shall be dealt with in one of the following ways:
(a) If it is determined by a veterinary inspector that further handling of the rabbits will not create a health hazard, the lot shall be subject to ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection pursuant to the regulations in this part.
(b) If it is determined by a veterinary inspector that further handling of the rabbits will not create a health hazard, such rabbits may be released for treatment under the control of an appropriate State or Federal agency. If the circumstances are such that release for treatment is impracticable, a careful rabbit-by-rabbit ante-mortem inspection shall be made, and all rabbits found to be, or which are suspected of being, affected with the contagious disease transmissible to man shall be condemned.

# Post-Mortem Inspection
§ 354.125
Evisceration.
No viscera or any part thereof shall be removed from any rabbits which are to be processed under inspection in any official plant, except at the time of evisceration and inspection. Each carcass to be eviscerated shall be opened so as to expose the organs and the body cavity for proper examination by the inspector and shall be prepared immediately after inspection as ready-to-cook rabbit.
§ 354.126
Carcasses held for further examination.
Each carcass, including all parts thereof, in which there is any lesion of disease or other condition, which might render such carcass or any part thereof unfit for human food, and with respect to which a final decision cannot be made on first examination by the inspector, shall be held for further examination. The identity of each such carcass, including all parts thereof, shall be maintained until a final examination has been completed.
§ 354.127
Condemnation and treatment of carcasses.
Each carcass, or any part thereof, which is found to be unsound, unwholesome, or otherwise unfit for human food shall be condemned by the inspector and shall receive such treatment, under the supervision of the inspector, as will prevent its use for human food and preclude dissemination of disease through consumption by animals.
§ 354.128
Certification of carcasses.
Each carcass and all parts and organs thereof which are found by the inspector to be sound, wholesome, and fit for human food shall be certified as provided in this part.

# Disposition of Diseased Rabbit Carcasses and Parts
§ 354.129
General.
The carcasses or parts of carcasses of all rabbits inspected at an official establishment and found at the time of post-mortem inspection, or at any subsequent inspection, to be affected with any of the diseases or conditions named in other sections in this part, shall be disposed of in accordance with the section pertaining to the disease or condition. Owing to the fact that it is impracticable to formulate rules for each specific disease or condition and to designate at just what stage a disease process results in an unwholesome product, the decision as to the disposal of all carcasses, parts, or organs not specifically covered by the regulations, or by instructions of the Administrator issued pursuant thereto, shall be left to the inspector in charge, and if the inspector in charge is in doubt concerning the disposition to be made, specimens from such carcasses shall be forwarded to the laboratory for diagnosis.
§ 354.130
Diseases or conditions evident which require condemnation.
(a) Carcasses of rabbits affected with or showing lesions of any of the following named diseases or conditions shall be condemned: Tularemia, anthrax, hemorrhagic septicemia, pyemia, septicemia, leukemia, acute enteritis, peritonitis, sarcomatosis, metritis, necrobacillosis (Smorl's Disease), tuberculosis, emaciation, streptobacillary pseudotuberculosis, and advanced stages of snuffles. Rabbits from pathological laboratories shall be condemned.
(b) Any organ or part of a rabbit carcass affected with a tumor shall be condemned and when there is evidence that the general condition of the rabbit has been affected by the size, position, or nature of the tumor, the whole carcass shall be condemned. In cases of malignant neoplasms involving any internal organ to a marked extent, or affecting the muscles, skeleton, or body lymph glands, even primarily, the whole carcass shall be condemned.
(c) Carcasses of rabbits showing any disease such as generalized melanosis, pseudoleukemia, and the like, which systemically affect the rabbit, shall be condemned.
(d) Any organ or part of a carcass which is badly bruised or which is affected by an abscess, or a suppurating sore, shall be condemned. Parts or carcasses which are contaminated by pus shall be condemned.
(e) Carcasses of rabbits contaminated by volatile oils, paints, poisons, gases, or other substances which affect the wholesomeness of the carcass shall be condemned.
(f) All carcasses of rabbits so infected that consumption of the meat or meat food products thereof may give rise to meat poisoning shall be condemned. This includes all carcasses showing signs of any of the following diseases: Acute inflammation of the lungs, pleura, pericardium, peritoneum or meninges; septicemia or pyemia, whether traumatic, or without evident
cause; gangrenous or severe hemorrhagic enteritis or gastritis; polyarthritis and acute nephritis. Immediately after the slaughter of any rabbit so infected, the infected premises and implements used shall be thoroughly sanitized. The part or parts of any carcass coming into contact with the carcass or any part of the carcass of any rabbit covered by this section other than those affected with acute inflammation of the lungs, pleura, pericardium, peritoneum or meninges, shall be condemned.
(g) Carcasses showing any degree of icterus with a parenchymatous degeneration of organs, the result of infection or intoxication, and those which, as a result of a pathological condition, show an intense yellow or greenish-yellow discoloration without evidence of infection or intoxication shall be condemned.
(h) Carcasses of rabbits affected with mange or scab in advanced stages, or showing emaciation or extension of the inflammation to the flesh, shall be condemned. When the diseased condition is slight, the carcass may be passed for food after removal and condemnation of the affected parts.
(i) In the disposal of carcasses and parts of carcasses showing evidence of infestation with parasites not transmissible to man, the following general rules shall govern: If the lesions are localized in such manner and are of such character that the parasites and the lesions caused by them may be radically removed, the non-affected portion of the carcass, or part of the carcass, may be certified for food after the removal and condemnation of the affected portions. Where a part of a carcass shows numerous lesions caused by parasites, or the character of the infestation is such that complete extirpation of the parasites and lesions is difficult and uncertainly accomplished, or if the parasitic infestation or invasion renders the organ or part in any way unfit for food, the affected organ or part shall be condemned. Where parasites are found to be distributed in a carcass in such a manner or to be of such a character that their removal and the removal of the lesions caused by them are impracticable, no part of the carcass shall be certified for food and the entire carcass shall be condemned. Carcasses infested with a hydatid cyst or cysts (Echinococcus granulosis), transmissible to dogs and from dogs to man, shall in all cases be condemned regardless of the degree of infestation.
(j) Carcasses of rabbits showing such degree of emaciation or anemic condition as would render the meat unwholesome, and carcasses which show a slimy degeneration of the fat or a serious infiltration of the muscles shall be condemned.
§ 354.131
Decomposition.
Carcasses of rabbits deleteriously affected by post-mortem changes shall be disposed of as follows:
(a) Carcasses which have reached a state of putrefaction or stinking fermentation shall be condemned.
(b) [Reserved]
(c) Carcasses affected by types of post-mortem change which are superficial in nature may be certified for food after removal and condemnation of affected parts.

All condemned carcasses, or parts of carcasses, shall be disposed of by one of the following methods, under the supervision of an inspector of the Inspection Service: (Facilities and materials for carrying out the requirements in this section shall be furnished by the official establishment.)
(a) Steam treatment (which shall be accomplished by processing the condemned product in a pressure tank under at least 40 pounds of steam pressure) or thorough cooking in a kettle or vat for a sufficient time to effectively destroy the product for human food purposes and preclude dissemination of disease through consumption by animals. Tanks and equipment used for this purpose or for rendering or preparing inedible products shall be in rooms or compartments separate from those used for the preparation of edible products. There shall be no direct connection, by means of pipes or otherwise, between tanks containing inedible products and those containing edible products.
(b) Incineration or complete destruction by burning.
(c) Chemical denaturing, which shall be accomplished by the liberal application to all carcasses and parts thereof, of:
(1) Crude carbolic acid,
(2) Kerosene, fuel oil, or used crank case oil,
(3) Any phenolic disinfectant conforming to commercial standards CS 70-41 or CS 71-41 which shall be used in at least 2 percent emulsion or solution, or

Temperatures and cooling and freezing procedures.
Temperatures and procedures which are necessary for cooling and freezing of rabbits in accordance with sound commercial practice shall be maintained in the coolers and freezers, and chilling temperatures and procedures shall also be in accordance with sound commercial practice.
(a)
Cooling.
Immediately after evisceration and washing of the carcass, it shall be placed in a cooling tank containing running cold tap water to remove the animal heat from the carcass. Carcasses shall not be allowed to remain in the cooling tank for longer than 1 hour.
(b)
Air chilling.
Immediately after the initial water chilling, the carcasses shall be placed in cooling racks and thereupon placed in a refrigerated cooler with moderate air movements and a temperature which will reduce the internal temperature of the carcasses to from 36 °F. to 40 °F., both inclusive, within 24 hours.
(c)
Freezing.
(1) When ready-to-cook rabbits are packaged in bulk or shipping containers, the carcasses should
be individually wrapped or packaged in water-vapor resistant cartons or the containers should be lined with heavy water-vapor resistant paper so as to assure adequate overlapping of the lining to completely surround the carcasses and to permit unsealed closure or sealing in such a manner that water-vapor loss from the product is considerably retarded or prevented. The rabbit carcasses should receive an initial rapid freezing under such packaging, temperature, air circulation, and stacking conditions which will result in freezing the carcasses solid in less than 48 hours.
(2) Frozen ready-to-cook rabbits shall be held under conditions which will maintain the product in a solidly frozen state with temperature maintained as constant as possible.
(d)
Refrigeration.
Immediately after packaging, all ready-to-cook rabbits, other than those which are shipped from the plant in a refrigerated carrier, should be moved into the freezer, except that a period not exceeding 72 hours will be permitted for transportation and temporary holding before placing in the freezer provided such rabbits are held at not above 36 °F.
§ 354.245
Vermin.
Every practicable precaution shall be taken to exclude flies, rats, mice, and other vermin from the official plant. Dogs, cats, and other pets shall be excluded from rooms where edible products are processed, handled, or stored.
§ 354.246
Exclusion of diseased persons.
No person affected with any communicable disease (including, but not being limited to, tuberculosis) in a transmissible stage shall be permitted in any room or compartment where exposed or unpacked edible products are prepared, processed, or otherwise handled.

# Subpart B—Administration; Application of Inspection and Other Requirements
§ 381.3
Administration.
(a) [Reserved]
(b) The Administrator may in specific classes of cases waive for limited periods any provisions of the regulations in order to permit appropriate and necessary action in the event of a public health emergency or to permit experimentation so that new procedures, equipment, and processing techniques may be tested to facilitate definite improvements:
Provided,
That such waivers of the provisions of the regulations are not in conflict with the purposes or provisions of the Act.
(c) Pursuant to section 6 of the Act, the Administrator believes that, in establishments processing poultry products at which inspection under the Act and regulations is required, the frequency with which and the manner in which poultry products made from poultry previously slaughtered and eviscerated in official establishments are reinspected by Inspection Service employees should be based on considerations relevant to effective regulation of poultry products and protection of the health and welfare of consumers. In order to test procedures for use in making such determinations and, in particular, for determining whether and, if so, to what extent the intensity of inspection coverage exceeds that which should be deemed necessary pursuant to section 6 of the Act, the Administrator is initiating experimentation of a new system of inspection for reviewing the performance of establishments and for designing the supervision and other conditions and methods of inspection coverage. For the period of such experimentation, the Administrator shall identify establishments for review, and the frequency and the manner of inspection by Inspection Service employees shall be determined on the basis of the results of those reviews and be otherwise in accordance with this section.
(d) The determinations referred to in paragraph (c) of this section shall be made by the Inspection Service and shall reflect evaluations of the performance and the characteristics of such establishments.
(1) In assessing the performance of an establishment, the following factors are appropriate for consideration:
(i) The history of compliance with applicable regulatory requirements by the person operating such establishment or by anyone responsibly connected with the business operating such establishment, as “responsibly connected” is defined in section 18(a) of the Act,
(ii) The competence of the person operating such establishment, as indicated by:
(A) Knowledge of appropriate manufacturing practices and applicable regulatory requirements,
(B) Demonstrated ability to apply such knowledge in a timely and consistent manner, and
(C) Commitment to correcting deficiencies noted by Inspection Service employees and otherwise assuring compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, and
(iii) The procedures used in such establishment to control the production process, environment, and resulting product in order to assure and monitor compliance with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
(2) In assessing the characteristics of an establishment, the following factors are appropriate for consideration:
(i) The complexity of the processing operation(s) conducted at such establishment,
(ii) The frequency with which each such operation is conducted at such establishment,
(iii) The volume of product resulting from each such operation at such establishment,
(iv) Whether and to what extent slaughter and evisceration operations also are conducted at such establishment,
(v) What, if any, food products not regulated under this Act or the Federal Meat Inspection Act also are processed at such establishment, and
(vi) The size of such establishment.
(e)(1) For the period of experimentation described in paragraph (c) of this section, the frequency of inspection by Inspection Service employees of operations other than slaughter and evisceration may be reduced in an establishment in which the procedures referred to therein are being tested if and only if the evaluation of the performance of such establishment described in paragraph (d)(1) indicates that there are:
(i) No instances, documented in records compiled no earlier than 10 years before, of substantial and recent noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements (taking into account both the nature and frequency of any such noncompliance), and
(ii) The competence and control procedures needed to assure and monitor compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
(2)(i) The frequency of Federal inspection and other conditions and methods of inspection coverage in any establishment in which the frequency of Federal inspection is reduced shall be based on:
(A) The evaluation of the characteristics of such establishment described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section,
1
1
These evaluations will be based upon guidelines developed by FSIS and the complexity categorization in FSIS Directive 1030.2 (Documentation of Processing and Combination Assignments, 4/22/85). The guidelines and Directive will be available for public inspection and copying in the Policy Office, Room 3168, South Agriculture Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC.
(B) The significance of potential public health consequences of noncompliance, and
(C) The availability of Inspection Service employees.
(ii) To the extent that frequency of inspection or other conditions and methods of inspection coverage are identified as conflicting with provisions of the regulations in this part, the Administrator will waive such provisions for the period of experimentation, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
[37 FR 9706, May 16, 1972, as amended at 52 FR 10033, Mar. 30, 1987; 69 FR 255, Jan. 5, 2004]
§ 381.4

(4) For purposes of this paragraph, the term “private nonprofit institution” means “a corporation, and any community chest, fund, or foundation, organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes, or to foster national or international amateur sports competition (but only if no part of its activities involve the provision of athletic facilities or equipment), or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual, no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation, and which does not participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distribution of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.”
(5) The Administrator may withdraw or modify the exemption set forth in § 381.10(e)(1) for a particular establishment when he or she determines that such action is necessary to ensure food safety and public health. Before such action is taken, the owner or operator of the particular establishment shall be notified, in writing, of the reasons for the proposed action and shall be given an opportunity to respond, in writing, to the Administrator within 20 days after notification of the proposed action. The written notification shall be served on the owner or operator of the establishment in the manner prescribed in section 1.147(b) of the Department's Uniform Rules of Practice
(7 CFR 1.147(b)). In those instances where there is conflict of any material fact, the owner or operator of the establishment, upon request, shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the disputed fact, in accordance with rules of practice which shall be adopted for the proceeding. However, such withdrawal or modification shall become effective pending final determination in the proceeding when the Administrator determines that an imminent threat to food safety or public health exists, and that such action is, therefore, necessary to protect the public health, interest or safety. Such withdrawal or modification shall be effective upon oral or written notification, whichever is earlier, to the owner or operator of the particular establishment as promptly as circumstances permit. In the event of oral notification, written confirmation shall be given to the owner or operator of the establishment as promptly as circumstances permit. This withdrawal or modification shall continue in effect pending the completion of the proceeding and any judicial review thereof, unless otherwise ordered by the Administrator.

§ 381.11
Exemptions based on religious dietary laws.
(a) Any person who slaughters, processes, or otherwise handles poultry or poultry products which have been or are to be processed as required by recognized religious dietary laws may apply for exemption from specific provisions of the Act or regulations which are in conflict with such religious dietary laws. Any person desiring such an exemption shall apply in writing to the Meat and Poultry Inspection Program, Food Safety and Inspection Service, Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, setting forth the specific provisions of the Act and the regulations from which exemption is sought and setting forth the provisions of the religious dietary laws in support of the requested exemption. In addition, the applicant for such an exemption shall submit a statement from the clerical official having jurisdiction over the enforcement of the religious dietary laws with respect to the poultry or poultry products involved, which identifies the requirements of such laws pertaining to the slaughter of the poultry and the processing or other handling of the poultry products involved, and certifies that such requirements are in conflict with specific provisions of the Act and regulations from which the exemption is sought.
(b) The Administrator, upon a determination that an exemption should be granted, will grant such exemption to the extent necessary to avoid conflict with the religious requirements while still effectuating the purposes of the Act. He may impose such conditions as to sanitary standards, practices, and procedures in granting such exemption as he deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of the Act. Any person who processes poultry or poultry products under exemption from certain requirements as provided in this section shall be subject to all of the other applicable provisions of the Act and the regulations. Processing plants shall meet the sanitary requirements set forth in this part and unless exempted from inspection under the provisions of this subpart, shall be required to qualify for inspection and operate as official establishments. Slaughtered poultry which is prepared under an exemption authorizing the sale of noneviscerated poultry in commerce shall be individually identified with a label approved by the Administrator which identifies the clerical official under whose supervision the poultry was slaughtered.
§ 381.12
Effect of religious dietary laws exemptions on other persons.
Whenever a slaughterer or processor is granted an exemption under § 381.11 with respect to the slaughtering or processing of any poultry or poultry products under this part, under specified conditions, the sale, offer for sale, transportation and other handling in
commerce by any person of such poultry and poultry products in accordance with such conditions is hereby authorized, except as restricted by the Act.
§ 381.13
Suspension or termination of exemptions.
(a) The Administrator may, by order, in accordance with the applicable rules of practice suspend or terminate any exemption under § 381.10(a) with respect to any person whenever he finds that such action will aid in effectuating the purposes of the Act. Failure to comply with the conditions of the exemption, including, but not limited to, failure to process poultry and poultry products under clean and sanitary conditions may result in termination of an exemption, in addition to any other penalties provided by law.
(b) Except as provided in § 381.10(c), the Administrator may extend the requirements of the Act to any establishment in any State or organized territory at which poultry products are processed for distribution solely within such jurisdiction if he determines in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph 5(c)(1) of the Act that the establishment is producing adulterated poultry products which would clearly endanger the public health.
§ 381.14
Inspection concerning purportedly exempted operations.
Inspectors of the Inspection Service are authorized to make inspections in accordance with law to ascertain whether any of the provisions of the Act or the regulations applying to producers, retailers, or other persons purporting to be exempted from any requirements under this subpart have been violated.
§ 381.15
Exemption from definition of “poultry product” of certain human food products containing poultry.
The following articles contain poultry ingredients only in a relatively small proportion or historically have not been considered by consumers as products of the poultry food industry. Therefore said articles are exempted from the definition of “poultry product” and the requirements of the Act and the regulations applicable to poultry products, if they comply with the conditions specified in this section.
(a) Any human food product (in a consumer package) not provided for in paragraph (c) of this section, if:
(1) It contains less than 2 percent cooked poultry meat (deboned white or dark poultry meat, or both) and/or “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” as defined in § 381.173;
(2) It contains less than 10 percent of cooked poultry skins, giblets, or fat, separately, and less than 10 percent of cooked poultry skins, giblets, fat, and meat (as meat is limited in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) or “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” as defined in § 381.173, in any combination;
(3) The poultry ingredients used in the product were prepared under inspection as defined in § 381.1, or were inspected under a foreign inspection system approved under § 381.196(b) and imported in compliance with the Act and the regulations;
(4) The immediate container of the product bears a label which shows the name of the product in accordance with this section; and
(5) The product is not represented as a poultry product. The aforesaid percentages of ingredients shall be computed on the basis of the moist, deboned, cooked poultry in the ready-to-serve product when prepared according to the serving directions on the consumer package.
(b) Any human food product (in an institutional pack), not provided for in paragraph (c) of this section, if:
(1) It is prepared for sale only to institutional users, such as hotels, restaurants, and boardinghouses, for use as a soup base or flavoring;
(2) It contains less than 15 percent cooked poultry meat (deboned white or dark poultry meat or both) and/or “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” as defined in § 381.173, computed on the basis of the moist deboned, cooked poultry meat and/or “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” in such product; and
(3) It complies with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(3), (4), and (5) of this section in all respects.
(c) Bouillon cubes, poultry broths, gravies, sauces, seasonings, and flavorings if:
(1) They contain poultry meat and/or “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” as defined in § 381.173 or poultry fat only in condimental quantities;
(2) They comply with the provisions of paragraphs (a)(3), (4), and (5) of this section in all respects; and

(e) Products of the types specified in this section except those specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section will be deemed to be represented as poultry products if the kind name of the poultry (chicken, turkey, etc.) is used in the product name of the product without appropriate qualification. For example, a consumer-packaged noodle soup product containing less than 2 percent chicken meat on a ready-to-serve basis may not be labeled “Chicken Noodle Soup” but, when appropriate, could be labeled as “Chicken Flavored Noodle Soup.” Products exempted under this section are subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

# Subpart D—Application for Inspection; Grant or Refusal of Inspection
§ 381.16
How application shall be made.
The operator of each establishment of the kind required by § 381.6 to have inspection shall make application to the Administrator for inspection service. In cases of change of name, ownership, or location, a new application shall be made.
§ 381.17
Filing of application.
Every application for inspection at any establishment shall be made by the operator on a form furnished by the Meat and Poultry Inspection Program, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250, and shall include all information called for by that form, including the name of any subsidiary corporation that will prepare any poultry product or conduct any other operation at the establishment for which inspection is requested. The applicant for inspection will be held responsible for compliance by all its subsidiaries with the requirements of the regulations at such establishments if inspection is granted. Processing of poultry products and other operations at the establishment for which inspection is granted may be conducted only by the applicant, except that such a subsidiary of the grantee, may conduct such operations at such establishment.
§ 381.18
Authority of applicant.
Any person applying for inspection service may be required at the discretion of the Administrator to demonstrate that the operator of the establishment authorized him to do so.
§ 381.20
Survey and grant of inspection.
(a) Before inspection is granted, FSIS shall survey the establishment to determine if the construction and facilities of the establishment are in accordance with the regulations. FSIS will grant inspection, subject to § 381.21, when these requirements are met.
(b) FSIS shall give notice in writing to each applicant granted inspection and shall specify in the notice the establishment, including the limits of the establishment's premises, to which the grant pertains.
[62 FR 45026, Aug. 25, 1997]
§ 381.21
Refusal of inspection.
(a) Any application for inspection in accordance with this part may be denied or refused in accordance with the rules of practice in part 500 of this chapter.
(b)(1) Any applicant for inspection at an establishment where the operations thereof may result in any discharge into the navigable waters of the United States is required by subsection 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, to provide the Administrator with a certification as prescribed in said subsection that there is
reasonable assurance that such activity will be conducted in a manner which will not violate the applicable water quality standards. No grant of inspection can be issued after April 3, 1970 (the date of enactment of the Water Quality Improvement Act), unless such certification has been obtained, or is waived because of failure or refusal of the State, interstate agency, or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to act on a request for certification within 1 year after receipt of such request. Further, upon receipt of an application for inspection and a certification as required by subsection 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Administrator (as defined in § 381.1) is required by paragraph (2) of said subsection to notify the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for proceedings in accordance with that paragraph. No grant of inspection can be made until the requirements of said paragraph (2) have been met.
(2) However, certification under subsection 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is not initially required in connection with an application for inspection granted after April 3, 1970, for facilities existing or under construction on April 3, 1970, although certification for such facilities is required to be obtained within the 3-year period immediately following April 3, 1970. Failure to obtain such certification or to meet the other requirements of subsection 21(b) prior to April 3, 1973, will result in the termination of inspection at such facilities on that date.
(3) Further, any application for inspection pending on April 3, 1970, and granted within 1 year thereafter shall not require certification for 1 year following the grant of inspection but such grant of inspection shall terminate at the end of 1 year after its issuance unless prior thereto such certification has been obtained and the other requirements of subsection 21(b) are met.
(4) In the case of any activity which will affect water quality but for which there are no applicable water quality standards, no certification is required prior to the grant of inspection but such grant will be conditioned upon a requirement of compliance with the purpose of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as provided in paragraph 21(b)(9) of said Act.

(b) Before being granted Federal inspection, an establishment shall have conducted a hazard analysis and developed and validated a HACCP plan, in accordance with §§ 417.2 and 417.4 of this chapter. A conditional grant of inspection shall be issued for a period not to exceed 90 days, during which period the establishment must validate its HACCP plan.
(c) Before producing new product for distribution in commerce, an establishment shall have conducted a hazard analysis and developed a HACCP plan applicable to that product in accordance with § 417.2 of this chapter. During a period not to exceed 90 days after the date the new product is produced for distribution in commerce, the establishment shall validate its HACCP plan, in accordance with § 417.4 of this chapter.

§ 381.37
Schedule of operations.
(a) No operations requiring inspection shall be conducted except under the supervision of an Inspection Service employee. All eviscerating of poultry and further processing shall be done with reasonable speed, considering the official establishment's facilities.
(b) A shift is a regularly scheduled operating period, exclusive of mealtime. One lunch period is the only official authorized interruption in the inspector's tour of duty once it begins. Lunch periods may be 30 minutes, 45 minutes, or in any case may not exceed one hour in duration. Once established, the lunch period must remain relatively constant as to time and duration. Lunch periods for inspectors shall not, except as provided herein, occur prior to 4 hours after the beginning of scheduled operations nor later than 5 hours after operations begin. In plants where a company rest break of not less than 30 minutes is regularly observed, approximately midpoint between start of work and the lunch period, and the inspector is allowed this time to meet his personal needs, the lunch period may be scheduled as long as 5
1/2
hours after the beginning of scheduled operations.
(c) Official establishments, importers, and exporters shall be provided inspection service, without charge, up to 8 hours per shift during the basic workweek subject to the provisions of § 381.38:
Provided,
That any additional shifts meet requirements as determined by the Administrator or his designee. The basic workweek shall consist of 5 consecutive 8-hour days within the administrative workweek Sunday through Saturday, except that, when possible, the Department shall schedule the basic workweek so as to consist of 5 consecutive 8-hour days Monday through Friday. The 8-hour day excludes the lunch period but shall include activities deemed necessary by the Agency to fully carry out an inspection program, including the time for FSIS inspection program personnel to put on required gear, pick up required forms and walk to a work station; and the time for FSIS inspection program personnel to return from a work station, drop off required forms, and remove required gear; and to conduct duties scheduled by FSIS, including administrative duties. The Department may depart from the basic workweek in those cases where maintaining such a schedule would seriously handicap the Department in carrying out its functions. These provisions are applicable to all official establishments except in certain cases as provided in § 381.145(h) of this subchapter.
(d)(1) Each official establishment shall submit a work schedule to the area supervisor for approval. In consideration of whether the approval of an establishment work schedule shall be given, the area supervisor shall take in account the efficient and effective use of inspection personnel. The work schedule must specify the workweek, daily clock hours of operation, and lunch periods for all departments of the establishment requiring inspection.
(2) Establishments shall maintain consistent work schedules. Any request by an establishment for a change in its work schedule involving changes in the workweek or an addition or elimination of shifts shall be submitted to the area supervisor at least 2 weeks in advance of the proposed change. Frequent requests for change shall not be approved:
Provided, however,
Minor deviations from a daily operating schedule may be approved by the inspector in charge if such request is received on the day preceding the day of change.
(3) Requests for inspection service outside an approved work schedule shall be made as early in the day as possible for overtime work to be performed within that same workday; or made prior to the end of the day's operation when such a request will result in overtime service at the start of the following day:
Provided,
That an inspector may be recalled to his assignment after the completion of his daily tour of duty under the provisions of § 381.39(b).

(f)
Procedures for controlling visible fecal contamination.
Official poultry slaughter establishments must develop, implement, and maintain written procedures to ensure that poultry carcasses contaminated with visible fecal material do not enter the chiller. Establishments must incorporate these procedures into their HACCP plans, or sanitation SOPs, or other prerequisite programs.
(g)
Procedures for controlling contamination throughout the slaughter and dressing operation.
Official poultry slaughter establishments must develop, implement, and maintain written procedures to prevent contamination of carcasses and parts by enteric pathogens and fecal contamination throughout the entire slaughter and dressing operation. Establishments must incorporate these procedures into their HACCP plans, or sanitation SOPs, or other prerequisite programs. At a minimum, these procedures must include sampling and analysis for microbial organisms in accordance with the sampling location and frequency requirements in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section to monitor their ability to maintain process control.
(1)
Sampling locations.
Establishments, except for very small establishments operating under Traditional Inspection or very low volume establishments operating under Traditional Inspection must collect and analyze samples for microbial organisms at the pre-chill and post-chill points in the process. Very small establishments operating under Traditional Inspection and very low volume establishments operating under Traditional Inspection must collect and analyze samples for microbial organisms at the post-chill point in the process.
(i) Very small establishments are establishments with fewer than 10 employees or annual sales of less than $2.5 million.
(ii) Very low volume establishments annually slaughter no more than 440,000 chickens, 60,000 turkeys, 60,000 ducks, 60,000 geese, 60,000 guineas, or 60,000 squabs.
(2)
Sampling frequency.
(i) Establishments, except for very low volume establishments as defined in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, must, at a minimum, collect and analyze samples at a frequency proportional to the establishment's volume of production at the following rates:

[66 FR 1771, Jan. 9, 2001; 66 FR 19714, Apr. 17, 2001, as amended at 79 FR 49634, Aug. 21, 2014]
§ 381.66
Temperatures and chilling and freezing procedures.
(a)
General.
Temperatures and procedures that are necessary for chilling and freezing ready-to-cook poultry, including all edible portions thereof, must be in accordance with operating procedures that ensure the prompt removal of the animal heat, preserve the condition and wholesomeness of the poultry, and assure that the products are not adulterated.
(b)
Chilling performance standards, except for ratites.
(1)(i) Each official poultry slaughter establishment must ensure that all poultry carcasses, parts, and giblets are chilled immediately after slaughter operations so that there is no outgrowth of pathogens, unless such poultry is to be frozen or cooked immediately at the official establishment.
(ii) Previously chilled poultry carcasses and major portions must be kept chilled so that there is no outgrowth of the pathogens, unless such poultry is to be packed and frozen immediately at the official establishment.
(2) After product has been chilled, the establishment must prevent the outgrowth of pathogens on the product as long as the product remains at the establishment.
(3) The establishment must develop, implement, and maintain written procedures for chilling that address, at a minimum, the potential for pathogen outgrowth, the conditions affecting carcass chilling, and when its chilling process is completed. The establishment must incorporate these procedures into its HACCP plan, or sanitation SOP, or other prerequisite program.
(c)
Ice and water chilling.
(1) Only ice produced from potable water may be used for ice and water chilling, except that water and ice used for chilling may be reused in accordance with § 416.2(g). The ice must be handled and stored in a sanitary manner.
(2)(i) Poultry chilling equipment must be operated in a manner consistent with meeting the applicable pathogen reduction performance standards for raw poultry products as set forth in § 381.94 and the provisions of the establishment's HACCP plan.
(ii) Major portions of poultry carcasses, as defined in § 381.170(b)(22), may be chilled in water and ice.
(d)
Water absorption and retention.
(1) Poultry washing, chilling, and draining practices and procedures must be such as will minimize water absorption and retention at time of packaging.
(2) The establishment must provide scales, weights, identification devices, and other supplies necessary to conduct water tests.
(e)
Air chilling.
Air chilling is the method of chilling raw poultry carcasses and parts predominately with air. An antimicrobial intervention may be applied with water at the beginning of the chilling process, provided that its use does not result in any net pick-up of water or moisture during the chilling process. The initial antimicrobial intervention may result in some temperature reduction of the product, provided that the majority of temperature removal is accomplished exclusively by chilled air.
(f)
Freezing.
(1) Ready-to-cook poultry which is to be or is labeled with descriptive terms such as “fresh frozen,” “quick frozen” or “frozen fresh” or any other term implying a rapid change from a fresh state to a frozen state shall be placed into a freezer within 48 hours after initial chilling in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. During this period, if such poultry is not immediately placed into a freezer after chilling and packaging, it shall be held at 36 °F. or lower.
(2) Ready-to-cook poultry shall be frozen in a manner so as to bring the
internal temperature of the birds at the center of the package to 0 °F. or below within 72 hours from the time of entering the freezer. Such procedures shall not apply to raw poultry product described in § 381.129(b)(6)(i) of this subchapter.
(3) Upon written request, and under such conditions as may be prescribed by the Administrator, in specific cases, ready-to-cook poultry which is to be frozen immediately may be moved from the official establishment prior to freezing:
Provided,
That the plant and freezer are so located and such necessary arrangements are made that the Inspection Service will have access to the freezing room and adequate opportunity to determine compliance with the time and temperature requirements specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
(4) Warm packaged ready-to-cook poultry which is to be chilled by immediate entry into a freezer within the official establishment shall within 2 hours from time of slaughter be placed in a plate freezer or a freezer with a functioning circulating air system where a temperature of −10 °F. or lower is maintained.
(5) Frozen poultry shall be held under conditions which will maintain the product in a solidly frozen state with temperature maintained as constant as possible under good commercial practice.

§ 381.67
Young chicken and squab slaughter inspection rate maximums under traditional inspection procedure.
The maximum number of birds to be inspected by each inspector per minute under the traditional inspection procedure for the different young chicken and squab slaughter line configurations are specified in the following table. These maximum rates will not be exceeded. The inspector in charge will be responsible for reducing production line rates where in the inspector's judgment the prescribed inspection procedure cannot be adequately performed within the time available, either because the birds are not presented by the official establishment in such a manner that the carcasses, including both internal and external surfaces and all organs, are readily accessible for inspection, or because the health conditions of a particular flock dictate a need for a more extended inspection procedure. The standards in 381.170(a) of this part specify which classes of birds constitute young chickens and squabs. Section 381.76(b) specifies when either the traditional inspection procedure or the modified traditional inspection procedure can or must be used.

§ 381.68
Maximum inspection rates—New turkey inspection system.
(a) The maximum inspection rates for one inspector New Turkey Inspection (NTI-1 and NTI-1 Modified) and two inspectors New Turkey Inspection (NTI-2 and NTI-2 Modified) are listed in the table below. The line speeds for NTI-1 and NTI-2 are for lines using standard 9-inch shackles on 12-inch centers with birds hung on every shackle and opened with J-type or Bar-type opening cuts. The line speeds for NTI-1 Modified and NTI-2 Modified are for Bar-type cut turkey lines using a shackle with a 4-inch by 4-inch selector (or kickout), a 45 degree bend of the
lower 2 inches, an extended central loop portion of the shackle that lowers the abdominal cavity opening of the carcasses to an angle of 30 degrees from the vertical in direct alignment with the inspector's view, and a width of 10.5 inches. Maximum rates for those establishments having varying configurations will be established by the Administrator but will not exceed those in the table. Neither the rates in the table nor those established for establishments with varying configurations shall be exceeded under any circumstances.
(b) There are two categories of turkeys for determining inspection rates, “light turkeys” and “heavy turkeys”. Light turkeys are all turkeys weighing less than 16 pounds. Heavy turkeys are all turkeys weighing 16 pounds or more. The weights refer to the bird at the point of post-mortem inspection, with blood, feathers and feet removed.
(c) The inspector in charge may reduce inspection line rates when in his/her judgment the prescribed inspection procedure cannot be adequately performed within the time available because the health conditions of a particular flock or other factors, including the manner in which birds are being presented to the inspector for inspection and the level of contamination among the birds on the line, dictate a need for a more extended inspection.

# Subpart J—Ante Mortem Inspection
§ 381.70
Ante mortem inspection; when required; extent.
(a) An ante mortem inspection of poultry shall, where and to the extent considered necessary by the Administrator and under such instructions as he may issue from time to time, be
made of poultry on the day of slaughter in any official establishment.
(b) The examination and inspection of ratites will be on the day of slaughter, except:
(1) When it is necessary for humane reasons to slaughter an injured animal at night or on a Sunday or holiday, and the FSIS veterinary medical officer cannot be obtained; or
(2) In low volume establishments, when ante mortem inspection cannot be done on the day of slaughter, and the birds to be slaughtered have received ante mortem inspection in the last 24 hours, provided the establishment has an identification and control system over birds that have received ante mortem inspection.
[37 FR 9706, May 16, 1972, as amended at 66 FR 22906, May 7, 2001]
§ 381.71
Condemnation on ante mortem inspection.
(a) Birds plainly showing on ante mortem inspection any disease or condition, that under §§ 381.80 to 381.93, inclusive, would cause condemnation of their carcasses on post mortem inspection, shall be condemned. Birds which on ante mortem inspection are condemned shall not be dressed, nor shall they be conveyed into any department of the official establishment where poultry products are prepared or held. Poultry which has been condemned on ante mortem inspection and has been killed or died otherwise shall under the supervision of an inspector of the Inspection Service, be disposed of as provided in § 381.95.
(b) Dead-on-arrival ratites and ratites condemned on ante mortem inspection will be tagged “U.S. Condemned” by an establishment employee under FSIS supervision and disposed of by one of the methods prescribed in § 381.95.
(c) All seriously crippled ratites and non-ambulatory ratites, commonly termed “downers,” shall be identified as “U.S. Suspects.”
(d) Ratites exhibiting signs of drug or chemical poisoning shall be withheld from slaughter.
(e) Ratites identified as “U.S. Suspects” or “U.S. Condemned” may be set aside for treatment. The “U.S. Suspect” or “U.S. Condemned” identification device will be removed by an establishment employee under FSIS supervision following treatment if the bird is found to be free of disease. Such a bird found to have recovered from the condition for which it was treated may be released for slaughter or for purposes other than slaughter, provided that in the latter instance permission is first obtained from the local, State, or Federal sanitary official having jurisdiction over movement of such birds.
(f) When it is necessary for humane reasons to slaughter an injured ratite at night or Sunday or a holiday, and the Agency veterinary medical officer cannot be obtained, the carcass and all parts shall be kept for inspection, with the head and all viscera except the gastrointestinal tract held by the natural attachment. If all parts are not so kept for inspection, the carcass shall be condemned. If on inspection of a carcass slaughtered in the absence of an inspector, any lesion or other evidence is found indicating that the bird was sick or diseased, or affected with any other condition requiring condemnation of the animal on ante mortem inspection, or if there is lacking evidence of the condition that rendered emergency slaughter necessary, the carcass shall be condemned. Ratites that are sick, dying, or that have been treated with a drug or chemical and presented for slaughter before the required withdrawal period, are not covered by emergency slaughter provisions.
[37 FR 9706, May 16, 1972, as amended at 66 FR 22906, May 7, 2001; 67 FR 13258, Mar. 22, 2002]
§ 381.72
Segregation of suspects on ante mortem inspection.
(a) All birds, except ratites, that on ante mortem inspection do not plainly show, but are suspected of being affected with, any disease or condition that under §§ 381.80 to 381.93 of this Part may cause condemnation in whole or in part on post mortem inspection, shall be segregated from the other poultry and held for separate slaughter, evisceration, and post mortem inspection. The inspector shall be notified when such segregated lots are presented for post mortem inspection, and inspection
of such birds shall be conducted separately. Such procedure for the correlation of ante mortem and post mortem findings by the inspector, as may be prescribed or approved by the Administrator, shall be carried out.
(b) All ratites showing symptoms of disease will be segregated, individually tagged as “U.S. Suspects” by establishment personnel under FSIS supervision with a serially numbered metal or plastic leg band or tag bearing the term “U.S. Suspect,” and held for further examination by an FSIS veterinarian. Depending upon the findings of the veterinarian's examination, these birds will either be passed for regular slaughter, slaughtered as suspects, withheld from slaughter, or condemned on ante mortem. Those ratites affected with conditions that would be readily detected on post mortem inspection need not be individually tagged on ante mortem inspection with the “U.S. Suspect” tag provided that such ratites are segregated and otherwise handled as “U.S. Suspects.” All ratites identified as “U.S. Condemned” shall be tagged by establishment personnel, under FSIS supervision, with a serially numbered metal or plastic leg band or tag bearing the term “U.S. Condemned.”
[66 FR 22906, May 7, 2001]
§ 381.73
Quarantine of diseased poultry.
If live poultry, which is affected by any contagious disease which is transmissible to man, is brought into an official establishment, such poultry shall be segregated. The slaughtering of such poultry shall be deferred and the poultry shall be dealt with in one of the following ways:
(a) If it is determined by a veterinary inspector that further handling of the poultry will not create a health hazard, the lot shall be slaughtered separately, subject to ante mortem and post mortem inspection pursuant to the regulations.
(b) If it is determined by a veterinary inspector that further handling of the poultry will create a health hazard, such poultry may be released for treatment under the control of an appropriate State or Federal agency. If the circumstances are such that release for treatment is impracticable, a careful bird-by-bird ante mortem inspection shall be made, and all birds found to be, or which are suspected of being, affected with a contagious disease transmissible to man shall be condemned.
§ 381.74
Poultry suspected of having biological residues.
When any poultry at an official establishment is suspected of having been treated with or exposed to any substance that may impart a biological residue that would make their edible tissues adulterated, they shall, at the option of the operator of the establishment, be processed at the establishment and the carcasses and all parts thereof retained under U.S. Retained tags, pending final disposition in accordance with § 381.80, of this part, and other provisions in subpart K; or they shall be slaughtered at the establishment and buried or incinerated in a manner satisfactory to the inspector. Alternatively, such poultry may be returned to the grower, if further holding is likely to result in their not being adulterated by reason of any residue. The Inspection Service will notify the other Federal and State agencies concerned of such action. To aid in determining the amount of residue present in the poultry, officials of the Inspection Service may permit the slaughter of any such poultry for the purpose of collecting tissues for analysis of the residue. Such analysis may include the use of inplant screening procedures designed to detect the presence of antimicrobial residues in any species of poultry.
[47 FR 41336, Sept. 20, 1982]
§ 381.75
Poultry used for research.
(a) No poultry used in any research investigation involving an experimental biological product, drug, or chemical shall be eligible for slaughter at an official establishment unless the operator of such establishment, the sponsor of the investigation, or the investigator has submitted to the Inspection Service, or the Veterinary Biologics unit of Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the Department or the Environmental Protection Agency, or the Food
and Drug Administration of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, data or a summary evaluation of the data which demonstrates that the use of such biological product, drug, or chemical will not result in the products of such poultry being adulterated, and the Administrator has approved such slaughter.

# Subpart K—Post Mortem Inspection; Disposition of Carcasses and Parts
§ 381.76
Post-mortem inspection under Traditional Inspection, the Streamlined Inspection System (SIS), the New Line Speed (NELS) Inspection System, the New Poultry Inspection System (NPIS), the New Turkey Inspection System (NTI), and Ratite Inspection.
(a) A post-mortem inspection shall be made on a bird-by-bird basis on all poultry eviscerated in every official establishment. Each carcass, or all parts comprising such carcass, must be examined by an inspector, except for parts that are not needed for inspection purposes and are not intended for human food and are condemned. Each carcass eviscerated shall be prepared as ready-to-cook poultry.
(b)(1) There are six systems of post-mortem inspection: the New Poultry Inspection System (NPIS), which may be used for young chickens and turkeys; the Streamlined Inspection System (SIS) and the New Line Speed Inspection System (NELS), both of which may be used only for broilers and cornish game hens; the New Turkey Inspection (NTI) System, which may be used only for turkeys; Traditional Inspection, which may be used for all poultry, except for ratites; and Ratite Inspection.
(i) The SIS shall be used only for broilers and cornish game hens if:
(
a
) The Administrator determines that SIS will increase inspector efficiency; or
(
b
) The operator requests SIS and the Administrator determines that the system will result in no loss of inspection efficiency.
(ii) The NELS Inspection System shall be used only for broilers and cornish game hens if:
(
a
) The operator requests the NELS Inspection System, and
(
b
) The Administrator determines that the establishment has the intent and capability to operate at line speeds greater than 70 birds per minute, and meets all the facility requirements in § 381.36(d).
(iii) The NTI System shall be used only for turkeys if:
(
a
) The operator requests it, and
(
b
) The Administrator determines that the establishment meets all the facility requirements in § 381.36(e).
(iv) The NPIS may be used for young chickens and turkeys if the official establishment requests to use it and meets or agrees to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(6) of this section and the Administrator approves the establishment's request. The Administrator may permit establishments that slaughter classes of poultry other than young chickens and turkeys to operate under the New Poultry Inspection System under a waiver from the provisions of the regulations as provided in § 381.3(b).
(v) Traditional Inspection shall be used for turkeys when neither the NTI System nor the NPIS is used. For other classes of poultry, Traditional Inspection shall be used when SIS, NELS, and the NPIS are not used.
(2) Official establishments that operate under Traditional Inspection, SIS, NELS, NTI, or Ratite Inspection must meet the following requirements:
(i) No viscera or any part thereof may be removed from any poultry processed in any official establishment, except at the time of post-mortem inspection, unless its identity with the rest of the carcass is maintained in a manner satisfactory to the inspector until such inspection is made.
(ii) Each carcass to be eviscerated must be opened so as to expose the organs and the body cavity for proper examination by the inspector.
(iii) If a carcass is frozen, it must be thoroughly thawed before being opened for examination by an inspector.
(3) The following requirements are applicable to SIS:
(i)
Definitions.
For purposes of this paragraph, the following definitions shall apply:
(
a
)
Cumulative sum (CUSUM).
A statistical concept used by the establishment and monitored by the inspector whereby compliance is determined based on sample results collected over a period of time. For purposes of determining compliance with the finished product standards, the CUSUM is equal to the sum of prior test results plus the weighted result of the current test minus the tolerance, with the condition that the resulting CUSUM cannot go below zero.
(
b
)
Tolerance number.
A weighted measure that equates to product being produced at a national product quality level. See Table 2.
(
c
)
Action number.
A level reached by the CUSUM where the process is out of control and product action is required by the establishment or the inspector. See Table 2.
(
d
) “Start number”. A value halfway between zero and the action number. The start number is used to determine the starting CUSUM for the first subgroup of a shift and to reset the CUSUM value if the CUSUM is equal to or greater than the action number. See Table 2.
(
e
)
Subgroup.
A 10-bird sample collected before product enters the chiller and after product leaves the chiller.
(
f
)
Subgroup absolute limit.
The tolerance number plus 5. See Table 2.
(
g
)
Prechill testing.
Testing conducted by the establishment to determine the CUSUM on consecutive 10-bird subgroup samples collected prior to product entering the chilling system.
(
h
)
Postchill testing.
Testing conducted by the establishment to determine the CUSUM on consecutive 10-bird subgroup samples collected as the product leaves the chilling system.
(
i
)
Rework.
Reprocessing the product to correct the condition or conditions causing the nonconformances listed in Table 1.
(ii)
General. (a
) Under SIS, one inspector inspects the outside, inside, and viscera of each bird. There may be two inspectors on one processing line, each inspecting every other bird. For the establishment to run its processing line(s) at maximum speed, optimal conditions must be maintained so that inspection may be conducted efficiently. The inspector in charge determines the speed at which each processing line may be operated to permit inspection. A variety of conditions may affect this determination including the health of each flock and the manner in which birds are being presented to the inspector for inspection.
(
b
) SIS may be performed by one inspector (SIS-1) or two inspectors (SIS-2). SIS-1 requires that the establishment provide one inspection station for each line and adequate reinspection facilities so carcasses can be removed from each line for evaluation. The maximum line speed for SIS-1 is 35 birds per minute. SIS-2 requires that the establishment provide two inspection stations for each line and adequate reinspection facilities so carcasses can be removed from each line for evaluation. The maximum line speed for SIS-2 is 70 birds per minute.
(
c
) Under all inspection systems, including SIS, inspectors conduct post-mortem inspection and look for a number of conditions, as specified elsewhere in this subpart, which may indicate adulteration. Adulterated product is condemned and destroyed, except that carcasses and parts which may be made unadulterated by reprocessing (reworking) may be so reprocessed under the supervision of an inspector and reinspected. Under SIS, inspectors also reinspect product by sampling finished birds (both before and after chilling) for nonconformances with finished product standards (see Table 1). If such nonconformances are present at certain statistical levels, it may indicate process difficulties requiring corrective action by the establishment. If the establishment does not take adequate corrective action, the inspector shall initiate corrective actions such as conducting closer post-mortem inspections and requiring reprocessing and reinspection of previously processed carcasses and parts. Thus, SIS is conducted in two phases—a post-mortem inspection phase and a reinspection phase. The following paragraphs describe the inspection requirements (not addressed elsewhere in this subpart) under each.
(iii)
Post-mortem inspection.
(
a
) Facilities: Each inspection station must comply with the facility requirements in § 381.36(c).
(
b
) Presentation: Each inspector shall be flanked by an establishment employee assigned to be the inspector's helper. The one inspector on the SIS-1 line shall be presented every bird. Each inspector on the SIS-2 line shall be presented every other bird on the line. An establishment employee shall present each bird to the inspector properly eviscerated with the back side toward the inspector and the viscera uniformly trailing or leading. Each inspector shall inspect the inside, viscera, and outside of all birds presented.
(
c
) Disposition: The inspector shall determine which birds shall be salvaged, reprocessed, condemned, retained for disposition by the veterinarian, or allowed to proceed down the line as a passed bird subject to trim and reinspection. Carcasses with certain defects not requiring condemnation of the entire carcass shall be passed by the inspector, but shall be subject to reinspection to ensure the physical removal of the defects. The helper, under the supervision of the inspector, shall mark such carcasses for trim when the defects are not readily observable. Trimming of birds passed subject to reinspection shall be performed by:
(
1
) The helper, time permitting, and
(
2
) One or more plant trimmers positioned after all giblets are harvested and prior to reinspection.
(iv)
Reinspection.
(
a
) Facilities: Reinspection stations are required at both the prechill and postchill locations. The Agency will determine the number of stations needed in those establishments having more than one processing line or more than one chiller. One or more prechill reinspection stations shall be conveniently located at the end of the line or lines prior to chilling. One or more postchill stations must be conveniently located at the end of the chiller or chillers. The prechill and postchill reinspection stations must meet the following provisions:
(
1
) Floor space shall consist of 3 feet along each conveyor line. The space shall be level and protected from all traffic and overhead obstructions.
(
2
) A table at least 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep and 3 feet in height designed to be readily cleanable and drainable shall be provided for reinspecting the sampled birds.
(
3
) A minimum of 200 foot-candles of shadow-free lighting with a minimum color rendering index of 85 on the table surface.
(
4
) A separate clip board holder shall be provided for holding the recording sheets.
(
5
) Hangback racks designed to hold 10 carcasses shall be provided for and positioned within easy reach of the person at the station.
(
b
) Disposition: An inspector shall monitor the establishment's application of the Finished Product Standards program and shall take corrective action including retaining product to prevent adulterated product from leaving the establishment when the inspector determines that the establishment has failed to apply the program as prescribed in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(
c
) of this section).
(
c
) Finished Product Standards: Finished Product Standards (FPS) are criteria applied to processed birds before and after chill to ensure that the product being produced is consistently wholesome and unadulterated. These criteria consist of nonconformances (listed in Table 1), the incidence of which is determined from 10 bird subgroup samples, reduced to a CUSUM number, and measured against the standards (Table 2). The standards are applied to permit the Agency to estimate when the production process is in control and when it is out of control. The establishment is responsible for maintaining FPS which, in turn, is monitored by the inspector. FPS is applied in two separate parts. The first is called prechill testing. It is designed to ensure that the slaughter and evisceration procedures are in control. Compliance is measured by determining the CUSUM on consecutive 10-bird subgroup samples collected prior to product entering the chilling system. The second part of the FPS is called postchill testing. It is designed to monitor the production through the chill system to ensure that it meets the
postchill FPS. This test is independent of the prechill test. Compliance is measured by determining the CUSUM on consecutive 10-bird subgroup samples as they exit the chilling system. When the system is operating within compliance, the establishment applies the FPS to product samples at the prechill reinspection station. Testing time and time between tests are such that birds represented by the test are still within the chiller. If an out-of-compliance condition is found, the product leaving the chiller is segregated for rework and retested before it may proceed into commerce. A second 10 bird subgroup sample of the birds is taken after they leave the chiller to ensure that the product meets the postchill FPS. Since the product is closer to the end of processing, the controls on releasing reworked product are stricter than controls under prechill testing, again to ensure that no adulterated product enters into commerce.
(
d
)
Prechill testing.
The prechill FPS have been divided into processing and trim categories. The processing category is designed to monitor the output of the dressing and evisceration procedures. The trim category monitors the establishment's ability to remove unwholesome lesions and conditions from inspected and passed carcasses. Each category is monitored independently of the other category using a separate CUSUM for each category.
(
1
)
Actions to be taken when the process is in control.
If the CUSUM is less than the action number and the subgroup absolute limit is not exceeded, the process is judged to be in control.
(
i
) Establishment Actions. The establishment shall:
(
A
) Randomly select and record subgroup sampling times for each production unit of time before product reaches the prechill reinspection station on the production line. In no case shall the time between tests exceed 1 hour of production time.
(
B
) Conduct a 10-bird subgroup test at a random time on each poultry slaughter line. These times are preselected by the establishment and available to the inspector prior to the start of the shift/day's operations. All 10 samples of the subgroup shall be collected at the random time.
(
C
) Obtain the weighted value of each nonconformance by multiplying the number recorded for each nonconformance by the “factor” in Table 1, sum the total of all the nonconformances, and calculate the CUSUM value for that test.
(
ii
) Inspector Actions. The inspector shall:
(
A
) Select random times for monitoring subgroup tests for each half-shift on the evisceration line. In establishments that have multiple evisceration lines on a production shift, monitor all lines of product at the random times.
(
B
) Collect the subgroup samples to be monitored at preselected times. All 10 samples of the subgroup shall be collected at the random time selected in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(
d
)(
1
)(
ii
)(
A
) of this section.
(
C
) Conduct the 10-bird monitoring subgroup test.
(
2
)
Actions to be taken when the subgroup absolute limit is exceeded.
If either an inspector or establishment subgroup test exceeds the subgroup absolute limit of tolerance plus 5 (T + 5), the establishment shall determine if any of the immediate past 5 plant prechill subgroups for that category (processing or trim) resulted in a CUSUM above the start number.
(
i
) If all of the past 5 plant prechill subgroups are at or below the start number, the establishment shall immediately conduct a retest subgroup on that category of prechill to determine sample validity. If retest subgroup total equals tolerance or less, the establishment resumes random time testing. If the retest subgroup total exceeds tolerance, the establishment shall proceed as if CUSUM reaches the action number and shall begin process actions as set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(
d
)(
4
) of this section. In either case, the prechill retest results will be used to calculate CUSUM.
(
ii
) If any of the past 5 plant prechill subgroups resulted in a CUSUM above the start number, the establishment shall proceed as if CUSUM reaches the action number and shall begin process actions as set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(
d
)(
4
) of this section.
(
3
)
Actions to be taken when a trimmable lesion/condition is found.
If either inspection or plant monitoring finds any trimmable lesion or condition as specified in item B(7) of Table 1 during a prechill subgroup test, the establishment shall immediately conduct an additional prechill subgroup test for the same trimmable lesion/condition category. This is a requirement on the subgroup testing for the prechill trim nonconformance that is in addition to the CUSUM test described in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(
d
)(
1
) of this section.
(
i
) If no additional item in the same category is found on retest, the establishment shall resume random time sampling.
(
ii
) If an additional item in the same category is found on retest, the establishment shall proceed as if CUSUM reaches the action number and shall initiate corrective action set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(
d
)(
4
) of this section for this category only.
(
4
)
Actions to be taken when the CUSUM reaches the action number.
Once CUSUM reaches the action number, the process is judged to be not in control.
(
i
) Establishment Actions. The establishment shall:
(
A
) Immediately notify the inspector in charge and the production supervisor responsible for the affected evisceration line.
(
B
) Suspend random time prechill testing of the affected nonconformance category (processing or trim). Suspend random time postchill subgroup testing when the processing category is the affected nonconformance category.
(
C
) Conduct subgroup retests on carcasses leaving the chill system. Apply the prechill criteria in Table 1 (A) or (B), depending upon which category caused the action, and apply prechill Finished Product Standards as listed in Table 2 to determine product compliance. In no case shall the time between retests exceed 30 minutes of production time. Apply prechill standard criteria at the postchill location after notifying the establishment's production supervisor. If any of these subgroup retests on product leaving the chill system result in a subgroup total exceeding tolerance, identify for rework subsequent product at the postchill location. All noncomplying product will be brought into compliance prior to release into commerce. Product from the chiller will continue accumulating for rework until a subsequent subgroup test results in a subgroup total equal to or less than tolerance.
(
D
) Conduct additional subgroup tests at the prechill reinspection station to determine the adequacy of production corrective action. If the prechill tests results in a subgroup total exceeding the tolerance, notify the production supervisor. The number of additional tests at the postchill reinspection station using prechill standards is increased as required to include the product in the chiller represented by this additional prechill test.
(
E
) After two consecutive additional prechill subgroup tests result in subgroup totals equal to or less than tolerance:
—Resume random time prechill subgroup testing as set forth in actions to be taken when the process is in control at paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(
d
)(
1
) of this section.
—Identify product entering the chill system that will mark the end of the retest action upon arrival at the postchill sampling location. Such identification may include tagging or empty space in chillers, depending upon the establishment's identification method.
—Once all product identified as needing retesting has arrived at the postchill sampling location, random time postchill FPS testing resumes.
—If two consecutive additional prechill subgroup tests demonstrate process control with subgroup totals equal to or less than tolerance, but they do not cause CUSUM to fall to the start line or below, reset CUSUM at the start number.
(
ii
) Inspector Actions. The inspector shall monitor product and process actions by making spot-check observations to ensure that all program requirements are met.
(
e
)
Postchill testing.
Postchill subgroups shall be collected after the product leaves the chiller but before the product is divided into separate processes. Each bird sampled shall be observed and its conformance measured against the postchill criteria. The subgroup nonconformance weights shall be totaled and the CUSUM calculated by subtracting the tolerance from the sum of the subgroup total and the starting CUSUM.
(
1
)
Actions to be taken when the process is in control.
If the CUSUM is less than
the action number and the subgroup absolute limit is not exceeded, the process is judged to be in control.
(
i
) Establishment Actions. The establishment shall conduct a 10-bird subgroup test for each chiller system at a randomly selected time of production. In no case shall the time between tests exceed 2 hours of production time.
(
ii
) Inspector Actions. The inspector shall:
(
A
) Select random times for postchill monitoring.
(
B
) Monitor each chill system twice per shift.
(
C
) Conduct subgroup tests at preselected random times.
(
2
)
Actions to be taken when the subgroup absolute limit is exceeded.
If either an inspector or establishment subgroup test exceeds the subgroup absolute limit of tolerance plus 5(T + 5), the establishment shall determine if any of the last 5 postchill monitoring subgroups resulted in a CUSUM above the start number.
(
i
) If all of the past 5 postchill monitoring subgroups resulted in a CUSUM at or below the start number, the establishment shall immediately retest a subgroup to determine sample validity. If this retest subgroup total exceeds tolerance, the establishment shall proceed as if CUSUM reaches the action number and shall begin process actions as set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(
e
)(
3
) of this section.
(
ii
) If any of the past 5 postchill monitoring subgroups resulted in a CUSUM above the start number, the establishment shall proceed as if CUSUM reaches the action number and shall begin process actions as set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(
e
)(
3
) of this section.
(
3
)
Actions to be taken when the CUSUM reaches the action number.
Once CUSUM reaches the action number, the process is judged to be not in control.
(
i
) Establishment Actions. The establishment shall:
(
A
) Notify the inspector in charge and the production supervisor responsible for product in the chiller.
(
B
) Suspend random time postchill subgroup testing.
(
C
) Immediately conduct an additional postchill subgroup test. If the retest subgroup total exceeds tolerance, the establishment shall identify subsequent product for rework. Product will continue accumulating for rework until a subsequent subgroup test results in a subgroup total equal to or less than tolerance.
(
D
) After two consecutive additional postchill subgroup tests results in subgroup totals equal to or less than tolerance:
—Resume random time postchill subgroup testing as set forth in actions to be taken when the process is in control at paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(
e
)(
1
) of this section.
—If the two consecutive additional postchill subgroup totals equal to or less than tolerance do not cause CUSUM to fall to the start number or below, reset CUSUM at the start number.
(
ii
) Inspector Actions. The inspector shall monitor product and process actions to ensure that program requirements are met.
(v) When the prechill or postchill product has been identified as having been produced when the process was not in control, additional online subgroup testing by the establishment is required to determine its conformance to the standard. If any of the additional plant subgroup testing results in a subgroup total exceeding tolerance, offline product corrective actions must take place. The responsibilities of the establishment and the inspector change depending on the CUSUM.
All corrective actions such as identifying affected product, segregating product, and maintaining control through rework actions are the establishment's responsibility. Corrective actions by the inspector depends upon the establishment's ability to control rework of affected product. If the establishment fails in its responsibilities, the inspector will identify, segregate, and retain affected product to prevent adulterated product from reaching consumers.
(
a
) Offline product. The establishment shall identify the affected product so that it may be segregated and accumulated offline for rework. The inspector shall spot check the establishment's identification, segregation, and control of reworked product to ensure that program requirements are met.
(
b
) Reworked product. Reworked product must be tested by the establishment with a randomly selected subgroup test of the accumulated reworked lot. Before product is released, the random subgroup test must result in a subgroup total equal to or less than tolerance. If the subgroup test of a reworked lot results in a subgroup total exceeding tolerance, the lot must be reworked again before another subgroup is selected. The following actions are required.
(
1
) Establishment Actions. The establishment shall:
(
i
) Select the random subgroup from throughout the lot only after the total lot has been reworked.
(
ii
) Conduct the subgroup test using the same criteria (prechill or postchill) that resulted in the rework action.
(
iii
) Release the lot if the reworked subgroup test resulted in a subgroup total equal to or less than tolerance.
(
iv
) Identify and control the lot to be reworked if the reworked subgroup total again exceeds tolerance.
(
2
) Inspector Actions: The inspector shall spot check the rework procedure to ensure that plant monitoring and production meet the requirements of the program.
(vi) After the 10 bird subgroup tests are completed, the prechill and postchill processing nonconformances shall be corrected on all bird samples prior to returning the samples to the product flow. Samples with trim nonconformances shall be returned to the trim station for correction prior to their return to the product flow.

(i) Inspection under NELS is conducted in two phases, as post-mortem inspection phase and a reinspection phase.
(
a
)
Post-mortem inspection.
The establishment shall provide three inspection stations on each eviscerating line in compliance with the facility requirements § 381.36(d)(1). The three inspectors shall inspect the inside, viscera, and outside of all birds presented. Each inspector shall be flanked by two establishment employees—the presenter and the helper. The presenter shall ensure that the bird is properly eviscerated and presented for inspection and the viscera uniformly trailing or leading. The inspector shall determine which birds shall be salvaged, reprocessed, condemned, retained for disposition by the veterinarian, or allowed to proceed down the line as a passed bird subject to reinspection. Poultry carcasses with certain defects not requiring condemnation of the entire carcass shall be passed by the inspector, but shall be subject to reinspection to ensure the physical removal of the specified defects. The helper, under the supervision of the inspector, shall mark such carcasses for trim when the defects are not readily observable. Trimming or birds passed subject to reinspection shall be performed by:
(
1
) The helper, time permitting, and
(
2
) One or more plant trimmers positioned after giblet harvest and prior to reinspection.
(
b
) A reinspection station shall be located at the end of each line. This station shall comply with the facility requirements in § 381.36(d)(2). The inspector shall ensure that the establishment has performed the indicated trimming of carcasses passed subject to reinspection by visually monitoring, checking data, or gathering samples at the station or at other critical points on the line.
(ii)-(iii) [Reserved]
(iv) The maximum inspection rate for NELS shall be 91 birds per minute per eviscerating line.
(5) The following requirements are also applicable to the NTI System:
(i) Inspection under the NTI System is conducted in two phases, a post-mortem inspection phase and a reinspection phase. The NTI-1 Inspection System requires that the establishment provide one inspection station for each line and adequate reinspection facilitiates so carcasses can be removed from each line for evaluation. The NTI-2 Inspection System requires that the establishment provide two inspection stations for each line and adequate reinspection facilities so carcasses can be removed from each line for evaluation.
(
a
)
Post-mortem inspection.
Each inspection station must comply with the facility requirements in § 381.36(e)(1). Each inspector shall be flanked by and establishment employee assigned to be the inspector's helper. The one inspector on an NTI-1 Inspection System shall be presented every bird. Each inspector on an NTI-2 Inspection System line shall be presented every other bird on the line. An establishment employee shall present each bird to the inspector properly eviscerated with the back side toward the inspector and the viscera uniformly trailing or leading. Each inspector shall inspect the inside, viscera, and outside of all birds presented. The inspector shall determine which bird shall be salvaged, reprocessed, condemned, retained for disposition by a veterinarian, or allowed to proceed down the line as a passed bird
subject to reinspection. Turkey carcasses with certain defects not requiring condemnation of the entire carcass shall be passed by the inspector, but shall be subject to reinspection to ensure the physical removal of the specified defects. The helper, under the supervision of the inspector, shall mark such carcasses for trim when the defects of birds passed subject to reinspection shall be performed by:
(
1
) The helper, time permitting, and
(
2
) One or more plant trimmers positioned after the giblet harvest and prior to reinspection.
(
b
)
Reinspection.
A reinspection station shall be located at the end of the lines. This station shall comply with the facility requirements in § 381.36(e)(2). The inspector shall ensure that establishments have performed the indicated trimming of each carcass passed subject to reinspection by visually monitoring, checking data, and/or sampling product at the reinspection station and, if necessary, at other points, critical to the wholesomeness of product, on the eviscerating line.
(ii)-(iii) [Reserved]
(6) The following requirements are applicable to the NPIS:
(i)
Facilities.
The establishment must comply with the facilities requirements in § 381.36(f).
(ii)
Carcass sorting and disposition.
(A) The establishment must conduct carcass with associated viscera sorting activities, dispose of carcasses and parts exhibiting condemnable conditions, and conduct appropriate trimming and reprocessing activities before carcasses are presented to the online carcass inspector.
(B) Any carcasses removed from the line for reprocessing activities or salvage must be returned to the line before the online carcass inspection station. The establishment must include in its written HACCP plan, or sanitation SOP, or other prerequisite program a process by which parts, other than parts identified as “major portions” as defined in § 381.170(b)(22), are available for inspection offline after reprocessing or salvage.
(C) The establishment must develop, implement, and maintain written procedures to ensure that poultry carcasses contaminated with septicemic and toxemic conditions do not enter the chiller. The establishment must incorporate these procedures into its HACCP plan, or sanitation SOP, or other prerequisite program. These procedures must cover, at a minimum, establishment sorting activities required under paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section.
(D) The establishment must maintain records to document that the products resulting from its slaughter operation meet the definition of ready-to-cook poultry in § 381.1. These records are subject to review and evaluation by FSIS personnel.
(iii)
Presentation for online carcass inspection.
To ensure the online carcass inspector may properly inspect every carcass, the establishment must present carcasses as follows:
(A) Each carcass, except carcasses and parts identified as “major portions” under 9 CFR 381.179(b)(22), must be held by a single shackle;
(B) Both hocks of each carcass must be held by the shackle;
(C) The back side of the carcass must be faced toward the inspector;
(D) There must be minimal carcass swinging motion;
(E) The establishment must ensure that it can sufficiently identify viscera and parts corresponding with each carcass inspected by the online carcass inspector so that if the carcass inspector condemns a carcass all corresponding viscera and parts are also condemned.

§ 381.77
Carcasses held for further examination.
Each carcass, including all parts thereof, in which there is any lesion of disease, or other condition which might render such carcass or any part thereof adulterated and with respect to which a final decision cannot be made on first examination by the inspector, shall be held for further examination.
The identity of each such carcass, including all parts thereof, shall be maintained until a final examination has been completed.
§ 381.78
Condemnation of carcasses and parts: separation of poultry suspected of containing biological residues.
(a) At the time of any inspection under this subpart each carcass, or any part thereof, which is found to be adulterated shall be condemned, except that any such articles which may be made not adulterated by reprocessing, need not be so condemned if so reprocessed under the supervision of an inspector and thereafter found to be not adulterated.
(b) When a lot of poultry suspected of containing biological residues is inspected in an official establishment, all carcasses and any parts of carcasses in such lot which are condemned shall be kept separate from all other condemned carcasses or parts.
[37 FR 9706, May 16, 1972, as amended at 48 FR 22899, May 23, 1983; 48 FR 23807, May 27, 1983]

§ 381.91
Contamination.
(a) Carcasses of poultry contaminated by volatile oils, paints, poisons, gases, scald vat water in the air sac system, or other substances which render the carcasses adulterated shall be condemned. Any organ or other part of a carcass which has been accidentally multilated in the course of processing shall be condemned, and if the whole carcass is affected, the whole carcass shall be condemned.
(b) Any carcass of poultry accidentally contaminated during slaughter with digestive tract contents need not be condemned if promptly reprocessed under the supervision of an inspector and thereafter found not to be adulterated. Contaminated surfaces that are cut must be removed only by trimming. Contaminated inner surfaces that are not cut may be cleaned by trimming alone or may be re-processed as provided in subparagraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1)
Online reprocessing.
Poultry carcasses accidentally contaminated with digestive tract contents may be cleaned by applying an online reprocessing antimicrobial intervention to all carcasses after evisceration and before the carcasses enter the chiller if the parameters for use of the antimicrobial intervention system have been approved by the Administrator. Establishments must incorporate procedures for the use of any online reprocessing antimicrobial intervention system into their HACCP plans, or sanitation SOPs, or other prerequisite programs.
(2)
Offline reprocessing.
Contaminated inner surfaces that are not cut may be cleaned at an approved reprocessing station away from the main processing line by any method that will remove the contamination, such as vacuuming, washing, and trimming, singly or in combination. All visible specks of contamination must be removed, and if the inner surfaces are reprocessed other than solely by trimming, all surfaces of the carcass must be treated with chlorinated water containing 20 ppm to 50 ppm available chlorine or another approved antimicrobial substance in accordance with the parameters approved by the Administrator.

The establishment must collect samples from whole ratites at the end of the chilling process. Samples from ratites may be collected by sponging the carcass on the back and thigh or samples can be collected by rinsing the whole carcass in an amount of buffer appropriate for that type of bird.
(iii)
Sampling frequency.
Establishments that slaughter ratites, except very low volume ratite establishments as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section, must take samples at a frequency proportional to the establishment's volume of production at the following rate: 1 sample per 3,000 carcasses, but at a minimum one sample each week of operation.
(iv)
Sampling frequency alternatives.
An establishment operating under a validated HACCP plan in accordance with § 417.2(b) of this chapter may substitute an alternative frequency for the frequency of sampling required under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section if,
(A) The alternative is an integral part of the establishment's verification procedures for its HACCP plan and,
(B) FSIS does not determine, and notify the establishment in writing, that the alternative frequency is inadequate to verify the effectiveness of the establishment's processing controls.
(v)
Sampling in very low volume ratite establishments.
(A) Very low volume ratite establishments annually slaughter no more than 6,000 ratites. Very low volume ratite establishments that slaughter ratites in the largest number must collect at least one sample during each week of operation after June 1 of each year, and continue sampling at a minimum of once each week the establishment operates until June of the following year or until 13 samples have been collected, whichever comes first.
(B) Upon the establishment's meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(v)(A) of this section, weekly sampling and testing is optional, unless changes are made in establishment facilities, equipment, personnel or procedures that may affect the adequacy of existing process control measures, as determined by the establishment or by FSIS. FSIS determinations that changes have been made requiring resumption of weekly testing shall be provided to the establishment in writing.

E. coli
that is approved as an AOAC Official Method of the AOAC International (formerly the Association of Official Analytical Chemists) or approved and published by a scientific
body and based on the results of a collaborative trial conducted in accordance with an internationally recognized protocol on collaborative trials and compared against the three tube Most Probable Number (MPN) method and agreeing with the 95 percent upper and lower confidence limit of the appropriate MPN index.
(4)
Recording of test results.
The establishment shall maintain accurate records of all test results, in terms of colony forming units (CFU)/ml of rinse fluid. Results shall be recorded onto a process control chart or table showing at least the most recent 13 test results. Records shall be retained at the establishment for a period of 12 months and shall be made available to FSIS upon request.
(5) Establishments shall evaluate
E. coli
test results using statistical process control techniques.
(6)
Failure to meet criteria.
Test results that do not meet the criteria described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section are an indication that the establishment may not be maintaining process controls sufficient to prevent fecal contamination. FSIS shall take further action as appropriate to ensure that all applicable provisions of the law are being met.
(7)
Failure to test and record.
Inspection will be suspended in accordance with rules of practice that will be adopted for such proceeding, upon a finding by FSIS that one or more provisions of paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section have not been complied with and written notice of same has been provided to the establishment.

§ 381.107
Special procedures as to certification of poultry products for export to certain countries.
When export certificates are required by any foreign country for poultry products exported to such country, the Administrator shall in specific cases prescribe or approve the form of export certificate to be used and the methods and procedures he deems appropriate with respect to the processing of such products, in order to comply with requirements specified by the foreign country regarding the export products. Inspectors shall satisfy themselves that all such requirements are met before issuing such an export certificate. It shall be the responsibility of the exporter to provide any unofficial documentation needed to meet the foreign requirements, before the export certificate will be issued. Such certificates may also cover articles exempted from definition as a poultry product under § 381.15 if they have been inspected and are certified under the regulations in part 362 of this chapter.

# Subpart N—Labeling and Containers
§ 381.115
Containers of inspected and passed poultry products required to be labeled.
Except as may be authorized in specific cases by the Administrator with respect to shipment of poultry products between official establishments, each shipping container and each immediate container of any inspected and passed poultry product shall at the time it leaves the official establishment bear a label which contains information, and has been approved, in accordance with this subpart.
§ 381.116
Wording on labels of immediate containers.
(a) Each label for use on immediate containers for inspected and passed poultry products shall bear on the principal display panel (except as otherwise permitted in the regulations), the items of information required by this subpart. Such items of information shall be in distinctly legible form. Except as provided in § 381.128, all words, statements and other information required by or under authority of the Act to appear on the label or labeling shall appear thereon in the English language:
Provided, however,
That in the case of products distributed solely in Puerto Rico, Spanish may be substituted for English for all printed matter except the USDA inspection legend.
(b) The principal display panel shall be the part of a label that is most likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for sale. The principal display panel shall be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label information required to be placed thereon by the regulations with clarity and conspicuousness and without being obscured by design or vignettes, or crowding. Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, information required to be placed on the principal display panel shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. The area that is to bear the principal display panel shall be:
(1) In the case of a rectangular package, one entire side, the area of which
is the product of the height times the width of that side.
(2) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container:
(i) An area on the side of the container that is 40 percent of the product of the height of the container times the circumference, or
(ii) A panel, the width of which is one-third of the circumference and the height of which is as high as the container:
Provided, however,
That there is, immediately to the right or left of such principal display panel, a panel which has a width not greater than 20 percent of the circumference and a height as high as the container, and which is reserved for information prescribed in §§ 381.118, 381.122, and 381.123. Such panel shall be known as the “20 percent panel” and such information may be shown on that panel in lieu of showing it on the principal display panel as provided in this § 381.116.
(3) In the case of a container of any other shape, 40 percent of the total surface of the container.
In determining the area of the principal display panel, exclude tops, bottoms, flanges at tops and bottoms of cans, and shoulders and necks of bottles or jars.
(c) (1) The information panel is that part of a label that is the first surface to the right of the principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the principal display panel, with the following exceptions:
(i) If the first surface to the right of the principal display panel is too small to accommodate the required information or is otherwise unusable label space, e.g., folded flaps, tear strips, opening flaps, heat-sealed flaps, the next panel to the right of this part of the label may be used.
(ii) If the package has one or more alternate principal display panels, the information panel is to the right of any principal display panel.
(iii) If the top of the container is the principal display panel and the package has no alternate principal display panel, the information panel is any panel adjacent to the principal display panel.
(2) (i) Except as otherwise permitted in this part, all information required to appear on the principal display panel or permitted to appear on the information panel shall appear on the same panel unless there is insufficient space. In determining the sufficiency of the available space, except as otherwise prescribed in this part, any vignettes, designs, and any other nonmandatory information shall not be considered. If there is insufficient space for all required information to appear on a single panel, it may be divided between the principal display panel and the information panel, provided that the information required by any given provision of this part, such as the ingredients statement, is not divided and appears on the same panel.
(ii) All information appearing on the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear in one place without intervening material, such as designs or vignettes.
[37 FR 9706, May 16, 1972, as amended at 40 FR 11347, Mar. 11, 1975; 59 FR 40214, Aug. 8, 1994]
§ 381.117
Name of product and other labeling.
(a) The label shall show the name of the product, which, in the case of a poultry product which purports to be or is represented as a product for which a definition and standard of identity or composition is prescribed in subpart P, shall be the name of the food specified in the standard, and in the case of any other poultry product shall be the common or usual name of the food, if any there be, and if there is none, a truthful descriptive designation.
(b) The name of the product required to be shown on labels for fresh or frozen raw whole carcasses of poultry shall be in either of the following forms: The name of the kind (such as chicken, turkey, or duck) preceded by the qualifying term “young” or “mature” or “old”, whichever is appropriate; or the appropriate class name as described in § 381.170(a). The name of the kind may be used in addition to the class name, but the name of the kind alone without the qualifying age or class term is not acceptable as the name of the product, except that the name “chicken” may be used without such qualification with respect to a ready-to-cook pack of fresh or frozen cut-up young chickens, or a half of a
young chicken, and the name “duckling” may be used without such qualification with respect to a ready-to-cook pack of fresh or frozen young ducks. The class name may be appropriately modified by changing the word form, such as using the term “roasting chicken”, rather than “roaster.” The appropriate names for cut-up parts are set forth in § 381.170(b). When naming parts cut from young poultry, the identity of both the kind of poultry and the name of the part shall be included in the product name. The product name for parts or portions cut from mature poultry shall include, along with the part or portion name, the class name or the qualifying term “mature.” The name of the product for cooked or heat processed poultry products shall include the kind name of the poultry from which the product was prepared but need not include the class name or the qualifying term “mature.”
(c) Poultry products containing light and dark chicken or turkey meat in quantities other than the natural proportions, as indicated in Table 1 in this paragraph, must have a qualifying statement in conjunction with the name of the product indicating, as shown in Table 1, the types of meat actually used, except that when the product contains less than 10 percent cooked deboned poultry meat or is processed in such a manner that the character of the light and dark meat is not distinguishable, the qualifying statement will not be required, unless the product bears a label referring to the light or dark meat content. In the latter case, the qualifying statement is required if the light and dark meat are not present in natural proportions. The qualifying statement must be in type at least one-half the size and of equal boldness as the name of the product; e.g., Boned Turkey (Dark Meat).

(d) Boneless poultry products shall be labeled in a manner that accurately describes their actual form and composition. The product name shall specify the form of the product (e.g., emulsified, finely chopped, etc.), and the kind name of the poultry, and if the product does not consist of natural proportions of skin and fat, as they occur in the whole carcass, shall also include terminology that describes the actual composition. If the product is cooked, it shall be so labeled. For the purpose of this paragraph, natural proportions of skin, as found on a whole chicken or turkey carcass, will be considered to be as follows:
Percent
Raw
Cooked
Chicken
20
25
Turkey
15
20
Boneless poultry product shall not have a bone solids content of more than 1 percent, calculated on a weight basis.
(e) On the label of any “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry) “ described in § 381.173, the name of such product shall be followed immediately by the phrase: “with excess skin” unless such product is made from poultry product that does not include skin in excess of the natural proportion of skin present on the whole carcass, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. Appropriate terminology on the label shall indicate if heat treatment has been used in the preparation of the product. The labeling information described in this paragraph shall be identified on the label before the product leaves the establishment at which it is manufactured.
(f) The labels of sausages encased in natural casings made from meat or poultry viscera shall identify the type of meat or poultry from which the casings were derived, if the casings are from a different type of meat or poultry than the encased meat or poultry. The identity of the casing, if required, may be placed on the principal display panel or in the ingredient statement.
Establishments producing, manufacturing, or using natural sausage casings are to maintain records documenting the meat or poultry source in accordance with subpart Q of this part.
(g) The labels of sausages encased in regenerated collagen casings shall disclose this fact on the product label. The fact that the sausage is encased in collagen may be placed on the principal display panel or in the ingredient statement.
(h) The product name for a raw poultry product that contains added solution and does not meet a standard of identity in this part must contain a descriptive designation that includes:
(1) The percentage of added solution (total weight of the solution ingredients divided by the weight of the raw poultry without solution or any other added ingredients multiplied by 100). The percentage of added solution must appear as a number (such as, 15, 20, 30) and the percent symbol (%). The percentage of added solution may be declared by the words “containing” or “contains” (such as, “contains 15% added solution of water and salt,” or “containing 15% added solution of water and teriyaki sauce”).
(2) The common or usual name of all individual ingredients or multi-ingredient components in the solution listed in descending order of predominance by weight.
(3) When the descriptive designation includes all ingredients in the solution, a separate ingredients statement is not required on the label. When the descriptive designation includes multi-ingredient components and the ingredients of the component are not declared in the product name, all ingredients in the product must be declared in a separate ingredients statement on the label as required in § 381.118.
(4) The product name and the descriptive designation must be printed in a single easy-to-read type style and color and must appear on a single-color contrasting background. The print may appear in upper and lower case letters, with the lower case letters not smaller than one-third (
1/3
) the size of the largest letter.
(5) The word “enhanced” cannot be used in the product name.
[37 FR 9706, May 16, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 55983, Nov. 3, 1995; 66 FR 40845, Aug. 6, 2001; 79 FR 79061, Dec. 31, 2014]
§ 381.118
Ingredients statement.
(a)(1) The label shall show a statement of the ingredients in the poultry product if the product is fabricated from two or more ingredients. Such ingredients shall be listed by their common or usual names in the order of their descending proportions, except as prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2)(i) Product ingredients which are present in individual amounts of 2 percent or less by weight may be listed in the ingredients statement in other than descending order of predominance:
Provided,
That such ingredients are listed by their common or usual names at the end of the ingredients statement and preceded by a quantifying statement, such as “Contains __________ percent or less of __________ ,” or “Less than __________ percent of __________ .” The percentage of the ingredient(s) shall be filled in with a threshold level of 2 percent, 1.5 percent, 1.0 percent, or 0.5 percent, as appropriate. No ingredient to which the quantifying statement applies may be present in an amount greater than the stated threshold. Such a quantifying statement may also be utilized when an ingredients statement contains a listing of ingredients by individual components. Each component listing may utilize the required quantifying statement at the end of each component ingredients listing.
(ii) Such ingredients may be adjusted in the product formulation without a change being made in the ingredients statement on the labeling, provided that the adjusted amount complies with subpart P of this part and § 424.21(c) of subchapter E, and does not exceed the amount shown in the quantifying statement. Any such adjustments to the formulation shall be provided to the inspector-in-charge.
(b) For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “chicken meat,” unless modified by an appropriate adjective, is construed to mean deboned white and dark meat; whereas the term “chicken” may
include other edible parts such as skin and fat not in excess of their natural proportions, in addition to the chicken meat. If the term “chicken meat” is listed and the product also contains skin, giblets, or fat, it is necessary to list each such ingredient. Similar principles shall be followed in listing ingredients of poultry products processed from other kinds of poultry.
(c) The terms spice, natural flavor, natural flavoring, flavor or flavoring may be used in the following manner:
(1) The term “spice” means any aromatic vegetable substance in the whole, broken, or ground form, with the exceptions of onions, garlic and celery, whose primary function in food is seasoning rather than nutritional and from which no portion of any volatile oil or other flavoring principle has been removed. Spices include the spices listed in 21 CFR 182.10, and 184.
(2) The term “natural flavor,” “natural flavoring,” “flavor” or “flavoring” means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or any other edible portions of a plant, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose primary function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors include the natural essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in 21 CFR 182.10, 182.20, 182.40, 182.50 and 184, and the substances listed in 21 CFR 172.510. The term natural flavor, natural flavoring, flavor or flavoring may also be used to designate spices, powdered onion, powdered garlic, and powdered celery.
(i) Natural flavor, natural flavoring, flavor or flavoring as described in paragraph (c)(1) and (2) of this section, which are also colors shall be designated as “natural flavor and coloring,” “natural flavoring and coloring,” “flavor and coloring” or “flavoring and coloring” unless designated by their common or usual name.
(ii) Any ingredient not designated in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section whose function is flavoring, either in whole or in part, must be designated by its common or usual name. Those ingredients which are of livestock or poultry origin must be designated by names that include the species and livestock and poultry tissues from which the ingredients are derived.
(d) On containers of frozen dinners, entrees, and pizzas, and similarly packaged products in cartons, the ingredient statement may be placed on the front riser panel:
Provided,
That the words “see ingredients,” followed immediately by an arrow pointing to the front riser panel, are placed on the principal display panel immediately above the location of such statement, without intervening printing or designs.
(e) The ingredients statement may be placed on the information panel, except as otherwise permitted in this subchapter.
(f) Establishments may interchange the identity of two kinds of poultry (e.g., chicken and turkey, chicken meat and turkey meat) used in a product formulation without changing the product's ingredient statement or product name under the following conditions:
(1)(i) The two kinds of poultry used must comprise at least 70 percent by weight of the poultry and the poultry ingredients [e.g. giblets, skin or fat in excess of natural proportions, or mechanically separated (kind)] used; and,
(ii) Neither of the two kinds of poultry used can be less than 30 percent by weight of the total poultry and poultry ingredients used;
(2) The word “and” in lieu of a comma must be shown between the declaration of the two kinds of poultry in the ingredients statement and in the product name.

§ 381.119
Declaration of artificial flavoring or coloring.
(a) When an artificial smoke flavoring or a smoke flavoring is added as an ingredient in the formula of any poultry product, there shall appear on
the label, in prominent letters and contiguous to the name of the product, a statement such as “Artificial Smoke Flavoring Added” or “Smoke Flavoring Added,” as applicable, and the ingredient statement shall identify any artificial smoke flavoring or smoke flavoring added as an ingredient in the formula of the poultry product.
(b) Any poultry product which bears or contains any artificial flavoring other than an artificial smoke flavoring or a smoke flavoring, or bears or contains any artificial coloring shall bear a statement stating that fact on the immediate container or, if there is none, on the product.
§ 381.120
Antioxidants; chemical preservatives; and other additives.
When an antioxidant is added to a poultry product, there shall appear on the label in prominent letters and contiguous to the name of the product, a statement showing the name of the antioxidant and the purpose for which it is added, such as “BHA added to help protect the flavor.” Immediate containers of poultry products packed in, bearing, or containing any chemical preservative shall bear a label stating that fact and naming the additive and the purpose of its use. Immediate containers of poultry products packed in, bearing or containing any other chemical additive shall bear a label naming the additive and the purpose of its use when required by the Administrator in specific cases. When approved proteolytic enzymes as permitted in a regulation permitting that use in this subchapter or 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter E, or in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B of this subchapter are used in mature poultry muscle tissue, there shall appear on the label, in a prominent manner, contiguous to the product name, the statement “Tenderized with [approved enzyme],” to indicate the use of such enzymes. Any other approved substance which may be used in the solution shall also be included in the statement. When approved inorganic chlorides as permitted in a regulation permitting that use in this subchapter or 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter E, or in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B of this subchapter are used in mature poultry muscle tissue, there shall appear on the label, in a prominent manner, contiguous to the product name, the statement, “Tenderized with (name of approved inorganic chloride(s))” to indicate the use of such inorganic chlorides. Any other approved substance which may be used in the solution shall also be included in the statement.
[37 FR 9706, May 16, 1972, as amended at 45 FR 58820, Sept. 5, 1980; 49 FR 18999, May 4, 1984; 64 FR 72175, Dec. 23, 1999]
§ 381.121
Quantity of contents.
(a) The label shall bear a statement of the quantity of contents in terms of weight or measures as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. However, the Administrator may approve the use of labels for certain types of consumer packages which do not bear a statement of the net weight that would otherwise be required under this subparagraph:
Provided,
That the shipping container bears a statement “Net weight to be marked on consumer packages prior to display and sale”:
And provided further,
That the total net weight of the contents of the shipping container is marked on such container:
And provided further,
That the shipping container bears a statement “Tare weight of consumer package” and in close proximity thereto, the actual tare weight (weight of packaging material), weighed to the nearest one-eighth ounce or less, of the individual consumer package in the shipping container. The above-specified statements may be added to approved shipping container labels upon approval by the inspector in charge.
(b) When a poultry product and a nonpoultry product are separately wrapped and are placed in a single immediate container bearing the same name of both products, the net weight on such immediate container may be the total net weight of the products, or such immediate container may show the net weights of the poultry product and the nonpoultry product separately. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph, the label on consumer size retail packages of stuffed poultry and other stuffed poultry products must show the total net weight of
the poultry product, and in close proximity thereto, a statement specifying the minimum weight of the poultry in the product.
(c)(1) The statement of net quantity of contents shall appear (except as otherwise permitted under this paragraph (c)), on the principal display panel of all containers to be sold at retail intact, in conspicuous and easily legible boldface print or type, in distinct contrast to other matter on the container, and shall be declared in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c). An unused tare weight, as defined in section 381.121b of this subchapter, may be printed adjacent to the statement of net quantity of contents when the product is packaged totally with impervious packaging material and is packed with a usable medium.
(2) The statement shall be placed on the principal display panel within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the panel, in lines generally parallel to the base:
Provided,
That on packages having a principal display panel of 5 square inches or less, the requirement for placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel shall not apply when the statement meets the other requirements of this paragraph. The declaration may appear in more than one line.
(3) The statement shall be in letters and numerals in type size established in relationship to the area of the principal display panel of the package and shall be uniform for all packages of substantially the same size by complying with the following type specifications:
(i) Not less than one-sixteenth inch in height on containers, the principal display panel of which has an area of 5 square inches or less;
(ii) Not less than one-eighth inch in height on containers, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 5 but not more than 25 square inches;
(iii) Not less than three-sixteenth inch in height on containers, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 25 but not more than 100 square inches;
(iv) Not less than one-quarter inch in height on containers, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 100 but not more than 400 square inches;
(v) Not less than one-half inch in height on containers, the principal display panel of which has an area of more than 400 square inches.
(vi) The ratio of height to width of letters and numerals shall not exceed a differential of 3 units to 1 unit (no more than 3 times as high as it is wide). This height standard pertains to upper case or capital letters. When upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower case letter “o” or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum standards. When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one-half the height standards.
(4) The statement shall appear as a distinct item on the principal display panel and shall be separated, from other label information appearing to the left or right of the statement, by a space at least equal in width to twice the width of the letter “N” of the style of type used in the quantity of contents statement and shall be separated from other label information appearing above or below the statement by a space at least equal in height to the height of the lettering used in the statement.
(5) The terms “net weight” or “net wt.” shall be used when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of weight, and the term “net contents” or “contents” when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of fluid measure. Except as provided in § 381.128, the statement shall be expressed in terms of avoirdupois weight or liquid measure. Where no general consumer usage to the contrary exists, the statement shall be in terms of liquid measure, if the product is liquid, or in terms of weight if the product is solid, semi-solid, viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid. On packages containing less than 1 pound or 1 pint, the statement shall be expressed in ounces or fractions of a pint, respectively. On packages containing 1 pound or 1 pint or more, and less than 4 pounds or 1 gallon, the statement shall be expressed in ounces or in pounds with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fraction of the pound, or in the case of liquid measure, in the largest
whole units with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fraction of the pint or quart. For example, a declaration of three-fourths pound avoirdupois weight shall be expressed as “Net Wt. 12 oz.”; a declaration of 1
1/2
pounds avoirdupois weight shall be expressed as “Net Wt. 24 oz.,” “Net Wt. 1 lb. 8 oz.,” “Net Wt. 1
1/2
lb.,” or “Net Wt. 1.5 lbs.”. However, on random weight packages the statement shall be expressed in terms of pounds and decimal fractions of the pound, for packages over 1 pound, and for packages which do not exceed 1 pound the statement may be in decimal fractions of the pound in lieu of ounces. The numbers may be written in provided the unit designation is printed. Paragraphs (c)(8) and (9) of this section permit certain exceptions to this paragraph (c)(5) for multi-unit packages, and random weight consumer size and small packages (less than
1/2
ounce), respectively.
(6) The statement as it is shown on a label shall not be false or misleading and shall express an accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the container. Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the course of good distribution practices or by unavoidable deviations in good manufacturing practices will be recognized. Variations from stated quantity of contents shall be as provided in section 381.121b of this subchapter. The statement shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count such as “jumbo quart,” “full gallon,” “giant quart,” “when packed,” “minimum,” or words of similar importance except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(7) Labels for containers which bear any representation as to the number of servings contained therein shall bear, contiguous to such representation, and in the same size type as is used for such representation, a statement of the net quantity of each such serving.
(8) On a multiunit retail package, a statement of the quantity of contents shall appear on the outside of the package and shall include the number of individual units, the quantity of each individual unit, and, in parentheses, the total quantity of contents of the multiunit package in terms of avoirdupois or fluid ounces. “A multiunit retail package” is a package containing two or more individually packaged units of the identical commodity and in the same quantity, with the individual packages intended to be sold as part of the multiunit retail package but capable of being sold individually. Open multiunit retail packages that do not obscure the number of units and the labeling thereon are not subject to this paragraph (c) (8) if the labeling of each individual unit complies with the requirements of this paragraph (c).
(9) The following exemptions from the requirements contained in this section are hereby established:
(i) Individually wrapped, random weight consumer size packages of poultry products (as specified in paragraph (c)(10) of this section) and poultry products that are subject to shrinkage through moisture loss during good distribution practices and are designated as gray area type of products as defined in NBS handbook 133, section 3.18.2, need not bear a net weight statement when shipped from an official establishment provided a net weight shipping statement which meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(6) of this section is applied to the shipping container prior to shipping it from the official establishment. Net weight statements so applied to the shipping container are exempt from the type size and placement requirements of this paragraph if an accurate statement of net weight is shown conspicuously on the principal display panel of the shipping container. The net weight also shall be applied directly to random weight consumer size packages prior to retail display and sale. The net weight statement of random weight consumer size packages for retail sale shall be exempt from the type size and placement requirements of this paragraph if an accurate statement of net weight is shown conspicuously on the principal display panel of the package.
(ii) Individually wrapped and labeled packages of less than
1/2
ounce net weight and random weight consumer size packages shall be exempt from the requirements of this paragraph if they are in a shipping container and the statement of net quantity of contents
on the shipping container meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(6) of this section;
(iii) Individually wrapped and labeled packages of less than
1/2
ounce net weight bearing labels declaring net weight, price per pound, and total price, shall be exempt from the type size and placement requirements of this paragraph if an accurate statement of net weight is shown conspicuously on the principal display panel of the package.
(10) As used in this section a “random weight consumer size package” is one of a lot, shipment or delivery of packages of the same product, with varying weights and with no fixed weight pattern.

(1) (i) Safe handling instructions shall accompany the poultry products, specified in this paragraph (b), destined for household consumers, hotels, restaurants, or similar institutions and shall appear on the label. The information shall be in lettering no smaller than one-sixteenth of an inch in size and shall be prominently placed with such conspicuousness (as compared with other words, statements, designs or devices in the labeling) as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.
(ii) The safe handling information shall be presented on the label under the heading “Safe Handling Instructions” which shall be set in type size larger than the print size of the rationale statement and handling statements as discussed in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.

§ 381.127
Wording on labels of shipping containers.
(a) Each label for use on a shipping container for inspected and passed poultry products shall bear, in distinctly legible form, the following information:
(1) The official inspection legend.
(2) The official establishment number of the official establishment in which the poultry product was inspected, either within the official inspection mark, or elsewhere on the container clearly visible and in proximity to the official inspection mark.
§ 381.128
Labels in foreign languages.
Any label to be affixed to a container of any dressed poultry or other poultry product for foreign commerce may be printed in a foreign language. However, the official inspection legend and establishment number shall appear on the label in English, but in addition, may be literally translated into such foreign language. Each such label shall be subject to the applicable provisions of §§ 381.115 to 381.141, inclusive. Deviations from the form of labeling required under the regulations may be approved by the Administrator in specific cases and such modified labeling may be used for poultry products to be exported:
Provided,
(a) That the proposed labeling accords to the specifications of the foreign purchaser, (b) that it is not in conflict with the Act or the laws of the country to which it is intended for export, and (c) that the outside of the shipping container is labeled to show that it is intended for export; but if such product is sold or offered for sale in domestic commerce, all the requirements of the regulations shall apply.
§ 381.129
False or misleading labeling or containers.
(a) No poultry product subject to the Act shall have any false or misleading labeling or any container that is so made, formed, or filled as to be misleading. However, established trade names and other labeling and containers which are not false or misleading and which are approved by the Administrator in the regulations or in specific cases are permitted.
(b) No statement, word, picture, design, or device which is false or misleading in any particular or conveys any false impression or gives any false indication of origin, identity, or quality, shall appear on any label. For example:
(1) Official grade designations such as the letter grades A, B, and C may be used in labeling individual carcasses of poultry or containers of poultry products only if such articles have been graded by a licensed grader of the Federal or Federal-State poultry grading service and found to qualify for the indicated grade.
(2) Statements, words, pictures, designs, or devices having geographical significance with reference to a particular locality must be made in accordance with § 317.8(b)(1) of this chapter.
(3) “Fresh frozen”, “quick frozen”, “frozen fresh”, and terms of similar import apply only to ready-to-cook poultry processed in accordance with § 381.66(f)(1). Ready-to-cook poultry handled in any other manner and dressed poultry may be labeled “frozen” only if it is frozen in accordance with § 381.66(f)(2) under Department supervision and is in fact in a frozen state. “Individually quick frozen
(Kind)” and terms of similar import are applicable only to poultry products that are frozen as stated on the label and whose component parts can be easily separated at time of packing.
(4) Poultry products labeled with a term quoted in any paragraph of § 381.170(b) shall comply with the specifications in the applicable paragraph. However, parts of poultry may be cut in any manner the processor desires as long as the labeling appropriately reflects the contents of the container of such poultry.
(5) The terms “All,” “Pure,” “100%,” and terms of similar connotation shall not be used on labels for products to identify ingredient content, unless the product is prepared solely from a single ingredient.
(6)(i) A raw poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been below 26 °F may not bear a label declaration of “fresh.” A raw poultry product bearing a label declaration of “fresh” but whose internal temperature has ever been below 26 °F is mislabeled. The temperature of individual packages of raw poultry product within an official establishment may deviate below the 26 °F standard by 1 degree (i.e., have a temperature of 25 °F) and still be labeled “fresh.” The temperature of individual packages of raw poultry product outside an official establishment may deviate below the 26 °F standard by 2 degrees (i.e., have a temperature of 24 °F) and still be labeled “fresh.” The average temperature of poultry product lots of each specific product type must be 26 °F. Product described in this paragraph is not subject to the freezing procedures required in § 381.66(f)(2) of this subchapter.
(ii) Raw poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been at or below 0°F must be labeled with the descriptive term “frozen,” except when such labeling duplicates or conflicts with the labeling requirements in § 381.125 of this subchapter. The word “previously” may be placed next to the term “frozen” on an optional basis. The descriptive term must be prominently displayed on the principal display panel of the label. If additional labeling containing the descriptive term is affixed to the label, it must be prominently affixed to the label. The additional labeling must be so conspicuous (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices in the labeling) that it is likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use. Product described in this paragraph is subject to the freezing procedures required in § 381.66(f)(2) of this subchapter.
(iii) Raw poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been below 26 °F, but is above 0 °F, is not required to bear any specific descriptive term. Raw poultry product whose internal temperature has ever been below 26 °F, but is above 0 °F, may bear labeling with an optional, descriptive term, provided the optional, descriptive term does not cause the raw poultry product to become misbranded. If used, an optional, descriptive term must be prominently displayed on the principal display panel of the label. If additional labeling containing the optional, descriptive term is affixed to the label, it must be prominently affixed on the label. The additional labeling must be so conspicuous (as compared with other words, statements, designs, or devices in the labeling) that it is likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and use.
(iv)
Handling and relabeling of products.
(A) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(C) of this section, when any inspected and passed product has become misbranded under this subpart after it has been transported from an official establishment, such product may be transported in commerce to an official establishment after oral permission is obtained from the Area Supervisor of the area in which that official establishment is located. The transportation of the product may be to the official establishment from which it had been transported or to another official establishment designated by the person desiring to handle the product. The transportation shall be authorized only for the purpose of the relabeling of the product. The Area Supervisor shall record the authorization and other information necessary to identify the product and shall provide a copy of the record to the inspector at
the establishment receiving the product. The shipper shall be furnished a copy of the authorization record upon request.
(B) Upon the arrival of the shipment at the official establishment, a careful inspection shall be made of the product by the inspector, and if it is found that the product is not adulterated, it may be received into the establishment; but if the product is found to be adulterated, it shall at once be condemned and disposed of in accordance with § 381.95 of this subchapter. Wholesome product will be relabeled in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) (i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate.
(C) When any inspected and passed product has become misbranded under this subpart after it has been transported from an official establishment, the owner may transport the product in commerce to a retail entity for relabeling in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) (i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate, or to other end users, such as hotels, restaurants or similar institutions; or, relabel the product in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) (i) or (ii) of this section, as appropriate if the product is already at a retail entity. A hotel, restaurant or similar institution is not required to relabel product misbranded under this subpart;
Provided,
That the product is prepared in meals or as entrees only for sale or service directly to individual consumers at such institutions, and that the mark of inspection is removed or obliterated. Oral permission shall be obtained from the Area Officer-in-Charge of the Compliance Program for the area in which the product is located prior to such transportation or relabeling. The Area Officer-in-Charge shall record the authorization and other information necessary to identify the product, and shall furnish a copy of the authorization record upon request. Before being offered for sale at a retail entity, such product shall be relabeled.
(v) Ready-to-cook chicken may bear the claim “air chilled” or “air chilling” on its label only if the product was chilled under a process that meets the definition of air chilling in § 381.66(e).
(c) A calendar date may be shown on labeling when declared in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph:
(1) The calendar date shall express the month of the year and the day of the month for all products and also the year in the case of products hermetically sealed in metal or glass containers, dried or frozen products, or any other products that the Administrator finds should be labeled with the year because the distribution and marketing practices with respect to such products may cause a label without a year identification to be misleading.
(2) Immediately adjacent to the calendar date will be a phrase explaining the meaning of such date in terms of “packing” date, “sell by” date, or “use before” date, with or without a further qualifying phrase, e.g., “For Maximum Freshness” or “For Best Quality.”
(d) When sodium alginate, calcium carbonate, lactic acid, and calcium lactate are used together in a dry binding matrix in ground or formed poultry products, as permitted in § 424.21(c) of subchapter E, there shall appear on the label contiguous to the product name a statement to indicate the use of sodium alginate, calcium carbonate, lactic acid, and calcium lactate.
(e) When transglutaminase enzyme is used to bind pieces of poultry to form a cut of poultry, or to reform a piece of poultry from a multiple cuts of poultry, there shall appear on the label, as part of the product name, a statement that indicates that the product has been “formed” or “reformed,” in addition to other preparation steps, e.g., “Formed Turkey Thigh Roast” or “Reformed and Shaped Chicken Breast.”
(f) A country of origin statement on the label of any poultry product “covered commodity” as defined in 7 CFR part 65, subpart A, that is to be sold by a “retailer,” as defined in 7 CFR 65.240, must comply with the requirements in 7 CFR 65.300 and 65.400.

§ 381.130
False or misleading labeling or containers; orders to withhold from use.
If the Administrator has reason to believe that any marking or other labeling or the size or form of any container in use or proposed for use with respect to any article subject to the Act is false or misleading in any particular, he may direct that the use of the article be withheld unless it is modified in such manner as the Administrator may prescribe so that it will not be false or misleading. If the person using or proposing to use the labeling or container does not accept the determination of the Administrator, he may request a hearing, but the use of the labeling or container shall, if the Administrator so directs, be withheld pending hearing and final determination by the Secretary in accordance with applicable rules of practice. Any such determination with respect to the matter by the Secretary shall be conclusive unless, within 30 days after the receipt of notice of such final determination, the person adversely affected thereby appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which he has his principal place of business, or to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The provisions of section 204 of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, as amended, shall be applicable to appeals taken under this section.
§ 381.131
Preparation of labeling or other devices bearing official inspection marks without advance approval prohibited; exceptions.
(a) Except for the purposes of preparing and submitting a sample or samples of the same to the Administrator for approval, no brand manufacturer, printer, or other person shall cast, print, lithograph, or otherwise make any marking device containing any official mark or simulation thereof, or any label bearing any such mark or simulation, without the written authority therefor of the Administrator. However, when any such sample label, or other marking device, is approved by the Administrator, additional supplies of the approved label, or marking device, may be made for use in accordance with the regulations in this subchapter, without further approval by the Administrator. The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to marking devices containing the official inspection legend shown in Figure 5 of § 381.102.
(b) No brand manufacturer or other person shall cast or otherwise make, without an official certificate issued in quadruplicate by a Program employee, a marking device containing the official inspection legend shown in Figure 5 of § 381.102 or any simulation of that legend.
(1) The certificate is a Food Safety and Inspection Service form for signature by a Program employee and the official establishment ordering the marking device, bearing a certificate serial number and a letterhead and the seal of the United States Department of Agriculture. The certificate authorizes the making of only the devices of the type and quantity listed on the certificate.
(2) After signing the certificate, the Program employee and the establishment shall each keep a copy, and the remaining two copies shall be given to the marking device manufacturer.
(3) The manufacturer of the marking devices shall engrave or otherwise mark each marking device with a permanent identifying serial number unique to it. The manufacturer shall list on each of the two copies of the certificate given to the manufacturer the number of each marking device authorized by the certificate. The manufacturer shall retain one copy of the certificate for the manufacturer's records and return the remaining copy with the marking devices to the Program employee whose name and address are given on the certificate as the recipient.
(4) In order that all such marking devices bear identifying numbers, within one year after June 24, 1985, an establishment shall either replace each such marking device that does not bear an identifying number, or, under the direction of the inspector-in-charge, mark such marking device with a permanent identifying number.

Any unauthorized use or disposition of approved labeling or devices bearing official inspection marks is prohibited and may result in cancellation of the approval.
(b) Labeling and containers bearing any official inspection marks, with or without the official establishment number, may be transported from one official establishment to any other official establishment, only if such shipments are made with the prior authorization of the inspector in charge at point of origin, who will notify the inspector in charge at destination concerning the date of shipment, quantity, and type of labeling material involved.

Relabeling poultry products.
When it is claimed by the operator of an official establishment that some of its labeled poultry product, which has been transported to a location other than an official establishment, is in need of relabeling because the labeling has become mutilated or damaged, or for some other reason needs relabeling, the requests for relabeling the poultry product shall be sent to the Administrator and accompanied with a statement of the reasons therefor and the
quantity of labeling required. Labeling material intended for relabeling inspected and passed product shall not be transported from an official establishment until permission has been received from the Administrator. The relabeling of inspected and passed product with official labels shall be done under the supervision of an inspector pursuant to the regulations in part 362 of this chapter. The establishment shall reimburse the Inspection Service for any cost involved in supervising the relabeling of such product as provided in said regulations.

(b) Packaging materials entering the official establishment must be accompanied or covered by a guaranty, or statement of assurance, from the packaging supplier under whose brand name and firm name the material is marketed to the official establishment. The guaranty shall state that the material's intended use complies with the FFDCA and all applicable food additive regulations. The guaranty must identify the material, e.g., by the distinguishing brand name or code designation appearing on the packaging material shipping container; must specify the applicable conditions of use, including temperature limits and other pertinent limits specified under the FFDCA and food additive regulations; and must be signed by an authorized official of the supplying firm. The guaranty may be limited to a specific shipment of an article, in which case it may be part of or attached to the invoice covering such shipment, or it may be general and continuing, in which case, in its application to any article or other shipment of an article, it shall be considered to have been given at the date such article was shipped by the person who gives the guaranty. Guaranties consistent with the Food and Drug Administration's regulations regarding such guaranties (21 CFR 7.12 and 7.13) will be acceptable. The management of the establishment must maintain a file containing guaranties for all food contact packaging materials in the establishment. The file shall be made available to Program inspectors or other Department officials upon request. While in the official establishment, the identity of all packaging materials must be traceable to the applicable guaranty.
(c) The guaranty by the packaging supplier will be accepted by Program inspectors to establish that the use of material complies with the FFDCA and all applicable food additive regulations.
(d) The Department will monitor the use of packaging materials in official establishments to assure that the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are met, and may question the basis for any guaranty described under paragraph (b) of this section. Official establishments and packaging suppliers providing written guaranties to those official establishments will be permitted an opportunity to provide information to designated Department officials as needed to verify the basis for any such guaranty. The required information will include, but is not limited to, manufacturing firm's name, trade name or code designation for the material, complete chemical composition, and use. Selection of a material for review does not in itself affect a material's acceptability. Materials may continue to be used during the review period. However, if information requested from the supplier is not provided within the time indicated in the request—a minimum of 30 days—any applicable guaranty shall cease to be effective and approval to continue using the specified packaging material in official establishments may be denied. The Administrator may extend this time where reasonable grounds for extension are shown, as, for example, where data must be obtained from suppliers.
(e) The Administrator may disapprove for use in official establishments packaging materials whose use
cannot be confirmed as complying with the FFDCA and applicable food additive regulations. Before approval to use a packaging material is finally denied by the Administrator, the affected official establishment and the supplier of the material shall be given notice and the opportunity to present their views to the Administrator. If the official establishment and the supplier do not accept the Administrator's determination, a hearing in accordance with applicable rules of practice will be held to resolve such dispute. Approval to use the materials pending the outcome of the presentation of views or hearing shall be denied if the Administrator determines that such use may present an imminent hazard to public health.
(f) Periodically, the Administrator will issue to inspectors a listing, by distinguishing brand name or code designation, of packaging materials that have been reviewed and that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. Listed materials will not be permitted for use in official establishments. If a subsequent review of any material indicates that it meets the requirements of paragraph (a), the material will be deleted from the listing.
(g) Nothing in this section shall affect the authority of Program inspectors to refuse a specific material if he/she determines the material may render products adulterated or injurious to health.

# Subpart O—Entry of Articles Into Official Establishments; Processing Inspection and Other Reinspections; Processing Requirements
§ 381.145
Poultry products and other articles entering or at official establishments; examination and other requirements.
(a) No poultry product (including poultry broth for use in any poultry product in any official establishment) may be brought into any official establishment unless it has been processed in the United States only in an official establishment or imported from a foreign country eligible to export such poultry and poultry products to the United States under § 381.196(b), and inspected and passed, in accordance with the regulations; and unless the container of such product is marked so as to identify the product as so inspected and passed, in accordance with § 381.115 or § 381.205, except that poultry products inspected and passed and identified as such under the laws of an “at least equal” State or territory listed in § 381.187 may be brought into any official establishment solely for storage and distribution therefrom without repackaging, relabeling, or processing in such establishment. No carcass, part thereof, meat or meat food product of cattle, sheep, swine, goats, or equines may be brought into an official establishment unless it has been prepared in the United States only in an official meat packing establishment, or imported, and inspected and passed, in accordance with the Federal Meat Inspection Act, and the regulations under such Act (Subchapter A of this chapter) and is properly marked as so inspected and passed; or has been inspected and passed and is identified as such in accordance with the requirements of the law and regulations of a State not designated in § 331.2 of this chapter; or is present in the official establishment by reason of an exemption allowed in the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the regulations under such Act (Subchapter A of this chapter) or the law and regulations of a State not so designated. However, such exempted articles may enter only under conditions approved by the Administrator in specific cases, including but not limited to, complete separation of inspected poultry products and processing and other operations with respect thereto from the exempted articles and operations with respect thereto, complete cleanup of facilities and equipment between processing of inspected poultry products and the exempted articles and no commingling of inspected and exempted articles in receiving, holding or storage areas.
(b) All poultry products and all carcasses, parts thereof, meat and meat food products of cattle, sheep, swine, goats, or equines which enter any official establishment shall be identified
by the operator of the official establishment at the time of receipt at the official establishment. All poultry products, and all carcasses, parts thereof, meat and meat food products of such animals, which are processed or otherwise handled at any official establishment shall be subject to examination by an inspector at the official establishment in such manner and at such times as may be deemed necessary by the inspector in charge to assure compliance with the regulations. Upon such examination, if any such article or portion thereof is found to be adulterated, such article or portion shall, in the case of poultry products, be condemned and disposed of as prescribed in § 381.95, unless by reprocessing they may be made not adulterated, and shall, in the case of such other articles be disposed of according to applicable law.
Such examination may be accomplished through use of statistically sound sampling plans that assure a high level of confidence. The inspector in charge shall designate the type of plan and the program employee shall select the specific plan to be used in accordance with instructions issued by the Administrator.
1

Further information concerning sampling plans which have been adopted for specific products may be obtained from the Circuit Supervisor. These sampling plans are developed for individual products by the Washington staff and will be distributed for field use as they are developed. The type of plan applicable depends on factors such as whether the product is in containers, stage of preparation, and procedures followed by the establishment operator. The specific plan applicable depends on the kind of product involved.
(c)
Applying for Total Plant Quality Control.
Any owner or operator of an official establishment preparing poultry product who has a total plant quality control system or plan for controlling such products, after ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection, through all stages of preparation, may request the Administrator to evaluate it to determine whether or not that system is adequate to result in product being in compliance with the requirements of the Act and therefore qualify as a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Total Plant Quality Control Establishment. Such a request shall, as a minimum, include:
(1) A letter to the Administrator from the establishment owner or operator stating the company's basis and purpose for seeking an approved quality control system and willingness to adhere to the requirements of the system as approved by the Department; that all the establishment's data, analyses, and information generated by its quality control system will be maintained to enable the Department to monitor compliance and available to Department personnel; that plant quality control personnel will have authority to halt production or shipping of product in cases where the submitted quality control systems require it; and that the owner or operator (or his/her designee) will be available for consultation at any time Department personnel consider it necessary.
(2) In the case of an establishment having one or more full-time persons whose primary duties are related to the quality control system, an organizational chart showing that such people ultimately report to an establishment official whose quality control responsibilities are independent of or not predominantly production responsibilities. In the case of a small establishment which does not have full-time quality control personnel, information indicating the nature of the duties and responsibilities of the person who will also be responsible for the quality control system.
(3) A list identifying those subparts and sections of the poultry products inspection regulations which are applicable to the operations of the establishment applying for approval of a quality control system. This list shall also identify which part of the system will serve to maintain compliance with the applicable regulations.
(4) Detailed information concerning the manner in which the system will function. Such information should include, but not necessarily be limited to, questions of raw material control, the critical check or control points, the nature and frequency of tests to be made, the nature of charts and other records that will be used, the length of time such charts and records will be
maintained in the custody of the official establishment, the nature of deficiencies the quality control system is designed to identify and control, the parameters of limits which will be used and the points at which corrective action will occur, and the nature of such corrective action—ranging from the least to most severe:
Provided,
That subsequent to approval of the total plant quality control system by the Administrator, the official establishment may produce a new product for test marketing provided labeling for the product has been approved by the Administrator, the inspector in charge has determined that the procedures for preparing the product will assure that all Federal requirements are met, and the production for test marketing does not exceed 6 months. Such new product shall not be produced at that establishment after the 6-month period unless approval of the quality control system for that product has been received from the Administrator.
(d)-(e) [Reserved]

(1) The approval of a total plant quality control system may be terminated at any time by the owner or operator of the official establishment upon written notice to the Administrator.
(2) The approval of a total plant quality control system or a quality control system for irradiation facilities may be terminated upon the establishment's receipt of a written notice from the Administrator under the following conditions:
(i) If adulterated or misbranded poultry product is found by the Adminstrator to have been prepared for or distributed in commerce by the subject establishment. In such case, opportunity will be provided to the establishment owner or operator to present views to the Administrator within 30 days of the date of terminating the approval. In those instances where there is a conflict of facts, a hearing, under applicable Rules of Practice, will be afforded to the establishment owner or operator, if requested, to resolve the conflict, The Administrator's termination of approval shall remain in effect pending the final determination of the proceeding.
(ii) If the establishment fails to comply with the quality control system to which it has agreed after being notified by letter from the Administrator or his designee. Prior to such termination, opportunity will be provided to the establishment owner or operator to present views to the Administrator within 30 days of the date of the letter. In those instances where there is a conflict of facts, a hearing, under applicable Rules of Practice, will be afforded to the establishment owner or operator, if requested, to resolve the conflict. The Administrator's termination of quality control approval shall remain in effect pending the final determination of the proceeding.
(3) If approval of the total establishment quality control system has been terminated in accordance with the provisions of this section, an application and request for approval of the same or modified total establishment quality control system will not be evaluated by the Administrator for at least 6 months from the termination date.
(4) If approval of a quality control system for irradiation facilities, as
specified in section 381.149 of this subpart, has been terminated in accordance with the provisions of this section, a request for approval of the same or a modified quality control system will be evaluated by the Administrator upon receipt.

§ 381.172
Requirements for substitute standardized poultry products named by use of an expressed nutrient content claim and a standardized term.
(a)
Description.
The poultry products prescribed by this general definition and standard of identity are those products that substitute, in accordance with § 381.413(d), for a standardized product defined in this subpart and use the name of that standardized product in their statements of identity, but that do not comply with the established standard because of a compositional deviation that results from reduction of a constituent that is described by an expressed nutrient content claim that has been defined by regulation in this subpart. The expressed nutrient content claim shall comply with the requirements of § 381.413 and with the requirements in subpart Y of this part which define the particular nutrient content claim that is used. The poultry product shall comply with the relevant standard in this part in all other respects, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(b)
Performance characteristics.
The performance characteristics, such as physical properties, functional properties, and shelf-life, of the poultry product shall be similar to those of the standardized poultry product produced under subpart P of this part. If there is a significant difference in a performance characteristic that materially
limits the use of the product compared to the use of the standardized product defined in subpart P of this part, the label shall include a statement in accordance with § 381.413(d)(1) and (2) of this part, that informs the consumer of such differences (
e.g.
, if appropriate, “not recommended for frozen storage” or “not suitable for roller grilling”). Deviations from the ingredient provisions of the standard must be the minimum necessary to qualify for the nutrient content claim, while maintaining similar performance characteristics.
(c)
Ingredients used in substitute products.
(1) Ingredients used in the product shall be those ingredients provided for in the standard as defined in subpart P of this part, except that safe and suitable ingredients permitted for use in poultry products as provided in a regulation permitting that use in this subchapter or in 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter E, or in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B, may be used at the minimum level necessary to improve texture and prevent syneresis, so that the substitute product is not inferior in performance characteristics from the standardized product defined in subpart P of this part for which it is a substitute.
(2) An ingredient that is specifically required by the standard prescribed in subpart P of this part shall not be replaced or exchanged with a similar ingredient from another source, for example, extruded turnips shall not replace noodles in poultry with noodles.
(3) An ingredient that is specifically prohibited from use in any poultry product by subpart P of this part shall not be added to the substitute poultry product under this section.
(4) Unless otherwise specified in this part, a substitute poultry product must meet all other requirements of the applicable standards of identity or composition.
(5) Water and fat-replacers (
e.g.
, binders), in combination, may be added to replace fat in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(6) Textured vegetable protein may be used by itself or in combination with other binders and water as a fat replacer in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(d)
Nomenclature.
The name of a substitute poultry product that complies with this section is the appropriate expressed nutrient content claim and the applicable standardized term.
(e)
Label declaration.
(1) Each of the ingredients used in the substitute poultry product shall be declared on the label as required by this section and subpart N of this part.
(2) Ingredients not provided for, and ingredients used in excess of those levels provided for, by the standard as defined in subpart P of this part, shall be identified as such with an asterisk in the ingredients statement. The statement “*Ingredients not in regular __________” (the blank shall be filled in with the name of the traditional standardized product) or “**Ingredients in excess of amounts permitted in regular __________” (the blank shall be filled in with the name of the traditional standardized product), or both, as appropriate, shall immediately follow the ingredients statement in the same type and size.

[60 FR 55983, Nov. 3, 1995]
§ 381.174
Limitations with respect to use of Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry).
(a) A poultry product required to be prepared from a particular kind of poultry (e.g., chicken) shall not contain “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” described in § 381.173, that is made from any other kind of poultry (e.g., Mechanically Separated Turkey).
(b) “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)” described in § 381.173 may be used in the formulation of any poultry or meat food product, provided such use conforms with any applicable requirements of the definitions and standards of identity or composition in this subchapter or part 319 of this chapter, and provided that it is identified as “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry).”

Under the “Talmadge-Aiken Act” of September 28, 1962 (7 U.S.C. 450), the Administrator is authorized under stated conditions to utilize employees and facilities of any State in carrying out Federal functions under the Poultry Products Inspection Act. A cooperative program for this purpose is called a Federal-State program. Under paragraph (a) of section 5 of the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Administrator is also authorized to conduct examinations, investigations, and inspections under the Act through any officer or employee of any State or territory or the District of Columbia commissioned by him for such purpose.
§ 381.187
Cooperation of States for the interstate shipment of poultry products.
(a) The Administrator is authorized under 21 U.S.C. 472(b) to coordinate with States that have poultry products inspection programs as provided in § 381.185 of this subpart to select certain establishments operating under these programs to participate in a cooperative program to ship poultry products in interstate commerce. A cooperative program for this purpose is called a “cooperative interstate shipment program.”
(b) Establishments selected to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program described in this section must receive inspection services from designated State personnel that have been trained in the enforcement of the Act. If the designated personnel determine that the poultry products prepared in establishments selected to participate in the cooperative interstate shipment program comply with all requirements under the Act, these items will bear an official Federal mark of inspection and may be shipped in interstate commerce. The Administrator will assign an FSIS “selected establishment coordinator,” who will be an FSIS employee, to each State that participates in a cooperative interstate shipment program to provide Federal oversight of the program and enforcement of the program's requirements. The Federal contribution for inspection services provided by States that enter into a cooperative interstate shipment program under this section will be at least 60 percent of eligible State costs. Eligible State costs are those costs that a State has justified and FSIS has approved as necessary for the State to provide inspection services to selected establishments in the State.
(c) Subpart Z, of this part 381 prescribes conditions under which States and establishments may participate in the cooperative interstate shipment program.
(d) The Administrator will terminate a cooperative interstate shipment agreement with a State if the Administrator determines that the State is not conducting inspection at selected establishments in a manner that complies with the Act and the implementing regulations in this chapter.

§ 381.189
Provisions inapplicable to specimens for laboratory examination, etc., or to naturally inedible articles.
The provisions of this subpart do not apply:
(a) To dead, dying, disabled or diseased poultry and specimens of undenatured, uninspected or adulterated carcasses, parts, or products of poultry sent to or by the Department of Agriculture or divisions thereof in Washington, DC, or elsewhere, for laboratory examination, exhibition purposes, or other official use;
(b) To dead, dying, disabled or diseased poultry and specimens of undenatured, uninspected or adulterated carcasses, parts, or products of poultry thereof for educational, research, or other nonfood purposes shipped under permit issued by the inspector in charge upon his determination that collection and movement thereof will not interfere with inspection or sanitary conditions at the establishment, and the specimens are for nonfood purposes. The person desiring such specimens shall make a written application to the inspector in charge for such permit on Form MP-112 and shall obtain permission from the operator of the official establishment to obtain the specimens. Permits shall be issued for a period not longer than one year. The permit may be revoked by the inspector in charge if he determines after notice and opportunity to present views is afforded to the permittee that any such specimens were not used as stated in the application, or if the collection or handling of the specimens interferes with inspection or the maintenance of sanitary conditions in the establishment. The specimens referred to in this paragraph shall be collected and handled only at such time and place and in such manner as not to interfere with the inspection or to cause any objectionable condition and shall be identified as inedible when they leave the establishment.
(c) To parts of poultry carcasses that are naturally inedible by humans, such as entrails and feathers in their natural state.
[40 FR 55310, Nov. 28, 1975]
§ 381.190
Transactions in slaughtered poultry and other poultry products restricted; vehicle sanitation requirements.
(a) No person shall sell, transport, offer for sale or transportation, or receive for transportation, in commerce or from any official establishment, any slaughtered poultry from which the blood, feathers, feet, head, or viscera have not been removed in accordance with the regulations.
(b)(1) No person shall sell, transport, offer for sale or transportation, or receive for transportation, in commerce, any slaughtered poultry or other poultry product which is capable of use as human food and is adulterated or fails to bear an official inspection legend or is otherwise misbranded at the time of such sale, transportation, offer or receipt, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b) and subpart C or T.
(2)(i) Poultry heads and feet that are collected and handled at an official establishment in an acceptable manner may be shipped from the official establishment directly for export as human food, if they have been examined and found to be suitable for such purpose, by an inspector and are labeled as prescribed in this paragraph.
(ii) The containers of all such products shall bear a label showing: (A) The name of the products; (B) the name and address of the packer or distributor, and, when the name of the distributor is shown, it shall be qualified by such terms as “packed for,” “distributed by,” or “distributors”; and (C) the official establishment number of the establishment where packed.
(iii) Such products shall not bear the official inspection legend.
(3)(i) Poultry heads and feet that are collected and handled at an official establishment in an acceptable manner may be shipped from the official establishment and in commerce directly to another official establishment for processing before export, provided the receiving establishment maintains records that:
(A) Identify the source of the incoming undenatured poultry product;
(B) Identify the location of the product at all times during processing and preparation for export; and
(C) Contain a written certification from an official of the receiving establishment that the undenatured poultry product intended for export has not been, and will not be, commingled with any product intended for consumption in the United States.

(c) No person, engaged in the business of buying, selling, freezing, storing, or transporting, in or for commerce, poultry products capable of use as human food, or importing such articles, shall transport, offer for transportation, or receive for transportation, in commerce or in any State designated under § 381.221, any poultry product which is capable of use as human food and is not wrapped, packaged, or otherwise enclosed to prevent adulteration by airborne contaminants, unless the railroad car, truck, or other means of conveyance in which the product is contained or transported is completely enclosed with tight fitting doors or other covers for all openings. In all cases, the means of conveyance shall be reasonably free of foreign matter (such as dust, dirt, rust, or other articles or residues), and free of chemical residues, so that product placed therein will not become adulterated. Any cleaning compound, lye, soda solution, or other chemical used in cleaning the means of conveyance must be thoroughly removed from the means of conveyance prior to its use. Such means of conveyance onto which product is loaded, being loaded, or intended to be loaded, shall be subject to inspection by an inspector at any official establishment. The decision whether or not to inspect a means of conveyance in a specific case, and the type and extent of such inspection shall be at the Inspection Service's discretion and shall be adequate to determine if poultry product in such conveyance is, or when moved could become, adulterated.
Circumstances of transport that can be reasonably anticipated shall be considered in making said determination. These include, but are not limited to, weather conditions, duration and distance of trip, nature of product covering, and effect of restowage at stops en route. Any means of conveyance found upon such inspection to be in such condition that poultry product placed therein could become adulterated shall not be used until such condition which could cause adulteration is corrected. Poultry product placed in any means of conveyance that is found by the inspector to be in such condition that the poultry product may have become adulterated shall be removed from the means of conveyance and handled in accordance with § 381.145(b).

§ 381.192
Penalties inapplicable to carriers.
No carrier shall be subject to the penalties of the Act, other than the penalties for violation of section 11, by reason of his receipt, carriage, holding, or delivery, in the usual course of business, as a carrier, of poultry or poultry products, owned by another person, unless the carrier has knowledge, or is in possession of facts which would cause a reasonable person to believe that such
poultry or poultry products were not inspected or marked in accordance with the provisions of the Act or where otherwise not eligible for transportation under the Act, or unless the carrier refuses to furnish on request of a representative of the Secretary, the name and address of the person from whom he received such poultry or poultry products, and copies of all documents, if any there be, pertaining to the delivery of the poultry or poultry products to such carrier.
§ 381.193
Poultry carcasses, etc., not intended for human food.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, poultry carcasses, and parts and products thereof, that are not intended for use as human food may, after they have been denatured as prescribed in § 381.95, be bought, sold, transported, offered for sale or transportation, or received for transportation, in commerce, or imported, even though they do not comply with all the provisions of the regulations, provided they are marked “Not fit for human food.” These requirements do not apply to parts of poultry carcasses that are naturally inedible by humans, such as entrails.
(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) (2), (3), and (4) of this section, no animal food processed, in whole or in part, from materials derived from the carcasses of poultry in an official establishment or elsewhere, shall be bought, sold, transported, offered for sale or transportation, or received for transportation in commerce, or imported, unless:
(i) It is properly identified as animal food;
(ii) It is not represented as being a human food; and
(iii) It has been denatured as prescribed in § 381.95 so as to be readily distinguishable from an article of human food.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an animal food that consists of less than 5 percent of parts or products of the carcasses of poultry and that is not represented by labeling or appearance or otherwise as being a human food or as a product of the poultry industry need not be denatured in accordance with § 381.95.
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, animal food packed in hermetically sealed, retort processed, conventional retail-size containers, and retail-size packages of semi-moist animal food need not be denatured in accordance with § 381.95 if the name of the article clearly conveys the article's intended use for animal food and appears on the label in a conspicuous manner.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii) of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the name of the article must be stated on the label as “Animal Food,” “Pet Food,” or “(name of species) Food” (e.g., “Dog Food” or “Cat Food”). To be considered conspicuous, the name of the article, wherever it appears on the label, must be stated in letters at least twice as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence in the article of any ingredients derived from carcasses of poultry.
(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i) of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the article's name may be stated on the label to show that it is or contains poultry carcass-source material and that the article is for animals; e.g., “Chicken for Pets” or “Turkey Dinner for Cats”:
Provided,
That the entire name of the article is stated, wherever it appears on the label, as an individual, contiguous unit, whether stated on a single line or more than one line, and the letters denoting the article's intended use for animal food are at least as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence of material derived from any poultry carcass. However, when the label bears on its principal display panel a vignette which pictures, in clearly recognizable form and size, one or more animals of the species for which the article's name indicates the article is intended, the letters used to state the article's intended use shall be at least one-half as high, wide, and thick as the letters used in the article's name or other letters indicating the presence of material derived from any poultry carcass, but shall not be less than
1/8
inch high. The letters used to state the article's intended use may be separated from the article's name by the vignette.
(iii) Letters used to denote the intended use of the article must contrast as markedly with their background as the letters indicating the presence in the article of poultry carcass-source material contrast with their background.
(4) The requirements of this part do not apply to livestock or poultry feed manufactured from processed poultry byproducts (such as poultry byproduct meal, hydrolyzed poultry feathers, and hydrolyzed poultry byproducts aggregate), or to processed dry animal food.

(a) Sell, transport, offer for sale or transportation or receive for transportation, in commerce, any dead, dying, disabled, or diseased poultry, or parts of the carcasses of any poultry that died otherwise than by slaughter, unless such poultry and parts are consigned and delivered, without avoidable delay, to establishments of animal food manufacturers, renderers, or collection stations that are registered as required by § 381.179, or to official establishments that operate under Federal inspection, or to establishments that operate under a State or Territorial inspection system approved by the Secretary as one that imposes requirements at least equal to the Federal requirements for purposes of section 5(c) of the Act.
(b) Buy in commerce or import any dead, dying, disabled, or diseased poultry or parts of the carcasses of any poultry that died otherwise than by slaughter, unless he is an animal food manufacturer or renderer and is registered as required by § 381.179, or is the operator of an establishment inspected as required by paragraph (a) of this section and such poultry or parts of carcasses are to be delivered to establishments eligible to receive them under paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) Unload en route to any establishment eligible to receive them under paragraph (a) of this section, any dead, dying, disabled, or diseased poultry or parts of the carcasses of any poultry that died otherwise than by slaughter, which are transported in commerce or imported by any such person:
Provided,
That any such dead, dying, disabled, or diseased poultry, or parts of carcasses may be unloaded from a means of conveyance en route where necessary in case of a wreck or otherwise extraordinary emergency, and may be reloaded into another means of conveyance; but in all such cases, the carrier shall immediately report the facts by telegraph or telephone to the Director, Compliance Staff, Meat and Poultry Inspection Program, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.

[37 FR 9706, May 16, 1972, as amended at 40 FR 42338, Sept. 12, 1975; 54 FR 41049, Oct. 5, 1989; 79 FR 56233, Sept. 19, 2014; 84 FR 65268, Nov. 27, 2019]
§ 381.196
Eligibility of foreign countries for importation of poultry products into the United States.
(a)(1) Whenever it shall be determined by the Administrator that the system of poultry inspection maintained by any foreign country, with respect to establishments preparing products in such country for export to the United States, insures compliance of such establishments and their poultry products, with requirements equivalent to all the provisions of the Act and the regulations in this part which are applied to official establishments in the United States, and their poultry products, and that reliance can be placed upon certificates required under this subpart from authorities of such foreign country, notice of that fact will be given in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Thereafter, poultry products processed in such establishments which are certified and approved in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be eligible, so far as the regulations in this part are concerned, for importation into the United States from such foreign country after applicable requirements of this part have been met.
(2) The determination of acceptability of a foreign poultry inspection system for purposes of this section shall be based on an evaluation of the foreign program in accordance with the following requirements and procedures:
(i) The system shall have a program organized and administered by the national government of the foreign country. The system as implemented must provide standards equivalent to those of the Federal system of poultry inspection in the United States with respect to:
(A) Organizational structure and staffing, so as to insure uniform enforcement of the requisite laws and regulations in all establishments throughout the system at which poultry products are processed for export to the United States;
(B) Ultimate control and supervision by the national government over the official activities of all employees or licensees of the system;
(C) The assignment of competent, qualified inspectors;
(D) Authority and responsibility of national inspection officials to enforce the requisite laws and regulations governing poultry inspection and to certify or refuse to certify poultry products intended for export;
(E) Adequate administrative and technical support;
(F) The inspection, sanitation, quality, species verification, and residue standards applied to products produced in the United States.
(G) Other requirements of adequate inspection service as required by the regulations.
(ii) The legal authority for the system and the regulations thereunder shall impose requirements equivalent to those governing the system of poultry inspection organized and maintained in the United States with respect to:
(A) Ante mortem inspection of poultry for slaughter, which shall be performed by veterinarians or by other employees or licensees of the system under the direct supervision of veterinarians;
(B) Post mortem inspection of carcasses and parts thereof at time of slaughter, performed by veterinarians or other employees or licensees of the system under the direct supervision of veterinarians;
(C) Official controls by the national government over establishment construction, facilities, and equipment;
(D) Direct and continuous official supervision of slaughtering of poultry and processing of poultry products, by the assignment of inspectors to establishments certified under paragraph (a)(3) of this section to assure that adulterated or misbranded poultry
products are not processed for export to the United States;
(E) Complete separation of establishments certified under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph from establishments not certified, and the maintenance of a single standard of inspection and sanitation throughout all certified establishments;
(F) Requirements for sanitation at certified establishments and for sanitary handling of poultry products;
(G) Official controls over condemned material until destroyed or removed and thereafter excluded from the establishment;
(H) A Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, as set forth in part 417 of this chapter.
(I) Other matters for which requirements are contained in the Act or the regulations in this part.
(iii) Countries desiring to establish eligibility for importation of poultry products into the United States may request a determination of eligibility by presenting copies of the laws and regulations on which the foreign poultry inspection system is based and such other information as the Administrator may require with respect to matters enumerated in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii). Determination of eligibility is based on a study of the documents and other information presented and an initial review of the system in operation by a representative of the Department using the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. Maintenance of eligibility of a country for importation of poultry products into the United States depends on the results of periodic reviews of the foreign poultry inspection system in operation by a representative of the Department, and the timely submission of such documents and other information related to the conduct of the foreign inspection system as the Administrator may find pertinent to and necessary for the determinations required by this section.
(iv) The foreign inspection system must maintain a program to assure that the requirements referred to in this section, equivalent to those applicable to the Federal system in the United States, are being met. The program as implemented must provide for the following:
(A) Periodic supervisory visits by a representative of the foreign inspection system to each establishment certified in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section to ensure that requirements referred to in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) through (H) of this section are being met: Provided, That such visits are not required with respect to any establishment during a period when the establishment is not operating or is not engaged in producing products for exportation to the United States;
(B) Written reports prepared by the representative of the foreign inspection system who has conducted a supervisory visit, documenting his or her findings with respect to the requirements referred to in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) through (a)(2)(ii)(H) of this section, copies of which shall be made available to the representative of the Department at the time of the representative's review upon request by that representative to a responsible foreign inspection official:
Provided,
that such reports are not required during a period when the establishment is not operating or not engaged in producing products for exportation to the United States.
(C) Random sampling and testing at the point of slaughter of carcasses, including internal organs and fat, for residues identified by the exporting country's inspection authorities or by this Agency as potential contaminants, in accordance with sampling and analytical techniques approved by the Administrator:
Provided,
that such testing is required only on samples taken of carcasses from which poultry or poultry products intended for importation into the United States are produced.
(3) Only those establishments that are determined and certified to the Agency by a responsible official of the foreign meat inspection system as fully meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are eligible to have their products imported into the United States. Establishment eligibility is subject to review by the Agency (including observations of the establishments by Program representatives at times prearranged with
the foreign meat inspection system officials). Foreign establishment certifications must be renewed annually. Notwithstanding certification by a foreign official, the Administrator may terminate the eligibility of any foreign establishment for the importation of its products into the United States if it does not comply with the requirements listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, or if current establishment information cannot be obtained. The Administrator will provide reasonable notice to the foreign government of the proposed termination of any foreign establishment, unless a delay in terminating its eligibility could result in the importation of adulterated or misbranded product.
(i) For a new establishment or any establishment for which information from last year's electronic certification or paper certificate has changed, the certification or certificate must contain: The date; the foreign country; the foreign establishment's name, address, and foreign establishment number; the foreign official's title; the foreign official's signature (for paper certificates only); the type of operation(s) conducted at the establishment (e.g., slaughter, processing, storage, exporting warehouse); and the establishment's eligibility status (e.g., new or relisted (if previously delisted)). Slaughter and processing establishment certifications must address the species and type of products produced at the establishment (e.g., the process category).
(ii) If the establishment information provided on the preceding year's electronic foreign establishment certification or paper certificate, as required in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, has not changed, the certification or certificate must contain: The date, the foreign country, the foreign establishment's name, the foreign official's title and signature (for paper certificates only).
(4) Poultry products from foreign countries not deemed eligible in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section may not be imported into the United States, except as provided by §§ 381.207 and 381.209. Eligibility of any foreign country under this section may be withdrawn whenever the Administrator determines that the system of poultry inspection maintained by such foreign country does not assure compliance with requirements equivalent to all the requirements of the Act and the regulations as applied to official establishments in the United States; or that reliance cannot be placed upon certificates required under this subpart from authorities of such foreign country; or that, for lack of current information concerning the system of poultry inspection being maintained by such foreign country, such foreign country should be required to reestablish its eligibility.
(b) A list of countries eligible to export specific process categories of poultry products to the United States is maintained at
http://www.fsis.usda.gov/importlibrary.
Such products from listed countries must be accompanied by inspection certificates of the country of origin, as required by § 381.197, and are eligible under the regulations in this subpart for entry into the United States, after inspection and marking as required by the applicable provisions of this subpart.

(f) Owners or operators of establishments, other than official establishments, who want to have import inspections made at their establishments, shall apply to the Administrator for approval of their establishments for such purpose. Application shall be made on a form furnished by the Program, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC, and shall include all information called for by that form.
(g) Approval for Federal import inspection shall be in accordance with subpart D of this part.
(h) Owners or operators of establishments at which import inspections of product are to be made shall furnish adequate sanitary facilities and equipment for examination of such product. The requirements of §§ 381.21 and 381.36, and part 416 of this chapter shall apply as conditions for approval of establishments as official import inspection establishments to the same extent and in the same manner as they apply with respect to official establishments.
(i) The Administrator is authorized to approve any establishment as an official import inspection establishment provided that an application has been filed and drawings have been submitted in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and he determines that such establishment meets the requirements under paragraph (e) of this section. Any application for inspection under this section may be denied or refused in accordance with the rules of practice in part 500 of this chapter.
(j) Approval of an official import inspection establishment may be withdrawn in accordance with applicable rules of practice if it is determined that the sanitary conditions are such that the product is rendered adulterated, that such action is authorized by section 21(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (84
Stat. 91), or that the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section were not complied with. Approval may also be withdrawn in accordance with section 401 of the Act and applicable rules of practice.
(k) A special official number shall be assigned to each official import inspection establishment. Such number shall be used to identify all products inspected and passed for entry at the establishment.

(a) No slaughtered poultry or other poultry product required by this subpart to be inspected shall be released from customs custody prior to inspection, but such product may be delivered to the consignee, or his agent, prior to inspection, if the consignee shall furnish a bond, in form prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, conditioned that the product shall be returned, if demanded, to the collector of the port where the same is offered for clearance through the customs.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, no product required by this subpart to be inspected shall be moved, prior to inspection, from the port of arrival where first unloaded, and if arriving by water, from the wharf where first unloaded at such port, to any place other than the place designated in accordance with this subpart as the place where the same shall be inspected; and no product shall be conveyed in any manner other than in compliance with this subpart.
(c) The consignee, or his agent, shall furnish such facilities and shall provide such assistance for handling and marking poultry products offered for entry as the inspector may require.

Compartments of steamships, railroad cars, and other means of conveyance transporting any poultry product to the United States, and all chutes, platforms, racks, tables, tools, utensils, and all other devices used in moving and handling any poultry product offered for entry into the United States, shall be maintained in a sanitary condition.
§ 381.202
Poultry products offered for entry; reporting of findings to customs; handling of articles refused entry; appeals, how made; denaturing procedures.
(a)(1) Program inspectors shall report their findings as to any product which has been inspected in accordance with this part, to the Director of Customs at the original port of entry.
(2) When product has been identified as “U.S. refused entry,” the inspector shall request the Director of Customs to refuse admission to such product and to direct that it be exported by the owner or consignee within the time specified in this section, unless the owner or consignee, within the specified time, causes it to be destroyed by disposing of it under the supervision of a Program employee so that the product can no longer be used as human food, or by converting it to animal food uses, if permitted by the Food and Drug Administration. The owner or consignee of the refused entry product shall not transfer legal title to such product, except to a foreign consignee for direct and immediate exportation, or an end user, e.g., an animal food manufacturer or a renderer, for destruction for human food purposes. “Refused entry” product must be delivered to and used by the manufacturer or renderer within the 45-day time limit. Even if such title is illegally transferred, the subsequent purchaser will still be required to export the product or have it destroyed as specified in the notice under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(3) No lot of product which has been refused entry may be subdivided during disposition pursuant to paragraph
(a)(2) of this section, except that removal and destruction of any damaged or otherwise unsound product from a lot destined for reexportation is permitted under supervision of USDA prior to exportation. Additionally, such refused entry lot may not be shipped for export from any port other than that through which the product came into the United States without the expressed consent of the Administrator, based on full information concerning the product's disposition, including the name of the vessel and the date of export. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “lot” shall refer to that product identified on MP Form 410 in the original request for inspection for importation pursuant to § 381.198.
(4) The owner or consignee shall have 45 days after notice is given by FSIS to the Director of Customs at the original port of entry to take the action required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for “refused entry” product. Extension beyond the 45-day period may be granted by the Administrator when extreme circumstances warrant it; e.g., a dock workers' strike or an unforeseeable vessel delay.
(5) If the owner or consignee fails to take the required action within the time specified under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the Department will take such actions as may be necessary to effectuate its order to have the product destroyed for human food purposes. The Department shall seek court costs and fees, storage, and proper expenses in the appropriate forum.
(6) No product which has been refused entry and exported to another country pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be returned to the United States under any circumstance. Any such product so returned to the United States shall be subject to administrative detention in accordance with section 19 of the Act, and seizure and condemnation in accordance with section 20 of the Act.
(b) Upon the request of the Director of Customs at the port where a product is offered for clearance through the customs, the consignee of the product shall, at the consignee's own expense, immediately return to the Director any product which has been delivered to consignee under this subpart and subsequently designated “U.S. Refused Entry” or found in any request not to comply with the requirements in this subpart.
(c) Except as provided in § 381.200(a) or (b), no person shall remove or cause to be removed from any place designated as the place of inspection, any poultry product which the regulations in this subpart require to be marked in any way, unless the same has been clearly and legibly marked in compliance with this subpart.
(d) Any person receiving inspection service may, if dissatisfied with any decision or action of an inspector or other Agency employee relating to any inspection, file an appeal from such decision or action in accordance with 9 CFR 500.9. The poultry or poultry products involved in any appeal must be identified by U.S. retained tags and segregated in a manner approved by the inspector or other Agency employee pending completion of an appeal inspection.
(e) All condemned carcasses, or condemned parts of carcasses, or other condemned poultry products, except those condemned for biological residues, shall be disposed of by one of the following methods, under the supervision of an inspector of the Inspection Service. (Facilities and materials for carrying out the requirements in this section shall be furnished by the official establishments.)
(1) Steam treatment (which shall be accomplished by processing the condemned product in a pressure tank under at least 40 pounds of steam pressure) or thorough cooking in a kettle or vat, a sufficient time to effectively destroy the product for human food purposes and preclude dissemination of disease through consumption by animals. (Tanks and equipment used for this purpose or for rendering or preparing inedible products shall be in rooms or compartments separate from those used for the preparation of edible products. There shall be no direct connection by means of pipes, or otherwise, between tanks containing inedible products and those containing edible products.)
(2) Incineration or complete destruction by burning.
(3) Chemical denaturing, which shall be accomplished by the liberal application to all carcasses and parts thereof, of:
(i) Crude carbolic acid,
(ii) Kerosene, fuel oil, or used crankcase oil, or
(iii) Any phenolic disinfectant conforming to commercial standards CS 70-41 or CS 71-41 which shall be used in at least 2 percent emulsion or solution.
(4) Any other substances or method that the Administrator approves in specific cases, which will denature the poultry product to the extent necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section.
(5) Carcasses and parts of carcasses condemned for biological residue shall be disposed of in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section or by burying under the supervision of an inspector.

(1) The written procedure for controlled pre-stamping should be in the form of a letter and shall include the following:
(i) That stamping under this subpart will be limited to those lots of product which can be inspected on the day that certificates for the product are examined;
(ii) That all products which have been pre-stamped will be stored in the facility where the import inspection will occur;
(iii) That inspection marks applied under this part will be removed from any lot of product subsequently refused entry on the day the product is rejected; and

The daily stamping log must be retained by the establishment in accordance with the requirements of § 381.177.
(2) An official import establishment's controlled pre-stamping privilege may be cancelled orally or in writing by the inspector or other Agency employee who is supervising its enforcement whenever the employee finds that the official import establishment has failed to comply with the provisions of this part or any conditions imposed pursuant thereto. If the cancellation is oral, the decision or action and the reasons therefor will be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose controlled pre-stamping privilege has been cancelled may appeal the decision or action in accordance with 9 CFR 500.9.

§ 381.222
States designated under paragraph 5(c) of the Act; application of regulations.
The provisions of the regulations in this part apply to operations and transactions wholly within each State designated in § 381.221 under paragraph 5(c) of the Act, except as otherwise provided in this section. (The provisions of the regulations apply in all respects to operations and transactions in or for commerce.)
(a) Each establishment located in such a designated State, shall be granted inspection required under § 381.6(b) only if it is found, upon a combined evaluation of its premises, facilities, and operating procedures, to be capable of producing products that are not adulterated or misbranded.
(b) Section 381.26 will apply to establishments required to have inspection under § 381.6(b), except that existing interconnections between official and unofficial establishments or between official establishments will be permitted if it is determined in specific cases that the interconnections are such that transfer of inedible poultry product into the official establishment would be difficult or unusual, and any such transfers are strictly prohibited, except as permitted under other provisions of the regulations. It is essential that separation of facilities be maintained to the extent necessary to assure that inedible poultry product does not enter the official establishment contrary to the regulations.
(c) Sections 381.49 and 381.51 shall apply to such establishments, except that separate facilities for men and women workers will not be required when the majority of the workers in the establishment are related by blood or marriage, provided that this will not conflict with municipal or State requirements; and except that separation of toilet soil lines from house drainage lines to a point outside the buildings will not be required in existing construction when positive acting backflow devices are installed.
(d) Subpart N of this part shall apply to such establishments except as provided in this paragraph (d).
(1) The operator of each such establishment shall, prior to the inauguration of inspection, identify all labeling and marking devices in use, or proposed for use (upon the date of inauguration of inspection) to the Front Line Supervisor in which the establishment is located. Temporary approval, pending formal approval under § 412.1 of this chapter, will be granted by the Front Line Supervisor for labeling and marking devices that he determines are neither false nor misleading, provided the official inspection legend bearing the official establishment number is applied to the principal display panel of each label, either by a mechanical printing device or a self-destructive pressure sensitive sticker, and provided the label shows the true product name, an accurate ingredient statement, the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, and any other features required by section 4(h) of the Act.
(2) The Front Line Supervisor will forward one copy of each item of labeling and a description of each marking device for which he has granted temporary approval to the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff and will retain one copy in a temporary approval file for the establishment.
(3) The operator of the official establishment shall promptly forward a copy of each item of labeling and a description of each marking device for which temporary approval has been granted by the Front Line Supervisor (showing any modifications required by the Front Line Supervisor) to the FSIS Labeling and Program Delivery Staff at headquarters, accompanied by the formula and details of preparation and packaging for each product. Within 90 days after inauguration of inspection,
all labeling material and marking devices temporarily approved by the Front Line Supervisor must receive approval as required by § 412.1 or their use must be discontinued.
(4) The Front Line Supervisor will also review all shipping containers to ensure that they do not have any false or misleading labeling and are otherwise not misbranded. Modifications of unacceptable information on labeling material by the use of pressure sensitive tape of a type that cannot be removed without visible evidence of such removal, or by blocking out with an ink stamp will be authorized on a temporary basis to permit the maximum allowable use of all labeling materials on hand. All unacceptable labeling material which is not modified to comply with the requirements of the regulations must be destroyed or removed from the official establishment.
(e) Sections 381.175 through 381.179 apply to operations and transactions not in or for commerce in a State designated under paragraph 5(c) only if the State is also designated under section 11 of the Act and if such provisions are applicable as shown in § 381.224.
(f) Section 381.185(a) will not apply to States designated under paragraph 5(c) of the Act.
(g) Provisions of this part relating to exports and imports do not apply to operations and transactions solely in or for intrastate commerce.

§ 381.223
Control and disposition of nonfederally inspected poultry products in States designated under paragraph 5(c) of the Act.
Upon the effective date of designation of a State under paragraph 5(c) of the Act, no poultry products can be processed within the State unless they are prepared under inspection pursuant to the regulations or are exempted from the requirement of inspection under § 381.10, and no unexempted poultry products which were processed without any inspection can lawfully be distributed within the State. For a period of 90 days from the effective date of such designation, poultry products which were processed in any State listed in § 381.187 and inspected and passed under the supervision of a responsible State or local inspection agency or exempted from State inspection can be distributed solely within the State, provided they are not adulterated or misbranded, except that the official inspection legend shall not be used. Such products may not enter official establishments. After said 90-day period, only federally inspected and passed products may be distributed within the designated State, except as provided in § 381.10.

§ 381.225
Criteria and procedure for designating establishments with operations which would clearly endanger the public health; disposition of poultry products therein.
(a) An establishment in any State not listed in § 381.221 that is preparing poultry products solely for distribution within such State shall be designated as one producing adulterated products which would clearly endanger the public health, if:
(1) Any poultry product processed at the establishment is adulterated in any of the following respects:
(i) It bears or contains a pesticide chemical, food additive, or color additive, that is “unsafe” within the meaning of section 408, 409, or 706 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or was intentionally subjected to radiation in a manner not permitted under section 409 of said Act; or if it bears or contains any other added poisonous or added deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health or make it unfit for human food; or
(ii) It consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid or decomposed substance or is for any other reason unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or otherwise unfit for human food (for example, it was prepared from a poultry carcass or other ingredients exhibiting spoilage characteristics); or it is, or was prepared from, a poultry carcass which would be required to be condemned under subpart K at official establishments; or
(iii) It has been prepared, packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth or may have been rendered injurious to health (for example, if insects or vermin are not effectively controlled at the establishment, or insanitary water is used in preparing poultry products for human food); or
(iv) It is, in whole or in part, the product of poultry that died otherwise than by slaughter; or
(v) Its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health; and
(2) Such adulterated articles are intended to be or are distributed from the establishment while capable of use as human food.
(b) When any such establishment is identified by an inspector as one producing adulterated poultry products which would clearly endanger public health under the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section, the following procedure will be followed:
(1) The inspector will informally advise the operator of the establishment concerning the deficiencies found by him and report his findings to the appropriate Regional Director for the Inspection Service. When it is determined by the Regional Director that
any establishment preparing poultry products solely for distribution within any State is producing adulterated poultry products for distribution within such State which would clearly endanger the public health, written notification thereof will be issued to the appropriate State officials, including the Governor of the State and the appropriate Advisory Committee, for effective action under State or local law to prevent such endangering of the public health. Such written notification shall clearly specify the deficiencies deemed to result in the production of adulterated poultry products and shall specify a reasonable time for such action under State or local law.
(2) If effective action is not taken under State or local law within the specified time, written notification shall be issued by the Regional Director to the operator of the establishment, specifying the deficiencies involved and allowing him 10 days to present his views or make the necessary corrections, and notifying him that failure to correct such deficiencies may result in designation of the establishment and operator thereof as subject to the provisions of sections 1 through 4, 6 through 10, and 12 through 22 of the Act as though engaged in commerce.
(3) Thereafter the inspector shall survey the establishment and designate it if he determines, in consultation with the Regional Director, that it is producing adulterated poultry products, which would clearly endanger the public health, and formal notice of such designation will be issued to the operator of the establishment by the Regional Director.
(c) Poultry products on hand at the time of designation of an establishment under this section are subject to retention or detention, and seizure and condemnation in accordance with § 381.145 or subpart U of this part:
Provided,
That poultry products that have been federally inspected and so identified and that have not been further prepared at any nonfederally inspected establishment may be released for distribution if the products appear to be not adulterated or misbranded at the time of such release.
(d) No establishment designated under this section can lawfully prepare any poultry products unless it first obtains inspection or qualifies for exemption under § 381.10 of this subpart. All other provisions of the regulations shall apply to establishments designated under this section to the same extent and in the same manner as if they were engaged in commerce, except that the exceptions provided for in § 381.222 shall apply to such establishments.
Subpart X [Reserved]

# Subpart Y—Nutrition Labeling

# Source:
58 FR 675, Jan. 6, 1993, unless otherwise noted.
§ 381.400
Nutrition labeling of poultry products.
(a) Nutrition labeling must be provided for all poultry products intended for human consumption and offered for sale, except single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401 and are not major cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry products identified in § 381.444, unless the product is exempted under § 381.500. Nutrition labeling must be provided for the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry products identified in § 381.444, either in accordance with the provisions of § 381.409 for nutrition labels, or in accordance with the provisions of § 381.445 for point-of-purchase materials, except as exempted under § 381.500. For all other products that require nutrition labeling, including ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, nutrition labeling must be provided in accordance with the provisions of § 381.409, except as exempted under § 381.500.
(b) Nutrition labeling may be provided for single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401 and that are not major cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry products identified in § 381.444, either in accordance with the provisions of § 381.409 for nutrition labels, or in accordance with
the provisions of § 381.445 for point-of-purchase materials.
[75 FR 82166, Dec. 29, 2010]
§ 381.401
Required nutrition labeling of ground or chopped poultry products.
Nutrition labels must be provided for all ground or chopped poultry (kind) with or without added seasonings (including, but not limited to, ground chicken, ground turkey, and (kind) burgers) that are intended for human consumption and offered for sale, in accordance with the provisions of § 381.409, except as exempted under § 381.500.
[75 FR 82166, Dec. 29, 2010]
§ 381.402
Location of nutrition information.
(a) Nutrition information on a label of a packaged poultry product shall appear on the label's principal display panel or on the information panel, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(b) Nutrition information for gift packs may be shown at a location other than on the product label, provided that the labels for these products bear no nutrition claim. In lieu of on the product label, nutrition information may be provided by alternate means such as product label inserts.
(c) Poultry products in packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling greater than 40 square inches but whose principal display panel and information panel do not provide sufficient space to accommodate all required information may use any alternate panel that can be readily seen by consumers for the nutrition information. In determining the sufficiency of available space for the nutrition information, the space needed for vignettes, designs, and other nonmandatory label information on the principal display panel may be considered.

§§ 381.403-381.407
[Reserved]
§ 381.408
Labeling of poultry products with number of servings.
The label of any package of a poultry product that bears a representation as to the number of servings contained in such package shall meet the requirements of § 381.121(c)(7).
§ 381.409
Nutrition label content.
(a) All nutrient and food component quantities shall be declared in relation to a serving as defined in this section.
(b)(1) The term “serving” or “serving size” means an amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons 4 years of age or older, which is expressed in a common household measure that is appropriate to the product. When the product is specially formulated or processed for use by infants or by toddlers, a serving or serving size means an amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively.
(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(8), (b)(12), and (b)(14) of this section and for products that are intended for weight control and are available only through a weight-control or weight-maintenance program, the serving size declared on a product label shall be determined from the “Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed Per Eating Occasion—General Food Supply” (Reference Amount(s)) that appear in § 381.412(b) using the procedures described in this paragraph (b). For products that are both intended for weight control and available only through a weight-control program, a manufacturer may determine the serving size that is consistent with the meal plan of the program. Such products must bear a statement, “for sale only through the ______ program” (fill in the blank with the name of the appropriate weight-control program, e.g., Smith's Weight Control), on the principal display panel. However, the Reference Amounts in § 381.412(b) shall be used for purposes of evaluating whether weight-control products that are available only through a weight-control program qualify for nutrition claims.
(3) The declaration of nutrient and food component content shall be on the basis of the product “as packaged” for all products, except that single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped poultry products as described in § 381.401 may be declared on the basis of the product “as consumed.” For single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, if data are based on the product “as consumed,” the data must be presented in accordance with § 381.445(d). In addition to the required declaration on the basis of “as packaged” for products other than single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped poultry products as described in § 381.401, the declaration may also be made on the basis of “as consumed,” provided that preparation and cooking instructions are clearly stated.
(4) For products in discrete units (e.g., chicken wings, and individually packaged products within a multi-serving package), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is in discrete units (e.g., chicken wings and barbecue sauce), the serving size shall be declared as follows:
(i) If a unit weighs 50 percent or less of the Reference Amount, the serving size shall be the number of whole units that most closely approximates the Reference Amount for the product category.
(ii) If a unit weighs more than 50 percent but less than 67 percent of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may declare one unit or two units as the serving size.
(iii) If a unit weighs 67 percent or more but less than 200 percent of the Reference Amount, the serving size shall be one unit.
(iv) If a unit weighs 200 percent or more of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may declare one unit as the serving size if the whole unit can reasonably be consumed at a single eating occasion.
(v) For products that have Reference Amounts of 100 grams (or milliliter) or larger and are individual units within a multi-serving package, if a unit contains more than 150 percent but less than 200 percent of the Reference Amount, the manufacturer may decide whether to declare the individual unit as 1 or 2 servings.
(vi) For products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is in discrete units (e.g., chicken wings and barbecue sauce), the serving size may be the number of discrete units represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the Reference Amount for the combined product as determined in § 381.412(c).
(vii) For packages containing several individual single-serving containers, each of which is labeled with all required information including nutrition labeling as specified in this section (i.e., are labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers), the serving size shall be 1 unit.
(5) For products in large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., pizza, pan of poultry lasagna), for unprepared products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., pizza kit), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a large discrete unit usually divided for consumption, the serving size shall be the fractional slice of the ready-to-eat product (e.g.,
1/8
quiche,
1/4
pizza) that most closely approximates the Reference Amount for the product category. The serving size may be the fraction of the package used to make the Reference Amount for the unprepared product determined in § 381.412(d) or the fraction of the large discrete unit represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the Reference Amount of the combined product determined in § 381.412(c). In expressing the fractional slice, manufacturers shall use
1/2
,
1/3
,
1/4
,
1/5
,
1/6
, or smaller fractions that can be generated by further division by 2 or 3.
(6) For nondiscrete bulk products (e.g., whole turkey, turkey breast, ground poultry), and for products which consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is a bulk product (e.g., turkey breast and gravy), the serving size shall be the amount in household measure that most closely approximates the Reference Amount for the product category and may be the amount of the bulk product represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned minor ingredients used to make the Reference Amount for the combined product determined in § 381.412(c).
(7) For labeling purposes, the term “common household measure” or “common household unit” means cup, tablespoon, teaspoon, piece, slice, fraction (e.g.,
1/4
pizza), ounce (oz), or other common household equipment used to package food products (e.g., jar or tray). In expressing serving size in household measures, except as specified in paragraphs (b)(7)(iv), (v), and (vi) of this section, the following rules shall be used:
(i) Cups, tablespoons, or teaspoons shall be used wherever possible and appropriate. Cups shall be expressed in
1/4
- or
1/3
-cup increments, tablespoons in whole number of tablespoons for quantities less than
1/4
cup but greater than or equal to 2 tablespoons (tbsp), 1, 1
1/3
, 1
1/2
, or 1
2/3
tbsp for quantities less than 2 tbsp but greater than or equal to 1 tbsp, and teaspoons in whole number of teaspoons for quantities less than 1 tbsp but greater than or equal to 1 teaspoon (tsp), and in
1/4
-tsp increments for quantities less than 1 tsp.
(ii) If cups, tablespoons or teaspoons are not applicable, units such as piece, slice, tray, jar, and fraction shall be used.
(iii) If cups, tablespoons and teaspoons, or units such as piece, slice, tray, jar, or fraction are not applicable, ounces may be used. Ounce measurements shall be expressed in 0.5-ounce increments most closely approximating the Reference Amount with rounding indicated by the use of the term “about” (e.g., about 2.5 ounces).
(iv) A description of the individual container or package shall be used for single-serving containers and for individually packaged products within multi-serving containers (e.g., can, box, package, meal, or dinner). A description of the individual unit shall be used for other products in discrete units (e.g., wing, slice, link, or patty).
(v) For unprepared products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare large discrete units that are usually divided for consumption (e.g., pizza kit), the fraction or portion of the package may be used.
(vi) For products that consist of two or more distinct ingredients or components packaged and presented to be consumed together (e.g., chicken wings with a glaze packet), the nutrition information may be declared for each component or as a composite. The serving size may be provided in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section.
(vii) For nutrition labeling purposes, a teaspoon means 5 milliliters (mL), a tablespoon means 15 mL, a cup means 240 mL, and 1 oz in weight means 28 grams (g).
(viii) When a serving size, determined from the Reference Amount in § 381.412(b) and the procedures described in this section, falls exactly half way between two serving sizes (e.g., 2.5 tbsp), manufacturers shall round the serving size up to the next incremental size.
(8) A product that is packaged and sold individually and that contains less than 200 percent of the applicable Reference Amount shall be considered to be a single-serving container, and the entire content of the product shall be labeled as one serving, except for products that have Reference Amounts of 100 g (or mL) or larger, manufacturers may decide whether a package that contains more than 150 percent but less than 200 percent of the Reference Amount is 1 or 2 servings. Packages sold individually that contain 200 percent or more of the applicable Reference Amount may be labeled as a single-serving if the entire content of the package can reasonably be consumed at a single-eating occasion.
(9) A label statement regarding a serving shall be the serving size expressed in common household measures as set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)
through (b)(8) of this section and shall be followed by the equivalent metric quantity in parenthesis (fluids in milliliters and all other foods in grams), except for single-serving containers.
(i) For a single-serving container, the parenthetical metric quantity, which will be presented as part of the net weight statement on the principal display panel, is not required except where nutrition information is required on a drained weight basis according to paragraph (b)(11) of this section. However, if a manufacturer voluntarily provides the metric quantity on products that can be sold as single servings, then the numerical value provided as part of the serving size declaration must be identical to the metric quantity declaration provided as part of the net quantity of contents statement.
(ii) The gram or milliliter quantity equivalent to the household measure should be rounded to the nearest whole number except for quantities that are less than 5 g (mL). The gram (mL) quantity between 2 and 5 g (mL) should be rounded to the nearest 0.5 g (mL) and the g (mL) quantity less than 2 g (mL) should be expressed in 0.1-g (mL) increments.
(iii) In addition, serving size may be declared in ounce, in parenthesis, following the metric measure separated by a slash where other common household measures are used as the primary unit for serving size, e.g., 1 slice (28 g/1 oz) for sliced chicken roll. The ounce quantity equivalent to the metric quantity should be expressed in 0.1-oz increments.
(iv) If a manufacturer elects to use abbreviations for units, the following abbreviations shall be used: tbsp for tablespoon, tsp for teaspoon, g for gram, mL for milliliter, and oz for ounce.
(10) Determination of the number of servings per container shall be based on the serving size of the product determined by following the procedures described in this section.
(i) The number of servings shall be rounded to the nearest whole number except for the number of servings between 2 and 5 servings and random weight products. The number of servings between 2 and 5 servings shall be rounded to the nearest 0.5 serving. Rounding should be indicated by the use of the term “about” (e.g., about 2 servings; about 3.5 servings).
(ii) When the serving size is required to be expressed on a drained solids basis and the number of servings varies because of a natural variation in unit size, the manufacturer may state the typical number of servings per container (e.g., usually 5 servings).
(iii) For random weight products, a manufacturer may declare “varied” for the number of servings per container provided the nutrition information is based on the Reference Amount expressed in ounces. The manufacturer may provide the typical number of servings in parenthesis following the “varied” statement (e.g., varied (approximately 8 servings per pound)).
(iv) For packages containing several individual single-serving containers, each of which is labeled with all required information including nutrition labeling as specified in this section (i.e., are labeled appropriately for individual sale as single-serving containers), the number of servings shall be the number of individual packages within the total package.
(v) For packages containing several individually packaged multi-serving units, the number of servings shall be determined by multiplying the number of individual multi-serving units in the total package by the number of servings in each individual unit. The declaration of the number of servings per container need not be included in nutrition labeling of single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, including those that have been previously frozen.
(11) The declaration of nutrient and food component content shall be on the basis of product as packaged or purchased with the exception of single-ingredient, raw products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401 and products that are packed or canned in water, brine, or oil but whose liquid packing medium is not customarily consumed. Declaration of the nutrient and food component content of products that are packed in liquid which is not customarily consumed shall be based on the drained solids.
(12) The serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products as defined in § 381.413(l) and § 381.413 (m) in single-serve containers will be the entire edible content of the package. Serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products in multi-serve containers will be based on the reference amount applicable to the product in § 381.412(b) if the product is listed in § 381.412(b). Serving size for meal-type products and main-dish products in multi-serve containers that are not listed in § 381.412(b) will be based on the reference amount according to § 381.412(c), (d), and (e).
(13) Another column of figures may be used to declare the nutrient and food component information in the same format as required by § 381.409(e),
(i) Per 100 grams, 100 milliliters, or 1 ounce of the product as packaged or purchased.
(ii) Per one unit if the serving size of a product in discrete units in a multi-serving container is more than one unit.
(14) If a product consists of assortments of poultry products (e.g., variety packs) in the same package, nutrient content shall be expressed on the entire package contents or on each individual product.
(15) If a product is commonly combined with other ingredients or is cooked or otherwise prepared before eating, and directions for such combination or preparations are provided, another column of figures may be used to declare the nutrient contents on the basis of the product as consumed for the product alone (e.g., a cream soup mix may be labeled with one set of Daily Values for the dry mix (per serving), and another set for the serving of the final soup when prepared (e.g., per serving of cream soup mix and 1 cup of vitamin D fortified whole milk)):
Provided,
that the type and quantity of the other ingredients to be added to the product by the user and the specific method of cooking and other preparation shall be specified prominently on the label.
(c) The declaration of nutrition information on the label or in labeling of a poultry product shall contain information about the level of the following nutrients, except for those nutrients whose inclusion, and the declaration of amounts, is voluntary as set forth in this paragraph.

When the protein quality in a product as measured by the Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) is less than 40 percent of the reference standard (casein) for a product represented or purported to be for infants, the statement “not a significant source of protein” shall be placed adjacent to the declaration of protein content. Protein content may be calculated on the basis of the factor of 6.25 times the nitrogen content of the food as determined by appropriate methods of analysis in accordance with § 381.409(h), except when the procedure for a specific food requires another factor.
(i) A statement of the corrected amount of protein per serving, as determined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section, calculated as a percentage of the RDI or DRV for protein, as appropriate, and expressed as percent of Daily Value, may be placed on the label, except that such a statement shall be given if a protein claim is made for the product, or if the product is represented or purported to be for infants or children under 4 years of age. When such a declaration is provided, it shall be placed on the label adjacent to the statement of grams of protein and aligned under the column headed “Percent Daily Value,” and expressed to the nearest whole percent. However, the percentage of the RDI for protein shall not be declared if the product is represented or purported to be for infants and the protein quality value is less than 40 percent of the reference standard.
(ii) The corrected amount of protein (grams) per serving for products represented or purported to be for adults and children 1 or more years of age is equal to the actual amount of protein (grams) per serving multiplied by the amino acid score corrected for protein digestibility. If the corrected score is above 1.00, then it shall be set at 1.00. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score shall be determined by methods given in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8 in “Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,” Rome, 1990, which is incorporated by reference. Sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8 of the “Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,” as published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization, is incorporated as it exists on the date of approval. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. It is available for inspection at the office of the FSIS Docket Clerk, Room 3171, South Building, 14th and Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

Copies of the incorporation by reference are available from the Product Assessment Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 329, West End Court Building, Washington, DC 20250-3700. For products represented or purported to be for infants, the corrected amount of protein (grams) per serving is equal to the actual amount of protein (grams) per serving multiplied by the relative protein quality value. The relative protein quality value shall be determined by dividing the subject product's protein PER value by the PER value for casein. If the relative protein
value is above 1.00, it shall be set at 1.00.
(iii) For the purpose of labeling with a percent of the DRV or RDI, a value of 50 grams of protein shall be the DRV for adults and children 4 or more years of age, and the RDI for protein for children less than 4 years of age, infants, pregnant women, and lactating women shall be 16 grams, 14 grams, 60 grams, and 65 grams, respectively.
(8) Vitamins and minerals: A statement of the amount per serving of the vitamins and minerals as described in this paragraph, calculated as a percent of the RDI and expressed as percent of Daily Value.

For products represented or purported to be for use by both infants and children under 4 years of age, the percent of Daily Value shall be presented by separate declarations according to paragraph (e) of this section based on the RDI values for infants from birth to 12 months of age and for children under 4 years of age. Similarly, the percent of Daily Value based on both the RDI values for pregnant women and for lactating women shall be declared separately on products represented or purported to be for use by both pregnant and lactating women. When such dual declaration is used on any label, it shall be included in all labeling, and equal prominence shall be given to both values in all such labeling. All other products shall use the RDI for adults and children 4 or more years of age.
(ii) The declaration of vitamins and minerals as a percent of the RDI shall include vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron, in that order, and shall include any of the other vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are added, or when a claim is made about them. Other vitamins and minerals need not be declared if neither the nutrient nor the component is otherwise referred to on the label or in labeling or advertising and the vitamins and minerals are:
(A) Required or permitted in a standardized food (e.g., thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin in enriched flour) and that standardized food is included as an ingredient (i.e., component) in another product; or
(B) Included in a product solely for technological purposes and declared only in the ingredients statement. The declaration may also include any of the other vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are naturally occurring in the food. The additional vitamins and minerals shall be listed in the order established in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section.
(iii) The percentages for vitamins and minerals shall be expressed to the nearest 2-percent increment up to and including the 10-percent level, the nearest 5-percent increment above 10 percent and up to and including the 50-percent level, and the nearest 10-percent increment above the 50-percent level. Amounts of vitamins and minerals present at less than 2 percent of the RDI are not required to be declared in nutrition labeling but may be declared by a zero or by the use of an asterisk (or other symbol) that refers to another asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table and that is followed by the statement “Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).” Alternatively, if vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, or iron is present in amounts less than 2 percent of the RDI, label declaration of the nutrient(s) is not required if the statement “Not a significant source of ________ (listing the vitamins or minerals omitted)” is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values.

The caloric conversion information provided for in paragraph (d)(10) of this section may be presented beneath either side or along the full length of the nutrition label.
(ii) If the space beneath the mandatory declaration of iron is not adequate to accommodate any remaining vitamins and minerals to be declared or the information required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, the remaining information may be moved to the right and set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the percent of Daily Value information given to the left. The caloric conversion information provided for in paragraph (d)(10) of this section may be presented beneath either side or along the full length of the nutrition label.
(iii) If there is not sufficient continuous vertical space (i.e., approximately 3 inches) to accommodate the required components of the nutrition label up to and including the mandatory declaration of iron, the nutrition label may be presented in a tabular display in which the footnote required by paragraph (d)(9) of the section is given to the far right of the label, and additional vitamins and minerals beyond the four that are required (i.e., vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron) are arrayed horizontally following declarations of the required vitamins and minerals.
(12) The following sample label illustrates the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section:
EC11SE91.053
(13)(i) Nutrition labeling on the outer label of packages of poultry products that contain two or more products in the same packages (e.g., variety packs) or of packages that are used interchangeably for the same type of food (e.g., poultry salad containers) may use an aggregate display.
(ii) Aggregate displays shall comply with format requirements of paragraph
(d) of this section to the maximum extent possible, except that the identity of each food shall be specified to the right of the “Nutrition Facts” title, and both the quantitative amount by weight (i.e., g/mg amounts) and the percent Daily Value for each nutrient shall be listed in separate columns under the name of each food.
(14) When nutrition labeling appears in a second language, the nutrition information may be presented in a separate nutrition label for each language or in one nutrition label with the information in the second language following that in English. Numeric characters that are identical in both languages need not be repeated (e.g., “Protein/Proteinas 2 g”). All required information must be included in both languages.
(e) Nutrition information may be presented for two or more forms of the same product (e.g., both “raw” and “cooked”) or for common combinations of foods as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, or for different units (e.g., per 100 grams) as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, or for two or more groups for which RDI's are established (e.g., both infants and children less than 4 years of age) as provided for in paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section. When such dual labeling is provided, equal prominence shall be given to both sets of values. Information shall be presented in a format consistent with paragraph (d) of this section, except that:
(1) Following the subheading of “Amount Per Serving,” there shall be two or more column headings accurately describing the forms of the same product (e.g., “raw” and “roasted”), the combinations of foods, the units, or the RDI groups that are being declared. The column representing the product as packaged and according to the label serving size based on the Reference Amount in § 381.412(b) shall be to the left of the numeric columns.
(2) When the dual labeling is presented for two or more forms of the same product, for combinations of foods, or for different units, total calories and calories from fat (and calories from saturated fat, when declared) shall be listed in a column and indented as specified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section with quantitative amounts declared in columns aligned under the column headings set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(3) Quantitative information by weight required in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section shall be specified for the form of the product as packaged, but may be on the basis of 'as consumed' for single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, and according to the label serving size based on the Reference Amount in § 381.412(b).
(i) Quantitative information by weight may be included for other forms of the product represented by the additional column(s) either immediately adjacent to the required quantitative information by weight for the product as packaged, but may be on the basis of 'as consumed' for single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, and according to the label serving size based on the Reference Amount in § 381.412(b) or as a footnote.
(A) If such additional quantitative information is given immediately adjacent to the required quantitative information, it shall be declared for all nutrients listed and placed immediately following and differentiated from the required quantitative information (e.g., separated by a comma). Such information shall not be put in a separate column.
(B) If such additional quantitative information is given in a footnote, it shall be declared in the same order as the nutrients are listed in the nutrition label. The additional quantitative information may state the total nutrient content of the product identified in the second column or the nutrient amounts added to the product as packaged, but may be on the basis of 'as consumed' for single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, for only those nutrients that are present in different amounts than the amounts declared in the required quantitative information. The footnote shall clearly identify which
amounts are declared. Any subcomponents declared shall be listed parenthetically after principal components (e.g.,
1/2
cup skim milk contributes an additional 40 calories, 65 mg sodium, 6 g total carbohydrate (6 g sugars), and 4 g protein).
(ii) Total fat and its quantitative amount by weight shall be followed by an asterisk (or other symbol) (e.g., “Total fat (2 g)*”) referring to another asterisk (or symbol) at the bottom of the nutrition label identifying the form(s) of the product for which quantitative information is presented.
(4) Information required in paragraphs (d)(7)(ii) and (d)(8) of this section shall be presented under the subheading “% DAILY VALUE” and in columns directly under the column headings set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(5) The following sample label illustrates the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section:
EC11SE91.054
(f)(1) Nutrition information may be presented in a simplified format as set forth herein when any required nutrients, other than the core nutrients (i.e., calories, total fat, sodium, total carbohydrate, and protein), are present in insignificant amounts. An insignificant amount shall be defined as that
amount that may be rounded to zero in nutrition labeling, except that for total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars and protein, it shall be an amount less than 1 gram.
(2) The simplified format shall include information on the following nutrients:
(i) Total calories, total fat, total carbohydrate, sodium, and protein;
(ii) Any of the following that are present in more than insignificant amounts: Calories from fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, dietary fiber, sugars, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron; and
(iii) Any vitamins and minerals listed in paragraph (c)(8)(iv) of this section when they are added in fortified or fabricated foods.
(3) Other nutrients that are naturally present in the product in more than insignificant amounts may be voluntarily declared as part of the simplified format.
(4) Any required nutrient, other than a core nutrient, that is present in an insignificant amount may be omitted from the tabular listing, provided that the following statement is included at the bottom of the nutrition label, “Not a significant source of ________.” The blank shall be filled in with the appropriate nutrient or food component. Alternatively, amounts of vitamins and minerals present in insignificant amounts may be declared by the use of an asterisk (or symbol) that is placed at the bottom of the table of nutrient values and that is followed by the statement “Contains less than 2 percent of the Daily Value of this (these) nutrient (nutrients).”
(5) Except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section and in § 381.500(c) and (d), nutrient information declared in the simplified format shall be presented in the same manner as specified in paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, except that the footnote required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section is not required. When the footnote is omitted, an asterisk shall be placed at the bottom of the label followed by the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet” and, if the term “Daily Value” is not spelled out in the heading, a statement that “DV” represents “Daily Value.”
(g) Foods in packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches may modify the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section and § 381.402(a) by one or more of the following means:
(1)(i) Presenting the required nutrition information in a tabular or linear (i.e., string) fashion, rather than in vertical columns if the product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches, or if the product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches and the package shape or size cannot accommodate a standard vertical column or tabular display on any label panel. Nutrition information may be given in a linear fashion only if the package shape or size will not accommodate a tabular display.
(ii) When nutrition information is given in a linear display, the nutrition information shall be set off in a box by the use of a hairline. The percent Daily Value is separated from the quantitative amount declaration by the use of parenthesis, and all nutrients, both principal components and subcomponents, are treated similarly. Bolding is required only on the title “Nutrition Facts” and is allowed for nutrient names for “Calories,” “Total fat,” “Cholesterol,” “Sodium,” “Total carbohydrate,” and “Protein.”
(2) Using any of the following abbreviations:
Serving size—Serv size
Servings per container—Servings
Calories from fat—Fat cal
Calories from saturated fat—Sat fat cal
Saturated fat—Sat fat
Monounsaturated fat—Monounsat fat
Polyunsaturated fat—Polyunsat fat
Cholesterol—Cholest
Total carbohydrate—Total carb
Dietary fiber—Fiber
Soluble fiber—Sol fiber
Insoluble fiber—Insol fiber
Sugar alcohol—Sugar alc
Other carbohydrate—Other carb
(3) Omitting the footnote required in paragraph (d)(9) of this section and placing another asterisk at the bottom of the label followed by the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet” and, if the term “Daily Value” is not spelled out in the
heading, a statement that “DV” represents “Daily Value.”
(4) Presenting the required information on any other label panel.
(h) Compliance with this section shall be determined as follows:
(1) A production lot is a set of food production consumer units that are from one production shift. Alternatively, a collection of consumer units of the same size, type, and style produced under conditions as nearly uniform as possible, designated by a common container code or marking, constitutes a production lot.
(2) The sample for nutrient analysis shall consist of a composite of a minimum of six consumer units, each from a production lot. Alternatively, the sample for nutrient analysis shall consist of a composite of a minimum of six consumer units, each randomly chosen to be representative of a production lot. In each case, the units may be individually analyzed and the results of the analyses averaged, or the units would be composited and the composite analyzed. In both cases, the results, whether an average or a single result from a composite, will be considered by the Agency to be the nutrient content of a composite. All analyses shall be performed by appropriate methods and procedures used by the Department for each nutrient in accordance with the “Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook,” or, if no USDA method is available and appropriate for the nutrient, by appropriate methods for the nutrient in accordance with the 1990 edition of the “Official Methods of Analysis” of the AOAC International, formerly Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 15th ed., which is incorporated by reference, unless a particular method of analysis is specified in § 381.409(c), or, if no USDA, AOAC, or specified method is available and appropriate, by other reliable and appropriate analytical procedures as so determined by the Agency. The “Official Methods of Analysis” is incorporated as it exists on the date of approval. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be purchased from the AOAC International, 2200 Wilson Blvd., Suite 400, Arlington, VA 22201. It is also available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:
http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.
(3) Two classes of nutrients are defined for purposes of compliance:
(i) Class I. Added nutrients in fortified or fabricated foods; and
(ii) Class II. Naturally occurring (indigenous) nutrients. If any ingredient which contains a naturally occurring (indigenous) nutrient is added to a food, the total amount of such nutrient in the final food product is subject to Class II requirements unless the same nutrient is also added, which would make the total amount of such nutrient subject to Class I requirements.
(4) A product with a label declaration of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or potassium shall be deemed to be misbranded under section 4(h) of the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 453(h)(4)) unless it meets the following requirements:
(i) Class I vitamin, mineral, protein, dietary fiber, or potassium. The nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to the value for that nutrient declared on the label.
(ii) Class II vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or potassium. The nutrient content of the composite is at least equal to 80 percent of the value for that nutrient declared on the label;
Provided,
That no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value which falls below this level by an amount less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that product at the level involved, and inherent nutrient variation in a product.
(5) A product with a label declaration of calories, sugars, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium shall be deemed to be misbranded under section 4(h) of the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 453(h)(4)) if the nutrient content of the composite is greater
than 20 percent in excess of the value for that nutrient declared on the label;
Provided,
That no regulatory action will be based on a determination of a nutrient value which falls above this level by an amount less than the variability generally recognized for the analytical method used in that product at the level involved, and inherent nutrient variation in a product.
(6) The amount of a vitamin, mineral, protein, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, other carbohydrate, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat, or potassium may vary over labeled amounts within good manufacturing practice. The amount of calories, sugars, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium may vary under labeled amounts within good manufacturing practice.
(7) Compliance will be based on the metric measure specified in the label statement of serving size.
(8) The management of the establishment must maintain records to support the validity of nutrient declarations contained on product labels. Such records shall be made available to the inspector or any duly authorized representative of the Agency upon request.
(9) The compliance provisions set forth in paragraph (h)(1) through (8) of this section shall not apply to single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401, including those that have been previously frozen, when nutrition labeling is based on the most current representative data base values contained in USDA's National Nutrient Data Bank or its released form, the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, as provided in § 381.445(e) and (f).

§§ 381.410-381.411
[Reserved]
§ 381.412
Reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion.
(a) The general principles followed in arriving at the reference amounts customarily consumed per eating occasion (Reference Amount(s)), as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, are:
(1) The Reference Amounts are calculated for persons 4 years of age or older to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by persons in this population group. These Reference Amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys.
(2) The Reference Amounts are calculated for an infant or child under 4 years of age to reflect the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion by infants up to 12 months of age or by children 1 through 3 years of age, respectively. These Reference Amounts are based on data set forth in appropriate national food consumption surveys. Such Reference Amounts are to be used only when the product is specially formulated or processed for use by an infant or by a child under 4 years of age.
(3) An appropriate national food consumption survey includes a large sample size representative of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the relevant population group and must be based on consumption data under actual conditions of use.
(4) To determine the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion, the mean, median, and mode of the consumed amount per eating occasion were considered.
(5) When survey data were insufficient, FSIS took various other sources of information on serving sizes of food into consideration. These other sources of information included:
(i) Serving sizes used in dietary guidance recommendations or recommended by other authoritative systems or organizations;
(ii) Serving sizes recommended in comments;
(iii) Serving sizes used by manufacturers and grocers; and
(iv) Serving sizes used by other countries.
(6) Because they reflect the amount customarily consumed, the Reference Amount and, in turn, the serving size declared on the product label are based on only the edible portion of food, and not bone, seed, shell, or other inedible components.
(7) The Reference Amount is based on the major intended use of the product (e.g., a mixed dish measurable with a cup as a main dish and not as a side dish).
(8) The Reference Amounts for products that are consumed as an ingredient of other products, but that may also be consumed in the form in which they are purchased (e.g., ground poultry), are based on use in the form purchased.
(9) FSIS sought to ensure that foods that have similar dietary usage, product characteristics, and customarily consumed amounts have a uniform Reference Amount.
(b) The following Product Categories and Reference Amounts shall be used as the basis for determining serving sizes for specific products:

These values represent the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion and were primarily derived from the 1977-1978 and the 1987-1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Surveys conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
2
Unless otherwise noted in the Reference Amount column, the Reference Amounts are for the ready-to-serve or almost ready-to-serve form of the product (i.e., heat and serve). If not listed separately, the Reference Amount for the unprepared form (e.g., dehydrated cereal) is the amount required to make one Reference Amount of the prepared form.
3
Manufacturers are required to convert the Reference Amount to the label serving size in a household measure most appropriate to their specific product using the procedures established by the regulation.

These values represent the amount of food customarily consumed per eating occasion and were primarily derived from the 1977-78 and the 1987-88 Nationwide Food Consumption Surveys conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
2
Manufacturers are required to convert the Reference Amounts to the label serving size in a household measure most appropriate to their specific product using the procedures established by regulation.
3
Examples listed under Product Category are not all inclusive or exclusive. Examples are provided to assist manufacturers in identifying appropriate product Reference Amount.
4
If packed or canned in liquid, the Reference Amount is for the drained solids, except for products in which both the solids and liquids are customarily consumed.
5
Pizza sauce is part of the pizza and is not considered to be a sauce topping.
(c) For products that have no Reference Amount listed in paragraph (b) of this section for the unprepared or the prepared form of the product and that consist of two or more foods packaged and presented to be consumed together (e.g., poultry lunch meat with cheese and crackers), the Reference Amount for the combined product shall be determined using the following rules:
(1) For bulk products, the Reference Amount for the combined product shall be the Reference Amount, as established in paragraph (b) of this section, for the ingredient that is represented as the main ingredient plus proportioned amounts of all minor ingredients.
(2) For products where the ingredient represented as the main ingredient is one or more discrete units, the Reference Amount for the combined product shall be either the number of small discrete units or the fraction of the large discrete unit that is represented as the main ingredient that is closest to the Reference Amount for that ingredient as established in paragraph (b) of this section plus proportioned amounts of all minor ingredients.
(3) If the Reference Amounts are in compatible units, they shall be summed (e.g., ingredients in equal volumes such as tablespoons). If the Reference Amounts are in incompatible units, the weights of the appropriate volumes should be used (e.g., grams of one ingredient plus gram weight of tablespoons of a second ingredient).
(d) If a product requires further preparation, e.g., cooking or the addition of water or other ingredients, and if paragraph (b) of this section provides a Reference Amount for the product in the prepared form, then the Reference Amount for the unprepared product shall be determined using the following rules:
(1) Except as provided for in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Reference Amount for the unprepared product shall be the amount of the unprepared product required to make the Reference Amount for the prepared product as established in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) For products where the entire contents of the package is used to prepare one large discrete unit usually divided for consumption, the Reference Amount for the unprepared product shall be the amount of the unprepared product required to make the fraction of the large discrete unit closest to the Reference Amount for the prepared product as established in paragraph (b) of this section.
(e) The Reference Amount for an imitation or substitute product or altered product as defined in § 381.413(d), such as a “low calorie” version, shall be the
same as for the product for which it is offered as a substitute.
(f) The Reference Amounts set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section shall be used in determining whether a product meets the criteria for nutritional claims. If the serving size declared on the product label differs from the Reference Amount, and the product meets the criteria for the claim only on the basis of the Reference Amount, the claim shall be followed by a statement that sets forth the basis on which the claim is made. That statement shall include the Reference Amount as it appears in paragraph (b) of this section followed, in parenthesis, by the amount in common household measure if the Reference Amount is expressed in measures other than common household measures.
(g) The Administrator, on his or her own initiative or on behalf of any interested person who has submitted a labeling application, may issue a proposal to establish or amend a Product Category or Reference Amount identified in paragraph (b) of this section.
(1) Labeling applications and supporting documentation to be filed under this section shall be submitted in quadruplicate, except that the supporting documentation may be submitted on a computer disc copy. If any part of the material submitted is in a foreign language, it shall be accompanied by an accurate and complete English translation. The labeling application shall state the applicant's post office address.
(2) Pertinent information will be considered as part of an application on the basis of specific reference to such information submitted to and retained in the files of the Food Safety and Inspection Service. However, any reference to unpublished information furnished by a person other than the applicant will not be considered unless use of such information is authorized (with the understanding that such information may in whole or part be subject to release to the public) in a written statement signed by the person who submitted it. Any reference to published information should be accompanied by reprints or photostatic copies of such references.
(3) The availability for public disclosure of labeling applications, along with supporting documentation, submitted to the Agency under this section will be governed by the rules specified in subchapter D, title 9.
(4) Data accompanying the labeling application, such as food consumption data, shall be submitted on separate sheets, suitably identified. If such data has already been submitted with an earlier labeling application from the applicant, the present labeling application must provide the data.
(5) The labeling application must be signed by the applicant or by his or her attorney or agent, or (if a corporation) by an authorized official.
(6) The labeling application shall include a statement signed by the person responsible for the labeling application, that to the best of his or her knowledge, it is a representative and balanced submission that includes unfavorable information, as well as favorable information, known to him or her pertinent to the evaluation of the labeling application.
(7) Labeling applications for a new Reference Amount and/or Product Category shall be accompanied by the following data which shall be submitted in the following form to the Director, Food Labeling Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, Washington, DC 20250:
(Date)
The undersigned, ____________ submits this labeling application pursuant to 9 CFR 381.412 with respect to Reference Amount and/or Product Category.
Attached hereto, in quadruplicate, or on a computer disc copy, and constituting a part of this labeling application, are the following:
(i) A statement of the objective of the labeling application;
(ii) A description of the product;
(iii) A complete sample product label including nutrition label, using the format established by regulation;
(iv) A description of the form in which the product will be marketed;
(v) The intended dietary uses of the product with the major use identified (e.g., turkey as a luncheon meat);
(vi) If the intended use is primarily as an ingredient in other foods, list of foods or food categories in which the product will be used as an ingredient with information on the prioritization of the use;
(vii) The population group for which the product will be offered for use (e.g., infants, children under 4 years of age);
(viii) The names of the most closely-related products (or in the case of foods for special dietary use and imitation or substitute foods, the names of the products for which they are offered as substitutes);
(ix) The suggested Reference Amount (the amount of edible portion of food as consumed, excluding bone, skin or other inedible components) for the population group for which the product is intended with full description of the methodology and procedures that were used to determine the suggested Reference Amount. In determining the Reference Amount, general principles and factors in paragraph (a) of this section should be followed.
(x) The suggested Reference Amount shall be expressed in metric units. Reference Amounts for foods shall be expressed in grams except when common household units such as cups, tablespoons, and teaspoons are more appropriate or are more likely to promote uniformity in serving sizes declared on product labels. For example, common household measures would be more appropriate if products within the same category differ substantially in density such as mixed dishes measurable with a cup.
(A) In expressing the Reference Amount in grams, the following general rules shall be followed:
(
1
) For quantities greater than 10 grams, the quantity shall be expressed in nearest 5 grams increment.
(
2
) For quantities less than 10 grams, exact gram weights shall be used.
(B) [Reserved]
(xi) A labeling application for a new subcategory of food with its own Reference Amount shall include the following additional information:
(A) Data that demonstrate that the new subcategory of food will be consumed in amounts that differ enough from the Reference Amount for the parent category to warrant a separate Reference Amount. Data must include sample size, and the mean, standard deviation, median, and modal consumed amount per eating occasion for the product identified in the labeling application and for other products in the category. All data must be derived from the same survey data.
(B) Documentation supporting the difference in dietary usage and product characteristics that affect the consumption size that distinguishes the product identified in the labeling application from the rest of the products in the category.
(xii) In conducting research to collect or process food consumption data in support of the labeling application, the following general guidelines should be followed.
(A) Sampled population selected should be representative of the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the target population group for which the food is intended.
(B) Sample size (i.e., number of eaters) should be large enough to give reliable estimates for customarily consumed amounts.
(C) The study protocol should identify potential biases and describe how potential biases are controlled for or, if not possible to control, how they affect interpretation of results.
(D) The methodology used to collect or process data including study design, sampling procedures, materials used (e.g., questionnaire, interviewer's manual), procedures used to collect or process data, methods or procedures used to control for unbiased estimates, and procedures used to correct for nonresponse, should be fully documented.

§ 381.413
Nutrient content claims; general principles.
(a) This section applies to poultry products that are intended for human consumption and that are offered for sale.
(b) A claim which, expressly or by implication, characterizes the level of a nutrient (nutrient content claim) of the type required in nutrition labeling pursuant to § 381.409, may not be made on a label or in labeling of that product unless the claim is made in accordance with the applicable provisions in this subpart.
(1) An expressed nutrient content claim is any direct statement about the level (or range) of a nutrient in the product, e.g., “low sodium” or “contains 100 calories.”
(2) An implied nutrient content claim is any claim that:
(i) Describes the product or an ingredient therein in a manner that suggests that a nutrient is absent or present in a certain amount (e.g., “high in oat bran”); or
(ii) Suggests that the product, because of its nutrient content, may be useful in maintaining healthy dietary practices and is made in association with an explicit claim or statement about a nutrient (e.g., “healthy, contains 3 grams (g) of fat”).
(3) Except for claims regarding vitamins and minerals described in paragraph (q)(3) of this section, no nutrient content claims may be made on products intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age unless the claim is specifically provided for in subpart Y of this part.
(4) Reasonable variations in the spelling of the terms defined in applicable provisions in this subpart and their synonyms are permitted provided these variations are not misleading (e.g., “hi” or “lo”).
(c) Information that is required or permitted by § 381.409 to be declared in nutrition labeling, and that appears as part of the nutrition label, is not a nutrient content claim and is not subject to the requirements of this section. If such information is declared elsewhere on the label or in labeling, it is a nutrient content claim and is subject to the requirements for nutrient content claims.
(d) A “substitute” product is one that may be used interchangeably with another product that it resembles, i.e., that it is organoleptically, physically, and functionally (including shelf life) similar to, and that it is not nutritionally inferior to unless it is labeled as an “imitation.”
(1) If there is a difference in performance characteristics that materially limits the use of the product, the product may still be considered a substitute if the label includes a disclaimer adjacent to the most prominent claim as defined in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section, informing the consumer of such difference (e.g., “not recommended for frying”).
(2) This disclaimer shall be in easily legible print or type and in a size no less than that required by § 381.121(c) for the net quantity of contents statement, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclaimer statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than
1/16
-inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 381.500(d)(2).
(e)(1) Because the use of a “free” or “low” claim before the name of a product implies that the product differs from other products of the same type by virtue of its having a lower amount of the nutrient, only products that have been specially processed, altered, formulated, or reformulated so as to lower the amount of the nutrient in the product, remove the nutrient from the product, or not include the nutrient in the product, may bear such a claim (e.g., “low sodium chicken noodle soup”).
(2) Any claim for the absence of a nutrient in a product, or that a product is low in a nutrient when the product has not been specially processed, altered,
formulated, or reformulated to qualify for that claim shall indicate that the product inherently meets the criteria and shall clearly refer to all products of that type and not merely to the particular brand to which the labeling attaches (e.g., “chicken breast meat, a low sodium food”).
(f) A nutrient content claim shall be in type size and style no larger than two times that of the statement of identity and shall not be unduly prominent in type style compared to the statement of identity.
(g) Labeling information required in §§ 381.413, 381.454, 381.456, 381.460, 381.461, 381.462, and 381.480, whose type size is not otherwise specified, is required to be in letters and/or numbers no less than
1/16
inch in height, except as permitted by § 381.500(d)(2).
(h) [Reserved]
(i) Except as provided in § 381.409 or in paragraph (q)(3) of this section, the label or labeling of a product may contain a statement about the amount or percentage of a nutrient if:
(1) The use of the statement on the product implicitly characterizes the level of the nutrient in the product and is consistent with a definition for a claim, as provided in subpart Y of this part, for the nutrient that the label addresses. Such a claim might be, “less than 10 g of fat per serving;”
(2) The use of the statement on the product implicitly characterizes the level of the nutrient in the product and is not consistent with such a definition, but the label carries a disclaimer adjacent to the statement that the product is not “low” in or a “good source” of the nutrient, such as “only 200 milligrams (mg) sodium per serving, not a low sodium product.” The disclaimer must be in easily legible print or type and in a size no less than required by § 381.121(c) for the net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the disclaimer statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than
1/16
-inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 381.500(d)(2);
(3) The statement does not in any way implicitly characterize the level of the nutrient in the product and it is not false or misleading in any respect (e.g., “100 calories” or “5 grams of fat”), in which case no disclaimer is required.
(4) “Percent fat free” claims are not authorized by this paragraph. Such claims shall comply with § 381.462(b)(6).
(j) A product may bear a statement that compares the level of a nutrient in the product with the level of a nutrient in a reference product. These statements shall be known as “relative claims” and include “light,” “reduced,” “less” (or “fewer”), and “more” claims.
(1) To bear a relative claim about the level of a nutrient, the amount of that nutrient in the product must be compared to an amount of nutrient in an appropriate reference product as specified in this paragraph (j).
(i)(A) For “less” (or “fewer”) and “more” claims, the reference product may be a dissimilar product within a product category that can generally be substituted for one another in the diet or a similar product.
(B) For “light,” “reduced,” and “added” claims, the reference product shall be a similar product, and
(ii)(A) For “light” claims, the reference product shall be representative of the type of product that includes the product that bears the claim. The nutrient value for the reference product shall be representative of a broad base of products of that type; e.g., a value in a representative, valid data base; an average value determined from the top three national (or regional) brands, a market basket norm; or, where its nutrient value is representative of the product type, a market leader. Firms using such a reference nutrient value as a basis for a claim, are required to provide specific information upon which the nutrient value was derived, on request, to consumers and appropriate regulatory officials.
(B) For relative claims other than “light,” including “less” and “more” claims, the reference product may be the same as that provided for “light” in paragraph (j)(1)(ii)(A) of this section or it may be the manufacturer's regular product, or that of another manufacturer, that has been offered for sale to the public on a regular basis for a
substantial period of time in the same geographic area by the same business entity or by one entitled to use its trade name, provided the name of the competitor is not used on the labeling of the product. The nutrient values used to determine the claim when comparing a single manufacturer's product to the labeled product shall be either the values declared in nutrition labeling or the actual nutrient values, provided that the resulting labeling is internally consistent (i.e., that the values stated in the nutrition information, the nutrient values in the accompanying information, and the declaration of the percentage of nutrient by which the product has been modified are consistent and will not cause consumer confusion when compared), and that the actual modification is at least equal to the percentage specified in the definition of the claim.
(2) For products bearing relative claims:
(i) The label or labeling must state the identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) of the amount of the nutrient in the reference product by which the nutrient has been modified, (e.g., “50 percent less fat than ‘reference product’ ” or “
1/3
fewer calories than ‘reference product’ ”); and
(ii) This information shall be immediately adjacent to the most prominent claim in easily legible boldface print or type, in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, that is no less than that required by § 381.121(c) for net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the referral statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim, but no smaller than
1/16
-inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 381.500(d)(2).
(iii) The determination of which use of the claim is in the most prominent location on the label or labeling will be made based on the following factors, considered in order:
(A) A claim on the principal display panel adjacent to the statement of identity;
(B) A claim elsewhere on the principal display panel;
(C) A claim on the information panel; or
(D) A claim elsewhere on the label or labeling.
(iv) The label or labeling must also bear:
(A) Clear and concise quantitative information comparing the amount of the subject nutrient in the product per labeled serving size with that in the reference product; and
(B) This statement shall appear adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information.
(3) A relative claim for decreased levels of a nutrient may not be made on the label or in labeling of a product if the nutrient content of the reference product meets the requirement for a “low” claim for that nutrient.
(k) The term “modified” may be used in the statement of identity of a product that bears a relative claim that complies with the requirements of this part, followed immediately by the name of the nutrient whose content has been altered (e.g., “modified fat ‘product’ ”). This statement of identity must be immediately followed by the comparative statement such as “contains 35 percent less fat than ‘reference product’ ” The label or labeling must also bear the information required by paragraph (j)(2) of this section in the manner prescribed.
(l) For purposes of making a claim, a “meal-type” product will be defined as a product that:
(1) Makes a major contribution to the diet by:
(i) Weighing at least 10 ounces per labeled serving; and
(ii) Containing not less than three 40 gram portions of food, or combinations of foods, from two or more of the following four food groups, except as noted in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(E) of this section:
(A) Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta;
(B) Fruits and vegetables;
(C) Milk, yogurt, and cheese;
(D) Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts; except that:
(E) These foods will not be sauces (except for foods in the four food groups in paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, that are in
the sauces), gravies, condiments, relishes, pickles, olives, jams, jellies, syrups, breadings, or garnishes; and
(2) Is represented as, or is in the form commonly understood to be, a breakfast, lunch, dinner, meal, or entrèe. Such representations may be made by statements, photographs, or vignettes.
(m) For purposes of making a claim, a “main-dish” product will be defined as a food that:
(1) Makes a major contribution to the meal by:
(i) Weighing at least 6 ounces per labeled serving; and
(ii) Containing not less than 40 grams of food, or combinations of foods, from two or more of the following four food groups, except as noted in paragraph (m)(1)Iii)(E) of this section.
(A) Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta;
(B) Fruits and vegetables;
(C) Milk, yogurt, and cheese;
(D) Meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts; except that:
(E) These foods will not be sauces (except for foods in the four food groups in paragraph (m)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, that are in the sauces), gravies, condiments, relishes, pickles, olives, jams, jellies, syrups, breadings, or garnishes; and
(2) Is represented as, or is in a form commonly understood to be, a main dish (
e.g.
, not a beverage or a dessert). Such representations may be made by statements, photographs, or vignettes.
(n) Nutrition labeling in accordance with § 381.409 shall be provided for any food for which a nutrient content claim is made.
(o) Compliance with requirements for nutrient content claims shall be in accordance with § 381.409(h).
(p)(1) Unless otherwise specified, the reference amount customarily consumed set forth in § 381.412(b) through (e) shall be used in determining whether a product meets the criteria for a nutrient content claim. If the serving size declared on the product label differs from the reference amount customarily consumed, and the amount of the nutrient contained in the labeled serving does not meet the maximum or minimum amount criterion in the definition for the descriptor for that nutrient, the claim shall be followed by the criteria for the claim as required by § 381.412(f) (e.g., “very low sodium, 35 mg or less per 55 grams”).
(2) The criteria for the claim shall be immediately adjacent to the most prominent claim in easily legible print or type and in a size that is no less than that required by § 381.121(c) for net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement, in which case the criteria statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than 1/16-inch minimum height, except as permitted by § 381.500(d)(2).
(q) The following exemptions apply:
(1) Nutrient content claims that have not been defined by regulation and that appear as part of a brand name that was in use prior to November 27, 1991, may continue to be used as part of that brand name, provided they are not false or misleading under section 4(h) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 453(h)(4)).
(2) [Reserved]
(3) A statement that describes the percentage of a vitamin or mineral in the food, including foods intended specifically for use by infants and children less than 2 years of age, in relation to a Reference Daily Intake (RDI) as defined in § 381.409 may be made on the label or in the labeling of a food without a regulation authorizing such a claim for a specific vitamin or mineral.
(4) The requirements of this section do not apply to infant formulas and medical foods, as described in 21 CFR 101.13(q)(4).
(5) [Reserved]
(6) Nutrient content claims that were part of the name of a product that was subject to a standard of identity as of November 27, 1991, are not subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section whether or not they meet the definition of the descriptive term.
(7) Implied nutrient content claims may be used as part of a brand name, provided that the use of the claim has been authorized by FSIS. Labeling applications requesting approval of such
a claim may be submitted pursuant to § 381.469.

[Reserved]
§ 381.444
Identification of major cuts of poultry products.
The major cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry products are: Whole chicken (without neck and giblets), chicken breast, chicken wing, chicken drumstick, chicken thigh, whole turkey (without necks and giblets; separate nutrient panels for white and dark meat permitted as an option), turkey breast, turkey wing, turkey drumstick, and turkey thigh.
§ 381.445
Nutrition labeling of single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped products described in § 381.401.
(a)(1) Nutrition information on the major cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry products identified in § 381.444, including those that have been previously frozen, is required, either on their label or at their point-of-purchase, unless exempted under § 381.500. If nutrition information is presented on the label, it must be provided in accordance with the provisions of § 381.409. If nutrition information is presented at the point-of-purchase, it must be provided in accordance with the provisions of this section.
(2) Nutrition information on single-ingredient, raw poultry products that are not ground or chopped poultry products described in § 381.401 and are not major cuts of single-ingredient, raw poultry products identified in § 381.444, including those that have been previously frozen, may be provided at their point-of-purchase in accordance with the provisions of this section or on their label, in accordance with the provisions of § 381.409.
(3) A retailer may provide nutrition information at the point-of-purchase by various methods, such as by posting a sign or by making the information readily available in brochures, notebooks, or leaflet form in close proximity to the food. The nutrition labeling information may also be supplemented by a video, live demonstration, or other media. If a nutrition claim is made on point-of-purchase materials, all of the format and content requirements of § 381.409 apply. However, if only nutrition information—and not a nutrition claim—is supplied on point-of-purchase materials, the requirements of § 381.409 apply, provided, however:
(i) The listing of percent of Daily Value for the nutrients (except vitamins and minerals specified in § 381.409(c)(8)) and footnote required by § 381.409(d)(9) may be omitted; and
(ii) The point-of-purchase materials are not subject to any of the format requirements.
(b) [Reserved]
(c) For the point-of-purchase materials, the declaration of nutrition information may be presented in a simplified format as specified in § 381.409(f).
(d) The nutrition label data for products covered in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) must be based on either raw or cooked edible portions of poultry cuts with skin. If data are based on cooked portions, the methods used to cook the products must be specified and for products covered in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) must be those which do not add nutrients from other ingredients such as flour, breading, and salt. Additional nutritional data may be presented on an optional basis for the raw or cooked edible portions of the skinless poultry meat.
(e) Nutrient data that are the most current representative data base values contained in USDA's National Nutrient Data Bank or its released form, the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, may be used for nutrition labeling of single-ingredient, raw poultry products, including those that have been previously frozen. These data may be composite data that reflect different classes of turkey or other variables affecting nutrient content. Alternatively, data that reflect specific classes or other variables may be used, except that if data are used on labels attached to a product which is labeled as to class of poultry or other variables, the data must represent the product in the package when such data are contained in the representative
data base. When data are used on labels attached to a product, the data must represent the edible poultry tissues present in the package.
(f) If the nutrition information is provided in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, a nutrition label or labeling will not be subject to the Agency compliance review under § 381.409(h), unless a nutrition claim is made on the basis of the representative data base values.
(g) Retailers may use data bases that they believe reflect the nutrient content of single-ingredient, raw poultry products, including those that have been previously frozen; however, such labeling shall be subject to the compliance procedures of paragraph (e) of this section and the requirements specified in this subpart for the mandatory nutrition labeling program.

§§ 381.446-381.453
[Reserved]
§ 381.454
Nutrient content claims for “good source,” “high,” and “more.”
(a)
General requirements.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a claim about the level of a nutrient in a product in relation to the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) or Daily Reference Value (DRV), established for that nutrient (excluding total carbohydrate) in § 381.409(c), may only be made on the label or in labeling of the product if:
(1) The claim uses one of the terms defined in this section in accordance with the definition for that term;
(2) The claim is made in accordance with the general requirements for nutrient content claims in § 381.413; and
(3) The product for which the claim is made is labeled in accordance with § 381.409.
(b)
“High” claims.
(1) The terms “high,” “rich in,” or “excellent source of” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that the product contains 20 percent or more of the RDI or the DRV per reference amount customarily consumed.
(2) The terms defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:
(i) The product contains a food that meets the definition of “high” in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
(ii) The label or labeling clearly identifies the food that is the subject of the claim (e.g., “the serving of broccoli in this meal is high in vitamin C”).
(c)
“Good Source” claims.
(1) The terms “good source,” “contains,” or “provides” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as described in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 317.313(m), provided that the product contains 10 to 19 percent of the RDI or the DRV per reference amount customarily consumed.
(2) The terms defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:
(i) The product contains a food that meets the definition of “good source” in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and
(ii) The label or labeling clearly identifies the food that is the subject of the claim (e.g., “the serving of sweet potatoes in this meal is a good source of fiber”).
(d)
Fiber claims.
(1) If a nutrient content claim is made with respect to the level of dietary fiber, i.e., that the product is high in fiber, a good source of fiber, or that the product contains “more” fiber, and the product is not “low” in total fat as defined in § 381.462(b)(2) or, in the case of a meal-type product or in a main-dish product, is not “low” in total fat as defined in § 381.462(b)(3), then the labeling shall disclose the level of total fat per labeled serving size (e.g., “contains 12 grams (g) of fat per serving”); and
(2) The disclosure shall appear in immediate proximity to such claim and be in a type size no less than one-half the size of the claim.
(e)
“More” claims.
(1) A relative claim using the terms “more” and “added” may be used on the label or in labeling
to describe the level of protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, or potassium in a product, except meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:
(i) The product contains at least 10 percent more of the RDI or the DRV for protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, or potassium (expressed as a percent of the Daily Value) per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); and
(ii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:
(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the nutrient is greater relative to the RDI or DRV are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “contains 10 percent more of the Daily Value for fiber than ‘reference product’ ”); and
(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “fiber content of ‘reference product’ is 1 g per serving; ‘this product’ contains 4 g per serving”).
(2) A relative claim using the terms “more” and “added” may be used on the label or in labeling to describe the level of protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, or potassium in meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:
(i) The product contains at least 10 percent more of the RDI or the DRV for protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, or potassium (expressed as a percent of the Daily Value) per 100 g of product than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); and
(ii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:
(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the nutrient is greater relative to the RDI or DRV are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “contains 10 percent more of the Daily Value for fiber per 3 ounces (oz) than does ‘reference product’ ”), and
(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the meal-type product or in a main-dish product per specified weight with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “fiber content of ‘reference product’ is 2 g per 3 oz; ‘this product’ contains 5 g per 3 oz”).

(B) The accompanying statement is no less than one-half the type size of the “light” or “lite” claim.
(2)(i) The terms “light in sodium” or “lite in sodium” may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish product as defined in
§ 381.413(m), provided that the product meets the definition of “low in sodium” as defined in § 381.461(b)(5)(i); and
(ii) “Light” or “lite” and “in sodium” are presented in uniform type size, style, color, and prominence.
(3) The terms “light” or “lite” may be used in the brand name of a product to describe the sodium content, provided that:

(A) Contiguous to the brand name; and
(B) In uniform type size, style, color, and prominence as the product name; and
(iii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:
(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sodium was reduced are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim; and
(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of sodium per labeled serving size with that of the reference product it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information.
(e) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the terms “light” or “lite” may not be used to refer to a product that is not reduced in fat by 50 percent, or, if applicable, in calories by
1/3
or, when properly qualified, in sodium by 50 percent unless:
(1) It describes some physical or organoleptic attribute of the product such as texture or color and the information (e.g., “light in color” or “light in texture”) so stated, clearly conveys the nature of the product; and
(2) The attribute (e.g., “color” or “texture”) is in the same style, color, and at least one-half the type size as the word “light” and in immediate proximity thereto.
(f) If a manufacturer can demonstrate that the word “light” has been associated, through common use, with a particular product to reflect a physical or organoleptic attribute to the point where it has become part of the statement of identity, such use of the term “light” shall not be considered a nutrient content claim subject to the requirements in this part.
(g) The term “lightly salted” may be used on a product to which has been added 50 percent less sodium than is normally added to the reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1)(i)(B) and (j)(1)(ii)(B), provided that if the product is not “low in sodium” as defined in § 381.461(b)(4), the statement “not a low sodium food,” shall appear adjacent to the nutrition information and the information required to accompany a relative claim shall appear on the label or labeling as specified in § 381.413(j)(2).

1/3
percent fewer calories than our regular ‘product’ ”); and
(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of calories in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “calorie content has been reduced from 150 to 100 calories per serving”).
(iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section may not be made on the label or in labeling of products if the reference product meets the definition for “low calorie.”
(5) The terms defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:

is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “calorie content has been reduced from 110 calories per 3 oz to 80 calories per 3 oz”).
(iii) Claims described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section may not be made on the label or in labeling of products if the reference product meets the definition for “low calorie.”
(c)
Sugar content claims.
(1) Terms such as “sugar free,” “free of sugar,” “no sugar,” “zero sugar,” “without sugar,” “sugarless,” “trivial source of sugar,” “negligible source of sugar,” or “dietarily insignificant source of sugar” may reasonably be expected to be regarded by consumers as terms that represent that the product contains no sugars or sweeteners, e.g., “sugar free,” or “no sugar,” as indicating a product which is low in calories or significantly reduced in calories. Consequently, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a product may not be labeled with such terms unless:
(i) The product contains less than 0.5 g of sugars, as defined in § 381.409(c)(6)(ii), per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving size or, in the case of a meal-type product or a main-dish product, less than 0.5 g of sugars per labeled serving size;
(ii) The product contains no ingredient that is a sugar or that is generally understood by consumers to contain sugars unless the listing of the ingredient in the ingredients statement is followed by an asterisk that refers to the statement below the list of ingredients, which states: “Adds a trivial amount of sugar,” “adds a negligible amount of sugar,” or “adds a dietarily insignificant amount of sugar;” and
(iii)(A) It is labeled “low calorie” or “reduced calorie” or bears a relative claim of special dietary usefulness labeled in compliance with paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(5) of this section; or
(B) Such term is immediately accompanied, each time it is used, by either the statement “not a reduced calorie product,” “not a low calorie product,” or “not for weight control.”
(2) The terms “no added sugar,” “without added sugar,” or “no sugar added” may be used only if:
(i) No amount of sugars, as defined in § 381.409(c)(6)(ii), or any other ingredient that contains sugars that functionally substitute for added sugars is added during processing or packaging;
(ii) The product does not contain an ingredient containing added sugars such as jam, jelly, or concentrated fruit juice;
(iii) The sugars content has not been increased above the amount present in the ingredients by some means such as the use of enzymes, except where the intended functional effect of the process is not to increase the sugars content of a product, and a functionally insignificant increase in sugars results;
(iv) The product that it resembles and for which it substitutes normally contains added sugars; and
(v) The product bears a statement that the product is not “low calorie” or “calorie reduced” (unless the product meets the requirements for a “low” or “reduced calorie” product) and that directs consumers' attention to the nutrition panel for further information on sugar and calorie content.
(3) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall not apply to a factual statement that a product, including products intended specifically for infants and children less than 2 years of age, is unsweetened or contains no added sweeteners in the case of a product that contains apparent substantial inherent sugar content, e.g., juices.
(4) The terms “reduced sugar,” “reduced in sugar,” “sugar reduced,” “less sugar,” “lower sugar,” or “lower in sugar” may be used on the label or in labeling of products, except meal-type products as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish products as defined in § 318.413(m), provided that:
(i) The product contains at least 25 percent less sugars per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); and
(ii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:
(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sugars differ between the two products are declared in immediate
proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “this product contains 25 percent less sugar than our regular product”); and
(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the sugar in the product per labeled serving size with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “sugar content has been lowered from 8 g to 6 g per serving”).
(5) The terms defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section may be used on the label or in labeling of a meal-type product as defined in § 381.413(l) and main-dish product as defined in § 381.413(m), provided that:
(i) The product contains at least 25 percent less sugars per 100 g of product than an appropriate reference product as described in § 381.413(j)(1); and
(ii) As required in § 381.413(j)(2) for relative claims:
(A) The identity of the reference product and the percent (or fraction) that the sugars differ between the two products are declared in immediate proximity to the most prominent such claim (e.g., “reduced sugar ‘product’—
25% less sugar than our regular ‘product’ ”); and
(B) Quantitative information comparing the level of the nutrient in the product per specified weight with that of the reference product that it replaces is declared adjacent to the most prominent claim or to the nutrition information (e.g., “sugar content has been reduced from 17 g per 3 oz to 13 g per 3 oz”).

(2) Labeling applications for a synonymous term (i.e., one that is consistent with a term defined by regulation) for characterizing the level of a nutrient, and
(3) Labeling applications for the use of an implied claim in a brand name.
(c) Labeling applications and supporting documentation to be filed under this section shall be submitted in quadruplicate, except that the supporting documentation may be submitted on a computer disc copy. If any part of the material submitted is in a foreign language, it shall be accompanied by an accurate and complete English translation. The labeling application shall state the applicant's post office address.
(d) Pertinent information will be considered as part of an application on the basis of specific reference to such information submitted to and retained in the files of the Food Safety and Inspection Service. However, any reference to unpublished information furnished by a person other than the applicant will not be considered unless use of such information is authorized (with the understanding that such information may in whole or part be subject to release to the public) in a written statement signed by the person who submitted it. Any reference to published information should be accompanied by reprints or photostatic copies of such references.
(e) If nonclinical laboratory studies accompany a labeling application, the applicant shall include, with respect to each nonclinical study included with the application, either a statement that the study has been, or will be, conducted in compliance with the good laboratory practice regulations as set forth in part 58 of chapter 1, title 21, or, if any such study was not conducted in compliance with such regulations, a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.
(f) If clinical investigations accompany a labeling application, the applicant shall include, with respect to each clinical investigation included with the application, either a statement that the investigation was conducted in compliance with the requirements for institutional review set forth in part 56 of chapter 1, title 21, or was not subject to such requirements in accordance with § 56.194 or § 56.105, and that it was conducted in compliance with the requirements for informed consents set forth in part 50 of chapter 1, title 21.
(g) The availability for public disclosure of labeling applications, along with supporting documentation, submitted to the Agency under this section will be governed by the rules specified in subchapter D, title 9.
(h) The data specified under this section to accompany a labeling application shall be submitted on separate sheets, suitably identified. If such data has already been submitted with an earlier labeling application from the applicant, the present labeling application must provide the data.
(i) The labeling application must be signed by the applicant or by his or her attorney or agent, or (if a corporation) by an authorized official.
(j) The labeling application shall include a statement signed by the person responsible for the labeling application, that to the best of his or her knowledge, it is a representative and balanced submission that includes unfavorable information, as well as favorable information, known to him or her pertinent to the evaluation of the labeling application.
(k)(1) Labeling applications for a new nutrient content claim shall be accompanied by the following data which shall be submitted in the following form to the Director, Food Labeling Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, Washington, DC 20250:
(Date)
The undersigned, ____________ submits this labeling application pursuant to 9 CFR 381.469 with respect to (statement of the claim and its proposed use).
Attached hereto, in quadruplicate, or on a computer disc copy, and constituting a part of this labeling application, are the following:
(i) A statement identifying the nutrient content claim and the nutrient that the term is intended to characterize with respect to the level of such nutrient. The statement shall address why the use of the term as proposed will not be misleading. The statement
shall provide examples of the nutrient content claim as it will be used on labels or labeling, as well as the types of products on which the claim will be used. The statement shall also specify the level at which the nutrient must be present or what other conditions concerning the product must be met for the appropriate use of the term in labels or labeling, as well as any factors that would make the use of the term inappropriate.
(ii) A detailed explanation supported by any necessary data of why use of the food component characterized by the claim is of importance in human nutrition by virtue of its presence or absence at the levels that such claim would describe. This explanation shall also state what nutritional benefit to the public will derive from use of the claim as proposed and why such benefit is not available through the use of existing terms defined by regulation. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the analysis shall specifically address nutritional needs of such group, and scientific data sufficient for such purpose, and data and information to the extent necessary to demonstrate that consumers can be expected to understand the meaning of the term under the proposed conditions of use.
(iii) Analytical data that demonstrates the amount of the nutrient that is present in the products for which the claim is intended. The assays should be performed on representative samples in accordance with 381.409(h). If no USDA or AOAC methods are available, the applicant shall submit the assay method used, and data establishing the validity of the method for assaying the nutrient in the particular food. The validation data shall include a statistical analysis of the analytical and product variability.
(iv) A detailed analysis of the potential effect of the use of the proposed claim on food consumption, and any corresponding changes in nutrient intake. The analysis shall specifically address the intake of nutrients that have beneficial and negative consequences in the total diet. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the above analysis shall specifically address the dietary practices of such group, and shall include data sufficient to demonstrate that the dietary analysis is representative of such group.
Yours very truly,
Applicant

The undersigned, ____________ submits this labeling application pursuant to 9 CFR 381.469 with respect to (statement of the synonymous term and its proposed use in a nutrient content claim that is consistent with an existing term that has been defined under subpart Y of part 381).
Attached hereto, in quadruplicate, or on a computer disc copy, and constituting a part of this labeling application, are the following:
(i) A statement identifying the synonymous term, the existing term defined by a regulation with which the synonymous term is claimed to be consistent, and the nutrient that the term is intended to characterize the level of. The statement shall address why the use of the synonymous term as proposed will not be misleading. The statement shall provide examples of the nutrient content claim as it will be used on labels or labeling, as well as the types of products on which the claim will be used. The statement shall also specify whether any limitations not applicable to the use of the defined term are intended to apply to the use of the synonymous term.
(ii) A detailed explanation supported by any necessary data of why use of the proposed term is requested, including whether the existing defined term is inadequate for the purpose of effectively characterizing the level of a nutrient. This explanation shall also state what nutritional benefit to the public will derive from use of the claim as proposed, and why such benefit is not available through use of existing terms defined by regulation. If the claim is intended for a specific group within the population, the analysis shall specifically address nutritional needs of such group, scientific data sufficient for such purpose, and data and information to the extent necessary to demonstrate that consumers can be expected to understand the
meaning of the term under the proposed conditions of use.
