with testing at yaw angles of 0°, ±1°, ±3°, ±4.5°, ±6°, and ±9° (you may include additional angles), using direction conventions described in Figure 2 of SAE J1252 (incorporated by reference, see § 1037.810). Also, determine the drag area at the coastdown effective yaw angle,
C
d
A
alt
(
C
eff
), by taking the average drag area at
C
eff
and−
C
eff
for your vehicle using the same alternate method.
(5) For Phase 2 and later testing, determine separate values of
F
alt-aero
for at least one high-roof day cab and one high-roof sleeper cab for model year 2021, at least two high-roof day cabs and two high-roof sleeper cabs for model year 2024, and at least three high-roof day cabs and three high-roof sleeper cabs for model year 2027. These test requirements are cumulative; for example, you may meet these requirements by testing two vehicles to support model year 2021 certification and four additional vehicles to support model year 2023 certification. For any untested tractor models, apply the value of
F
alt-aero
from the tested tractor model that best represents the aerodynamic characteristics of the untested tractor model, consistent with good engineering judgment. Testing under this paragraph (b)(5) continues to be valid for later model years until you change the tractor model in a way that causes the test results to no longer represent production vehicles. You must also determine unique values of
F
alt-aero
for low-roof and mid-roof tractors if you determine
C
d
A
values based on low or mid-roof tractor testing as shown in § 1037.520(b)(3)(ii). For Phase 1 testing, if good engineering judgment allows it, you may calculate a single, constant value of
F
alt-aero
for your whole product line by dividing the coastdown drag area,
C
d
A
coastdown
, by drag area from your alternate method,
C
d
A
alt.
(6) Determine
F
alt-aero
to at least three decimal places. For example, if your coastdown testing results in a drag area of 6.430, but your wind tunnel method results in a drag area of 6.200,
F
alt-aero
would be 1.037 (or a higher value you declare).
(7) If a tractor and trailer cannot be configured to meet the gap requirements specified in § 1037.501(g)(1)(ii), test with the trailer positioned as close as possible to the specified gap dimension and use good engineering judgment to correct the results to be equivalent to a test configuration meeting the specified gap dimension. For example, we may allow you to correct your test output using an approved alternate method or substitute a test vehicle that is capable of meeting the required specifications and is otherwise aerodynamically equivalent. The allowance in this paragraph (b)(7) applies for certification, confirmatory testing, SEA, and all other testing to demonstrate compliance with standards.
(8) You may ask us for preliminary approval of your coastdown testing under § 1037.210. We may witness the testing.
(c)
Yaw sweep corrections.
Aerodynamic features can have a different effectiveness for reducing wind-averaged drag than is predicted by zero-yaw drag. The following procedures describe how to determine a tractor's
C
d
A
values to account for wind-averaged drag as specified in § 1037.520:
(1) Apply the following method for all Phase 2 and later testing with an alternate method:
(i) Calculate the wind-averaged drag area from the alternate method,
C
d
A
wa-alt
, using an average of measurements at −4.5 and +4.5 degrees.
(ii) Determine your wind-averaged drag area,
C
d
A
wa
, rounded to one decimal place, using the following equation:
ER29JN21.117
(2) Apply the following method for Phase 2 and later coastdown testing other than coastdown testing used to establish
F
alt-aero
:
(i) Determine your drag area at the effective yaw angle from coastdown,
C
d
A
coastdown
(ψ
eff
).
(ii) Use an alternate method to calculate the ratio of the wind-averaged drag area,
C
d
A
wa-alt
(using an average of measurements at −4.5 and +4.5 degrees) to the drag area at the effective yaw angle,
C
d
A
alt
(ψ
eff
).
(iii) Determine your wind-averaged drag area,
C
d
A
wa
, rounded to one decimal place, using the following equation:
ER29JN21.118
(3) Different approximations apply for Phase 1. For Phase 1 testing, you may correct your zero-yaw drag area as follows if the ratio of the zero-yaw drag area divided by yaw-sweep drag area for your vehicle is greater than 0.8065 (which represents the ratio expected for a typical Class 8 high-roof sleeper cab):
(i) Determine the zero-yaw drag area,
C
d
A
zero-yaw
, and the yaw-sweep drag area
for your vehicle using the same alternate method as specified in this subpart. Measure the drag area for 0°, −6°, and +6°. Use the arithmetic mean of the −6° and +6° drag areas as the ±6° drag area,
C
d
A
±6
.
(ii) Calculate your yaw-sweep correction factor,
CF
ys
, using the following equation:
ER29JN21.119
(iii) Calculate your corrected drag area for determining the aerodynamic bin by multiplying the measured zero-yaw drag area by
CF
ys
, as determined using Eq. 1037.525-4, as applicable. You may apply the correction factor to drag areas measured using other procedures. For example, apply
CF
ys
to drag areas measured using the coastdown method. If you use an alternate method, apply an alternate correction,
F
alt-aero
, and calculate the final drag area using the following equation:
ER29JN21.120
(iv) You may ask us to apply
CF
ys
to similar vehicles incorporating the same design features.
(v) As an alternative, you may calculate the wind-averaged drag area according to SAE J1252 (incorporated by reference, see § 1037.810) and substitute this value into Eq. 1037.525-4 for the ±6° drag area.
(d)
Approval of alternate methods.
You must obtain preliminary approval before using any method other than coastdown testing to quantify aerodynamic drag. We will approve your request if you show that your procedures produce data that are the same as or better than coastdown testing with respect to repeatability and unbiased correlation. Note that the correlation is not considered to be biased if there is a bias before correction, but you remove the bias using
F
alt-aero
. Send your request for approval to the Designated Compliance Officer. Keep records of the information specified in this paragraph (d). Unless we specify otherwise, include this information with your request. You must provide any information we require to evaluate whether you may apply the provisions of this section. Include additional information related to your alternate method as described in §§ 1037.530 through 1037.534. If you use a method other than those specified in this subpart, include all the following information, as applicable:
(1) Official name/title of the procedure.
(2) Description of the procedure.
(3) Cited sources for any standardized procedures that the method is based on.
(4) Description and rationale for any modifications/deviations from the standardized procedures.
(5) Data comparing the procedure to the coastdown reference procedure.
(6) Additional information specified for the alternate methods described in §§ 1037.530 through 1037.534 as applicable to this method (
e.g.,
source location/address, background/history).

§ 1037.528
Coastdown procedures for calculating drag area (
C
d
A
).
This section describes the reference method for calculating drag area,
C
d
A
, for tractors using coastdown testing. Follow the provisions of Sections 1 through 9 of SAE J2263 (incorporated by reference, see § 1037.810), with the clarifications and exceptions described in this section. Several of the exceptions in this section are from SAE J1263 (incorporated by reference, see § 1037.810). The coastdown procedures in 40 CFR 1066.310 apply instead of the provisions of this section for Phase 1 tractors.
(a) The terms and variables identified in this section have the meaning given in SAE J1263 and SAE J2263 unless specified otherwise.
(b) To determine
C
d
A
values for a, perform coastdown testing with a tractor-trailer combination using the manufacturer's tractor and a standard trailer. Prepare the tractor-trailer combination for testing as follows:
(1) Install instrumentation for performing the specified measurements.
(2) After adding vehicle instrumentation, verify that there is no brake drag or other condition that prevents the wheels from rotating freely. Do not apply the parking brake at any point between this inspection and the end of the measurement procedure.
(3) Install tires mounted on steel rims in a dual configuration (except for steer tires). The tires must—
(i) Be SmartWay-Verified or have a coefficient of rolling resistance at or below 5.1 kg/metric ton.
(ii) Have accumulated at least 2,000 miles but have no less than 50 percent of their original tread depth, as specified for truck cabs in SAE J1263.
(iii) Not be retreads or have any apparent signs of chunking or uneven wear.
(iv) Be size 295/75R22.5 or 275/80R22.5.
(v) Be inflated to the proper tire pressure as specified in Sections 6.6 and 8.1 of SAE J2263.
(vi) Be of the same tire model for a given axle.
(4) Perform an inspection or wheel alignment for both the tractor and the trailer to ensure that wheel position is within the manufacturer's specifications.
(c) The test condition specifications described in Sections 7.1 through 7.4 of SAE J1263 apply, with certain exceptions and additional provisions as described in this paragraph (c). These conditions apply to each run separately.
(1) We recommend that you not perform coastdown testing if winds are expected to exceed 6.0 mi/hr.
(2) The average of the component of the wind speed parallel to the road must not exceed 6.0 mi/hr. This constraint is in addition to those in Section 7.3 of SAE J1263.
(3) If road grade is greater than 0.02% over the length of the test surface, you must determine elevation as a function of distance along the length of the test surface and incorporate this into the analysis.
(4) Road grade may exceed 0.5% for limited portions of the test surface as long as it does not affect coastdown results, consistent with good engineering judgment.
(5) The road surface temperature must be at or below 50 °C. Use good engineering judgment to measure road surface temperature.
(d)
C
d
A
calculations are based on measured speed values while the vehicle coasts down through a high-speed range from 70 to 60 mi/hr, and through a low-speed range from 20 to 10 mi/hr. Disable any vehicle speed limiters that prevent travel above 72 mi/hr. Measure vehicle speed at a minimum recording frequency of 10 Hz, in conjunction with time-of-day data. Determine vehicle speed using either of the following methods:
(1)
Complete coastdown runs.
Operate the vehicle at a top speed above 72.0 mi/hr and allow the vehicle to coast down to 8.0 mi/hr or lower. Collect data for the high-speed range over a test segment that includes speeds from 72.0 down to 58.0 mi/hr, and collect data for the low-speed range over a test segment that includes speeds from 22.0 down to 8.0 mi/hr.
(2)
Split coastdown runs.
Collect data during a high-speed coastdown while the vehicle coasts through a test segment that includes speeds from 72.0 mi/hr down to 58.0 mi/hr. Similarly, collect data during a low-speed coastdown while the vehicle coasts through a test segment that includes speeds from 22.0 mi/hr down to 8.0 mi/hr. Perform one high-speed coastdown segment or two consecutive high-speed coastdown segments in one direction, followed by the same number of low-speed coastdown segments in the same direction, and then perform that same number of measurements in the opposite direction. You may not split runs as described in Section 9.3.1 of SAE J2263 except as allowed under this paragraph (d)(2).
(e) Measure wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, and air pressure at a recording frequency of 10 Hz, in conjunction with time-of-day data. Use at least one stationary anemometer and suitable data loggers meeting SAE J1263 specifications, subject to the following additional specifications for the anemometer placed along the test surface:
(1) You must start a coastdown measurement within 24 hours after completing zero-wind and zero-angle calibrations.
(2) Place the anemometer at least 50 feet from the nearest tree and at least 25 feet from the nearest bush (or equivalent features). Position the anemometer adjacent to the test surface, near the midpoint of the length of the track, between 2.5 and 3.0 body widths from the expected location of the test vehicle's centerline as it passes the anemometer. Record the location of the anemometer along the test track, to the nearest 10 feet.
(3) Mount the anemometer at a height that is within 6 inches of half the test vehicle's body height.
(4) The height of vegetation surrounding the anemometer may not exceed 10% of the anemometer's mounted height, within a radius equal to the anemometer's mounted height.
(f) Measure air speed and relative wind direction (yaw angle) onboard the vehicle at a minimum recording frequency of 10 Hz, in conjunction with time-of-day data, using an anemometer and suitable data loggers that meet the requirements of Sections 5.4 of SAE J2263. The yaw angle must be measured to a resolution and accuracy of ±0.5°. Mount the anemometer such that it measures air speed at 1.5 meters above the top of the leading edge of the trailer. If obstructions at the test site do not allow for this mounting height, then mount the anemometer such that it measures air speed at least 0.85 meters above the top of the leading edge of the trailer.
(g) Perform the following calculations to filter and correct measured data:
(1) For any measured values not identified as outliers, use those measured values directly in the calculations specified in this section. Filter air speed, yaw angle, wind speed, wind direction, and vehicle speed measurements to replace outliers for every measured value as follows:
(i) Determine a median measured value to represent the measurement point and the measurements 3 seconds before and after that point. In the first and last three seconds of the coastdown run, use all available data to determine the median measured value. The measurement window for determining the median value will accordingly include 61 measurements in most cases, and will always include at least 31 measurements (for 10 Hz recording frequency).
(ii) Determine the median absolute deviation corresponding to each measurement window from paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section. This generally results from calculating 61 absolute deviations from the median measured value and determining the median from those 61 deviations. Calculate the standard deviation for each measurement window by multiplying the median absolute deviation by 1.4826; calculate three standard deviations by multiplying the median absolute deviation by 4.4478. Note that the factor 1.4826 is a statistical constant that relates median absolute deviations to standard deviations.
(iii) A measured value is an outlier if the measured value at a given point differs from the median measured value by more than three standard deviations. Replace each outlier with the median measured value from paragraph
(g)(1)(i) of this section. This technique for filtering outliers is known as the Hampel method.
(2) For each high-speed and each low-speed segment, correct measured air speed using the wind speed and wind direction measurements described in paragraph (e) of this section as follows:
(i) Calculate the theoretical air speed,
v
air,th,
for each 10-Hz set of measurements using the following equation:
ER25OC16.094
Where:
w
= filtered wind speed.
v
= filtered vehicle speed.
ø
w
= filtered wind direction. Let
ø
w
= 0° for air flow in the first travel direction, with values increasing counterclockwise. For example, if the vehicle starts by traveling eastbound, then
ø
w
= 270° means a wind from the south.
ø
veh
= the vehicle direction. Use
ø
veh
= 0° for travel in the first direction, and use
ø
veh
= 180° for travel in the opposite direction.

# Example:
w
= 7.1 mi/hr
v

ø
w

, to determine the air-speed correction coefficients,
a
0
and
a
1,
based on the following equation:
ER25OC16.096
(iii) Correct each measured value of air speed using the following equation:
ER25OC16.097
(3) Correct measured air direction from all the high-speed segments using the wind speed and wind direction measurements described in paragraph (e) of this section as follows:
(i) Calculate the theoretical air direction,
c;
air,th
, using the following equation:
ER25OC16.098

and
b
1,
based on the following equation:

(iii) Correct each measured value of air direction using the following equation:
ER25OC16.101
(h) Determine drag area,
C
d
A
, using the following procedure instead of the procedure specified in Section 10 of SAE J1263:
(1) Calculate the vehicle's effective mass,
M
e
, to account for rotational inertia by adding 56.7 kg to the measured vehicle mass,
M,
(in kg) for each tire making road contact.
(2) Operate the vehicle and collect data over the high-speed range and low-speed range as specified in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section. If the vehicle has a speed limiter that prevents it from exceeding 72 mi/hr, you must disable the speed limiter for testing.
(3) Calculate mean vehicle speed at each speed start point (70 and 20 mi/hr) and end point (60 and 10 mi/hr) as follows:
(i) Calculate the mean vehicle speed to represent the start point of each speed range as the arithmetic average of measured speeds throughout the continuous time interval that begins when measured vehicle speed is less than 2.00 mi/hr above the nominal starting speed point and ends when measured vehicle speed reaches 2.00 mi/hr below the nominal starting speed point, expressed to at least two decimal places. Calculate the timestamp corresponding to the starting point of each speed range as the average timestamp of the interval.
(ii) Repeat the calculations described in paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section corresponding to the end point speed (60 or 10 mi/hr) to determine the time at which the vehicle reaches the end speed, and the mean vehicle speed representing the end point of each speed range.
(iii) If you incorporate grade into your calculations, use the average values for the elevation and distance traveled over each interval.
(4) Calculate the road-load force,
F,
for each speed range using the following equation:
ER25OC16.102
Where:
M
e
= the vehicle's effective mass.
v
= average vehicle speed at the start or end of each speed range, as described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.

§ 1037.530
Wind tunnel procedures for calculating drag area (
C
d
A
).
This section describes an alternate method for calculating drag area,
C
d
A
, for tractors using wind tunnel testing.
(a) You may measure drag areas consistent with published SAE procedures as described in this section using any wind tunnel recognized by the Subsonic Aerodynamic Testing Association, subject to the provisions of § 1037.525. If
your wind tunnel does not meet the specifications described in this section, you may ask us to approve it as an alternate method under § 1037.525(d). All wind tunnels and wind tunnel tests must meet the specifications described in SAE J1252 (incorporated by reference, see § 1037.810), with the following exceptions and additional provisions:
(1) The Overall Vehicle Reynolds number,
Re
#
w
, must be at least 1.0·10
6
. Tests for Reynolds effects described in Section 7.1 of SAE J1252 are not required.
(2) For full-scale wind tunnel testing, use good engineering judgment to select a trailer that is a reasonable representation of the trailer used for reference coastdown testing. For example, where your wind tunnel is not long enough to test the tractor with a standard 53 foot box van, it may be appropriate to use a shorter box van. In such a case, the correlation developed using the shorter trailer would only be valid for testing with the shorter trailer.
(3) For reduced-scale wind tunnel testing, use a one-eighth or larger scale model of a tractor and trailer that is sufficient to simulate airflow through the radiator inlet grill and across an engine geometry that represents engines commonly used in your test vehicle.
(b) Open-throat wind tunnels must also meet the specifications of SAE J2071 (incorporated by reference, see § 1037.810).
(c) To determine
C
dA
values, perform wind tunnel testing with a tractor-trailer combination using the manufacturer's tractor and a standard trailer. Use a moving/rolling floor if the facility has one. For Phase 1 tractors, conduct the wind tunnel tests at a zero yaw angle. For Phase 2 and later vehicles, conduct the wind tunnel tests by measuring the drag area at yaw angles of +4.5° and −4.5° and calculating the average of those two values.
(d) In your request to use wind tunnel testing, describe how you meet all the specifications that apply under this section, using terminology consistent with SAE J1594 (incorporated by reference, see § 1037.810). If you request our approval to use wind tunnel testing even though you do not meet all the specifications of this section, describe how your method nevertheless qualifies as an alternate method under § 1037.525(d) and include all the following information:
(1) Identify the name and location of the test facility for your wind tunnel method.
(2) Background and history of the wind tunnel.
(3) The wind tunnel's layout (with diagram), type, and construction (structural and material).
(4) The wind tunnel's design details: the type and material for corner turning vanes, air settling specification, mesh screen specification, air straightening method, tunnel volume, surface area, average duct area, and circuit length.
(5) Specifications related to the wind tunnel's flow quality: temperature control and uniformity, airflow quality, minimum airflow velocity, flow uniformity, angularity and stability, static pressure variation, turbulence intensity, airflow acceleration and deceleration times, test duration flow quality, and overall airflow quality achievement.
(6) Test/working section information: test section type (
e.g.,
open, closed, adaptive wall) and shape (
e.g.,
circular, square, oval), length, contraction ratio, maximum air velocity, maximum dynamic pressure, nozzle width and height, plenum dimensions and net volume, maximum allowed model scale, maximum model height above road, strut movement rate (if applicable), model support, primary boundary layer slot, boundary layer elimination method, and photos and diagrams of the test section.
(7) Fan section description: fan type, diameter, power, maximum angular speed, maximum speed, support type, mechanical drive, and sectional total weight.
(8) Data acquisition and control (where applicable): acquisition type, motor control, tunnel control, model balance, model pressure measurement, wheel drag balances, wing/body panel balances, and model exhaust simulation.
(9) Moving ground plane or rolling road (if applicable): construction and
material, yaw table and range, moving ground length and width, belt type, maximum belt speed, belt suction mechanism, platen instrumentation, temperature control, and steering.
(10) Facility correction factors and purpose.

§ 1037.532
Using computational fluid dynamics for calculating drag area (
C
dA
).
This section describes an alternate method for calculating drag area,
C
dA,
for tractors using commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software.
(a) For Phase 2 and later vehicles, use SAE J2966 (incorporated by reference, see § 1037.810), with the following clarifications and exceptions:
(1) Vehicles are subject to the requirement to meet standards based on the average of testing at yaw angles of +4.5° and −4.5°; however, you may submit your application for certification with CFD results based on only one of those yaw angles.
(2) For CFD code with a Navier-Stokes based solver, follow the additional steps in paragraph (d) of this section. For Lattice-Boltzmann based CFD code, follow the additional steps in paragraph (e) of this section.
(3) Simulate a Reynolds number of 5.1 million (based on a 102-inch trailer width) and an air speed of 65 mi/hr.
(4) Perform an open-road simulation (not the Wind Tunnel Simulation).
(5) Use a free stream turbulence intensity of 0.0%.
(6) Choose time steps that can accurately resolve intrinsic flow instabilities, consistent with good engineering judgment.
(7) The result must be drag area (
C
d
A
), not drag coefficient (
C
d
), based on an air speed of 65 mi/hr.
(8) Submit information as described in paragraph (g) of this section.
(b) For Phase 1 tractors, apply the procedures as specified in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section. Paragraphs (c) through (f) apply for Phase 2 and later vehicles only as specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) To determine
C
dA
values, perform CFD modeling based on a tractor-trailer combination using the manufacturer's tractor and a standard trailer. Perform all CFD modeling as follows:
(1) Specify a blockage ratio at or below 0.2% to simulate open-road conditions.
(2) Assume zero yaw angle.
(3) Model the tractor with an open grill and representative back pressures based on available data describing the tractor's pressure characteristics.
(4) Enable the turbulence model and mesh deformation.
(5) Model tires and ground plane in motion to simulate a vehicle moving forward in the direction of travel.
(6) Apply the smallest cell size to local regions on the tractor and trailer in areas of high flow gradients and smaller-geometry features (
e.g.,
the A-pillar, mirror, visor, grille and accessories, trailer-leading edge, trailer-trailing edge, rear bogey, tires, and tractor-trailer gap).
(7) Simulate a vehicle speed of 55 mi/hr.
(d) Take the following steps for CFD code with a Navier-Stokes formula solver:
(1) Perform an unstructured, time-accurate analysis using a mesh grid size with a total volume element count of at least 50 million cells of hexahedral and/or polyhedral mesh cell shape, surface elements representing the geometry consisting of no less than 6 million elements, and a near-wall cell size corresponding to a y+ value of less than 300.
(2) Perform the analysis with a turbulence model and mesh deformation enabled (if applicable) with boundary layer resolution of ±95%. Once the results reach this resolution, demonstrate the convergence by supplying multiple, successive convergence values for the analysis. The turbulence model may use k-epsilon (k-ε), shear stress transport k-omega (SST k-ω), or other commercially accepted methods.
(e) For Lattice-Boltzmann based CFD code, perform an unstructured, time-accurate analysis using a mesh grid size with total surface elements of at least 50 million cells using cubic volume elements and triangular and/or quadrilateral surface elements with a
near-wall cell size of no greater than 6 mm on local regions of the tractor and trailer in areas of high flow gradients and smaller geometry features, with cell sizes in other areas of the mesh grid starting at twelve millimeters and increasing in size from this value as the distance from the tractor and trailer increases.
(f) You may ask us to allow you to perform CFD analysis using parameters and criteria other than those specified in this section, consistent with good engineering judgment. In your request, you must demonstrate that you are unable to perform modeling based on the specified conditions (for example, you may have insufficient computing power, or the computations may require inordinate time), or you must demonstrate that different criteria (such as a different mesh cell shape and size) will yield better results. In your request, you must also describe your recommended alternative parameters and criteria, and describe how this approach will produce results that adequately represent a vehicle's in-use performance. We may require that you supply data demonstrating that your selected parameters and criteria will provide a sufficient level of detail to yield an accurate analysis. If you request an alternative approach because it will yield better results, we may require that you perform CFD analysis using both your recommended criteria and parameters and the criteria and parameters specified in this section to compare the resulting key aerodynamic characteristics, such as pressure profiles, drag build-up, and turbulent/laminar flow at key points around the tractor-trailer combination.
(g) Include the following information in your request to determine
C
d
A
values using CFD:
(1) The name of the software.
(2) The date and version number of the software.
(3) The name of the company producing the software and the corresponding address, phone number, and Web site.
(4) Identify whether the software uses Navier-Stokes or Lattice-Boltzmann equations.
(5) Describe the input values you will use to simulate the vehicle's aerodynamic performance for comparing to coastdown results.

§ 1037.534
Constant-speed procedure for calculating drag area (
C
d
A
).
This section describes an alternate method for calculating drag area,
C
dA,
for tractors using constant-speed aerodynamic drag testing.
(a)
Test track.
Select a test track that meets the specifications described in § 1037.528(c)(3).
(b)
Ambient conditions.
At least two tests are required. For one of the tests, ambient conditions must remain within the specifications described in § 1037.528(c) throughout the preconditioning and measurement procedure. The other tests must also meet those specifications except for the wind conditions. The wind conditions must be such that 80 percent of the values of yaw angle, ψ
air
, from the 50 mi/hr and 70 mi/hr test segments are between 4° and 10° or between −4° and −10°.
(c)
Vehicle preparation.
Perform testing with a tractor-trailer combination using the manufacturer's tractor and a standard trailer. Prepare the tractor-trailer combination for testing as described in § 1037.528(b). Install measurement instruments meeting the requirements of 40 CFR part 1065, subpart C, that have been calibrated as described in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart D, as follows:
(1) Measure torque at each of the drive wheels using a hub torque meter or a rim torque meter. If testing a tractor with two drive axles, you may disconnect one of the drive axles from receiving torque from the driveshaft, in which case you would measure torque at only the wheels that receive torque from the driveshaft. Set up instruments to read engine speed for calculating angular speed at the point of the torque measurements, or install instruments for measuring the angular speed of the wheels directly.
(2) Install instrumentation to measure vehicle speed at 10 Hz, with an accuracy and resolution of 0.1 mi/hr. Also
install instrumentation for reading engine speed from the engine's onboard computer.
(3) Mount an anemometer on the trailer as described in § 1037.528(f).
(4) Fill the vehicle's fuel tanks so they are at maximum capacity at the start of the measurement procedure.
(5) Measure the weight over each axle to the nearest 20 kg, with a full fuel tank, including the driver and any passengers that will be in the vehicle during the test.
(d)
Measurement procedure.
The measurement sequence consists of vehicle preconditioning followed by stabilization and measurement over five consecutive constant-speed test segments with three different speed setpoints (10, 50, and 70 mi/hr). Each test segment is divided into smaller increments for data analysis.
(1) Precondition the vehicle and zero the torque meters as follows:
(i) If you are using rim torque meters, zero the torque meters by lifting each instrumented axle and recording torque signals for at least 30 seconds, and then drive the vehicle at 50 mi/hr for at least 30 minutes.
(ii) If you are using any other kind of torque meter, drive the vehicle at 50 mi/hr for at least 30 minutes, and then allow the vehicle to coast down from full speed to a complete standstill while the clutch is disengaged or the transmission is in neutral, without braking. Zero the torque meters within 60 seconds after the vehicle stops moving by recording the torque signals for at least 30 seconds, and directly resume vehicle preconditioning at 50 mi/hr for at least 1.25 mi.
(iii) You may calibrate instruments during the preconditioning drive.
(2) Perform testing as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section over a sequence of test segments at constant vehicle speed as follows:
(i) (300 ±30) seconds in each direction at 10 mi/hr.
(ii) (450 ±30) seconds in each direction at 70 mi/hr.
(iii) (450 ±30) seconds in each direction at 50 mi/hr.
(iv) (450 ±30) seconds in each direction at 70 mi/hr.
(v) (450 ±30) seconds in each direction at 50 mi/hr.
(vi) (300 ±30) seconds in each direction at 10 mi/hr.
(3) When the vehicle preconditioning described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is complete, stabilize the vehicle at the specified speed for at least 200 meters and start taking measurements. The test segment starts when you start taking measurements for all parameters.
(4) During the test segment, continue to operate the vehicle at the speed setpoint, maintaining constant speed and torque within the ranges specified in paragraph (e) of this section. Drive the vehicle straight with minimal steering; do not change gears. Perform measurements as follows during the test segment:
(i) Measure the angular speed of the driveshaft, axle, or wheel where the torque is measured, or calculate it from engine speed in conjunction with gear and axle ratios, as applicable.
(ii) Measure vehicle speed in conjunction with time-of-day data.
(iii) Measure ambient conditions, air speed, and air direction as described in § 1037.528(e) and (f). Correct air speed and air direction as described in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section.
(5) You may divide a test segment into multiple passes by suspending and resuming measurements. Stabilize vehicle speed before resuming measurements for each pass as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Analyze the data from multiple passes by combining them into a single sequence of measurements for each test segment.
(6) Divide measured values into even 10 second increments. If the last increment for each test segment is less than 10 seconds, disregard measured values from that increment for all calculations under this section.
(e)
Validation criteria.
Analyze measurements to confirm that the test is valid. Analyze vehicle speed and drive torque by calculating the mean speed and torque values for each successive 1 second increment, for each successive 10 second increment, and for each test segment. The test is valid if the data conform to all the following specifications:
(1)
Vehicle speed.
The mean vehicle speed for the test segment must be
within 1.00 mi/hr of the speed setpoint. In addition, for testing at 50 mi/hr and 70 mi/hr, all ten of the 1 second mean vehicle speeds used to calculate a corresponding 10 second mean vehicle speed must be within ±0.2 mi/hr of that 10 second mean vehicle speed. Perform the same data analysis for testing at 10 mi/hr, but apply a validation threshold of ±0.1 mi/hr.
(2)
Drive torque.
All ten of the 1 second mean torque values used to calculate a corresponding 10 second mean torque value must be within ±50% of that 10 second mean torque value.
(3)
Torque drift.
Torque meter drift may not exceed ±1%. Determine torque meter drift by repeating the procedure described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section after testing is complete, except that driving the vehicle is necessary only to get the vehicle up to 50 mi/hr as part of coasting to standstill.
(f)
Calculations.
Analyze measured data for each time segment after time-aligning all the data. Use the following calculations to determine
C
d
A
:
(1)
Onboard air speed.
Correct onboard anemometer measurements for air speed using onboard measurements and measured ambient conditions as described in § 1037.528(f), except that you must first divide the test segment into consecutive 10 second increments. Disregard data from the final increment of the test segment if it is less than 10 seconds. This analysis results in the following equation for correcting air speed measurements:
ER25OC16.116
(2)
Yaw angle.
Correct the onboard anemometer measurements for air direction for each test segment as follows:
(i) Calculate arithmetic mean values for vehicle speed,

, over each 10 second increment for each test segment. Disregard data from the final increment of the test segment if it is less than 10 seconds.

, for each 10 second increment using the following equation:
ER25OC16.117
Where:
ϕ

based on the following equation:
ER25OC16.119
(iv) For all 50 mi/hr and 70 mi/hr test segments, correct each measured value of air direction using the following equation:

See 40 CFR 1036.545 for powertrain testing requirements that apply for drivetrain hybrid systems. The procedures are written to test the PTO by ensuring that the engine produces all of the energy with no net change in stored energy (charge-sustaining), and for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, also allowing for drawing down the stored energy (charge-depleting). The full charge-sustaining test for the hybrid vehicle is from a fully charged rechargeable energy storage system (RESS) to a depleted RESS and then back to a fully charged RESS. You must include all hardware for the PTO system. You may ask us to modify the provisions of this section to allow testing hybrid vehicles that use a technology other than batteries for storing
energy, consistent with good engineering judgment. For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, use a utility factor to properly weight charge-sustaining and charge-depleting operation as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
(a) Select two vehicles for testing as follows:
(1) Select a vehicle with a hybrid energy delivery system to represent the range of PTO configurations that will be covered by the test data. If your test data will represent more than one PTO configuration, use good engineering judgment to select the configuration with the maximum number of PTO circuits that has the smallest potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
(2) Select an equivalent conventional vehicle as specified in § 1037.615.
(b) Measure PTO emissions from the fully warmed-up conventional vehicle as follows:
(1) Without adding a restriction, instrument the vehicle with pressure transducers at the outlet of the hydraulic pump for each circuit. Perform pressure measurements with a frequency of at least 1 Hz.
(2) Operate the PTO system with no load for at least 15 seconds. Measure gauge pressure and record the average value over the last 10 seconds (
p
min
). For hybrid PTO systems the measured pressure with no load is typically zero. Apply maximum operator demand to the PTO system until the pressure relief valve opens and pressure stabilizes; measure gauge pressure and record the average value over the last 10 seconds (
p
max
).
(3) Denormalize the PTO duty cycle in appendix B of this part using the following equation:
ER24JA23.078
Where:
p
refi
= the reference pressure at each point
i
in the PTO cycle.
p
i
= the normalized pressure at each point
i
in the PTO cycle (relative to
p
max).
p
max = the mean maximum pressure measured in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
p
min = the mean minimum pressure measured in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(4) If the PTO system has two circuits, repeat paragraph (b)(2) and (3) of this section for the second PTO circuit.
(5) Install a system to control pressures in the PTO system during the cycle.
(6) Start the engine.
(7) Depending on the number of circuits the PTO system has, operate the vehicle over one or concurrently over both of the denormalized PTO duty cycles in appendix B of this part. Measure emissions during operation over each duty cycle using the provisions of 40 CFR part 1066.
(8) Measured pressures must meet the cycle-validation specifications in the following table for each test run over the duty cycle:

a
Determine values for specified parameters as described in 40 CFR 1065.514(e) by comparing measured values to denormalized pressure values from the duty cycle in appendix B of this part.
(c) Measure PTO emissions from the fully warmed-up hybrid vehicle as follows:
(1) Perform the steps in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.
(2) Prepare the vehicle for testing by operating it as needed to stabilize the RESS at a full state of charge (or equivalent for vehicles that use a technology other than batteries for storing energy).
(i) For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, we recommend charging the battery with an external electrical source.
(ii) For other vehicles, we recommend running back-to-back PTO tests until engine operation is initiated to charge the RESS. The RESS should be fully charged once engine operation stops. The ignition should remain in the “on” position.
(3) Turn the vehicle and PTO system off while the sampling system is being prepared.
(4) Turn the vehicle and PTO system on such that the PTO system is functional, whether it draws power from the engine or a battery.
(5) Operate the vehicle over one or both of the denormalized PTO duty cycles without turning the vehicle off, until the engine starts and then shuts down. This may require running multiple repeats of the PTO duty cycles. For non-PHEV systems that are not plug-in hybrid systems, the test cycle is completed once the engine shuts down. For plug-in hybrid systems, continue running until the PTO hybrid is running in a charge-sustaining mode such that the “End of Test” requirements defined in 40 CFR 1066.501(a)(3) are met. Measure emissions as described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section. Use good engineering judgment to minimize the variability in testing between the two types of vehicles.
(6) For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, follow 40 CFR 1066.501(a)(3) to divide the test into charge-depleting and charge-sustaining operation.
(7) Apply cycle-validation criteria as described in paragraph (b)(8) of this section to both charge-sustaining and charge-depleting operation.
(d) Calculate the equivalent distance driven based on operating time for each section of the PTO portion of the test as applicable by determining the time of the test and applying the conversion factor in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. For testing where fractions of a cycle were run (for example, where three cycles are completed and the halfway point of a fourth PTO cycle is reached before the engine starts and shuts down again), calculate the time of the test,
t
test
, as follows:
(1) Add up the time run for all complete tests.
(2) For fractions of a test, use the following equation to calculate the time:
ER29JN21.129

Δ
t
= the time interval between measurements. For example, at 100 Hz, Δ
t
= 0.0100 seconds.
(3) Sum the time from the complete cycles and from the partial cycle.
(4) Divide the total PTO operating time from paragraph (d)(3) of this section by a conversion factor of 0.0144 hr/mi for Phase 1 and 0.0217 hr/mi for Phase 2 and later to determine the equivalent distance driven. The conversion factors are based on estimates of
average vehicle speed and PTO operating time as a percentage of total engine operating time; the Phase 2 and later conversion factor is calculated from an average speed of 27.1 mi/hr and PTO operation 37% of engine operating time, as follows:
ER22AP24.218
Eq. 1037.540-2a
(e) For Phase 1, calculate combined cycle-weighted emissions of the four duty cycles for vocational vehicles, for both the conventional and hybrid PTO vehicle tests, as follows:
(1) Calculate the CO
2
emission rates in grams per test without rounding for both the conventional vehicle and the charge-sustaining and charge-depleting portions of the test for the hybrid vehicle as applicable.
(2) Divide the CO
2
mass from the PTO cycle by the distance determined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section and the standard payload as defined in § 1037.801 to get the CO
2
emission rate in g/ton-mile. For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles follow paragraph (f)(3) of this section to calculate utility factor weighted CO
2
emissions in g/ton-mile.
(3) Calculate the g/ton-mile emission rate for the driving portion of the test specified in § 1037.510 and add this to the CO
2
g/ton-mile emission rate for the PTO portion of the test.
(4) Follow the provisions of § 1037.615 to calculate improvement factors and benefits for advanced technologies.
(f) For Phase 2 and later, calculate the delta PTO fuel results for input into GEM during vehicle certification as follows:
(1) Determine fuel consumption by calculating the mass of fuel for each test in grams,
m
fuelPTO,
without rounding, as described in 40 CFR 1036.540(d)(12) for both the conventional vehicle and the charge-sustaining and charge-depleting portions of the test for the hybrid vehicle as applicable.
(2) Divide the fuel mass by the applicable distance determined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section and the appropriate standard payload as defined in § 1037.801 to determine the fuel-consumption rate in g/ton-mile.
(3) For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles calculate the utility factor weighted fuel-consumption rate in g/ton-mile, as follows:
(i) Determine the utility factor fraction for the PTO system from the table in appendix E of this part using interpolation based on the total time of the charge-depleting portion of the test as determined in paragraphs (c)(6) and (d)(3) of this section.
(ii) Weight the emissions from the charge-sustaining and charge-depleting portions of the test to determine the utility factor-weighted fuel mass,

§ 1037.551
Engine-based simulation of powertrain testing.
The regulations in 40 CFR 1036.545 describe how to measure fuel consumption over specific duty cycles with an engine coupled to a transmission; 40 CFR 1036.545(a)(5) describes how to create equivalent duty cycles for repeating those same measurements with just the engine. This section describes how to perform this engine testing to simulate the powertrain test. These engine-based measurements may be used for selective enforcement audits as described in § 1037.301, as long as the test engine's operation represents the engine operation observed in the powertrain test. If we use this approach for confirmatory testing, when making compliance determinations, we will consider the uncertainty associated with this approach relative to full powertrain testing. Use of this approach for engine SEAs is optional for engine manufacturers.
(a) Use the procedures of 40 CFR part 1065 to set up the engine, measure emissions, and record data. Measure individual parameters and emission constituents as described in this section. Measure NO
X
emissions for each sampling period in grams. You may perform these measurements using a NO
X
emission-measurement system that meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 1065, subpart J. Include these measured NO
X
values any time you report to us your greenhouse gas emissions or fuel consumption values from testing under this section. If a system malfunction prevents you from measuring NO
X
emissions during a test under this section but the test otherwise gives valid results, you may consider this a valid test and omit the NO
X
emission measurements; however, we may require you to repeat the test if we determine that you inappropriately voided the test with respect to NO
X
emission measurement. For hybrid powertrains, correct for the net energy change of the energy storage device as described in 40 CFR 1066.501(a)(3).
(b) Operate the engine over the applicable engine duty cycles corresponding to the vehicle cycles specified in § 1037.510(a)(2) for powertrain testing over the applicable vehicle simulations described in 40 CFR 1036.545(j). Warm up the engine to prepare for the transient test or one of the highway cruise cycles by operating it one time over one of the simulations of the corresponding duty cycle. Warm up the engine to prepare for the idle test by operating it over a simulation of the 65-mi/hr highway cruise cycle for 600 seconds. Within 60 seconds after concluding the warm up cycle, start emission sampling while the engine operates over the duty cycle. You may perform any number of test runs directly in succession once the engine is warmed up. Perform cycle validation as described in 40 CFR 1065.514 for engine speed, torque, and power.
(c) Calculate the mass of fuel consumed as described in 40 CFR 1036.545(n) and (o). Correct each measured value for the test fuel's mass-specific net energy content as described in 40 CFR 1036.550. Use these corrected values to determine whether the engine's emission levels conform to the
declared fuel-consumption rates from the powertrain test.

§ 1037.555
Special procedures for testing Phase 1 hybrid systems.
This section describes a powertrain testing procedure for simulating a chassis test with a pre-transmission or post-transmission hybrid system to perform A to B testing of Phase 1 vehicles. These procedures may also be used to perform A to B testing with non-hybrid systems. See 40 CFR 1036.545 for Phase 2 and later hybrid systems.
(a) Set up the engine according to 40 CFR 1065.110 to account for work inputs and outputs and accessory work.
(b) Collect CO
2
emissions while operating the system over the test cycles specified in § 1037.510(a)(1).
(c) Collect and measure emissions as described in 40 CFR part 1066. Calculate emission rates in grams per ton-mile without rounding. Determine values for
A, B, C,
and
M
for the vehicle being simulated as specified in 40 CFR part 1066. If you will apply an improvement factor or test results to multiple vehicle configurations, use values of
A, B, C, M,
k
a
, and
r
that represent the vehicle configuration with the smallest potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as a result of the hybrid capability.
(d) Calculate the transmission output shaft's angular speed target for the driver model,
f
nref,driver
, from the linear speed associated with the vehicle cycle using the following equation:
ER29JN21.145
Where:
v

i,
starting from
i

k
a
= drive axle ratio, as declared by the manufacturer.
r
= radius of the loaded tires, as declared by the manufacturer.
(e) Use speed control with a loop rate of at least 100 Hz to program the dynamometer to follow the test cycle, as follows:
(1) Calculate the transmission output shaft's angular speed target for the dynamometer,
f
nref,dyno
, from the measured linear speed at the dynamometer rolls using the following equation:
ER29JN21.146
ER29JN21.147
Where:
T
= instantaneous measured torque at the transmission output shaft.
F
brake
= instantaneous brake force applied by the driver model to add force to slow down the vehicle.
t
= elapsed time in the driving schedule as measured by the dynamometer, in seconds.
(2) For each test, validate the measured transmission output shaft's speed with the corresponding reference values according to 40 CFR 1065.514(e). You may delete points when the vehicle is stopped. Perform the validation based on speed values at the transmission output shaft. For steady-state tests (55 mi/hr and 65 mi/hr cruise), apply cycle-validation criteria by treating the sampling periods from the two tests as a continuous sampling period. Perform
this validation based on the following parameters:

(f) Send a brake signal when operator demand is equal to zero and vehicle speed is greater than the reference vehicle speed from the test cycle. Set a delay before changing the brake state to prevent the brake signal from dithering, consistent with good engineering judgment.
(g) The driver model should be designed to follow the cycle as closely as possible and must meet the requirements of § 1037.510 for steady-state testing and 40 CFR 1066.425 for transient testing. The driver model should be designed so that the brake and throttle are not applied at the same time.
(h) Correct for the net energy change of the energy storage device as described in 40 CFR 1066.501(a)(3).

§ 1037.560
Axle efficiency test.
This section describes a procedure for mapping axle efficiency through a determination of axle power loss.
(a) You may establish axle power loss maps based on testing any number of axle configurations within an axle family as specified in § 1037.232. You may share data across a family of axle configurations, as long as you test the axle configuration with the lowest efficiency from the axle family; this will generally involve testing the axle with the highest axle ratio. For vehicles with tandem drive axles, always test each drive axle separately. For tandem axles that can be disconnected, test both single-drive and tandem axle configurations. This includes 4×4 axles where one of the axles is disconnectable. Alternatively, you may analytically derive power loss maps for untested configurations within the same axle family as described in paragraph (h) of this section.
(b) Prepare an axle assembly for testing as follows:
(1) Select an axle assembly with less than 500 hours of operation before testing. Assemble the axle in its housing, along with wheel ends and bearings.
(2) If you have a family of axle assemblies with different axle ratios, you may test multiple configurations using a common axle housing, wheel ends, and bearings.
(3) Install the axle assembly on the dynamometer with an input shaft angle perpendicular to the axle.
(i) For axle assemblies with or without a locking main differential, test the axle assembly using one of the following methods:
(A) Lock the main differential and test it with one electric motor on the input shaft and a second electric motor on the output side of the output shaft that has the speed-reduction gear attached to it.
(B) Test with the main differential unlocked and with one electric motor on the input shaft and electric motors on the output sides of each of the output shafts.
(ii) For drive-through tandem-axle setups, lock the longitudinal and inter-wheel differentials.
(4) Add gear oil according to the axle manufacturer's instructions. If the axle manufacturer specifies multiple gear oils, select the one with the highest viscosity at operating temperature. You may use a lower-viscosity gear oil if we approve that as critical emission-related maintenance under § 1037.125. Fill the gear oil to a level that represents in-use operation. You may use an external gear oil conditioning system, as long as it does not affect measured values.
(5) Install equipment for measuring the bulk temperature of the gear oil in the oil sump or a similar location. Report temperature to the nearest 0.1 °C.
(6) Break in the axle assembly using good engineering judgment. Maintain
gear oil temperature at or below 100 °C throughout the break-in period.
(7) You may drain the gear oil following the break-in procedure and repeat the filling procedure described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. We will follow your practice for our testing.
(c) Measure input and output speed and torque as described in 40 CFR 1065.210(b). You must use a speed-measurement system that meets an accuracy of ±0.05% of point. Use torque transducers that meet an accuracy requirement of ±1.0 N·m for unloaded test points and ±0.2% of the maximum tested axle input torque or output torque, respectively, for loaded test points. Calibrate and verify measurement instruments according to 40 CFR part 1065, subpart D. Command speed and torque at a minimum of 10 Hz, and record all data, including bulk oil temperature, at a minimum of 1 Hz mean values.
(d) The test matrix consists of test points representing output torque and wheel speed values meeting the following specifications:
(1) Output torque includes both loaded and unloaded operation. For measurement involving unloaded output torque, also called spin loss testing, the wheel end is not connected to the dynamometer and is left to rotate freely; in this condition the input torque (to maintain constant wheel speed) equals the power loss. Test axles at a range of output torque values, as follows:
(i) 0, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 N·m for single drive axle applications for tractors and for vocational Heavy HDV with a single drive axle.
(ii) 0, 250, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 N·m for tractors, for vocational Heavy HDV with tandem drive axles, and for all vocational Light HDV or vocational Medium HDV.
(iii) You may exclude values that exceed your axle's maximum torque rating.
(2) Determine maximum wheel speed corresponding to a vehicle speed of 65 mi/hr based on the smallest tire (as determined using § 1037.520(c)(1)) that will be used with the axle. If you do not know the smallest tire size, you may use a default size of 650 r/mi. Use wheel angular speeds for testing that include 50 r/min and speeds in 100 r/min increments that encompass the maximum wheel speed (150, 250, etc.).
(3) You may test the axle assembly at additional speed and torque setpoints.
(e) Determine axle efficiency using the following procedure:
(1) Maintain ambient temperature between (15 and 35) °C throughout testing. Measure ambient temperature within 1.0 m of the axle assembly. Verify that critical axle settings (such as bearing preload, backlash, and oil sump level) are within specifications before and after testing.
(2) Maintain gear oil temperature at (81 to 83) °C. You may alternatively specify a lower range by shifting both temperatures down by the same amount for any or all test points. We will test your axle assembly using the same temperature range(s) you specify for your testing. If you use interpolation for mapping, use the same temperature range for all test points used in the interpolation. You may use an external gear oil conditioning system, as long as it does not affect measured values.
(3) Use good engineering judgment to warm up the axle assembly by operating it until the gear oil is within the specified temperature range.
(4) Stabilize operation at each point in the test matrix for at least 10 seconds, then measure the input torque, output torque, and wheel angular speed for at least 10 seconds. Record arithmetic mean values for all three parameters over the measurement period. Calculate power loss as described in paragraph (f) of this section based on these values for mean input torque,
T
in
, mean output torque,
T
out
, and mean wheel angular speed,
f
nwheel
, at each test point.
(5) Perform the map sequence described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section three times. Remove torque from the input shaft and allow the axle to come to a full stop before each repeat measurement.
(6) You may need to perform additional testing at a given test point based on a calculation of a confidence interval to represent repeatability at a 95% confidence level for that test point. If the confidence limit is greater than 0.10% for loaded tests or greater
than 0.05% for unloaded tests, perform another repeat of measurements at that test point and recalculate the repeatability for the whole set of test results. Continue testing until the confidence interval is at or below the specified values for all test points. Calculate a confidence interval representing the repeatability in establishing a 95% confidence level using the following equation:
ER29JN21.148
Where:
σ
Ploss
= standard deviation of power loss values at a given torque-speed setting (see 40 CFR 1065.602(c)).
N

P

N

ER29JN21.149
Confidence Interval

(f) Calculate the mean power loss,

, at each test point as follows:
(1) Calculate

for each measurement at each test point as follows:
ER29JN21.150
Where:
T

T

(2) Calculate
P

as the mean power loss from all measurements at a given test point.
(3) The following example illustrates a calculation of

P
loss,2
= 1601.9 W = 1.6019 kW
P
loss,3
= 1603.9 W = 1.6039 kW
ER29JN21.151
(g) Create a table with the mean power loss,
P
loss
, corresponding to each test point for input into GEM. Express wheel angular speed in r/min to one decimal place; express output torque in N·m to two decimal places; express power loss in kW to four decimal places.
ER29JN21.279
(2) Record declared mean power loss values at or above the corresponding value calculated in paragraph (f) of this section. Use good engineering judgment to select values that will be at or above the mean power loss values for your production axles. Vehicle manufacturers will use these declared mean power loss values for certification. For vehicles with tandem drive axles, the GEM input is the sum of the power loss and output torque from the individual axles. For vehicles with a disconnectable axle, GEM uses separate inputs for single and tandem drive axle configurations.
(h) You may analytically derive axle power loss maps for untested configurations within an axle family as follows:
(1) Test at least three axle assemblies within the same family representing at least the smallest axle ratio, the largest axle ratio, and an axle ratio closest to the arithmetic mean from the two other tested axle assemblies. Test each axle assembly as described in this section at the same speed and torque setpoints. Test all axle assemblies using the same gear oil temperature range for each setpoint as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(2) Perform a second-order least-squares regression between declared power loss and axle ratio using each speed and torque setpoint described in paragraph (d) of this section for your tested axle assemblies. Use the declared power loss values from paragraph (g) of this section; however, for purposes of analytically deriving power loss maps under this paragraph (h), you must select declared values for the largest and smallest axle ratios in the axle family that are adjusted relative to the calculated values for mean power loss by the same multiplier. If the coefficent of the second-order term is negative, include testing from additional axle ratios, or increase your declared power loss for the largest and smallest axle ratios by the same multiplier as needed for the second-order term to become positive.
(3) Determine
P
loss
of untested axles for each speed and torque setpoint based on a linear relationship between your declared power loss and axle ratio as follows:
(i) Determine the slope of the correlation line by connecting the declared power loss values for the smallest and largest axle ratios.
(ii) Fix the intercept for the correlation line by shifting it upward as needed so all the declared power loss values are on the correlation line or below it. Note that for cases involving three tested axle assemblies, the correlation line will always include the declared power loss for the smallest and largest axle ratio.
(4) Select declared values of
P

§ 1037.565
Transmission efficiency test.
This section describes a procedure for mapping transmission efficiency through a determination of transmission power loss.
(a) You may establish transmission power loss maps based on testing any number of transmission configurations within a transmission family as specified in § 1037.232. You may share data across any configurations within the family, as long as you test the transmission configuration with the lowest efficiency from the transmission family. Alternatively, you may ask us to approve analytically derived power loss maps for untested configurations within the same transmission family (see § 1037.235(h)).
(b) Prepare a transmission for testing as follows:
(1) Select a transmission with less than 500 hours of operation before testing.
(2) Mount the transmission to the dynamometer such that the geared shaft in the transmission is aligned with the input shaft from the dynamometer.
(3) Add transmission oil according to the transmission manufacturer's instructions. If the transmission manufacturer specifies multiple transmission oils, select the one with the highest viscosity at operating temperature. You may use a lower-viscosity transmission oil if we approve it as critical emission-related maintenance under § 1037.125. Fill the transmission oil to a level that represents in-use operation. You may use an external transmission oil conditioning system, as long as it does not affect measured values.
(4) Include any internal and external pumps for hydraulic fluid and lubricating oil in the test. Determine the work required to drive an external pump according to 40 CFR 1065.210.
(5) Install equipment for measuring the bulk temperature of the transmission oil in the oil sump or a similar location.
(6) If the transmission is equipped with a torque converter, lock it for all testing performed in this section.
(7) Break in the transmission using good engineering judgment. Maintain transmission oil temperature at (87 to 93) °C for automatic transmissions and transmissions having more than two friction clutches, and at (77 to 83) °C for all other transmissions. You may ask us to approve a different range of transmission oil temperatures if you have data showing that it better represents in-use operation.
(c) Measure input and output shaft speed and torque as described in 40 CFR 1065.210(b). You must use a speed measurement system that meets an accuracy of ±0.05% of point. Accuracy requirements for torque transducers depend on the highest loaded transmission input and output torque as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Use torque transducers for torque input measurements that meet an accuracy requirement of ±0.2% of the highest loaded transmission input for loaded test points and ±0.1% of the highest loaded transmission input torque for unloaded test points. For torque output measurements, torque transducers must meet an accuracy requirement of ±0.2% of the highest loaded transmission output torque for each gear ratio. Calibrate and verify measurement instruments according to 40 CFR part 1065, subpart D. Command speed and torque at a minimum of 10 Hz, and record all data, including bulk oil temperature, at a minimum of 1 Hz mean values.
(d) Test the transmission at input shaft speeds and torque setpoints as described in this paragraph (d). You may exclude lower gears from testing; however, you must test all the gears above the highest excluded gear. GEM will use default values for any untested gears. The test matrix consists of test points representing transmission input shaft speeds and torque setpoints meeting the following specifications for each tested gear:
(1) Test at the following transmission input shaft speeds:
(i) 600.0 r/min or transmission input shaft speed when paired with the engine operating at idle.
(ii) The transmission's maximum rated input shaft speed. You may alternatively select a value representing the highest expected in-use transmission input shaft speed.
(iii) Three equally spaced intermediate speeds. The intermediate speed points may be adjusted to the
nearest 50 or 100 r/min. You may test any number of additional speed setpoints to improve accuracy.
(2) Test at certain transmission input torque setpoints as follows:
(i) Include one unloaded (zero-torque) setpoint.
(ii) Include one loaded torque setpoint between 75% and 105% of the transmission's maximum rated input shaft torque. However, you may use a lower torque setpoint as needed to avoid exceeding dynamometer torque limits, as long as testing accurately represents in-use performance. If your loaded torque setpoint is below 75% of the transmission's maximum rated input shaft torque, you must demonstrate that the sum of time for all gears where demanded engine torque is between your maximum torque setpoint and 75% of the transmission's maximum rated input shaft torque is no more than 10% of the time for each vehicle drive cycle specified in subpart F of this part. This demonstration must be made available upon request.
(iii) You may test at any number of additional torque setpoints to improve accuracy.
(iv) Note that GEM calculates power loss between tested or default values by linear interpolation, except that GEM may extrapolate outside of measured values to account for testing at torque setpoints below 75% as specified in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
(3) In the case of transmissions that automatically go into neutral when the vehicle is stopped, also perform tests at 600 r/min and 800 r/min with the transmission in neutral and the transmission output fixed at zero speed.
(e) Determine transmission efficiency using the following procedure:
(1) Maintain ambient temperature between (15 and 35) °C throughout testing. Measure ambient temperature within 1.0 m of the transmission.
(2) Maintain transmission oil temperature as described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
(3) Use good engineering judgment to warm up the transmission according to the transmission manufacturer's specifications.
(4) Perform unloaded transmission tests by disconnecting the transmission output shaft from the dynamometer and letting it rotate freely. If the transmission adjusts pump pressure based on whether the vehicle is moving or stopped, set up the transmission for unloaded tests to operate as if the vehicle is moving.
(5) For transmissions that have multiple configurations for a given gear ratio, such as dual-clutch transmissions that can pre-select an upshift or downshift, set the transmission to operate in the configuration with the greatest power loss. Alternatively, test in each configuration and use good engineering judgment to calculate a weighted power loss for each test point under this section based on field data that characterizes the degree of in-use operation in each configuration.
(6) For a selected gear, operate the transmission at one of the test points from paragraph (d) of this section for at least 10 seconds. Measure the speed and torque of the input and output shafts for at least 10 seconds. You may omit measurement of output shaft speeds if your transmission is configured to not allow slip. Calculate arithmetic mean values for mean input shaft torque,
T
in
, mean output shaft torque,
T
out
, mean input shaft speed,
f
nin
, and mean output shaft speed,
f
nout
, for each point in the test matrix for each test. Repeat this stabilization, measurement, and calculation for the other speed and torque setpoints from the test matrix for the selected gear in any sequence. Calculate power loss as described in paragraph (f) of this section based on mean speed and torque values at each test point.
(7) Repeat the procedure described in paragraph (e)(6) of this section for all gears, or for all gears down to a selected gear. This section refers to an “operating condition” to represent operation at a test point in a specific gear.
(8) Perform the test sequence described in paragraphs (e)(6) and (7) of this section three times. You may do this repeat testing at any given test point before you perform measurements for the whole test matrix. Remove torque from the transmission input shaft and bring the transmission to a complete stop before each repeat measurement.
(9) You may need to perform additional testing at a given operating condition based on a calculation of a confidence interval to represent repeatability at a 95% confidence level at that operating condition. If the confidence interval is greater than 0.10% for loaded tests or greater than 0.05% for unloaded tests, perform another measurement at that operating condition and recalculate the repeatability for the whole set of test results. Continue testing until the confidence interval is at or below the specified values for all operating conditions. As an alternative, for any operating condition that does not meet this repeatability criterion, you may determine a maximum power loss instead of calculating a mean power loss as described in paragraph (g) of this section. Calculate a confidence interval representing the repeatability in establishing a 95% confidence level using the following equation:
ER23SE21.000
Where:
σ
Ploss
= standard deviation of power loss values at a given operating condition (see 40 CFR 1065.602(c)).
N
= number of repeat tests for an operating condition.
P
rated
= the transmission's rated input power for a given gear. For testing in neutral, use the value of
P
rated
for the top gear.

# Example:

= 0.1200 kW
N
= 3
P

= 314.2000 kW
ER23SE21.001
Confidence Interval

(f) Calculate the mean power loss,
P
loss
, at each operating condition as follows:
(1) Calculate
P
loss
for each measurement at each operating condition as follows:
ER23SE21.008
Where:
T
in
= mean input shaft torque from paragraph (e)(6) of this section.
f
nin
= mean input shaft speed from paragraph (e)(6) of this section in rad/s.
T
out
= mean output shaft torque from paragraph (e)(6) of this section. Let
T
out
= 0 for all unloaded tests.
f
nout
= mean output shaft speed from paragraph (e)(6) of this section in rad/s. Let
f
nout
= 0 for all tests with the transmission in neutral. See paragraph (f)(2) of this section for calculating
f
nout
as a function of
f
nin
instead of measuring
f
nout
.
(2) For transmissions that are configured to not allow slip, you may calculate
f
nout
based on the gear ratio using the following equation:
ER23SE21.002
Where:
k
g
= transmission gear ratio, expressed to at least the nearest 0.001.
(3) Calculate
P
loss
as the mean power loss from all measurements at a given operating condition.
(4) The following example illustrates a calculation of
P
loss
:
T
in,1
= 1000.0 N·m

= 361.27 r/min = 37.832 rad/s
P
loss,1
= 1000.0·104.72−2654.5·37.832
P
loss,1
= 4295 W = 4.295 kW

loss,2
= 4285 W = 4.285 kW
P
loss,3
= 4292 W = 4.292 kW
ER23SE21.003
(g) Create a table with the mean power loss,
P
loss
, corresponding to each operating condition for input into GEM. Also include power loss in neutral for each tested engine's speed, if applicable. Express transmission input speed in r/min to one decimal place; express input torque in N·m to two decimal places; express power loss in kW to four decimal places. Record the following values:
ER23SE21.009
(2) For any operating condition not meeting the repeatability criterion in paragraph (e)(9) of this section, record the maximum value of
P
loss
for that operating condition along with the corresponding values of
T
in
and
f
nin
.
(h) Record declared power loss values at or above the corresponding value calculated in paragraph (f) of this section. Use good engineering judgment to select values that will be at or above the mean power loss values for your production transmissions. Vehicle manufacturers will use these declared mean power loss values for certification.

§ 1037.570
Procedures to characterize torque converters.
GEM includes input values related to torque converters. This section describes a procedure for mapping a torque converter's capacity factors and torque ratios over a range of operating conditions. You may ask us to approve
analytically derived input values based on this testing for additional untested configurations as described in § 1037.235(h).
(a) Prepare a torque converter for testing as follows:
(1) Select a torque converter with less than 500 hours of operation before the start of testing.
(2) If the torque converter has a locking feature, unlock it for all testing performed under this section. If the torque converter has a slipping lockup clutch, you may ask us to approve a different strategy based on data showing that it represents better in-use operation.
(3) Mount the torque converter with a transmission to the dynamometer in series or parallel arrangement or mount the torque converter without a transmission to represent a series configuration.
(4) Add transmission oil according to the torque converter manufacturer's instructions, with the following additional specifications:
(i) If the torque converter manufacturer specifies multiple transmission oils, select the one with the highest viscosity at operating temperature. You may use a lower-viscosity transmission oil if we approve that as critical emission-related maintenance under § 1037.125.
(ii) Fill the transmission oil to a level that represents in-use operation. If you are testing the torque converter without the transmission, keep output pressure and the flow rate of transmission oil into the torque converter within the torque converter manufacturer's limits.
(iii) You may use an external transmission oil conditioning system, as long as it does not affect measured values.
(5) Install equipment for measuring the bulk temperature of the transmission oil in the oil sump or a similar location and at the torque converter inlet. If the torque converter is tested without a transmission, measure the oil temperature at the torque converter inlet.
(6) Break in the torque converter and transmission (if applicable) using good engineering judgment. Maintain transmission oil temperature at (87 to 93) °C. You may ask us to approve a different range of transmission oil temperatures if you have data showing that it better represents in-use operation.
(b) Measure pump and turbine shaft speed and torque as described in 40 CFR 1065.210(b). You must use a speed measurement system that meets an accuracy of ±0.1% of point or ±1 r/min, whichever is greater. Use torque transducers that meet an accuracy of ±1.0% of the torque converter's maximum rated input and output torque, respectively. Calibrate and verify measurement instruments according to 40 CFR part 1065, subpart D. Command speed and torque at a minimum of 10 Hz. Record all speed and torque data at a minimum of 1 Hz mean values. Note that this section relies on the convention of describing the input shaft as the pump and the output shaft as the turbine shaft.
(c) Determine torque converter characteristics based on a test matrix using either constant input speed or constant input torque as follows:
(1)
Constant input speed.
Test at constant input speed as follows:
(i) Select a fixed pump speed, ƒ
npum
, between (1000 and 2000) r/min.
(ii) Test the torque converter at multiple speed ratios,
v,
in the range of
v
= 0.00 to
v
= 0.95. Use a step width of 0.10 for the range of
v
= 0.00 to 0.60 and 0.05 for the range of
v
= 0.60 to 0.95. Calculate speed ratio,
v,
as turbine shaft speed divided by pump speed.
(2)
Constant input torque.
Test at constant input torque as follows:
(i) Set the pump torque,
T
pum
, to a fixed positive value at ƒ
npum
= 1000 r/min with the torque converter's turbine shaft locked in a non-rotating state (
i.e.,
turbine's speed,
n
tur
, = 0 r/min).
(ii) Test the torque converter at multiple speed ratios,
v,
in the range of
v
= 0.00 up to a value of ƒ
ntur
that covers the usable range of
v
. Use a step width of 0.10 for the range of
v
= 0.00 to 0.60 and 0.05 for the range of
v
= 0.60 to 0.95.
(3) You may limit the maximum speed ratio to a value below 0.95 if you have data showing this better represents in-use operation. You must use the step widths defined in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section and include the upper limit as a test point. If you choose a value less than 0.60, you must
test at least seven evenly distributed points between
v
= 0 and your new upper speed ratio.
(d) Characterize the torque converter using the following procedure:
(1) Maintain ambient temperature between (15 and 35) °C throughout testing. Measure ambient temperature within 1.0 m of the torque converter.
(2) Maintain transmission oil temperature as described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. You may use an external transmission oil conditioning system, as long as it does not affect measured values.
(3) Use good engineering judgment to warm up the torque converter according to the torque converter manufacturer's specifications.
(4) Test the torque converter at constant input speed or constant input torque as described in paragraph (c) of this section. Operate the torque converter at
v
= 0.00 for (5 to 60) seconds, then measure pump torque, turbine shaft torque, angular pump speed, angular turbine shaft speed, and the transmission oil temperature at the torque converter inlet for (5 to 15) seconds. Calculate arithmetic mean values for pump torque,
T
pum
, turbine shaft torque,
T
tur
, angular pump speed,
f
npum
, and angular turbine shaft speed,
f
ntur
, over the measurement period. Repeat this stabilization, measurement, and calculation for the other speed ratios from the test matrix in order of increasing speed ratio. Adjust the speed ratio by increasing the angular turbine shaft speed.
(5) Complete a test run by performing the test sequence described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section two times.
(6) Invalidate the test run if the difference between the pair of mean torque values for the repeat tests at any test point differ by more than ±1 N·m or by more than ±5% of the average of those two values. This paragraph (d)(6) applies separately for mean pump torque and mean turbine shaft torque at each test point.
(7) Invalidate the test run if any calculated value for mean angular pump speed does not stay within ±5 r/min of the speed setpoint or if any calculated value for mean pump torque does not stay within ±5 N·m of the torque setpoint.
(e) Calculate the mean torque ratio,
l
, at each tested speed ratio,
v
, as follows:
(1) Calculate
µ
at each tested speed ratio as follows:
ER23SE21.004
Where:
T
tur
= mean turbine shaft torque from paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
T
pum
= mean pump torque from paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(2) Calculate
l
as the average of the two values of
µ
at each tested speed ratio.
(3) The following example illustrates a calculation of
l
:
T
tur,v=0,1
= 332.4 N·m
T
pum,v=0,1
= 150.8 N·m
T
tur,v=0,2
= 333.6 N·m
T
pum,v=0,2
= 150.3 N·m
ER23SE21.005
(f) Calculate the mean capacity factor,
k
, at each tested speed ratio,
n
, as follows:
(1) Calculate
K
at each tested speed ratio as follows:
ER23SE21.006
Where:
f
npum
= mean angular pump speed from paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
T
pum
= mean pump torque from paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(2) Calculate
k
as the average of the two values of
K
at each tested speed ratio.
(3) The following example illustrates a calculation of
k
:
f
npum,v=0,1
=
f
npum,v=0,2
= 1000.0 r/min
T
pum,v=0,1
= 150.8 N·m
ER23SE21.007
(g) Create a table of GEM inputs showing
l
and
k
at each tested speed ratio,
n.
Express
l
to two decimal places; express
k
to one decimal place; express
n
to two decimal places.

# Subpart G—Special Compliance Provisions
§ 1037.601
General compliance provisions.
(a) Engine and vehicle manufacturers, as well as owners and operators of vehicles subject to the requirements of this part, and all other persons, must observe the provisions of this part, the applicable provisions of 40 CFR part 1068, and the applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act. The provisions of 40 CFR part 1068 apply for heavy-duty vehicles as specified in that part, subject to the provisions:
(1) Except as specifically allowed by this part or 40 CFR part 1068, it is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) to introduce into U.S. commerce either a tractor or vocational vehicle that is not certified to the applicable requirements of this part or a tractor or vocational vehicle containing an engine that is not certified to the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 86 or 1036. Further, it is a violation to introduce into U.S. commerce a Phase 1 tractor containing an engine not certified for use in tractors; or to introduce into U.S. commerce a vocational vehicle containing a Light HDE or Medium HDE not certified for use in vocational vehicles. These prohibitions apply especially to the vehicle manufacturer. Note that this paragraph (a)(1) allows the use of Heavy heavy-duty tractor engines in vocational vehicles.
(2) The provisions of 40 CFR 1068.105(a) apply for vehicle manufacturers installing engines certified under 40 CFR part 1036 as further limited by this paragraph (a)(2). If new engine emission standards apply in a given model year, you may install normal inventories of engines from the preceding model year under the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.105(a) through March 31 of that year without our approval; you may not install such engines after March 31 of that year unless we approve it in advance. Installing such engines after March 31 without our prior approval is considered to be prohibited stockpiling of engines. In a written request for our approval, you
must describe how your circumstances led you and your engine supplier to have normal inventories of engines that were not used up in the specified time frame. We will approve your request for up to three additional months to install engines under this paragraph (a)(2) if we determine that the excess inventory is a result of unforeseeable circumstances and should not be considered circumvention of emission standards. We will limit this approval to a certain number of engines consistent with your normal production and inventory practices. Note that 40 CFR 1068.105(a) allows vehicle manufacturers to use up only normal inventories of engines meeting less stringent standards; if, for example, a vehicle manufacturer's normal practice is to receive a shipment of engines every two weeks, it will deplete its potential to install previous-tier engines under this paragraph (a)(2) well before March 31 in the year that new standards apply.
(3) The exemption provisions of 40 CFR 1068.201 through 1068.230, 1068.240, and 1068.260 through 265 apply for heavy-duty motor vehicles. Other exemption provisions, which are specific to nonroad engines, do not apply for heavy-duty vehicles or heavy-duty engines.
(4) The tampering prohibition in 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1) applies for alternative fuel conversions as specified in 40 CFR part 85, subpart F.
(5) The warranty-related prohibitions in section 203(a)(4) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7522(a)(4)) apply to manufacturers of new heavy-duty highway vehicles in addition to the prohibitions described in 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(6). We may assess a civil penalty up to $44,539 for each engine or vehicle in violation. The civil monetary penalty amount listed in this section may not reflect recent inflation adjustments EPA is required to make. The current maximum and minimum statutory civil penalty amounts are located in § 19.4.
(6) A vehicle manufacturer that completes assembly of a vehicle at two or more facilities may ask to use as the date of manufacture for that vehicle the date on which manufacturing is completed at the place of main assembly, consistent with provisions of 49 CFR 567.4. Note that such staged assembly is subject to the corresponding provisions of 40 CFR 1068.260. Include your request in your application for certification, along with a summary of your staged-assembly process. You may ask to apply this allowance to some or all of the vehicles in your vehicle family. Our approval is effective when we grant your certificate. We will not approve your request if we determine that you intend to use this allowance to circumvent the intent of this part.
(7) The provisions for selective enforcement audits apply as described in 40 CFR part 1068, subpart E, and subpart D of this part.
(b) Vehicles exempted from the applicable standards of 40 CFR part 86 or 1036 other than glider vehicles are exempt from the standards of this part without request. Similarly, vehicles other than glider vehicles are exempt without request if the installed engine is exempted from the applicable standards in 40 CFR part 86 or 1036.
(c) The prohibitions of 40 CFR 1068.101 apply for vehicles subject to the requirements of this part. The following specific provisions apply:
(1) The actions prohibited under this provision include introducing into U.S. commerce a complete or incomplete vehicle subject to the standards of this part where the vehicle is not covered by a valid certificate of conformity or exemption.
(2) Applying a Clean Idle sticker to a vehicles with an installed engine that is not certified to the NO
X
standard of 40 CFR 1036.104(b) violates the prohibition in 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(7)(iii).
(d) The emergency vehicle field modification provisions of 40 CFR 85.1716 apply with respect to the standards of this part.
(e) Under § 1037.801, certain vehicles are considered to be new vehicles when they are imported into the United States, even if they have previously been used outside the country. Independent Commercial Importers may use the provisions of 40 CFR part 85, subpart P, and 40 CFR 85.1706(b) to receive a certificate of conformity for engines and vehicles meeting all the requirements of 40 CFR part 1036 and this part 1037.
(f) Standards apply to multi-fuel vehicles as described for engines in 40 CFR 1036.601(d).
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 86 FR 34489, June 29, 2021; 88 FR 4652, Jan. 24, 2023; 89 FR 29787, Apr. 22, 2024; 89 FR 88656, Nov. 8, 2024]
§ 1037.605
Installing engines certified to alternate standards for specialty vehicles.
(a)
General provisions.
This section allows vehicle manufacturers to introduce into U.S. commerce certain new motor vehicles using engines certified to alternate emission standards specified in 40 CFR 1036.605 for motor vehicle engines used in specialty vehicles. You may not install an engine certified to these alternate standards if there is an engine certified to the full set of requirements of 40 CFR part 1036 that has the appropriate physical and performance characteristics to power the vehicle. Note that, although these alternate emission standards are mostly equivalent to standards that apply for nonroad engines under 40 CFR part 1039 or 1048, they are specific to motor vehicle engines. The provisions of this section apply for the following types of specialty vehicles:
(1) All-terrain motor vehicles with portal axles (
i.e.,
axles that are offset from the corresponding wheel centerline by a gear assembly) or any axle configuration involving gear reduction such that the wheels rotate more slowly than the axle.
(2) Amphibious vehicles.
(3) Vehicles with maximum speed at or below 45 miles per hour. If your vehicle is speed-limited to meet this specification by reducing maximum speed below what is otherwise possible, this speed limitation must be programmed into the engine or vehicle's electronic control module in a way that is tamper-proof. If your vehicles are not inherently limited to a maximum speed at or below 45 miles per hour, they may qualify under this paragraph (a)(3) only if we approve your design to limit maximum speed as being tamper-proof in advance.
(4) Through model year 2027, vehicles with a hybrid powertrain in which the engine provides energy only for the Rechargeable Energy Storage System.
(b)
Notification and reporting requirements.
Send the Designated Compliance Officer written notification describing your plans before using the provisions of this section. In addition, by February 28 of each calendar year (or less often if we tell you), send the Designated Compliance Officer a report with all the following information:
(1) Identify your full corporate name, address, and telephone number.
(2) List the vehicle models for which you used this exemption in the previous year and identify the engine manufacturer and engine model for each vehicle model. Also identify the total number of vehicles produced in the previous year.
(c)
Production limits.
You may produce up to 1,000 hybrid vehicles in a given model year through model year 2027, and up to 200 of each type of vehicle identified in paragraph (a)(1) through (3) of this section in a given model year. This includes vehicles produced by affiliated companies. If you exceed this limit, the number of vehicles that exceed the limit for the model year will not be covered by a valid certificate of conformity. For the purpose of this paragraph (c), we will count all vehicles labeled or otherwise identified as exempt under this section.
(d)
Vehicle standards.
The vehicle standards of this part apply as follows for these vehicles:
(1) Vehicles qualifying under paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section are subject to evaporative emission standards of § 1037.103, but are exempt from the other requirements of this part, except as specified in this section and in § 1037.601. These vehicles must include a label as specified in § 1037.135(a) with the information from § 1037.135(c)(1) and (2) and the following statement: “THIS VEHICLE IS EXEMPT FROM GREENHOUSE GAS STANDARDS UNDER 40 CFR 1037.605.”
(2) Hybrid vehicles using the provisions of this section remain subject to the vehicle standards and all other requirements of this part 1037. For example, you may need to use GEM in conjunction with powertrain testing to demonstrate compliance with emission standards under subpart B of this part.

§ 1037.610
Vehicles with off-cycle technologies.
(a) You may ask us to apply the provisions of this section for CO
2
emission reductions resulting from vehicle technologies that were not in common use with heavy-duty vehicles before model year 2010 that are not reflected in GEM. While you are not required to prove that such technologies were not in common use with heavy-duty vehicles before model year 2010, we will not approve your request if we determine that they do not qualify. These may be described as off-cycle or innovative technologies. You may apply these provisions for CO
2
emission reductions reflected in the specified test procedures if they are not reflected in GEM, except as allowed under paragraph (g) of this section. We will apply these provisions only for technologies that will result in measurable, demonstrable, and verifiable real-world CO
2
emission reductions.
(b) The provisions of this section may be applied as either an improvement factor or as a separate credit, consistent with good engineering judgment. Note that the term “credit” in this section describes an additive adjustment to emission rates and is not equivalent to an emission credit in the ABT program of subpart H of this part. We recommend that you base your credit/adjustment on A to B testing of pairs of vehicles differing only with respect to the technology in question.
(1) Calculate improvement factors as the ratio of in-use emissions with the technology divided by the in-use emissions without the technology. Use the improvement-factor approach where good engineering judgment indicates that the actual benefit will be proportional to emissions measured over the test procedures specified in this part.
(2) Calculate separate credits (g/ton-mile) based on the difference between the in-use emission rate with the technology and the in-use emission rate without the technology. Subtract this value from your GEM result and use this adjusted value to determine your FEL. Use the separate-credit approach where good engineering judgment indicates that the actual benefit will not be proportional to emissions measured over the test procedures specified in this part.
(3) We may require you to discount or otherwise adjust your improvement factor or credit to account for uncertainty or other relevant factors.
(c) You may perform A to B testing by measuring emissions from the vehicles during chassis testing or from in-use on-road testing. You may also ask to use modified powertrain testing. If you use on-road testing, we recommend that you test according to SAE J1321, Fuel Consumption Test Procedure—Type II, revised February 2012, or SAE J1526, SAE Fuel Consumption Test Procedure (Engineering Method), Revised September 2015 (see § 1037.810 for information on availability of SAE standards), subject to the following provisions:
(1) The minimum route distance is 100 miles.
(2) The route selected must be representative in terms of grade. We will take into account published and relevant research in determining whether the grade is representative.
(3) Control vehicle speed over the route to be representative of the drive-cycle weighting adopted for each regulatory subcategory, as specified in § 1037.510(c), or apply a correction to account for the appropriate weighting. For example, if the route selected for an evaluation of a combination tractor with a sleeper cab contains only interstate driving at 65 mi/hr, the improvement factor would apply only to 86 percent of the weighted result.
(4) The ambient air temperature must be between (5 and 35) °C, unless the technology requires other temperatures for demonstration.
(5) We may allow you to use a Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS) device for measuring CO
2
emissions during the on-road testing.
(d) Send your request to the Designated Compliance Officer. We recommend that you do not begin collecting test data (for submission to EPA) before contacting us. For technologies for which the engine manufacturer could also claim credits (such as transmissions in certain circumstances), we may require you to include a letter from the engine manufacturer stating that it will not seek
credits for the same technology. Your request must contain the following items:
(1) A detailed description of the off-cycle technology and how it functions to reduce CO
2
emissions under conditions not represented on the duty cycles required for certification.
(2) A list of the vehicle configurations that will be equipped with the technology.
(3) A detailed description and justification of the selected test vehicles.
(4) All testing and simulation data required under this section, plus any other data you have considered in your analysis. You may ask for our preliminary approval of your test plan under § 1037.210.
(5) A complete description of the methodology used to estimate the off-cycle benefit of the technology and all supporting data, including vehicle testing and in-use activity data. Also include a statement regarding your recommendation for applying the provisions of this section for the given technology as an improvement factor or a credit.
(6) An estimate of the off-cycle benefit by vehicle model, and the fleetwide benefit based on projected sales of vehicle models equipped with the technology.
(7) A demonstration of the in-use durability of the off-cycle technology, based on any available engineering analysis or durability testing data (either by testing components or whole vehicles).
(8) A recommended method for auditing production vehicles consistent with the intent of 40 CFR part 1068, subpart E. We may approve your recommended method or specify a different method.
(e) We may seek public comment on your request, consistent with the provisions of 40 CFR 86.1866. However, we will generally not seek public comment on credits or adjustments based on A to B chassis testing performed according to the duty-cycle testing requirements of this part or in-use testing performed according to paragraph (c) of this section.
(f) We may approve an improvement factor or credit for any configuration that is properly represented by your testing.
(1) For model years before 2021, you may continue to use an approved improvement factor or credit for any appropriate vehicle families in future model years through 2020.
(2) For model years 2021 and later, you may not rely on an approval for model years before 2021. You must separately request our approval before applying an improvement factor or credit under this section for Phase 2 and later vehicles, even if we approved an improvement factor or credit for similar vehicle models before model year 2021. Note that Phase 2 and later approval may carry over for multiple years.
(g) You normally may not calculate off-cycle credits or improvement factors under this section for technologies represented by GEM, but we may allow you to do so by averaging multiple GEM runs for special technologies for which a single GEM run cannot accurately reflect in-use performance. For example, if you use an idle-reduction technology that is effective 80 percent of the time, we may allow you to run GEM with the technology active and with it inactive, and then apply an 80% weighting factor to calculate the off-cycle credit or improvement factor. You may need to perform testing to establish proper weighting factors or otherwise quantify the benefits of the special technologies.
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 29787, Apr. 22, 2024]
§ 1037.615
Advanced technologies.
(a) This section describes how to calculate emission credits for advanced technologies. You may calculate Phase 1 advanced technology credits through model year 2020 for hybrid vehicles with regenerative braking, vehicles equipped with Rankine-cycle engines, battery electric vehicles, and fuel cell electric vehicles. You may calculate Phase 2 advanced technology credits through model year 2026 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, battery electric vehicles, and fuel cell electric vehicles. You may calculate Phase 3 advanced technology credits for model year 2027 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, battery electric vehicles, and fuel cell
electric vehicles. You may not generate credits for Phase 1 engine technologies for which the engines generate CO
2
credits under 40 CFR part 1036.
(b) Generate Phase 1 advanced-technology credits for vehicles other than battery electric vehicles as follows:
(1) Measure the effectiveness of the advanced system by chassis-testing a vehicle equipped with the advanced system and an equivalent conventional vehicle, or by testing the hybrid systems and the equivalent non-hybrid systems as described in § 1037.555. Test the vehicles as specified in subpart F of this part. For purposes of this paragraph (b), a conventional vehicle is considered to be equivalent if it has the same footprint (as defined in 40 CFR 86.1803), vehicle service class, aerodynamic drag, and other relevant factors not directly related to the hybrid powertrain. If you use § 1037.540 to quantify the benefits of a hybrid system for PTO operation, the conventional vehicle must have the same number of PTO circuits and have equivalent PTO power. If you do not produce an equivalent vehicle, you may create and test a prototype equivalent vehicle. The conventional vehicle is considered Vehicle A and the advanced vehicle is considered Vehicle B. We may specify an alternate cycle if your vehicle includes a power take-off.
(2) Calculate an improvement factor and g/ton-mile benefit using the following equations and parameters:
(i) Improvement Factor = [(Emission Rate A)−(Emission Rate B)]/(Emission Rate A).
(ii) g/ton-mile benefit = Improvement Factor × (GEM Result B).
(iii) Emission Rates A and B are the g/ton-mile CO
2
emission rates of the conventional and advanced vehicles, respectively, as measured under the test procedures specified in this section. GEM Result B is the g/ton-mile CO
2
emission rate resulting from emission modeling of the advanced vehicle as specified in § 1037.520.
(3) If you apply an improvement factor to multiple vehicle configurations using the same advanced technology, use the vehicle configuration with the smallest potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the hybrid capability.
(4) Use the equation in § 1037.705 to convert the g/ton-mile benefit to emission credits (in Mg). Use the g/ton-mile benefit in place of the (Std−FEL) term.
(c) See § 1037.540 for special testing provisions related to Phase 1 vehicles equipped with hybrid power take-off units.
(d) For Phase 2 and Phase 3 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and for fuel cells powered by any fuel other than hydrogen, calculate CO
2
credits using an FEL based on emission measurements from powertrain testing. Phase 2 and Phase 3 advanced technology credits do not apply for hybrid vehicles that have no plug-in capability.
(e) [Reserved]
(f) For battery electric vehicles and for fuel cell electric vehicles, calculate CO
2
credits using an FEL of 0 g/ton-mile. Note that these vehicles are subject to compression-ignition standards for CO
2
.
(g) As specified in subpart H of this part, advanced-technology credits generated from Phase 1 vehicles under this section may be used under this part outside of the averaging set in which they were generated, or they may be used under 40 CFR part 86, subpart S, or 40 CFR part 1036. Advanced-technology credits generated from Phase 2 and later vehicles are subject to the averaging-set restrictions that apply to other emission credits.
(h) You may certify using both provisions of this section and the off-cycle technology provisions of § 1037.610, provided you do not double count emission benefits.
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 86 FR 34490, June 29, 2021; 88 FR 4652, Jan. 24, 2023; 89 FR 29787, Apr. 22, 2024]
§ 1037.620
Responsibilities for multiple manufacturers.
This section describes certain circumstances in which multiple manufacturers share responsibilities for vehicles they produce together. This section does not limit responsibilities that apply under the Act or these regulations for anyone meeting the definition of “manufacturer” in § 1037.801. Note that the definition of manufacturer is
broad and can include persons not commercially considered to be manufacturers.
(a) The following provisions apply when there are multiple persons meeting the definition of manufacturer in § 1037.801:
(1) Each person meeting the definition of manufacturer must comply with the requirements of this part that apply to manufacturers. However, if one person complies with a specific requirement for a given vehicle, then all manufacturers are deemed to have complied with that specific requirement.
(2) We will apply the requirements of subparts C and D of this part to the manufacturer that obtains the certificate of conformity for the vehicle. Other manufacturers are required to comply with the requirements of subparts C and D of this part only when notified by us. In our notification, we will specify a reasonable time period in which you need to comply with the requirements identified in the notice. See § 1037.601 for the applicability of 40 CFR part 1068 to these other manufacturers and remanufacturers.
(b) The provisions of § 1037.621, including delegated assembly, apply for certifying manufacturers that rely on other manufacturers to finish assembly in a certified configuration. The provisions of § 1037.622 generally apply for manufacturers that ship vehicles subject to the requirements of this part to a certifying secondary vehicle manufacturer. The provisions of § 1037.622 also apply to the secondary vehicle manufacturer. If you hold the certificate of conformity for a vehicle only with respect to exhaust or evaporative emissions, and a different company holds the other certificate of conformity for that vehicle, the provisions of § 1037.621 apply with respect to the certified configuration as described in your application for certification, and the provisions of § 1037.622 apply with respect to the certified configuration as described in the other manufacturer's application for certification.
(c) Component manufacturers (such as tire manufacturers) providing test data to certifying vehicle manufacturers are responsible as follows for test components and emission test results provided to vehicle manufacturers for the purpose of certification under this part:
(1) Such test results are deemed under § 1037.825 to be submissions to EPA. This means that you may be subject to criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 1001 if you knowingly submit false test results to the certifying manufacturer.
(2) You may not cause a vehicle manufacturer to violate the regulations by rendering inaccurate emission test results you provide (or emission test results from testing of test components you provide) to the vehicle manufacturer (see 40 CFR 1068.101(c)).
(3) Your provision of test components and/or emission test results to vehicle manufacturers for the purpose of certifying under this part are deemed to be an agreement to provide components to EPA for confirmatory testing under § 1037.235.
(d) Component manufacturers may contractually agree to process emission warranty claims on behalf of the certifying manufacturer with respect to those components, as follows:
(1) Your fulfillment of the warranty requirements of this part is deemed to fulfill the vehicle manufacturer's warranty obligations under this part with respect to components covered by your warranty.
(2) You may not cause a vehicle manufacturer to violate the regulations by failing to fulfill the emission warranty requirements that you contractually agreed to fulfill (see 40 CFR 1068.101(c)).
(e) We may require component manufacturers to provide information or take other actions under 42 U.S.C. 7542. For example, we may require component manufacturers to test components they produce.
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 29787, Apr. 22, 2024]
§ 1037.621
Delegated assembly.
(a) This section describes provisions that allow certificate holders to sell or ship vehicles that are missing certain emission-related components if those components will be installed by a secondary vehicle manufacturer. Paragraph (g) of this section similarly describes how dealers and distributors
may modify new vehicles with your advance approval. (
Note:
See § 1037.622 for provisions related to manufacturers introducing into U.S. commerce partially complete vehicles for which a secondary vehicle manufacturer holds the certificate of conformity.)
(b) You do not need an exemption to ship a vehicle that does not include installation or assembly of certain emission-related components if those components are shipped along with the vehicle. For example, you may generally ship fuel tanks and aerodynamic devices along with vehicles rather than installing them on the vehicle before shipment. We may require you to describe how you plan to use this provision.
(c) You may ask us at the time of certification for an exemption to allow you to ship your vehicles without emission-related components. If we allow this, you must provide emission-related installation instructions as specified in § 1037.130. You must follow delegated-assembly requirements in 40 CFR 1068.261 if you rely on secondary vehicle manufacturers to install certain technologies or components as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. For other technologies or components, we may specify conditions that we determine are needed to ensure that shipping the vehicle without such components will not result in the vehicle being operated outside of its certified configuration; this may include a requirement to comply with the delegated-assembly provisions in paragraph (d) of this section. We may consider your past performance when we specify the conditions that apply.
(d) Delegated-assembly provisions apply as specified in this paragraph (d) if the certifying vehicle manufacturer relies on a secondary vehicle manufacturer to procure and install auxiliary power units, aerodynamic devices, hybrid components (for powertrain or power take-off), or natural gas fuel tanks. These provisions do not apply for other systems or components, such as air conditioning lines and fittings, except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Apply the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.261, with the following exceptions and clarifications:
(1) Understand references to “engines” to refer to vehicles.
(2) Understand references to “aftertreatment components” to refer to any relevant emission-related components under this paragraph (d).
(3) Understand “equipment manufacturers” to be secondary vehicle manufacturers.
(4) The provisions of 40 CFR 1068.261(b), (c)(7), (d), and (e) do not apply. Accordingly, the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.261(c) apply regardless of pricing arrangements.
(e) Secondary vehicle manufacturers must follow the engine manufacturer's emission-related installation instructions. Not meeting the manufacturer's emission-related installation instructions is a violation of one or more of the prohibitions of § 1068.101. We may also require secondary vehicle manufacturers to recall defective vehicles under 40 CFR 1068.505 if we determine that their manufacturing practices caused vehicles to not conform to the regulations. Secondary vehicle manufacturers may be required to meet additional requirements if the certifying vehicle manufacturer delegates final assembly of emission controls as described in paragraph (d) of this section.
(f) Except as allowed by § 1037.622, the provisions of this section apply to manufacturers for glider kits they produce. Note that under § 1037.620, glider kit manufacturers are generally presumed to be responsible (in whole or in part) for compliance with respect to vehicles produced from their glider kits, even if a secondary vehicle manufacturer holds the certificate under § 1037.622.
(g) We may allow certifying vehicle manufacturers to authorize dealers or distributors to reconfigure/recalibrate vehicles after the vehicles have been introduced into commerce if they have not yet been delivered to the ultimate purchaser as follows:
(1) This allowance is limited to changes from one certified configuration to another, as noted in the following examples:
(i) If your vehicle family includes certified configurations with different axle ratios, you may authorize changing from one certified axle ratio to another.
(ii) You may authorize adding a certified APU to a tractor.
(2) Your final ABT report must accurately describe the vehicle's certified configuration as delivered to the ultimate purchaser. This means that the allowance no longer applies after you submit the final ABT report.
(3) The vehicle label must accurately reflect the final vehicle configuration.
(4) You must keep records to document modifications under this paragraph (g).
(5) Dealers and distributors must keep a record of your authorizing instructions. Dealers and distributors that fail to follow your instructions or otherwise make unauthorized changes may be committing a tampering violation as described in 40 CFR 1068.105(b).
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 86 FR 34490, June 29, 2021]
§ 1037.622
Shipment of partially complete vehicles to secondary vehicle manufacturers.
This section specifies how manufacturers may introduce partially complete vehicles into U.S. commerce (or in the case of certain custom vehicles, introduce complete vehicles into U.S. commerce for modification by a small manufacturer). The provisions of this section are intended to accommodate normal business practices without compromising the effectiveness of certified emission controls. You may not use the provisions of this section to circumvent the intent of this part. For vehicles subject to both exhaust greenhouse gas and evaporative standards, the provisions of this part apply separately for each certificate.
(a) The provisions of this section allow manufacturers to ship partially complete vehicles to secondary vehicle manufacturers or otherwise introduce them into U.S. commerce in the following circumstances:
(1)
Certified vehicles.
Manufacturers may introduce partially complete tractors into U.S. commerce if they are covered by certificates of conformity and are in certified configurations. See § 1037.621 for vehicles not yet in a certified configuration when introduced into U.S. commerce.
(2)
Uncertified vehicles that will be certified by secondary vehicle manufacturers.
Manufacturers may introduce into U.S. commerce partially complete vehicles for which they do not hold the required certificate of conformity only as allowed by paragraph (b) of this section; however, the requirements of this section do not apply for tractors or vocational vehicles with a date of manufacture before January 1, 2022, that are produced by a secondary vehicle manufacturer if they are excluded from the standards of this part under § 1037.150(c).
(3)
Exempted vehicles.
Manufacturers may introduce into U.S. commerce partially complete vehicles without a certificate of conformity if the vehicles are exempt under this part or under 40 CFR part 1068. This may involve the secondary vehicle manufacturer qualifying for the exemption.
(4)
Small manufacturers modifying certified tractors.
Small manufacturers that build custom sleeper cabs or natural gas-fueled tractors may modify complete or incomplete vehicles certified as tractors, as specified by paragraph (d) of this section.
(b) The provisions of this paragraph (b) generally apply where the secondary vehicle manufacturer has substantial control over the design and assembly of emission controls. They also apply where a secondary vehicle manufacturer qualifies for a permanent exemption. In unusual circumstances we may allow other secondary vehicle manufacturers to use these provisions. In determining whether a manufacturer has substantial control over the design and assembly of emission controls, we would consider the degree to which the secondary vehicle manufacturer would be able to ensure that the engine and vehicle will conform to the regulations in their final configurations.
(1) A secondary vehicle manufacturer may finish assembly of partially complete vehicles in the following cases:
(i) It obtains a vehicle that is not fully assembled with the intent to manufacture a complete vehicle in a certified or exempted configuration. For example, this would apply where a glider vehicle assembler holds a certificate that allows the assembler to produce certified glider vehicles from glider kits.
(ii) It obtains a vehicle with the intent to modify it to a certified configuration before it reaches the ultimate purchaser. For example, this may apply for converting a gasoline-fueled vehicle to operate on natural gas under the terms of a valid certificate.
(2) Manufacturers may introduce partially complete vehicles into U.S. commerce as described in this paragraph (b) if they have a written request for such vehicles from a secondary vehicle manufacturer that will finish the vehicle assembly and has certified the vehicle (or the vehicle has been exempted or excluded from the requirements of this part). The written request must include a statement that the secondary vehicle manufacturer has a certificate of conformity (or exemption/exclusion) for the vehicle and identify a valid vehicle family name associated with each vehicle model ordered (or the basis for an exemption/exclusion). The original vehicle manufacturer must apply a removable label meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 1068.45(b) that identifies the corporate name of the original manufacturer and states that the vehicle is exempt under the provisions of § 1037.622. The name of the certifying manufacturer must also be on the label or, alternatively, on the bill of lading that accompanies the vehicles during shipment. The original manufacturer may not apply a permanent emission control information label identifying the vehicle's eventual status as a certified vehicle. Note that an exemption allowing a glider assembler to install an exempt engine does not necessarily exempt the vehicle from the requirements of this part.
(3) If you are the secondary vehicle manufacturer and you will hold the certificate, you must include the following information in your application for certification:
(i) Identify the original manufacturer of the partially complete vehicle or of the complete vehicle you will modify.
(ii) Describe briefly how and where final assembly will be completed. Specify how you have the ability to ensure that the vehicles will conform to the regulations in their final configuration. (
Note:
This section prohibits using the provisions of this paragraph (b) unless you have substantial control over the design and assembly of emission controls.)
(iii) State unconditionally that you will not distribute the vehicles without conforming to all applicable regulations.
(4) If you are a secondary vehicle manufacturer and you are already a certificate holder for other families, you may receive shipment of partially complete vehicles after you apply for a certificate of conformity but before the certificate's effective date. This exemption allows the original manufacturer to ship vehicles after you have applied for a certificate of conformity. Manufacturers may introduce partially complete vehicles into U.S. commerce as described in this paragraph (b)(4) if they have a written request for such vehicles from a secondary vehicle manufacturer stating that the application for certification has been submitted (instead of the information we specify in paragraph (b)(2) of this section). We may set additional conditions under this paragraph (b)(4) to prevent circumvention of regulatory requirements.
(5) The provisions of this section also apply for shipping partially complete vehicles if the vehicle is covered by a valid exemption and there is no valid family name that could be used to represent the vehicle model. Unless we approve otherwise in advance, you may do this only when shipping engines to secondary vehicle manufacturers that are certificate holders. In this case, the secondary vehicle manufacturer must identify the regulatory cite identifying the applicable exemption instead of a valid family name when ordering engines from the original vehicle manufacturer.
(6) Both original and secondary vehicle manufacturers must keep the records described in this section for at least five years, including the written request for exempted vehicles and the bill of lading for each shipment (if applicable). The written request is deemed to be a submission to EPA.
(7) These provisions are intended only to allow secondary vehicle manufacturers to obtain or transport vehicles in the specific circumstances identified in this section so any exemption
under this section expires when the vehicle reaches the point of final assembly identified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
(8) For purposes of this section, an allowance to introduce partially complete vehicles into U.S. commerce includes a conditional allowance to sell, introduce, or deliver such vehicles into commerce in the United States or import them into the United States. It does not include a general allowance to offer such vehicles for sale because this exemption is intended to apply only for cases in which the certificate holder already has an arrangement to purchase the vehicles from the original manufacturer. This exemption does not allow the original manufacturer to subsequently offer the vehicles for sale to a different manufacturer who will hold the certificate unless that second manufacturer has also complied with the requirements of this part. The exemption does not apply for any individual vehicles that are not labeled as specified in this section or which are shipped to someone who is not a certificate holder.
(9) We may suspend, revoke, or void an exemption under this section, as follows:
(i) We may suspend or revoke your exemption if you fail to meet the requirements of this section. We may suspend or revoke an exemption related to a specific secondary vehicle manufacturer if that manufacturer sells vehicles that are in not in a certified configuration in violation of the regulations. We may disallow this exemption for future shipments to the affected secondary vehicle manufacturer or set additional conditions to ensure that vehicles will be assembled in the certified configuration.
(ii) We may void an exemption for all the affected vehicles if you intentionally submit false or incomplete information or fail to keep and provide to EPA the records required by this section.
(iii) The exemption is void for a vehicle that is shipped to a company that is not a certificate holder or for a vehicle that is shipped to a secondary vehicle manufacturer that is not in compliance with the requirements of this section.
(iv) The secondary vehicle manufacturer may be liable for penalties for causing a prohibited act where the exemption is voided due to actions on the part of the secondary vehicle manufacturer.
(c) Provide instructions along with partially complete vehicles including all information necessary to ensure that an engine will be installed in its certified configuration.
(d) Small manufacturers that build custom sleeper cabs or natural gas-fueled tractors may modify complete or incomplete vehicles certified as tractors, subject to the provisions of this paragraph (d). Such businesses are secondary vehicle manufacturers.
(1) Secondary vehicle manufacturers may not modify the vehicle body in front of the b-pillar or increase the effective frontal area of the certified configuration including consideration of the frontal area of the standard trailer. For high-roof custom sleeper tractors, this would generally mean that no part of the added sleeper compartment may extend beyond 102 inches wide or 162 inches high (measured from the ground), which are the dimensions of the standard trailer for high-roof tractors under this part. Note that these dimensions have a tolerance of ±2 inches.
(2) The certifying manufacturer may have responsibilities for the vehicle under this section, as follows:
(i) If the vehicle being modified is a complete tractor in a certified configuration, the certifying manufacturer has no additional responsibilities for the vehicle under this section.
(ii) If the vehicle being modified is partially complete only because it lacks body components to the rear of the b-pillar (but is otherwise a complete tractor in a certified configuration), the certifying manufacturer has no additional responsibilities for the vehicle under this section.
(iii) If the vehicle being modified is an incomplete tractor not in a certified configuration, the certifying manufacturer must comply with the provisions of § 1037.621 for the vehicle.
(3) The secondary vehicle manufacturer must add a permanent supplemental label to the vehicle near the
original manufacturer's emission control information label. On the label identify your corporate name and include the statement: “THIS TRACTOR WAS MODIFIED UNDER 40 CFR 1037.622.”
(4) See § 1037.150 for additional interim options that may apply.
(5) The provisions of this paragraph (d) may apply separately for vehicle greenhouse gas, evaporative, and refueling emission standards.
(6) Modifications under this paragraph (d) do not violate 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1).
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 29787, Apr. 22, 2024]
§ 1037.630
Special purpose tractors.
(a)
General provisions.
This section allows a vehicle manufacturer to reclassify certain tractors as vocational tractors. Vocational tractors are treated as vocational vehicles and are exempt from the standards of § 1037.106. Note that references to “tractors” outside of this section mean non-vocational tractors.
(1) This allowance is intended only for vehicles that do not typically operate at highway speeds, or would otherwise not benefit from efficiency improvements designed for line-haul tractors. This allowance is limited to the following vehicle and application types:
(i) Low-roof tractors intended for intra-city pickup and delivery, such as those that deliver bottled beverages to retail stores.
(ii) Tractors intended for off-road operation (including mixed service operation that does not qualify for an exemption under § 1037.631), such as those with reinforced frames and increased ground clearance. This includes drayage tractors.
(iii) Model year 2020 and earlier tractors with a gross combination weight rating (GCWR) at or above 120,000 pounds. Note that Phase 2 and later tractors meeting the definition of
heavy-haul tractor
in § 1037.801 must be certified to the heavy-haul standards in § 1037.106 or § 1037.670.
(2) Where we determine that a manufacturer is not applying this allowance in good faith, we may require the manufacturer to obtain preliminary approval before using this allowance.
(b)
Requirements.
The following requirements apply with respect to tractors reclassified under this section:
(1) The vehicle must fully conform to all requirements applicable to vocational vehicles under this part.
(2) Vehicles reclassified under this section must be certified as a separate vehicle family. However, they remain part of the vocational regulatory subcategory and averaging set that applies for their service class.
(3) You must include the following additional statement on the vehicle's emission control information label under § 1037.135: “THIS VEHICLE WAS CERTIFIED AS A VOCATIONAL TRACTOR UNDER 40 CFR 1037.630.”
(4) You must keep records for three years to document your basis for believing the vehicles will be used as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Include in your application for certification a brief description of your basis.
(c)
Production limit.
No manufacturer may produce more than 21,000 Phase 1 vehicles under this section in any consecutive three model year period. This means you may not exceed 6,000 in a given model year if the combined total for the previous two years was 15,000. The production limit applies with respect to all Class 7 and Class 8 Phase 1 tractors certified or exempted as vocational tractors. No production limit applies for tractors subject to Phase 2 and later standards.
(d)
Off-road exemption.
All the provisions of this section apply for vocational tractors exempted under § 1037.631, except as follows:
(1) The vehicles are required to comply with the requirements of § 1037.631 instead of the requirements that would otherwise apply to vocational vehicles. Vehicles complying with the requirements of § 1037.631 and using an engine certified to the standards of 40 CFR part 1036 are deemed to fully conform to all requirements applicable to vocational vehicles under this part.
(2) The vehicles must be labeled as specified under § 1037.631 instead of as
specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 29787, Apr. 22, 2024]
§ 1037.631
Exemption for vocational vehicles intended for off-road use.
This section provides an exemption from the greenhouse gas standards of this part for certain vocational vehicles (including certain vocational tractors) that are intended to be used extensively in off-road environments such as forests, oil fields, and construction sites. This section does not exempt engines used in vocational vehicles from the standards of 40 CFR part 86 or part 1036. Note that you may not include these exempted vehicles in any credit calculations under this part.
(a)
Qualifying criteria.
Vocational vehicles intended for off-road use are exempt without request, subject to the provisions of this section, if they are primarily designed to perform work off-road (such as in oil fields, mining, forests, or construction sites), and they meet at least one of the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and at least one of the criteria of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. See § 1037.105(h) for alternate Phase 2 and Phase 3 standards that apply for vehicles meeting only one of these sets of criteria.
(1) The vehicle must have affixed components designed to work inherently in an off-road environment (such as hazardous material equipment or off-road drill equipment) or be designed to operate at low speeds such that it is unsuitable for normal highway operation.
(2) The vehicle must meet one of the following criteria:
(i) Have an axle that has a gross axle weight rating (GAWR) at or above 29,000 pounds.
(ii) Have a speed attainable in 2.0 miles of not more than 33 mi/hr.
(iii) Have a speed attainable in 2.0 miles of not more than 45 mi/hr, an unloaded vehicle weight that is not less than 95 percent of its gross vehicle weight rating, and no capacity to carry occupants other than the driver and operating crew.
(iv) Have a maximum speed at or below 54 mi/hr. You may consider the vehicle to be appropriately speed-limited if engine speed at 54 mi/hr is at or above 95 percent of the engine's maximum test speed in the highest available gear. You may alternatively limit vehicle speed by programming the engine or vehicle's electronic control module in a way that is tamper-proof.
(b)
Tractors.
The provisions of this section may apply for tractors only if each tractor qualifies as a vocational tractor under § 1037.630.
(c)
Recordkeeping and reporting.
(1) You must keep records to document that your exempted vehicle configurations meet all applicable requirements of this section. Keep these records for at least eight years after you stop producing the exempted vehicle model. We may review these records at any time.
(2) You must also keep records of the individual exempted vehicles you produce, including the vehicle identification number and a description of the vehicle configuration.
(3) Within 90 days after the end of each model year, you must send to the Designated Compliance Officer a report with the following information:
(i) A description of each exempted vehicle configuration, including an explanation of why it qualifies for this exemption.
(ii) The number of vehicles exempted for each vehicle configuration.
(d)
Labeling.
You must include the following additional statement on the vehicle's emission control information label under § 1037.135: “THIS VEHICLE WAS EXEMPTED UNDER 40 CFR 1037.631.”
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 29788, Apr. 22, 2024]
§ 1037.635
Glider kits and glider vehicles.
Except as specified in § 1037.150, the requirements of this section apply beginning January 1, 2017.
(a) Vehicles produced from glider kits and other glider vehicles are subject to the same standards as other new vehicles, including the applicable vehicle standards described in Subpart B of this part. Note that this requirement for the vehicle generally applies even if the engine meets the criteria of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For engines originally produced before 2017, if you are unable to obtain a fuel map for
an engine you may ask to use a default map, consistent with good engineering judgment.
(b) Section 1037.601(a)(1) disallows the introduction into U.S. commerce of a new tractor or vocational vehicle (including a vehicle assembled from a glider kit) unless it has an engine that is certified to the applicable standards in 40 CFR parts 86 and 1036. Except as specified otherwise in this part, the standards apply for engines used in glider vehicles as follows:
(1) The engine must meet the greenhouse gas standards of 40 CFR part 1036 that apply for the engine model year corresponding to the vehicle's date of manufacture. For example, for a vehicle with a 2024 date of manufacture, the engine must meet the greenhouse gas standards that apply for model year 2024.
(2) The engine must meet the criteria pollutant standards of 40 CFR part 86 or 40 CFR part 1036 that apply for the engine model year corresponding to the vehicle's date of manufacture.
(3) The engine may be from an earlier model year if the standards were identical to the currently applicable engine standards.
(4) Note that alternate standards or requirements may apply under § 1037.150.
(c) The engine standards identified in paragraph (b) of this section do not apply for certain engines when used in glider kits. These engines remain subject to the standards to which they were previously certified.
(1) The allowance in this paragraph (c) applies only for the following engines:
(i) Certified engines still within their original useful life in terms of both miles and years. Glider vehicles produced using engines meeting this criterion are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if the glider vehicle configuration is identical to a configuration previously certified to the requirements of this part 1037 for a model year the same as or later than the model year of the engine.
(ii) Certified engines of any age with less than 100,000 miles of engine operation. This is intended for specialty vehicles (such as fire trucks) that have very low usage rates. These vehicles are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, provided the completed vehicle is returned to the owner of the engine in a configuration equivalent to that of the donor vehicle.
(iii) Certified engines less than three years old with any number of accumulated miles of engine operation. Vehicles using these engines must comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
(2) For remanufactured engines, these eligibility criteria apply based on the original date of manufacture rather than the date of remanufacture. For example, an engine originally manufactured in 2003 that is remanufactured in 2012 after 350,000 miles, then accumulates an additional 150,000 miles before being installed in a model year 2020 glider would be considered to be 17 years old and to have accumulated 500,000 miles.
(3) The provisions of this paragraph (c) apply only where you can show that one or more criteria have been met. For example, to apply the criterion of paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii), you must be able prove the number of miles the engine has accumulated.
(d) All engines used in glider vehicles (including remanufactured engines) must be in a certified configuration and properly labeled. This requirement applies equally to any engine covered by this section. Depending on the model year of the engine (and other applicable provisions of this section), it may be permissible for the engine to remain in its original certified configuration or another configuration of the same original model year. However, it may be necessary to modify the engine to a newer certified configuration.
(e) The following additional provisions apply:
(1) The Clean Air Act definition of “manufacturer” includes anyone who assembles motor vehicles, including entities that install engines in or otherwise complete assembly of glider kits.
(2) Vehicle manufacturers (including assemblers) producing glider vehicles must comply with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements in § 1037.250.
(3) Manufacturers of glider kits providing glider kits for the purpose of allowing another manufacturer to assemble vehicles under this section are subject to the provisions of §§ 1037.620 through 1037.622, as applicable. For example, introducing an uncertified glider kit into U.S. commerce may subject you to penalties under 40 CFR 1068.101 if the completed glider vehicle does not conform fully with the regulations of the part at any point before being placed into service.
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 86 FR 34490, June 29, 2021; 88 FR 4653, Jan. 24, 2023; 89 FR 29788, Apr. 22, 2024]
§ 1037.640
Variable vehicle speed limiters.
This section specifies provisions that apply for vehicle speed limiters (VSLs) that you model under § 1037.520. This section is written to apply for tractors; however, you may use good engineering judgment to apply equivalent adjustments for Phase 2 and later vocational vehicles with vehicle speed limiters.
(a)
General.
The regulations of this part do not constrain how you may design VSLs for your vehicles. For example, you may design your VSL to have a single fixed speed limit or a soft-top speed limit. You may also design your VSL to expire after accumulation of a predetermined number of miles. However, designs with soft tops or expiration features are subject to proration provisions under this section that do not apply to fixed VSLs that do not expire.
(b)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:
(1) Default speed limit means the speed limit that normally applies for the vehicle, except as follows:
(i) The default speed limit for adjustable VSLs must represent the speed limit that applies when the VSL is adjusted to its highest setting under paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii) For VSLs with soft tops, the default speed does not include speeds possible only during soft-top operation.
(iii) For expiring VSLs, the default does not include speeds that are possible only after expiration.
(2) Soft-top speed limit means the highest speed limit that applies during soft-top operation.
(3) Maximum soft-top duration means the maximum amount of time that a vehicle could operate above the default speed limit.
(4) Certified VSL means a VSL configuration that applies when a vehicle is new and until it expires.
(5) Expiration point means the mileage at which a vehicle's certified VSL expires (or the point at which tamper protections expire).
(6) Effective speed limit has the meaning given in paragraph (d) of this section.
(c)
Adjustments.
You may design your VSL to be adjustable; however, this may affect the value you use in GEM.
(1) Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, any adjustments that can be made to the engine, vehicle, or their controls that change the VSL's actual speed limit are considered to be adjustable operating parameters. Compliance is based on the vehicle being adjusted to the highest speed limit within this range.
(2) The following adjustments are not adjustable parameters:
(i) Adjustments made only to account for changing tire size or final drive ratio.
(ii) Adjustments protected by encrypted controls or passwords.
(iii) Adjustments possible only after the VSL's expiration point.
(d)
Effective speed limit.
(1) For VSLs without soft tops or expiration points that expire before 1,259,000 miles, the effective speed limit is the highest speed limit that results by adjusting the VSL or other vehicle parameters consistent with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) For VSLs with soft tops and/or expiration points, the effective speed limit is calculated as specified in this paragraph (d)(2), which is based on 10 hours of operation per day (394 miles per day for day cabs and 551 miles per day for sleeper cabs). Note that this calculation assumes that a fraction of this operation is speed-limited (3.9 hours and 252 miles for day cabs, and 7.3 hours and 474 miles for sleeper cabs). Use the following equation to calculate the effective speed limit, rounded to the nearest 0.1 mi/hr:
ER25OC16.152
Where:
ExF = expiration point miles/1,259,000 miles.
STF = the maximum number of allowable soft top operation hours per day/3.9 hours for day cabs (or maximum miles per day/252), or the maximum number of allowable soft top operation hours per day/7.3 hours for sleeper cabs (or maximum miles per day/474).
STSL = the soft-top speed limit.
DSL = the default speed limit.

§ 1037.645
In-use compliance with family emission limits (FELs).
Section 1037.225 describes how to change the FEL for a vehicle family during the model year. This section, which describes how you may ask us to increase a vehicle family's FEL after the end of the model year, is intended to address circumstances in which it is in the public interest to apply a higher in-use FEL based on forfeiting an appropriate number of emission credits. For example, this may be appropriate where we determine that recalling vehicles would not significantly reduce in-use emissions. We will generally not allow this option where we determine the credits being forfeited would likely have expired.
(a) You may ask us to increase a vehicle family's FEL after the end of the model year if you believe some of your in-use vehicles exceed the CO
2
FEL that applied during the model year (or the CO
2
emission standard if the family did not generate or use emission credits). We may consider any available information in making our decision to approve or deny your request.
(b) If we approve your request under this section, you must apply emission credits to cover the increased FEL for all affected vehicles. Apply the emission credits as part of your credit demonstration for the current production year. Include the appropriate calculations in your final report under § 1037.730.
(c) Submit your request to the Designated Compliance Officer. Include the following in your request:
(1) Identify the names of each vehicle family that is the subject of your request. Include separate family names for different model years
(2) Describe why your request does not apply for similar vehicle models or additional model years, as applicable.
(3) Identify the FEL that applied during the model year for each configuration and recommend replacement FELs for in-use vehicles; include a supporting rationale to describe how you determined the recommended replacement FELs.
(4) Describe whether the needed emission credits will come from averaging, banking, or trading.
(d) If we approve your request, we will identify one or more replacement FELs, as follows:
(1) Where your vehicle family includes more than one sub-family with different FELs, we may apply a higher FEL within the family than was applied to the vehicle's configuration in your final ABT report. For example, if your vehicle family included three sub-families, with FELs of 200 g/ton-mile, 210 g/ton-mile, and 220 g/ton-mile, we may apply a 220 g/ton-mile in-use FEL to vehicles that were originally designated as part of the 200 g/ton-mile or 210 g/ton-mile sub-families.
(2) Without regard to the number of sub-families in your certified vehicle family, we may specify one or more new sub-families with higher FELs than you included in your final ABT report. We may apply these higher FELs as in-use FELs for your vehicles. For example, if your vehicle family included three sub-families, with FELs of 200 g/ton-mile, 210 g/ton-mile, and 220 g/ton-mile, we may specify a new 230 g/ton-mile sub-family.
(3) Our selected values for the replacement FEL will reflect our best
judgment to accurately reflect the actual in-use performance of your vehicles, consistent with the testing provisions specified in this part.
(4) We may apply the higher FELs to other vehicle families from the same or different model years to the extent they used equivalent emission controls. We may include any appropriate conditions with our approval.
(e) If we order a recall for a vehicle family under 40 CFR 1068.505, we will no longer approve a replacement FEL under this section for any of your vehicles from that vehicle family, or from any other vehicle family that relies on equivalent emission controls.
§ 1037.655
Post-useful life vehicle modifications.
(a)
General.
Vehicle modifications during and after the useful life are presumed to violate 42 U.S.C. 7522(a)(3)(A) if they involve removing or rendering inoperative any emission control device installed to comply with the requirements of this part 1037. This section specifies vehicle modifications that may occur in certain circumstances after a vehicle reaches the end of its regulatory useful life. EPA may require a higher burden of proof with respect to modifications that occur within the useful life period, and the specific examples presented here do not necessarily apply within the useful life. This section also does not apply with respect to engine modifications or recalibrations.
(b)
Allowable modifications.
You may modify a vehicle for the purpose of reducing emissions, provided you have a reasonable technical basis for knowing that such modification will not increase emissions of any other pollutant. “Reasonable technical basis” has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1068.30. This generally requires you to have information that would lead an engineer or other person familiar with engine and vehicle design and function to reasonably believe that the modifications will not increase emissions of any regulated pollutant.
(c)
Examples of allowable modifications.
The following are examples of allowable modifications:
(1) It is generally allowable to remove tractor roof fairings after the end of the vehicle's useful life if the vehicle will no longer be used primarily to pull box vans.
(2) Other fairings may be removed after the end of the vehicle's useful life if the vehicle will no longer be used significantly on highways with a vehicle speed of 55 miles per hour or higher.
(d)
Examples of prohibited modifications.
The following are examples of modifications that are not allowable:
(1) No person may disable a vehicle speed limiter prior to its expiration point.
(2) No person may remove aerodynamic fairings from tractors that are used primarily to pull box vans on highways.
§ 1037.660
Idle-reduction technologies.
This section specifies requirements that apply for idle-reduction technologies modeled under § 1037.520. It does not apply for idle-reduction technologies you do not model under § 1037.520.
(a)
Minimum requirements.
Idle-reduction technologies must meet all the following requirements to be modeled under § 1037.520 except as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:
(1)
Automatic engine shutdown (AES) systems.
The system must shut down the engine within a threshold inactivity period of 60 seconds or less for vocational vehicles and 300 seconds or less for tractors when all the following conditions are met:
(i) The transmission is set to park, or the transmission is in neutral with the parking brake engaged. This is “parked idle.”
(ii) The operator has not reset the system timer within the specified threshold inactivity period by changing the position of the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedal; or by resetting the system timer with some other mechanism we approve.
(iii) You may identify systems as “tamper-resistant” if you make no provision for vehicle owners, dealers, or other service outlets to adjust the threshold inactivity period.
(iv) For Phase 2 and later tractors, you may identify AES systems as “adjustable” if, before delivering to the ultimate purchaser, you enable authorized dealers to modify the vehicle in a
way that disables the AES system or makes the threshold inactivity period longer than 300 seconds. However, the vehicle may not be delivered to the ultimate purchaser with the AES system disabled or the threshold inactivity period set longer than 300 seconds. You may allow dealers or repair facilities to make such modifications; this might involve password protection for electronic controls, or special tools that only you provide. Any dealers making any modifications before delivery to the ultimate purchaser must notify you, and you must account for such modifications in your production and ABT reports after the end of the model year. Dealers failing to provide prompt notification are in violation of the tampering prohibition of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1). Dealer notifications are deemed to be submissions to EPA. Note that these adjustments may not be made if the AES system was not “adjustable” when first delivered to the ultimate purchaser.
(v) For vocational vehicles, you may use the provisions of § 1037.610 to apply for an appropriate partial emission reduction for AES systems you identify as “adjustable.”
(2)
Neutral idle.
Phase 2 and later vehicles with hydrokinetic torque converters paired with automatic transmissions qualify for neutral-idle credit in GEM modeling if the transmission reduces torque equivalent to shifting into neutral throughout the interval during which the vehicle's brake pedal is depressed and the vehicle is at a zero-speed condition (beginning within five seconds of the vehicle reaching zero speed with the brake depressed). If a vehicle reduces torque partially but not enough to be equivalent to shifting to neutral, you may use the provisions of § 1037.610(g) to apply for an appropriate partial emission reduction; this may involve A to B testing with the powertrain test procedure in 40 CFR 1036.545 or the spin-loss portion of the transmission efficiency test in § 1037.565.
(3)
Stop-start.
Phase 2 and later vocational vehicles qualify for stop-start reduction in GEM modeling if the engine shuts down no more than 5 seconds after the vehicle's brake pedal is depressed when the vehicle is at a zero-speed condition.
(b)
Override conditions
. The system may limit activation of the idle-reduction technology while any of the conditions of this paragraph (b) apply. These conditions allow the system to delay engine shutdown, adjust engine restarting, or delay disengaging transmissions, but do not allow for resetting timers. Engines may restart and transmissions may re-engage during override conditions if the vehicle is set up to do this automatically. We may approve additional override criteria as needed to protect the engine and vehicle from damage and to ensure safe vehicle operation.
(1) For AES systems on tractors, the system may delay shutdown—
(i) When an exhaust emission control device is regenerating. The period considered to be regeneration for purposes of this allowance must be consistent with good engineering judgment and may differ in length from the period considered to be regeneration for other purposes. For example, in some cases it may be appropriate to include a cool down period for this purpose but not for infrequent regeneration adjustment factors.
(ii) When the vehicle's main battery state-of-charge is not sufficient to allow the main engine to be restarted.
(iii) When the vehicle's transmission, fuel, oil, or engine coolant temperature is too low or too high according to the manufacturer's specifications for protecting against system damage. This allows the engine to continue operating until it is in a predefined temperature range, within which the shutdown sequence of paragraph (a) of this section would resume.
(iv) When the vehicle's main engine is operating in power take-off (PTO) mode. For purposes of this paragraph (b), an engine is considered to be in PTO mode when a switch or setting designating PTO mode is enabled.
(v) When external ambient conditions prevent managing cabin temperatures for the driver's safety.
(vi) When necessary while servicing the vehicle, provided the deactivation of the AES system is accomplished using a diagnostic scan tool. The system must be automatically reactivated
when the engine is shut down for more than 60 minutes.
(2) For AES systems on vocational vehicles, the system may limit activation—
(i) When any condition specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (v) of this section applies.
(ii) When the engine compartment is open.
(3) For neutral idle, the system may delay shifting the transmission to neutral—
(i) When the system meets the PTO conditions specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section.
(ii) When the transmission is in reverse gear.
(iii) When the vehicle is ascending or descending a road with grade at or above 6.0%.
(4) For stop-start, the system may limit activation—
(i) When any condition specified in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section applies.
(ii) When air brake pressure is too low according to the manufacturer's specifications for maintaining vehicle-braking capability.
(iii) When an automatic transmission is in “park” or “neutral” and the parking brake is engaged.
(iv) When recent vehicle speeds indicate an abnormally high shutdown and restart frequency, such as with congested driving. For example, a vehicle not exceeding 10 mi/hr for the previous 300 seconds or since the most recent engine start would be a proper basis for overriding engine shutdown. You may also design this override to protect against system damage or malfunction of safety systems.
(v) When the vehicle detects that a system or component is worn or malfunctioning in a way that could reasonably prevent the engine from restarting, such as low battery voltage.
(vi) When the steering angle is at or near the limit of travel.
(vii) When flow of diesel exhaust fluid is limited due to freezing.
(viii) When a sensor failure could prevent the anti-lock braking system from properly detecting vehicle speed.
(ix) When a protection mode designed to prevent component failure is active.
(x) When a fault on a system component needed for starting the engine is active.
(c)
Adjustments to AES systems for Phase 1.
(1) The AES system may include an expiration point (in miles) after which the AES system may be disabled. If your vehicle is equipped with an AES system that expires before 1,259,000 miles, adjust the model input as follows, rounded to the nearest 0.1 g/ton-mile: AES Input = 5 g CO
2
/ton-mile × (miles at expiration/1,259,000 miles).
(2) For AES systems designed to limit idling to a specific number of hours less than 1,800 hours over any 12-month period, calculate an adjusted AES input using the following equation, rounded to the nearest 0.1 g/ton-mile: AES Input = 5 g CO
2
/ton-mile × (1—(maximum allowable number of idling hours per year/1,800 hours)). This is an annual allowance that starts when the vehicle is new and resets every 12 months after that. Manufacturers may propose an alternate method based on operating hours or miles instead of years.
(d)
Adjustable parameters.
Provisions that apply generally with respect to adjustable parameters also apply to the AES system operating parameters, except the following are not considered to be adjustable parameters:
(1) Accelerator, brake, and clutch pedals, with respect to resetting the idle timer. Parameters associated with other timer reset mechanisms we approve are also not adjustable parameters.
(2) Bypass parameters allowed for vehicle service under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(3) Parameters that are adjustable only after the expiration point.
(e)
PM limit for diesel APU.
For model year 2020 and earlier tractors with a date of manufacture on or after January 1, 2018, the GEM credit for AES systems with OEM-installed diesel APUs is valid only if the engine is certified under 40 CFR part 1039 with a deteriorated emission level for particulate matter at or below 0.15 g/kW-hr, or if
the engine or APU is certified to the standards specified in § 1037.106(g).

§ 1037.665
Production and in-use tractor testing.
We may require manufacturers with annual U.S.-directed production volumes of greater than 20,000 tractors to perform testing as described in this section. Tractors may be new or used.
(a) Test model year 2021 and later tractors as follows:
(1) Each calendar year, we may require you to select for testing three sleeper cabs and two day cabs certified to Phase 1 or Phase 2 standards. If we do not identify certain vehicle configurations for your testing, select models that you project to be among your 12 highest-selling vehicle configurations for the given year.
(2) Set up the tractors on a chassis dynamometer and operate them over all applicable duty cycles from § 1037.510(a)(3). You may use emission-measurement systems meeting the specifications of 40 CFR part 1065, subpart J. Calculate coefficients for the road-load force equation as described in Section 10 of SAE J1263 or Section 11 of SAE J2263 (both incorporated by reference, see § 1037.810). Use standard payload. Measure emissions of NO
X
, PM, CO, NMHC, CO
2
, CH
4
, and N
2
O. Determine emission levels in g/ton-mile.
(b) Send us an annual report with your test results for each duty cycle and the corresponding GEM results. Send the report by the next October 1 after the year we select the vehicles for testing, or a later date that we approve. We may make your test data publicly available.
(c) We may approve your request to perform alternative testing that will provide equivalent or better information compared to the specified testing. For example, we may allow you to provide CO
2
data from in-use operation or from manufacturer-run on-road testing as long as it allows for reasonable year-to-year comparisons and includes testing from production vehicles. We may also direct you to do less testing than we specify in this section.
(d) Greenhouse gas standards do not apply with respect to testing under this section. Note however that NTE standards apply for any qualifying operation that occurs during the testing in the same way that it would during any other in-use testing.

Note that these standards are not directly comparable to the standards for Heavy-Haul Tractors in § 1037.106 because GEM handles aerodynamic performance differently for the two sets of standards.
(b) Determine subcategories as described in § 1037.230 for tractors that are not heavy-haul tractors. For example, the subcategory for tractors that would otherwise be considered Class 8 low-roof day cabs would be Heavy Class 8 Low-Roof Day Cabs and would be
identified as HC8__DC__LR for the GEM run.
(c) Except for the CO
2
standards of § 1037.106, all provisions applicable to tractors under this part continue to apply to tractors certified to the standards of this section. Include the following compliance statement on your label instead of the statement specified in § 1037.135(c)(8): “THIS VEHICLE COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA REGULATIONS FOR [MODEL YEAR] HEAVY-DUTY VEHICLES UNDER 40 CFR 1037.670.”
(d) The optional emission standards in this section are intended primarily for tractors that will be exported; however, you may include any tractors certified under this section in your emission credit calculation under § 1037.705 if they are part of your U.S.-directed production volume.

# Subpart H—Averaging, Banking, and Trading for Certification
§ 1037.701
General provisions.
(a) You may average, bank, and trade emission credits for purposes of certification as described in this subpart and in subpart B of this part to show compliance with the standards of §§ 1037.105 and 1037.106. Note that § 1037.105(h) specifies standards involving limited or no use of emission credits under this subpart. Participation in this program is voluntary.
(b) The definitions of subpart I of this part apply to this subpart in addition to the following definitions:
(1)
Actual emission credits
means emission credits you have generated that we have verified by reviewing your final report.
(2)
Averaging set
means a set of vehicles in which emission credits may be exchanged. Note that an averaging set may comprise more than one regulatory subcategory. See § 1037.740.
(3)
Broker
means any entity that facilitates a trade of emission credits between a buyer and seller.
(4)
Buyer
means the entity that receives emission credits as a result of a trade.
(5)
Reserved emission credits
means emission credits you have generated that we have not yet verified by reviewing your final report.
(6)
Seller
means the entity that provides emission credits during a trade.
(7)
Standard
means the emission standard that applies under subpart B of this part for vehicles not participating in the ABT program of this subpart.
(8)
Trade
means to exchange emission credits, either as a buyer or seller.
(c) Emission credits may be exchanged only within an averaging set, except as specified in § 1037.740.
(d) You may not use emission credits generated under this subpart to offset any emissions that exceed an FEL or standard, except as allowed by § 1037.645.
(e) You may use either of the following approaches to retire or forego emission credits:
(1) You may trade emission credits generated from any number of your vehicles to the vehicle purchasers or other parties to retire the credits. Identify any such credits in the reports described in § 1037.730. Vehicles must comply with the applicable FELs even if you donate or sell the corresponding emission credits under this paragraph (e). Those credits may no longer be used by anyone to demonstrate compliance with any EPA emission standards.
(2) You may certify a family using an FEL below the emission standard as described in this part and choose not to generate emission credits for that family. If you do this, you do not need to calculate emission credits for those families and you do not need to submit or keep the associated records described in this subpart for that family.
(f) Emission credits may be used in the model year they are generated. Where we allow it, surplus emission credits may be banked for future model years. Surplus emission credits may sometimes be used for past model years, as described in § 1037.745. You may not apply banked or traded credits in a given model year until you have used all available credits through averaging to resolve credit balances for that model year.
(g) You may increase or decrease an FEL during the model year by amending your application for certification under § 1037.225. The new FEL may apply only to vehicles you have not already introduced into commerce.
(h) See § 1037.740 for special credit provisions that apply for credits generated under 40 CFR 86.1819-14(k)(7) or 1036.615 or § 1037.615.
(i) Unless the regulations in this part explicitly allow it, you may not calculate Phase 1 credits more than once for any emission reduction. For example, if you generate Phase 1 CO
2
emission credits for a given hybrid vehicle under this part, no one may generate CO
2
emission credits for the associated hybrid engine under 40 CFR part 1036. However, Phase 1 credits could be generated for identical engines used in vehicles that did not generate credits under this part.
(j) You may use emission credits generated under the Phase 1 standards when certifying vehicles to Phase 2 standards. No credit adjustments are required other than corrections for different useful lives.
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 86 FR 34491, June 29, 2021; 89 FR 29789, Apr. 22, 2024]
§ 1037.705
Generating and calculating CO
2
emission credits.
(a) The provisions of this section apply separately for calculating CO
2
emission credits for each pollutant.
(b) For each participating family or subfamily, calculate positive or negative emission credits relative to the otherwise applicable emission standard. Calculate positive emission credits for a family or subfamily that has an FEL below the standard. Calculate negative emission credits for a family or subfamily that has an FEL above the standard. Sum your positive and negative credits for the model year before rounding. Round the sum of emission credits to the nearest megagram (Mg), using consistent units with the following equation:
Emission credits
(Mg) = (
Std
−
FEL
) ·
PL

UL
· 10
−

# Eq. 1037.705-1
Where:
Std
= the emission standard associated with the specific regulatory subcategory (g/ton-mile).
FEL
= the family emission limit for the vehicle subfamily (g/ton-mile).
PL
= standard payload, in tons.
Volume
= U.S.-directed production volume of the vehicle subfamily, subject to the exclusions described in paragraph (c) of this section. For example, if you produce three configurations with the same FEL, the subfamily production volume would be the sum of the production volumes for these three configurations.
UL
= useful life of the vehicle, in miles, as described in §§ 1037.105 and 1037.106.
(c) Compliance with the requirements of this subpart is determined at the end of the model year by calculating emission credits based on actual production volumes, excluding any of the following vehicles:
(1) Vehicles that you do not certify to the CO
2
standards of this part because they are permanently exempted under subpart G of this part or under 40 CFR part 1068.
(2) Exported vehicles even if they are certified under this part and labeled accordingly.
(3) Vehicles not subject to the requirements of this part, such as those excluded under § 1037.5.
(4) Any other vehicles, where we indicate elsewhere in this part that they are not to be included in the calculations of this subpart.
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 86 FR 34491, June 29, 2021; 88 FR 4653, Jan. 24, 2023; 89 FR 29789, Apr. 22, 2024]
§ 1037.710
Averaging.
(a) Averaging is the exchange of emission credits among your vehicle families. You may average emission credits only within the same averaging set, except as specified in § 1037.740.
(b) You may certify one or more vehicle families (or subfamilies) to an FEL above the applicable standard, subject to any applicable FEL caps and other provisions in subpart B of this part, if you show in your application for certification that your projected balance of all emission-credit transactions in that model year is greater than or equal to zero or that a negative balance is allowed under § 1037.745.
(c) If you certify a vehicle family to an FEL that exceeds the otherwise applicable standard, you must obtain enough emission credits to offset the vehicle family's deficit by the due date for the final report required in § 1037.730. The emission credits used to address the deficit may come from your other vehicle families that generate emission credits in the same model year (or from later model years as specified in § 1037.745), from emission credits you have banked from previous model years, or from emission credits generated in the same or previous model years that you obtained through trading.
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 29790, Apr. 22, 2024]
§ 1037.715
Banking.
(a) Banking is the retention of surplus emission credits by the manufacturer generating the emission credits for use in future model years for averaging or trading.
(b) You may designate any emission credits you plan to bank in the reports you submit under § 1037.730 as reserved credits. During the model year and before the due date for the final report, you may designate your reserved emission credits for averaging or trading.
(c) Reserved credits become actual emission credits when you submit your final report. However, we may revoke these emission credits if we are unable to verify them after reviewing your reports or auditing your records.
(d) Banked credits retain the designation of the averaging set in which they were generated.
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 29790, Apr. 22, 2024]
§ 1037.720
Trading.
(a) Trading is the exchange of emission credits between manufacturers, or the transfer of credits to another party to retire them. You may use traded emission credits for averaging, banking, or further trading transactions. Traded emission credits remain subject to the averaging-set restrictions based on the averaging set in which they were generated.
(b) You may trade actual emission credits as described in this subpart. You may also trade reserved emission credits, but we may revoke these emission credits based on our review of your records or reports or those of the company with which you traded emission credits. You may trade banked credits within an averaging set to any certifying manufacturer.
(c) If a negative emission credit balance results from a transaction, both the buyer and seller are liable, except in cases we deem to involve fraud. See § 1037.255(e) for cases involving fraud. We may void the certificates of all vehicle families participating in a trade that results in a manufacturer having a negative balance of emission credits. See § 1037.745.
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 29790, Apr. 22, 2024]
§ 1037.725
Required information for certification.
(a) You must declare in your application for certification your intent to use the provisions of this subpart for each vehicle family that will be certified using the ABT program. You must also declare the FELs you select for the vehicle family or subfamily for each pollutant for which you are using the ABT program. Your FELs must comply with the specifications of subpart B of this part, including the FEL caps. FELs must be expressed to the same number of decimal places as the applicable standards.
(b) Include the following in your application for certification:
(1) A statement that, to the best of your belief, you will not have a negative balance of emission credits for any averaging set when all emission credits are calculated at the end of the year; or a statement that you will have a negative balance of emission credits for one or more averaging sets but that it is allowed under § 1037.745.
(2) Calculations of projected emission credits (positive or negative) based on projected U.S.-directed production volumes. We may require you to include similar calculations from your other vehicle families to project your net credit balances for the model year. If you project negative emission credits for a family or subfamily, state the source of positive emission credits you
expect to use to offset the negative emission credits.
§ 1037.730
ABT reports.
(a) If you certify any vehicle families using the ABT provisions of this subpart, send us a final report by September 30 following the end of the model year.
(b) Your report must include the following information for each vehicle family participating in the ABT program:
(1) Vehicle-family and subfamily designations, and averaging set.
(2) The regulatory subcategory and emission standards that would otherwise apply to the vehicle family.
(3) The FEL for each pollutant. If you change the FEL after the start of production, identify the date that you started using the new FEL and/or give the vehicle identification number for the first vehicle covered by the new FEL. In this case, identify each applicable FEL and calculate the positive or negative emission credits as specified in § 1037.225.
(4) The projected and actual production volumes for the model year for calculating emission credits. If you changed an FEL during the model year, identify the actual production volume associated with each FEL.
(5) Useful life.
(6) Calculated positive or negative emission credits for the whole vehicle family. Identify any emission credits that you traded, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(7) If you have a negative credit balance for the averaging set in the given model year, specify whether the vehicle family (or certain subfamilies with the vehicle family) have a credit deficit for the year. Consider for example, a manufacturer with three vehicle families (“A”, “B”, and “C”) in a given averaging set. If family A generates enough credits to offset the negative credits of family B but not enough to also offset the negative credits of family C (and the manufacturer has no banked credits in the averaging set), the manufacturer may designate families A and B as having no deficit for the model year, provided it designates family C as having a deficit for the model year.
(c) Your report must include the following additional information:
(1) Show that your net balance of emission credits from all your participating vehicle families in each averaging set in the applicable model year is not negative, except as allowed under § 1037.745. Your credit tracking must account for the limitation on credit life under § 1037.740(c).
(2) State whether you will retain any emission credits for banking. If you choose to retire emission credits that would otherwise be eligible for banking, identify the families that generated the emission credits, including the number of emission credits from each family.
(3) State that the report's contents are accurate.
(4) Identify the technologies that make up the certified configuration associated with each vehicle identification number. You may identify this as a range of identification numbers for vehicles involving a single, identical certified configuration.
(d) If you trade emission credits, you must send us a report within 90 days after the transaction, as follows:
(1) As the seller, you must include the following information in your report:
(i) The corporate names of the buyer and any brokers.
(ii) A copy of any contracts related to the trade.
(iii) The averaging set corresponding to the vehicle families that generated emission credits for the trade, including the number of emission credits from each averaging set.
(2) As the buyer, you must include the following information in your report:
(i) The corporate names of the seller and any brokers.
(ii) A copy of any contracts related to the trade.
(iii) How you intend to use the emission credits, including the number of emission credits you intend to apply for each averaging set.
(e) Send your reports electronically to the Designated Compliance Officer using an approved information format. If you want to use a different format, send us a written request with justification for a waiver.
(f) Correct errors in your report as follows:
(1) If you notify us by the deadline for submitting the final report that errors mistakenly decreased your balance of emission credits, you may correct the errors and recalculate the balance of emission credits. If you notify us that errors mistakenly decreased your balance of emission credits after the deadline for submitting the final report, you may correct the errors and recalculate the balance of emission credits after applying a 10 percent discount to the credit correction, but only if you notify us within 24 months after the deadline for submitting the final report. If you report a negative balance of emission credits, we may disallow corrections under this paragraph (f)(1).
(2) If you or we determine any time that errors mistakenly increased your balance of emission credits, you must correct the errors and recalculate the balance of emission credits.

§ 1037.735
Recordkeeping.
(a) You must organize and maintain your records as described in this section.
(b) Keep the records required by this section for at least eight years after the due date for the final report. You may not use emission credits for any vehicles if you do not keep all the records required under this section. You must therefore keep these records to continue to bank valid credits.
(c) Keep a copy of the reports we require in §§ 1037.725 and 1037.730.
(d) Keep records of the vehicle identification number for each vehicle you produce. You may identify these numbers as a range. If you change the FEL after the start of production, identify the date you started using each FEL and the range of vehicle identification numbers associated with each FEL. You must also identify the purchaser and destination for each vehicle you produce to the extent this information is available.
(e) We may require you to keep additional records or to send us relevant information not required by this section in accordance with the Clean Air Act.
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 88 FR 4653, Jan. 24, 2023]
§ 1037.740
Restrictions for using emission credits.
The following restrictions apply for using emission credits:
(a)
Averaging sets.
Except as specified in § 1037.105(h) and paragraph (b) of this section, emission credits may be exchanged only within an averaging set. The following principal averaging sets apply for vehicles certified to the standards of this part involving emission credits as described in this subpart:
(1) Light HDV.
(2) Medium HDV.
(3) Heavy HDV.
(4) Note that other separate averaging sets also apply for emission credits not related to this part. For example, vehicles certified to the greenhouse gas standards of 40 CFR part 86, subpart S, comprise a single averaging set. Separate averaging sets also apply for engines under 40 CFR part 1036, including engines used in vehicles subject to this subpart.
(b)
Credits from hybrid vehicles and other advanced technologies.
The following provisions apply for credits you generate under § 1037.615.
(1) Credits generated from Phase 1 vehicles may be used for any of the averaging sets identified in paragraph (a) of this section; you may also use those credits to demonstrate compliance with the CO
2
emission standards in 40 CFR part 86, subpart S, and 40 CFR part 1036. Similarly, you may use Phase 1 advanced-technology credits generated under 40 CFR 86.1819-14(k)(7) or 1036.615 to demonstrate compliance with the CO
2
standards in this part. The maximum amount of advanced-technology credits generated from Phase 1 vehicles that you may bring into each of the following service class groups is 60,000 Mg per model year:
(i) Spark-ignition HDE, Light HDE, and Light HDV. This group comprises the averaging set listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the averaging set listed in 40 CFR 1036.740(a)(1) and (2).
(ii) Medium HDE and Medium HDV. This group comprises the averaging sets listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and 40 CFR 1036.740(a)(3).
(iii) Heavy HDE and Heavy HDV. This group comprises the averaging sets listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and 40 CFR 1036.740(a)(4).
(iv) This paragraph (b)(1) does not limit the advanced-technology credits that can be used within a service class group if they were generated in that same service class group.
(2) Credits generated from Phase 2 and later vehicles are subject to the averaging-set restrictions that apply to other emission credits.
(c)
Credit life.
Banked credits may be used only for five model years after the year in which they are generated. For example, credits you generate in model year 2018 may be used to demonstrate compliance with emission standards only through model year 2023.
(d)
Other restrictions.
Other sections of this part specify additional restrictions for using emission credits under certain special provisions.
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 86 FR 34491, June 29, 2021; 88 FR 4653, Jan. 24, 2023; 89 FR 29790, Apr. 22, 2024]
§ 1037.745
End-of-year CO
2
credit deficits.
Except as allowed by this section, we may void the certificate of any vehicle family certified to an FEL above the applicable standard for which you do not have sufficient credits by the deadline for submitting the final report.
(a) Your certificate for a vehicle family for which you do not have sufficient CO
2
credits will not be void if you remedy the deficit with surplus credits within three model years. For example, if you have a credit deficit of 500 Mg for a vehicle family at the end of model year 2015, you must generate (or otherwise obtain) a surplus of at least 500 Mg in that same averaging set by the end of model year 2018.
(b) You may not bank or trade away CO
2
credits in the averaging set in any model year in which you have a deficit.
(c) You may apply only surplus credits to your deficit. You may not apply credits to a deficit from an earlier model year if they were generated in a model year for which any of your vehicle families for that averaging set had an end-of-year credit deficit.
(d) You must notify us in writing how you plan to eliminate the credit deficit within the specified time frame. If we determine that your plan is unreasonable or unrealistic, we may deny an application for certification for a vehicle family if its FEL would increase your credit deficit. We may determine that your plan is unreasonable or unrealistic based on a consideration of past and projected use of specific technologies, the historical sales mix of your vehicle models, your commitment to limit production of higher-emission vehicles, and expected access to traded credits. We may also consider your plan unreasonable if your credit deficit increases from one model year to the next. We may require that you send us interim reports describing your progress toward resolving your credit deficit over the course of a model year.
(e) If you do not remedy the deficit with surplus credits within three model years, we may void your certificate for that vehicle family. Note that voiding a certificate applies
ab initio.
Where the net deficit is less than the total amount of negative credits originally generated by the family, we will void the certificate only with respect to the number of vehicles needed to reach the amount of the net deficit. For example, if the original vehicle family generated 500 Mg of negative credits, and the manufacturer's net deficit after three years was 250 Mg, we would void the certificate with respect to half of the vehicles in the family.
(f) For purposes of calculating the statute of limitations, the following actions are all considered to occur at the expiration of the deadline for offsetting a deficit as specified in paragraph (a) of this section:
(1) Failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
(2) Failing to satisfy the conditions upon which a certificate was issued relative to offsetting a deficit.
(3) Selling, offering for sale, introducing or delivering into U.S. commerce, or importing vehicles that are found not to be covered by a certificate as a result of failing to offset a deficit.
[81 FR 74048, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 29790, Apr. 22, 2024]
§ 1037.750
What can happen if I do not comply with the provisions of this subpart?
(a) For each vehicle family participating in the ABT program, the certificate of conformity is conditioned upon full compliance with the provisions of this subpart during and after the model year. You are responsible to establish to our satisfaction that you fully comply with applicable requirements. We may void the certificate of conformity for a vehicle family if you fail to comply with any provisions of this subpart.
(b) You may certify your vehicle family or subfamily to an FEL above an applicable standard based on a projection that you will have enough emission credits to offset the deficit for the vehicle family. See § 1037.745 for provisions specifying what happens if you cannot show in your final report that you have enough actual emission credits to offset a deficit for any pollutant in a vehicle family.
(c) We may void the certificate of conformity for a vehicle family if you fail to keep records, send reports, or give us information we request. Note that failing to keep records, send reports, or give us information we request is also a violation of 42 U.S.C. 7522(a)(2).
(d) You may ask for a hearing if we void your certificate under this section (see § 1037.820).
§ 1037.755
Information provided to the Department of Transportation.
After receipt of each manufacturer's final report as specified in § 1037.730 and completion of any verification testing required to validate the manufacturer's submitted final data, we will issue a report to the Department of Transportation with CO
2
emission information and will verify the accuracy of each manufacturer's equivalent fuel consumption data required by NHTSA under 49 CFR 535.8. We will send a report to DOT for each vehicle manufacturer based on each regulatory category and subcategory, including sufficient information for NHTSA to determine fuel consumption and associated credit values. See 49 CFR 535.8 to determine if NHTSA deems submission of this information to EPA to also be a submission to NHTSA.

# Subpart I—Definitions and Other Reference Information

# Subpart A—Overview and Applicability
§ 1039.1
Does this part apply for my engines?
(a) The regulations in this part 1039 apply for all new, compression-ignition nonroad engines (defined in § 1039.801), except as provided in § 1039.5.
(b) This part 1039 applies as follows:
(1) This part 1039 applies for all engines subject to the emission standards specified in subpart B of this part starting with the model years noted in the following table:
Table 1 of § 1039.1—Part 1039 Applicability by Model Year

1
As described in § 1039.102, some engines below 19 kW may not be subject to the emission standards in this part until the 2010 model year.
2
As described in § 1039.102, some engines in the 19-56 kW power category may not be subject to the emission standards in this part until the 2012 model year.
(2) If you use the provisions of § 1039.104(a) to certify an engine to the emission standards of this part before the model years shown in Table 1 of this section, all the requirements of this part apply for those engines.
(3) Engines originally meeting Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 standards as specified in appendix I of this part remain subject to the standards in subpart B of this part. This includes uncertified engines that meet standards under 40 CFR 1068.265. Affected engines remain subject to recall provisions as specified in 40 CFR part 1068, subpart F, throughout the useful life corresponding to the original certification. Also, tampering and defeat-device prohibitions continue to apply for those engines as specified in 40 CFR 1068.101.
(4) This part 1039 applies for other compression-ignition engines as follows:
(i) The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section and § 1039.801 apply for stationary engines beginning January 1, 2006.
(ii) The provisions of § 1039.620 and § 1039.801 apply for engines used solely for competition beginning January 1, 2006.
(c) The definition of nonroad engine in 40 CFR 1068.30 excludes certain engines used in stationary applications. These engines may be required by 40 CFR part 60, subpart IIII, to comply with some of the provisions of this part; otherwise, these engines are only required to comply with the requirements in § 1039.20. In addition, the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101 restrict the use of stationary engines for nonstationary purposes unless they are certified to the same standards that would apply to certain nonroad engines for the same model year.
(d) In certain cases, the regulations in this part 1039 apply to engines at or above 250 kW that would otherwise be covered by 40 CFR part 1048. See 40 CFR 1048.620 for provisions related to this allowance.
[69 FR 39213, June 29, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 40462, July 13, 2005; 71 FR 39184, July 11, 2006; 86 FR 34499, June 29, 2021]
§ 1039.2
Who is responsible for compliance?
The regulations in this part 1039 contain provisions that affect both manufacturers and others. However, the requirements of this part are generally addressed to the manufacturer. The term “you” generally means the manufacturer, as defined in § 1039.801, especially for issues related to certification. Note that for engines that become new after being placed into service (such as engines converted from highway or stationary use), the requirements that normally apply for manufacturers of freshly manufactured engines apply to the importer or any other entity we allow to obtain a certificate of conformity.
[81 FR 74133, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1039.5
Which engines are excluded from this part's requirements?
This part does not apply to certain nonroad engines, as follows:
(a)
Locomotive engines.
(1) The following locomotive engines are not subject to the provisions of this part 1039:
(i) Engines in locomotives certified under 40 CFR part 1033.
(ii) Engines in locomotives that are exempt from the standards of 40 CFR
part 92 or 1033 pursuant to the provisions of 40 CFR part 1033 or 1068 (except for the provisions of 40 CFR 1033.150(e)).
(2) The following locomotive engines are subject to the provisions of this part 1039:
(i) Engines in locomotives exempt from 40 CFR part 1033 pursuant to the provisions of 40 CFR 1033.150(e).
(ii) Locomotive engines excluded from the definition of locomotive in 40 CFR 1033.901.
(iii) Locomotive engines produced under the provisions of 40 CFR 1033.625.
(b)
Marine engines.
(1) The following marine engines are not subject to the provisions of this part 1039:
(i) Engines subject to the standards of 40 CFR part 94.
(ii) Engines not subject to the standards of 40 CFR part 94 only because they were produced before the standards of 40 CFR part 94 started to apply.
(iii) Engines that are exempt from the standards of 40 CFR part 94 pursuant to the provisions of 40 CFR part 94 (except for the provisions of 40 CFR 94.907 or 94.912). For example, an engine that is exempt under 40 CFR 94.906 because it is a manufacturer-owned engine is not subject to the provisions of this part 1039.
(iv) Engines with rated power below 37 kW.
(v) Engines on foreign vessels.
(2) Marine engines are subject to the provisions of this part 1039 if they are exempt from 40 CFR part 94 based on the engine-dressing provisions of 40 CFR 94.907 or the common-family provisions of 40 CFR 94.912.

§ 1039.20
What requirements from this part apply to excluded stationary engines?
The provisions of this section apply for engines built on or after January 1, 2006.
(a) You must add a permanent label or tag to each new engine you produce or import that is excluded under § 1039.1(c) as a stationary engine and is not required by 40 CFR part 60, subpart IIII, to meet the requirements described in this part, or the requirements described in 40 CFR part 1042, that are equivalent to the requirements applicable to marine or land-based nonroad engines for the same model year. To meet labeling requirements, you must do the following things:
(1) Attach the label or tag in one piece so no one can remove it without destroying or defacing it.
(2) Secure it to a part of the engine needed for normal operation and not normally requiring replacement.
(3) Make sure it is durable and readable for the engine's entire life.
(4) Write it in English.
(5) Follow the requirements in § 1039.135(g) regarding duplicate labels if the engine label is obscured in the final installation.
(b) Engine labels or tags required under this section must have the following information:
(1) Include the heading “EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION.”
(2) Include your full corporate name and trademark.
(3) State the engine displacement (in liters) and maximum engine power (or in the case of fire pumps, NFPA nameplate engine power).

# Subpart B—Emission Standards and Related Requirements
§ 1039.101
What exhaust emission standards must my engines meet after the 2014 model year?
The exhaust emission standards of this section apply after the 2014 model year. Certain standards in this section also apply for model year 2014 and earlier. This section presents the full set of emission standards that apply after all the transition and phase-in provisions of §§ 1039.102 and 1039.104 expire. Section 1039.105 specifies smoke standards.
(a)
Emission standards for transient testing.
Transient exhaust emissions from your engines may not exceed the applicable emission standards in Table 1 of this section. Measure emissions
using the applicable transient test procedures described in subpart F of this part. The following engines are not subject to the transient standards in this paragraph (a):
(1) Engines above 560 kW.
(2) Constant-speed engines.
(b) Emission standards for steady-state testing. Steady-state exhaust emissions from your engines may not exceed the applicable emission standards in Table 1 of this section. Measure emissions using the applicable steady-state test procedures described in subpart F of this part.
ER29JN21.163
(c)
Optional PM standard for engines below 8 kW.
You may certify hand-startable, air-cooled, direct injection engines below 8 kW to an optional Tier 4 PM standard of 0.60 g/kW-hr. The term hand-startable generally refers to engines that are started using a hand crank or pull cord. This PM standard
applies to both steady-state and transient testing, as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Engines certified under this paragraph (c) may not be used to generate PM or NO
X
+ NMHC emission credits under the provisions of subpart H of this part. These engines may use PM or NO
X
+ NMHC emission credits, subject to the FEL caps in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(d)
Averaging, banking, and trading.
You may generate or use emission credits under the averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program, as described in subpart H of this part. This requires that you specify a family emission limit (FEL) for each pollutant you include in the ABT program for each engine family. These FELs serve as the emission standards for the engine family with respect to all required testing instead of the standards specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. The FELs determine the not-to-exceed standards for your engine family, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
(1)
Primary FEL caps.
The FEL may not be higher than the limits in Table 2 of this section, except as allowed by paragraph (d)(2) of this section or by § 1039.102:

For manufacturers certifying engines under Option #1 of Table 3 of § 1039.102, these alternate FEL caps apply starting with the 2017 model year.
3
For engines below 75 kW, the FEL caps are 0.40 g/kW-hr for PM emissions and 4.4 g/kW-hr for NO
X
emissions.
4
For engines above 560 kW, the provision for alternate NO
X
FEL caps is limited to generator-set engines. For example, if you produce 1,000 generator-set engines above 560 kW in a given model year, up to 50 of them may be certified to the alternate NO
X
FEL caps.
(e)
Not-to-exceed standards.
Exhaust emissions from your engines may not exceed the applicable not-to-exceed (NTE) standards in this paragraph (e).
(1) Measure emissions using the procedures described in subpart F of this part.
(2) Except as noted in paragraph (e)(7) of this section, the NTE standard, rounded to the same number of decimal places as the applicable standard in Table 1 of this section, is determined from the following equation:
NTE standard for each pollutant = (STD) × (M)
Where:
STD = The standard specified for that pollutant in Table 1 of this section (or paragraph (c) of this section) if you certify without using ABT for that pollutant; or
the FEL for that pollutant if you certify using ABT.
M = The NTE multiplier for that pollutant, as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(3) The NTE multiplier for each pollutant is 1.25, except in the following cases:
If . . .
Or . . .
Then . . .
(i) The engine family is certified to a NO
X
standard less than 2.50 g/kW-hr without using ABT
The engine family is certified to a NO
X
FEL less than 2.50 g/kW-hr or a NO
X
+ NMHC FEL less than 2.70 g/kW-hr
The multiplier for NO
X
, NMHC, and NO
X
+ NMHC is 1.50.
(ii) The engine family is certified to a PM standard less than 0.07 g/kW-hr without using ABT
The engine family is certified to a PM FEL less than 0.07 g/kW-hr
The multiplier for PM is 1.50.
(4) There are two sets of specifications of ambient operating regions that will apply for all NTE testing of engines in an engine family. You must choose one set for each engine family and must identify your choice of ambient operating regions in each application for certification for an engine family. You may choose separately for each engine family. Choose one of the following ambient operating regions:
(i) All altitudes less than or equal to 5,500 feet above sea level during all ambient temperature and humidity conditions.
(ii) All altitudes less than or equal to 5,500 feet above sea level, for temperatures less than or equal to the temperature determined by the following equation at the specified altitude:
T = −0.00254 × A + 100
Where:
T = ambient air temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
A = altitude in feet above sea level (A is negative for altitudes below sea level).
(5) Temperature and humidity ranges for which correction factors are allowed are specified in 40 CFR 86.1370-2007(e).
(i) If you choose the ambient operating region specified in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, the temperature and humidity ranges for which correction factors are allowed are defined in 40 CFR 86.1370-2007(e)(1).
(ii) If you choose the ambient operating region specified in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, the temperature and humidity ranges for which correction factors are allowed are defined in 40 CFR 86.1370-2007(e)(2).
(6) For engines equipped with exhaust-gas recirculation, the NTE standards of this section do not apply during the cold operating conditions specified in 40 CFR 86.1370-2007(f).
(7) For engines certified to a PM FEL less than or equal to 0.01 g/kW-hr, the PM NTE standard is 0.02 g/kW-hr.
(f)
Fuel types.
The exhaust emission standards in this section apply for engines using the fuel type on which the engines in the engine family are designed to operate, except for engines certified under § 1039.615. For engines certified under § 1039.615, the standards of this section apply to emissions measured using the specified test fuel. You must meet the numerical emission standards for NMHC in this section based on the following types of hydrocarbon emissions for engines powered by the following fuels:
(1) Alcohol-fueled engines: THCE emissions.
(2) Gaseous-fueled engines: Nonmethane-nonethane hydrocarbon emissions.
(3) Other engines: NMHC emissions.
(g)
Useful life.
Your engines must meet the exhaust emission standards in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section over their full useful life.
(1) The useful life values are shown in the following table, except as allowed by paragraph (g)(2) of this section:
Table 4 of § 1039.101—Useful Life Values

(2) You may request in your application for certification that we approve a shorter useful life for an engine family. We may approve a shorter useful life, in hours of engine operation but not in years, if we determine that these engines will rarely operate longer than the shorter useful life. If engines identical to those in the engine family have already been produced and are in use, your demonstration must include documentation from such in-use engines. In other cases, your demonstration must include an engineering analysis of information equivalent to such in-use data, such as data from research engines or similar engine models that are already in production. Your demonstration must also include any overhaul interval that you recommend, any mechanical warranty that you offer for the engine or its components, and any relevant customer design specifications. Your demonstration may include any other relevant information. The useful life value may not be shorter than any of the following:
(i) 1,000 hours of operation.
(ii) Your recommended overhaul interval.
(iii) Your mechanical warranty for the engine.
(h)
Applicability for testing.
The emission standards in this subpart apply to all testing, including certification, selective enforcement audits, and in-use testing. For selective enforcement audits, we will require you to perform duty-cycle testing as specified in §§ 1039.505 and 1039.510. The NTE standards of this section apply for those tests. We will not direct you to do additional testing under a selective enforcement audit to show that your engines meet the NTE standards.
[69 FR 39213, June 29, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 40462, July 13, 2005; 81 FR 74133, Oct. 25, 2016; 86 FR 34499, June 29, 2021]
§ 1039.102
What exhaust emission standards and phase-in allowances apply for my engines in model year 2014 and earlier?
The exhaust emission standards of this section apply for 2014 and earlier model years. See § 1039.101 for exhaust emission standards that apply to later model years.
(a)
Emission standards for transient testing.
Transient exhaust emissions from your engines may not exceed the applicable emission standards in Tables 1 through 6 of this section. Measure emissions using the applicable transient test procedures described in subpart F of this part. See paragraph (c) of this section for a description of provisions related to the phase-in and phase-out standards shown in Tables 4 through 6 of this section. The emission standards for transient testing are limited for certain engines, as follows:
(1) The transient standards in this section do not apply for the following engines:
(i) Engines below 37 kW for model years before 2013.
(ii) Engines certified under Option #1 of Table 3 of this section. These are the small-volume manufacturer engines certified to the Option #1 standards for model years 2008 through 2015 under § 1039.104(c), and other engines certified to the Option #1 standards for model years 2008 through 2012.
(iii) Engines certified to an alternate FEL during the first four years of the Tier 4 standards for the applicable power category, as allowed in § 1039.104(g). However, you may certify
these engines to the transient standards in this section to avoid using temporary compliance adjustment factors, as described in § 1039.104(g)(2). Note that in some cases this four-year period extends into the time covered by the standards in § 1039.101.
(iv) Constant-speed engines.
(v) Engines above 560 kW.
(2) The transient standards in this section for gaseous pollutants do not apply to phase-out engines that you certify to the same numerical standards (and FELs if the engines are certified using ABT) for gaseous pollutants as you certified under the Tier 3 requirements identified in appendix I of this part. However, except as specified by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the transient PM emission standards apply to these engines.
(b) Emission standards for steady-state testing. Steady-state exhaust emissions from your engines may not exceed the applicable emission standards in Tables 1 through 7 of this section. Measure emissions using the applicable steady-state test procedures described in subpart F of this part. See paragraph (c) of this section for a description of provisions related to the phase-in and phase-out standards shown in Tables 4 through 6 of this section.

Phase-in requirements.
The following phase-in provisions apply for engines in 56-560 kW power categories meeting the interim Tier 4 standards in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:
(1) For each model year before 2014 noted in Tables 4 through 6 of this section, you must certify engine families representing at least 50 percent of your U.S.-directed production volume for each power category to the applicable phase-in standards, except as allowed by paragraph (c)(3), (d)(2), or (e) of this section. Any engines not certified to the phase-in standards must be certified to the corresponding phase-out standards.
(2) Engines certified to the phase-out standards in Tables 4 through 6 of this section must comply with all other requirements that apply to Tier 4 engines, except as otherwise specified in this section.
(3) At the time of certification, show how you intend to meet the phase-in requirements of this paragraph (c) based on projected U.S.-directed production volumes. If your actual U.S.-directed production volume fails to meet the phase-in requirements for a given model year, you must make up the shortfall (in terms of number of engines) by the end of the model year representing the final year of the phase-in period. For example, if you plan in good faith to produce 50 percent of a projected 10,000 engines in the 56-130 kW power category (
i.e.
, 5,000 engines) in 2012 in compliance with the Tier 4 phase-in standards for NO
X
and NMHC in Table 4 of this section, but produce 4,500 such engines of an actual 10,000
engines, you must produce 500 engines in model year 2013 (
i.e.
, the final year of the phase-in for this power category) that meet the Tier 4 phase-in standards above and beyond the production otherwise needed to meet the 50-percent phase-in requirement for model year 2013. If any shortfall exceeds the applicable limit of paragraph (c)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, that number of phase-out engines will be considered not covered by a certificate of conformity and in violation of § 1068.101(a)(1). The shortfall allowed by this paragraph (c)(3) may not exceed a certain number of engines, as follows:
(i) For engine families certified according to the alternate phase-in schedule described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, for model years prior to the final year of the phase-in, 5 percent of your actual U.S.-directed production volume for that power category in that model year.
(ii) For all other engine families, for model years prior to the final year of the phase-in, 25 percent of your actual U.S.-directed production volume for that power category in that model year.
(iii) No shortfall is allowed in the final year of the phase-in.
(4) Engines you introduce into commerce beyond the limits described in paragraphs (c)(3) of this section will be considered not covered by a certificate of conformity and in violation of § 1068.101(a)(1).
(5) For the purposes of this part, the term “phase-in” means relating to a standard that is identified in this section as a phase-in standard and the term “phase-out” means relating to a standard that is identified in this section as a phase-out standard. For example, a 200-kW engine from the 2012 model year that is certified to the 4.0 g/kW-hr NO
X
+ NMHC standard in Table 6 of § 1039.102 is a phase-out engine.
(d)
Banked credits and alternate phase-in for 56-130 kW engines.
For engines in the 56-130 kW power category, you may use only one of the following additional provisions:
(1) For model years 2012 through 2014, you may use banked NO
X
+ NMHC credits from any Tier 2 engine at or above 37 kW certified under the standards identified in appendix I of this part to meet the NO
X
phase-in standards or the NO
X
+ NMHC phase-out standards under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, subject to the additional ABT provisions in § 1039.740.
(2) Instead of meeting the phase-in requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, you may certify engine families representing at least 25 percent of your U.S.-directed production volume for each model year from 2012 through 2014 to the applicable phase-in standards in Tables 4 and 5 of this section, except as allowed by paragraph (c)(3) or (e) of this section. Any engines not certified to the phase-in standards must be certified to the corresponding phase-out standards. Engines certified under this paragraph (d)(2) may generate NO
X
emission credits only for averaging within the same power category during the same model year. For engines certified under this paragraph (d)(2), the 2014 model year may not extend beyond December 30, 2014.
(e)
Alternate NO
X
standards.
For engines in 56-560 kW power categories during the phase-in of Tier 4 standards, you may certify engine families to the alternate NO
X
or NO
X
+ NMHC standards in this paragraph (e) instead of the phase-in and phase-out NO
X
and NO
X
+ NMHC standards described in Tables 4 through 6 of this section. Engines certified to an alternate NO
X
standard under this section must be certified to an NMHC standard of 0.19 g/kW-hr. Do not include engine families certified under this paragraph (e) in determining whether you comply with the percentage phase-in requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d)(2) of this section. Except for the provisions for alternate FEL caps in § 1039.104(g), the NO
X
and NO
X
+ NMHC standards and FEL caps under this paragraph (e) are as follows:
(1) For engines in the 56-130 kW power category, apply the following alternate NO
X
standards and FEL caps:
(i) If you use the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, your alternate NO
X
standard for any engine family in the 56-130 kW power category is 2.3 g/kW-hr for model years 2012 and 2013. Engines certified to this standard may not exceed a NO
X
FEL cap of 3.0 g/kW-hr.
(ii) If you use the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, your alternate NO
X
standard for any engine family in the 56-130 kW power category is 3.4 g/kW-hr for model years 2012 through 2014. Engines below 75 kW certified to this standard may not exceed a NO
X
FEL cap of 4.4 g/kW-hr; engines at or above 75 kW certified to this standard may not exceed a NO
X
FEL cap of 3.8 g/kW-hr.
(iii) If you do not use the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, you may apply the alternate NO
X
standard and the appropriate FEL cap from either paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(2) For engines in the 130-560 kW power category, the alternate NO
X
standard is 2.0 g/kW-hr for model years 2011 through 2013. Engines certified to this standard may not exceed a NO
X
FEL cap of 2.7 g/kW-hr.
(3) You use NO
X
+ NMHC emission credits to certify an engine family to the alternate NO
X
+ NMHC standards in this paragraph (e)(3) instead of the otherwise applicable alternate NO
X
and NMHC standards. Calculate the alternate NO
X
+ NMHC standard by adding 0.1 g/kW-hr to the numerical value of the applicable alternate NO
X
standard of paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section. Engines certified to the NO
X
+ NMHC standards of this paragraph (e)(3) may not generate emission credits. The FEL caps for engine families certified under this paragraph (e)(3) are the previously applicable NO
X
+ NMHC standards identified in appendix I of this part (generally the Tier 3 standards).
(f)
Split families.
For generating or using credits for engines in 56-560 kW power categories during the phase-in of Tier 4 standards, you may split an engine family into two subfamilies (for example, one that uses credits and one that generates credits for the same pollutant).
(1) Identify any split engine families in your application for certification. Your engines must comply with all the standards and requirements applicable to Tier 4 engines, except as noted in this paragraph (f). You may calculate emission credits relative to different emission standards (
i.e.
, phase-in and phase-out standards) for different sets of engines within the engine family, but the engine family must be certified to a single set of standards and FELs. To calculate NO
X
+ NMHC emission credits, add the NO
X
FEL to the NMHC phase-in standard for comparison with the applicable NO
X
+ NMHC phase-out standard. Any engine family certified under this paragraph (f) must meet the applicable phase-in standard for NMHC. You may assign the number and configurations of engines within the respective subfamilies any time before the due date for the final report required in § 1039.730. Apply the same label to each engine in the family, including the NO
X
FEL to which it is certified.
(2) For example, a 10,000-unit engine family in the 75-130 kW power category may be certified to meet the standards for PM, NMHC, and CO that apply to phase-in engines, with a 0.8 g/kW-hr FEL for NO
X
. When compared to the phase-out NO
X
+ NMHC standard, this engine family would generate positive NO

emission credits. You could create a subfamily with 2,500 engines (one-quarter of the 10,000 engines) and identify them as phase-in engines. You would count these 2,500, with their negative NO
X
credits, in determining compliance with the 50-percent phase-in requirement in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. You would calculate negative credits relative to the 0.40 g/kW-hr NO
X
standard for these 2,500 engines. You would identify the other 7,500 engines in the family as phase-out engines and calculate positive credits relative to the 4.0 g/kW-hr NO
X
+ NMHC standard.
(g)
Other provisions.
The provisions of § 1039.101(d) through (h) apply with respect to the standards of this section, with the following exceptions and special provisions:
(1)
NTE standards.
Use the provisions of § 1039.101(e)(3) to calculate and apply the NTE standards, but base these calculated values on the applicable standards in this section or the applicable FEL, instead of the standards in Table 1 of § 1039.101. All other provisions of § 1039.101(e) apply under this paragraph (g)(1). The NTE standards do not apply
for certain engines and certain pollutants, as follows:
(i) All engines below 37 kW for model years before 2013.
(ii) All engines certified under Option #1 of Table 3 of this section. These are small-volume manufacturer engines certified to the Option #1 standards for model years 2008 through 2015 under § 1039.104(c), and other engines certified to the Option #1 standards for model years 2008 through 2012.
(iii) All engines less than or equal to 560 kW that are certified to an FEL under the alternate FEL program during the first four years of the Tier 4 standards for the applicable power category, as described in § 1039.104(g). However, if you apply to meet transient emission standards for these engines under § 1039.102(a)(1)(iii), you must also meet the NTE standards in this paragraph (g)(1).
(iv) Gaseous pollutants for phase-out engines that you certify to the same numerical standards and FELs for gaseous pollutants to which you certified under the Tier 3 requirements identified in appendix I of this part. However, the NTE standards for PM apply to these engines.
(2) Interim FEL caps. As described in § 1039.101(d), you may participate in the ABT program in subpart H of this part by certifying engines to FELs for PM, NO
X
, or NO
X
+ NMHC instead of the standards in Tables 1 through 7 of this section for the model years shown. The FEL caps listed in the following table apply instead of the FEL caps in § 1039.101(d)(1), except as allowed by § 1039.104(g):
ER29JN21.167
(3)
Crankcase emissions.
The crankcase emission requirements of § 1039.115(a) do not apply to engines using charge-air compression that are certified to an FEL under the alternate FEL program in § 1039.104(g) during the first four years of the Tier 4 standards for the applicable power category.
(4)
Special provisions for 37-56 kW engines.
For engines at or above 37 kW and below 56 kW from model years 2008 through 2012, you must add information to the emission-related installation instructions to clarify the equipment manufacturer's obligations under § 1039.104(f).

§ 1039.104
Are there interim provisions that apply only for a limited time?
The provisions in this section apply instead of other provisions in this part. This section describes when these interim provisions apply.
(a)
Incentives for early introduction.
This paragraph (a) allows you to reduce the number of engines subject to the applicable standards in § 1039.101 or § 1039.102, when some of your engines are certified to the specified levels earlier than otherwise required. The engines that are certified early are considered offset-generating engines. The provisions of this paragraph (a), which describe the requirements applicable to offset-generating engines, apply beginning in model year 2007. These offset generating engines may generate additional allowances for equipment manufacturers under the incentive program described in § 1039.627; you may instead use these offsets under paragraph (a)(2) of this section in some cases.
(1) For early-compliant engines to generate offsets for use either under this paragraph (a) or under § 1039.627, you must meet the following general provisions:
(i) You may not generate offsets from engines below 19 kW.
(ii) You must begin actual production of engines covered by the corresponding certificate by the following dates:
(A) For engines at or above 19 kW and below 37 kW: September 1, 2012.
(B) For engines at or above 37 kW and below 56 kW: September 1, 2012 if you choose Option #1 in Table 3 of § 1039.102, or September 1, 2011 if you do not choose Option #1 in Table 3 of § 1039.102.
(C) For engines in the 56-130 kW power category: September 1, 2011.
(D) For engines in the 130-560 kW power category: September 1, 2010.
(E) For engines above 560 kW: September 1, 2014.
(iii) Engines you produce after December 31 of the year shown in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section may not generate offsets.
(iv) You may not use ABT credits to certify offset-generating engines.
(v) Offset-generating engines must be certified to the Tier 4 standards and requirements under this part 1039.
(2) If equipment manufacturers decline offsets for your offset-generating engines under § 1039.627, you may not generate ABT credits with these engines, but you may reduce the number of engines that are required to meet the standards in § 1039.101 or § 1039.102 as follows:
For every . . .

For engines above 560 kW, offsets from generator-set engines may be used only for generator-set engines. Offsets from engines for other applications may be used only for other applications besides generator sets.
(3) Example: If you produce 100 engines in the 56-130 kW power category in model year 2008 that are certified to the 56-130 kW standards listed in § 1039.101, and you produced 10,000 engines in this power category in model year 2015, then only 9,850 of these model year 2015 engines would need to comply with the standards listed in § 1039.101. The 100 offset-generating engines in model year 2008 could not use or generate ABT credits.
(4) Offset-using engines (that is, those not required to certify to the standards of § 1039.101 or § 1039.102 under paragraph (a)(2) of this section) are subject to the following provisions:
(i) If the offset is being used under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section for an engine that would otherwise be certified to the model year 2013 or 2014 standards in Table 2 of § 1039.102 or the standards in Table 1 of § 1039.101, this engine must be certified to the standards and requirements of this part 1039, except that the only PM standard that applies is the steady-state PM standard that applies for model year 2012. Such an engine may not generate ABT credits.
(ii) If the offset is being used under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for an engine that would otherwise be certified to the phase-out standards in Tables 4 through 6 of § 1039.102, this engine must be certified to the standards and requirements of this part 1039, except that the PM standard is the Tier 3 PM standard that applies for this engine's maximum power. Such an engine will be treated as a phase-out engine for purposes of determining compliance with percentage phase-in requirements. Such an engine may not generate ABT credits.
(iii) All other offset-using engines must meet the standards and other provisions that apply in model year 2011 for engines in the 19-130 kW power categories, in model year 2010 for engines in the 130-560 kW power category, or in model year 2014 for engines above 560 kW. Show that engines meet these emission standards by meeting all the requirements of § 1068.265. You must meet the labeling requirements in § 1039.135, but add the following statement instead of the compliance statement in § 1039.135(c)(12): “THIS ENGINE MEETS U.S. EPA EMISSION STANDARDS UNDER 40 CFR 1039.104(a).” For power categories with a percentage phase-in, these engines should be treated as phase-in engines for purposes of determining compliance with phase-in requirements.
(5) If an equipment manufacturer claims offsets from your engine for use under § 1039.627, the engine generating the offset must comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. You may not generate offsets for use under paragraphs (a)(2) and (5) of this section for these engines. You may generate ABT credits from these engines as follows:
(i) To generate emission credits for NO
X
, NO
X
+ NMHC, and PM, the engine must be certified to FELs at or below the standards in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(ii) Calculate credits according to § 1039.705 but use as the applicable standard the numerical value of the standard to which the engine would have otherwise been subject if it had not been certified under this paragraph (a).
(iii) For the production volume, use the number of engines certified under this paragraph (a) for which you do not claim offsets under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(6) You may include engines used to generate offsets under this paragraph (a) and engines used to generate offsets under § 1039.627 in the same engine family, subject to the provisions of § 1039.230. The engine must be certified to FELs, as specified in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section. The FELs must be below the standard levels specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and those specified in § 1039.627. In the reports required in § 1039.730, include the following information for each model year:
(i) The total number of engines that generate offsets under this paragraph (a).
(ii) The number of engines used to generate offsets under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(iii) The names of equipment manufacturers that intend to use your offsets under § 1039.627 and the number of offsets involved for each equipment manufacturer.
(b)
In-use compliance limits.
For purposes of determining compliance after title or custody has transferred to the ultimate purchaser, calculate the applicable in-use compliance limits by adjusting the applicable standards or FELs. This applies only for engines at or above 19 kW. The NO
X
adjustment applies only for engines with a NO
X
FEL no higher than 2.1 g/kW-hr The PM adjustment applies only for engines with a PM FEL no higher than the PM standard in § 1039.101 for the appropriate power category. Add the following adjustments to the otherwise applicable standards or FELs (steady-state, transient, and NTE) for NO

The standards and requirements described in appendix I of this part.
(2) To use the provisions of this paragraph (c) for engines at or above 37 kW and below 56 kW, choose one of the following:
(i) If you comply with the 0.30 g/kW-hr PM standard in § 1039.102 in all model years from 2008 through 2012 without using PM credits, you may continue meeting that standard through 2015.
(ii) If you do not choose to comply with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, you may continue to comply with the standards and requirements described in appendix I of this part for model years through 2012, but you must begin complying in 2013 with Tier 4 standards and requirements specified in Table 3 of § 1039.102 for model years 2013 and later.
(3) After the delays indicated in paragraph (c)(1) and (2) of this section, you must comply with the same Tier 4 standards and requirements as all other manufacturers.
(4) For engines not in the 19-56 kW power category, if you delay compliance with any standards under this paragraph (c), you must do all the following things for the model years when
you are delaying compliance with the otherwise applicable standards:
(i) Produce engines that meet all the emission standards identified in appendix I of this part and other requirements in this part applicable for that model year, except as noted in this paragraph (c).
(ii) Meet the labeling requirements in this part that apply for certified engines but use the following alternative compliance statement: “THIS ENGINE COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA REGULATIONS FOR [CURRENT MODEL YEAR] NONROAD COMPRESSION—IGNITION ENGINES UNDER 40 CFR 1039.104(c).”.
(5) For engines in the 19-56 kW power category, if you delay compliance with any standards under this paragraph (c), you must do all the following things for the model years when you are delaying compliance with the otherwise applicable standards:
(i) Produce engines in those model years that meet all the emission standards and other requirements that applied for your model year 2008 engines in the same power category.
(ii) Meet the labeling requirements in § 1039.135, but use the following compliance statement instead of the compliance statement in § 1039.135: “THIS ENGINE COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA REGULATIONS FOR [CURRENT MODEL YEAR] NONROAD COMPRESSION-IGNITION ENGINES UNDER 40 CFR 1039.104(c).”.
(iii) Notify the equipment manufacturer that the engines you produce under this section are excluded from the production volumes associated with the equipment-manufacturer allowance program in § 1039.625.
(6) The provisions of this paragraph (c) may not be used to circumvent the requirements of this part.
(d)
Deficiencies for NTE standards.
You may ask us to accept as compliant an engine that does not fully meet specific requirements under the applicable NTE standards. Such deficiencies are intended to allow for minor deviations from the NTE standards under limited conditions. We expect your engines to have functioning emission-control hardware that allows you to comply with the NTE standards.
(1) Request our approval for specific deficiencies in your application for certification, or before you submit your application. We will not approve deficiencies retroactively to cover engines already certified. In your request, identify the scope of each deficiency and describe any auxiliary emission-control devices you will use to control emissions to the lowest practical level, considering the deficiency you are requesting.
(2) We will approve a deficiency only if compliance would be infeasible or unreasonable considering such factors as the technical feasibility of the given hardware and the applicable lead time and production cycles—including schedules related to phase-in or phase-out of engines. We may consider other relevant factors.
(3) Our approval applies only for a single model year and may be limited to specific engine configurations. We may approve your request for the same deficiency in the following model year if correcting the deficiency would require unreasonable hardware or software modifications and we determine that you have demonstrated an acceptable level of effort toward complying.
(4) You may ask for any number of deficiencies in the first three model years during which NTE standards apply for your engines. For the next four model years, we may approve up to three deficiencies per engine family. Deficiencies of the same type that apply similarly to different power ratings within a family count as one deficiency per family. We may condition approval of any such additional deficiencies during these four years on any additional conditions we determine to be appropriate. We will not approve deficiencies after the seven-year period specified in this paragraph (d)(4).
(e)
Diesel test fuels and corresponding labeling requirements.
For diesel-fueled engines in 2011 and later model years, the diesel test fuel is ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel specified in 40 CFR part 1065. For diesel-fueled engines in 2010 and earlier model years, use test fuels and meet labeling requirements as follows:
(1) Use the following test fuels in 2010 and earlier model years:
(i) Unless otherwise specified, the diesel test fuel is low-sulfur diesel fuel specified in 40 CFR part 1065.
(ii) In model years 2007 through 2010, you may use ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel as the test fuel for any engine family that employs sulfur-sensitive technology if you can demonstrate that in-use engines in the family will use diesel fuel with a sulfur concentration no greater than 15 ppm.
(iii) You may use ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel as the test fuel for engine families in any power category below 56 kW, as long as none of the engines in your engine family employ sulfur-sensitive technologies, you ensure that ultimate purchasers of equipment using these engines are informed that ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel is recommended, and you recommend to equipment manufacturers that a label be applied at the fuel inlet recommending 15 ppm fuel.
(iv) For the engines described in § 1039.101(c) that are certified to the 0.60 g/kW-hr PM standard in Table 1 of § 1039.102 in the 2010 model year, you may test with the ultra low-sulfur fuel specified in 40 CFR part 1065.
(2) Meet the labeling requirements of this paragraph (e)(2) (or other labeling requirements we approve) to identify the applicable test fuels specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Provide instructions to equipment manufacturers to ensure that they are aware of these labeling requirements.
(i) For engines certified under the provisions of paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, include the following statement on the emission control information label and the fuel-inlet label specified in § 1039.135: “LOW SULFUR FUEL OR ULTRA LOW SULFUR FUEL ONLY”.
(ii) For engines certified under the provisions of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, include the following statement on the emission control information label and the fuel-inlet label specified in § 1039.135: “ULTRA LOW SULFUR FUEL ONLY”.
(iii) For engines certified under the provisions of paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, include the following statement on the emission control information label specified in § 1039.135: “ULTRA LOW SULFUR FUEL RECOMMENDED”.
(3) For model years 2010 and earlier, we will use the test fuel that you use under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, subject to the conditions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(f)
Requirements for equipment manufacturers.
If you produce equipment with engines certified to Tier 3 standards under Option #2 of Table 3 of § 1039.102 during model years from 2008 through 2011, then a minimum number of pieces of equipment you produce using 2012 model year engines must have engines certified to the Option #2 standards, as follows:
(1) For equipment you produce with 2012 model year engines at or above 37 kW and below 56 kW, determine the minimum number of these engines that must be certified to the Option #2 standards in Table 3 of § 1039.102 as follows:
(i) If all the equipment you produce using 2008 through 2011 model year engines use engines certified to Tier 3 standards under Option #2 of Table 3 of § 1039.102, then all the 2012 model year engines you install must be certified to the Option #2 standards of Table 3 of § 1039.102.
(ii) If you produce equipment using 2008 through 2011 model year engines with some engines certified to Option #1 standards of Table 3 of § 1039.102 and some engines certified to Tier 3 standards under Option #2 standards of Table 3 of § 1039.102, calculate the minimum number of 2012 model year engines you must install that are certified to the Option #2 standards of Table 3 of § 1039.102 from the following equation:
Minimum number = [(T-O
1
−F)/(T−F)−0.05] × P
Where:
T = The total number of 2008-2010 model year engines at or above 37 kW and below 56 kW that you use in equipment you produce.
O
1
= The number of engines from the 2008-2010 model years certified under Option #1 of Table 3 of § 1039.102 that you use in equipment you produce.
F = The number of 2008-2010 model year engines at or above 37 kW and below 56 kW that you use in equipment you produce under the flexibility provisions of § 1039.625.
P = The total number of 2012 model year engines at or above 37 kW and below 56 kW that you use in equipment you produce.
(2) As needed for the calculation required by this paragraph (f), keep records of all equipment you produce using 2008-2012 model year engines at or above 37 kW and below 56 kW. If you fail to keep these records, you may not use any 2012 model year engines certified to Option #1 standards in your equipment.
(3) If you fail to comply with the provisions of this paragraph (f), then using 2012 model year engines certified under Option #1 of Table 3 of § 1039.102 (or certified to less stringent standards) in such equipment violates the prohibitions in § 1068.101(a)(1).
(g)
Alternate FEL caps.
You may certify engines to the FEL caps in Table 1 of this section instead of the otherwise applicable FEL caps in § 1039.101(d)(1), § 1039.102(e), or § 1039.102(g)(2) for the indicated model years, subject to the following provisions:
(1) The provisions of this paragraph (g) apply for limited numbers of engines as specified in this paragraph (g)(1). If you certify an engine under an alternate FEL cap in this paragraph (g) for any pollutant, count it toward the allowed percentage of engines certified to the alternate FEL caps.
(i) Except as specified in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, the number of engines certified to the FEL caps in Table 1 of this section must not exceed 20 percent in any single model year in each power category, and the sum of percentages over the 4-year period must not exceed a total of 40 percent in each power category.
(ii) For the 19-56 kW power category, the number of engines certified to the FEL caps in Table 1 of this section must not exceed 40 percent in any single model year, and the sum of percentages over the 4-year period must not exceed a total of 80 percent.
(2) If your engine is not certified to transient emission standards under the provisions of § 1039.102(a)(1)(iii), you must adjust your FEL upward by a temporary compliance adjustment factor (TCAF) before calculating your negative emission credits under § 1039.705, as follows:
(i) The temporary compliance adjustment factor for NO
X
and for NO
X
+ NMHC is 1.1.
(ii) The temporary compliance adjustment factor for PM is 1.5.
(iii) The adjusted FEL (FEL
adj
) for calculating emission credits is determined from the steady-state FEL (FEL
ss
) using the following equation:
FEL
adj
= (FEL
ss
) × (TCAF)
(iv) The unadjusted FEL (FEL
ss
) applies for all purposes other than credit calculation.
(3) These alternate FEL caps may not be used for phase-in engines.
(4) Do not apply TCAFs to gaseous emissions for phase-out engines that you certify to the same numerical standards (and FELs if the engines are certified using ABT) for gaseous pollutants as you certified under the Tier 3 requirements identified in appendix I of this part.

e
For manufacturers certifying engines in this power category using the percentage phase-in/phase-out approach instead of the alternate NO
X
standard of § 1039.102(e)(2), the alternate NO

FEL caps is limited to generator-set engines.
(5) You may certify engines under this paragraph (g) in any model year provided for in Table 1 of this section without regard to whether or not the engine family's FEL is at or below the otherwise applicable FEL cap. For example, a 200 kW engine certified to the NO
X
+ NMHC standard of § 1039.102(e)(3) with an FEL equal to the FEL cap of 4.0 g/kW-hr may nevertheless be certified under this paragraph (g).
(6) For engines you produce under this paragraph (g) after the Tier 4 final standards take effect, you may certify based on a NO
X
+ NMHC FEL as described in Table 1 of this section. Calculate emission credits for these engines relative to the applicable NO
X
standard in § 1039.101 or § 1039.102, plus 0.1 g/kW-hr.
(h)
Delayed compliance with labeling requirements.
Before the 2011 model year, you may omit the dates of manufacture from the emission control information label as specified in § 1039.135(c)(6) if you keep those records and provide them to us upon request.
(i)
Lead time for diagnostic controls.
Model year 2017 and earlier engines are not subject to the requirements for diagnostic controls as specified in § 1039.110.

§ 1039.105
What smoke opacity standards must my engines meet?
(a) The smoke opacity standards in this section apply to all engines subject to emission standards under this part, except for the following engines:
(1) Single-cylinder engines.
(2) Constant-speed engines.
(3) Engines certified to a PM emission standard or FEL of 0.07 g/kW-hr or lower.
(b) Measure smoke opacity as specified in § 1039.501(c). Smoke opacity from your engines may not exceed the following standards:
(1) 20 percent during the acceleration mode.
(2) 15 percent during the lugging mode.
(3) 50 percent during the peaks in either the acceleration or lugging modes.

§ 1039.107
What evaporative emission standards and requirements apply?
There are no evaporative emission standards for diesel-fueled engines, or engines using other nonvolatile or nonliquid fuels (for example, natural gas). If your engine uses a volatile liquid fuel, such as methanol, you must meet the evaporative emission requirements of 40 CFR part 1048 that apply to spark-ignition engines, as follows:
(a) Follow the steps in 40 CFR 1048.245 to show that you meet the requirements of 40 CFR 1048.105.
(b) Do the following things in your application for certification:
(1) Describe how your engines control evaporative emissions.
(2) Present test data to show that equipment using your engines meets the evaporative emission standards we specify in this section if you do not use design-based certification under 40 CFR 1048.245.
[69 FR 39213, June 29, 2004, as amended at 81 FR 74134, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1039.110
Recording reductant use and other diagnostic functions.
(a) Engines equipped with SCR systems using a reductant other than the engine's fuel must have a diagnostic system that monitors reductant quality and tank levels and alert operators to the need to refill the reductant tank before it is empty, or to replace the reductant if it does not meet your concentration specifications. Unless we approve other alerts, use a warning lamp or an audible alarm. You do not need to separately monitor reductant quality if your system uses input from an exhaust NO
X
sensor (or other sensor) to alert operators when reductant quality is inadequate. However, tank level must be monitored in all cases.
(b) You may equip your engine with other diagnostic features. If you do, they must be designed to allow us to read and interpret the codes. Note that § 1039.205 requires you to provide us any information needed to read, record, and interpret all the information broadcast
by an engine's onboard computers and electronic control units.
[81 FR 74134, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1039.115
What other requirements apply?
Engines that are required to meet the emission standards of this part must meet the following requirements, except as noted elsewhere in this part:
(a)
Crankcase emissions.
Crankcase emissions may not be discharged directly into the ambient atmosphere from any engine throughout its useful life, except as follows:
(1) Engines may discharge crankcase emissions to the ambient atmosphere if the emissions are added to the exhaust emissions (either physically or mathematically) during all emission testing.
(2) If you take advantage of this exception, you must do the following things:
(i) Manufacture the engines so that all crankcase emissions can be routed into the applicable sampling systems specified in 40 CFR part 1065.
(ii) Account for deterioration in crankcase emissions when determining exhaust deterioration factors.
(3) For purposes of this paragraph (a), crankcase emissions that are routed to the exhaust upstream of exhaust aftertreatment during all operation are not considered to be discharged directly into the ambient atmosphere.
(b)-(d) [Reserved]
(e)
Adjustable parameters.
Engines that have adjustable parameters must meet all the requirements of this part for any adjustment in the practically adjustable range. We may require that you set adjustable parameters to any specification within the practically adjustable range during any testing, including certification testing, selective enforcement auditing, or in-use testing. General provisions for adjustable parameters apply as specified in 40 CFR 1068.50.
(f)
Prohibited controls.
(1)
General provisions.
You may not design your engines with emission control devices, systems, or elements of design that cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety while operating. For example, an engine may not emit a noxious or toxic substance it would otherwise not emit that contributes to such an unreasonable risk.
(2)
Vanadium sublimation in SCR catalysts.
For engines equipped with vanadium-based SCR catalysts, you must design the engine and its emission controls to prevent vanadium sublimation and protect the catalyst from high temperatures. We will evaluate your engine design based on the following information that you must include in your application for certification:
(i) Identify the threshold temperature for vanadium sublimation for your specified SCR catalyst formulation as described in 40 CFR 1065.1113 through 1065.1121.
(ii) Describe how you designed your engine to prevent catalyst inlet temperatures from exceeding the temperature you identify in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, including consideration of engine wear through the useful life. Also describe your design for catalyst protection in case catalyst temperatures exceed the specified temperature. In your description, include how you considered elevated catalyst temperature resulting from sustained high-load engine operation, catalyst exotherms, DPF regeneration, and component failure resulting in unburned fuel in the exhaust stream.
(g)
Defeat devices.
You may not equip your engines with a defeat device. A defeat device is an auxiliary emission-control device that reduces the effectiveness of emission controls under conditions that the engine may reasonably be expected to encounter during normal operation and use. This does not apply to auxiliary-emission control devices you identify in your certification application if any of the following is true:
(1) The conditions of concern were substantially included in the applicable test procedures described in subpart F of this part.
(2) You show your design is necessary to prevent engine (or equipment) damage or accidents.
(3) The reduced effectiveness applies only to starting the engine.
(4) The auxiliary emission control device applies only for engines that will be installed in emergency equipment and the need is justified in terms of preventing the equipment from losing
speed or power due to abnormal conditions of the emission control system, or in terms of preventing such abnormal conditions from occurring, during operation related to emergency response. Examples of such abnormal conditions may include excessive exhaust backpressure from an overloaded particulate trap, and running out of diesel exhaust fluid for engines that rely on urea-based selective catalytic reduction. The emission standards do not apply when any AECDs approved under this paragraph (g)(4) are active.
(5) The auxiliary emission control device operates only in emergency situations as defined in § 1039.665 and meets all of the requirements of that section, and you meet all of the requirements of that section.

§ 1039.120
What emission-related warranty requirements apply to me?
(a)
General requirements.
You must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that the new nonroad engine, including all parts of its emission-control system, meets two conditions:
(1) It is designed, built, and equipped so it conforms at the time of sale to the ultimate purchaser with the requirements of this part.
(2) It is free from defects in materials and workmanship that may keep it from meeting these requirements.
(b)
Warranty period.
Your emission-related warranty must be valid for at least as long as the minimum warranty periods listed in this paragraph (b) in hours of operation and years, whichever comes first. You may offer an emission-related warranty more generous than we require. The emission-related warranty for the engine may not be shorter than any basic mechanical warranty you provide without charge for the engine. Similarly, the emission-related warranty for any component may not be shorter than any warranty you provide without charge for that component. This means that your warranty may not treat emission-related and nonemission-related defects differently for any component. If an engine has no hour meter, we base the warranty periods in this paragraph (b) only on the engine's age (in years). The warranty period begins when the engine is placed into service. The minimum warranty periods are shown in the following table:
If your engine is certified as . . .
And its maximum power is . . .
And its rated speed is . . .
Then its warranty period is . . .
Variable speed or constant speed

37
Any speed
3,000 hours or five years, whichever comes first.
Variable speed or constant speed
kW ≥37
Any speed
3,000 hours or five years, whichever comes first.
(c)
Components covered.
The emission-related warranty covers all components whose failure would increase an engine's emissions of any regulated pollutant, including components listed in 40 CFR part 1068, appendix I, and components from any other system you develop to control emissions. The emission-related warranty covers these components even if another company produces the component. Your emission-related warranty does not need to cover components whose failure would not increase an engine's emissions of any regulated pollutant.
(d)
Limited applicability.
You may deny warranty claims under this section if the operator caused the problem through improper maintenance or use, as described in 40 CFR 1068.115.
(e)
Owners manual.
Describe in the owners manual the emission-related
warranty provisions from this section that apply to the engine.
[69 FR 39213, June 29, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 40463, July 13, 2005; 75 FR 22989, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74134, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1039.125
What maintenance instructions must I give to buyers?
Give the ultimate purchaser of each new nonroad engine written instructions for properly maintaining and using the engine, including the emission-control system. The maintenance instructions also apply to service accumulation on your emission-data engines, as described in § 1039.245 and in 40 CFR part 1065.
(a)
Critical emission-related maintenance.
Critical emission-related maintenance includes any adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of critical emission-related components. This may also include additional emission-related maintenance that you determine is critical if we approve it in advance. You may schedule critical emission-related maintenance on these components if you meet the following conditions:
(1) You demonstrate that the maintenance is reasonably likely to be done at the recommended intervals on in-use engines. We will accept scheduled maintenance as reasonably likely to occur if you satisfy any of the following conditions, with the exception that paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section do not apply for DEF replenishment:
(i) You present data showing that, if a lack of maintenance increases emissions, it also unacceptably degrades the engine's performance.
(ii) You present survey data showing that at least 80 percent of engines in the field get the maintenance you specify at the recommended intervals.
(iii) You provide the maintenance free of charge and clearly say so in your maintenance instructions.
(iv) You otherwise show us that the maintenance is reasonably likely to be done at the recommended intervals.
(2) For engines below 130 kW, you may not schedule critical emission-related maintenance more frequently than the following minimum intervals, except as specified in paragraphs (a)(4), (b), and (c) of this section:
(i) For EGR-related filters and coolers, DEF filters, crankcase ventilation valves and filters, and fuel injector tips (cleaning only), the minimum interval is 1,500 hours.
(ii) For the following components, including associated sensors and actuators, the minimum interval is 3,000 hours: Fuel injectors, turbochargers, catalytic converters, electronic control units, EGR systems (including related components, but excluding filters and coolers), and other add-on components.
(iii) For SCR systems, the minimum interval for replenishing the diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is the number of engine operating hours necessary to consume a full tank of fuel based on normal usage starting from full fuel capacity for the equipment. Use good engineering judgment to ensure that equipment manufacturers will meet this requirement for worst-case operation by following your installation instructions. For example, if your highest rate of DEF consumption (relative to fuel consumption) will occur under a steady state operating conditions characterized by one of the modes of the applicable steady-state certification test (to the extent that continuous operation at such mode is representative of real-world conditions), the DEF tank should be large enough that a single tank of DEF would be enough to continue proper operation of the SCR system for the expected operating range with a single tank of fuel at that mode. For engine testing in a laboratory, any size DEF tank and fuel tank may be used; however, for our testing of engines, we may require you to provide us with a production-type DEF tank, including any associated sensors.
(3) For engines at or above 130 kW, you may not schedule critical emission-related maintenance more frequently than the following minimum intervals, except as specified in paragraphs (a)(4), (b), and (c) of this section:
(i) For EGR-related filters and coolers, DEF filters, crankcase ventilation valves and filters, and fuel injector tips (cleaning only), the minimum interval is 1,500 hours.
(ii) For the following components, including associated sensors and actuators, the minimum interval is 4,500
hours: Fuel injectors, turbochargers, catalytic converters, electronic control units, EGR systems (including related components, but excluding filters and coolers), and other add-on components.
(iii) The provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section apply for SCR systems.
(4) For particulate traps, trap oxidizers, and components related to either of these, scheduled maintenance may include cleaning or repair at the intervals specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) or (a)(3)(ii) of this section, as applicable. Scheduled maintenance may include a shorter interval for cleaning or repair and may also include adjustment or replacement, but only if we approve it. We will approve your request if you provide the maintenance free of charge and clearly state this in your maintenance instructions, and you provide us additional information as needed to convince us that the maintenance will occur.
(5) You may ask us to approve a maintenance interval shorter than that specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section under § 1039.210, including emission-related components that were not in widespread use with nonroad compression-ignition engines before 2011. In your request you must describe the proposed maintenance step, recommend the maximum feasible interval for this maintenance, include your rationale with supporting evidence to support the need for the maintenance at the recommended interval, and demonstrate that the maintenance will be done at the recommended interval on in-use engines. In considering your request, we will evaluate the information you provide and any other available information to establish alternate specifications for maintenance intervals, if appropriate. We will announce any decision we make under this paragraph (a)(5) in the
Federal Register.
Anyone may request a hearing regarding such a decision (
see
§ 1039.820).
(6) If your engine family has an alternate useful life under § 1039.101(g) that is shorter than the period specified in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, you may not schedule critical emission-related maintenance more frequently than the alternate useful life, except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Recommended additional maintenance.
You may recommend any additional amount of maintenance on the components listed in paragraph (a) of this section, as long as you state clearly that these maintenance steps are not necessary to keep the emission-related warranty valid. If operators do the maintenance specified in paragraph (a) of this section, but not the recommended additional maintenance, this does not allow you to disqualify those engines from in-use testing or deny a warranty claim. Do not take these maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data engines.
(c)
Special maintenance.
You may specify more frequent maintenance to address problems related to special situations, such as atypical engine operation. You must clearly state that this additional maintenance is associated with the special situation you are addressing. You may also address maintenance of low-use engines (such as recreational or stand-by engines) by specifying the maintenance interval in terms of calendar months or years in addition to your specifications in terms of engine operating hours. All special maintenance instructions must be consistent with good engineering judgment. We may disapprove your maintenance instructions if we determine that you have specified special maintenance steps to address maintenance that is unlikely to occur in use, or engine operation that is not atypical. For example, this paragraph (c) does not allow you to design engines that require special maintenance for a certain type of expected operation. If we determine that certain maintenance items do not qualify as special maintenance under this paragraph (c), you may identify this as recommended additional maintenance under paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Noncritical emission-related maintenance.
Subject to the provisions of this paragraph (d), you may schedule any amount of emission-related inspection or maintenance that is not covered by paragraph (a) of this section (that is, maintenance that is neither explicitly identified as critical emission-related
maintenance, nor that we approve as critical emission-related maintenance). Noncritical emission-related maintenance generally includes maintenance on the components we specify in 40 CFR part 1068, appendix I, that is not covered in paragraph (a) of this section. You must state in the owners manual that these steps are not necessary to keep the emission-related warranty valid. If operators fail to do this maintenance, this does not allow you to disqualify those engines from in-use testing or deny a warranty claim. Do not take these inspection or maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data engines.
(e)
Maintenance that is not emission-related.
For maintenance unrelated to emission controls, you may schedule any amount of inspection or maintenance. You may also take these inspection or maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data engines, as long as they are reasonable and technologically necessary. This might include adding engine oil, changing air, fuel, or oil filters, servicing engine-cooling systems or fuel-water separator cartridges or elements, and adjusting idle speed, governor, engine bolt torque, valve lash, or injector lash. You may not perform this nonemission-related maintenance on emission-data engines more often than the least frequent intervals that you recommend to the ultimate purchaser.
(f)
Source of parts and repairs.
State clearly in your written maintenance instructions that a repair shop or person of the owner's choosing may maintain, replace, or repair emission-control devices and systems. Your instructions may not require components or service identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. Also, do not directly or indirectly condition your warranty on a requirement that the engine be serviced by your franchised dealers or any other service establishments with which you have a commercial relationship. You may disregard the requirements in this paragraph (f) if you do one of two things:
(1) Provide a component or service without charge under the purchase agreement.
(2) Get us to waive this prohibition in the public's interest by convincing us the engine will work properly only with the identified component or service.
(g)
Payment for scheduled maintenance.
Owners are responsible for properly maintaining their engines. This generally includes paying for scheduled maintenance. However, manufacturers must pay for scheduled maintenance during the useful life if the regulations require it or if it meets all the following criteria:
(1) Each affected component was not in general use on similar engines before the applicable dates shown in paragraph (6) of the definition of
new nonroad engine
in § 1039.801.
(2) The primary function of each affected component is to reduce emissions.
(3) The cost of the scheduled maintenance is more than 2 percent of the price of the engine.
(4) Failure to perform the maintenance would not cause clear problems that would significantly degrade the engine's performance.
(h)
Owners manual.
Explain the owner's responsibility for proper maintenance in the owners manual.

§ 1039.130
What installation instructions must I give to equipment manufacturers?
(a) If you sell an engine for someone else to install in a piece of nonroad equipment, give the engine installer instructions for installing it consistent with the requirements of this part. Include all information necessary to ensure that an engine will be installed in its certified configuration.
(b) Make sure these instructions have the following information:
(1) Include the heading: “Emission-related installation instructions”.
(2) State: “Failing to follow these instructions when installing a certified engine in a piece of nonroad equipment violates federal law (40 CFR 1068.105(b)), subject to fines or other
penalties as described in the Clean Air Act.”.
(3) Describe the instructions needed to properly install the exhaust system and any other components. Include instructions consistent with the requirements of § 1039.205(u). Also describe how to properly size the DEF tank consistent with the specifications in § 1039.125(a), if applicable.
(4) Describe any necessary steps for installing the diagnostic system described in § 1039.110.
(5) Describe how your certification is limited for any type of application. For example, if your engines are certified only for constant-speed operation, tell equipment manufacturers not to install the engines in variable-speed applications.
(6) Describe any other instructions to make sure the installed engine will operate according to design specifications in your application for certification. This may include, for example, instructions for installing aftertreatment devices when installing the engines.
(7) State: “If you install the engine in a way that makes the engine's emission control information label hard to read during normal engine maintenance, you must place a duplicate label on the equipment, as described in 40 CFR 1068.105.”.
(8) Describe equipment-labeling requirements consistent with § 1039.135. State whether you are providing the label for the fuel inlet or the equipment manufacturer must provide the label.
(c) You do not need installation instructions for engines you install in your own equipment.
(d) Provide instructions in writing or in an equivalent format. For example, you may post instructions on a publicly available website for downloading or printing. If you do not provide the instructions in writing, explain in your application for certification how you will ensure that each installer is informed of the installation requirements.

§ 1039.135
How must I label and identify the engines I produce?
(a) Assign each engine a unique identification number and permanently affix, engrave, or stamp it on the engine in a legible way.
(b) At the time of manufacture, affix a permanent and legible label identifying each engine. The label must meet the requirements of 40 CFR 1068.45.
(c) The label must—
(1) Include the heading “EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION”.
(2) Include your full corporate name and trademark. You may identify another company and use its trademark instead of yours if you comply with the branding provisions of 40 CFR 1068.45.
(3) Include EPA's standardized designation for the engine family (and subfamily, where applicable).
(4) State the power category or subcategory from § 1039.101 or § 1039.102 that determines the applicable emission standards for the engine family. For engines at or above 37 kW and below 56 kW from model years 2008 through 2012, and for engines less than 8 kW utilizing the provision at § 1039.101(c), you must state the applicable PM standard for the engine family.
(5) State the engine's displacement (in liters); however, you may omit this from the label if all the engines in the engine family have the same per-cylinder displacement and total displacement.
(6) State the date of manufacture [DAY (optional), MONTH, and YEAR]; however, you may omit this from the label if you stamp, engrave, or otherwise permanently identify it elsewhere on the engine, in which case you must also describe in your application for certification where you will identify the date on the engine.
(7) State the FELs to which the engines are certified if certification depends on the ABT provisions of subpart H of this part.
(8) Identify the emission-control system. Use terms and abbreviations as described in 40 CFR 1068.45. You may omit this information from the label if there is not enough room for it and you put it in the owners manual instead.
(9) For diesel-fueled engines, unless otherwise specified in § 1039.104(e)(2),
state: “ULTRA LOW SULFUR FUEL ONLY'.
(10) Identify any additional requirements for fuel and lubricants that do not involve fuel-sulfur levels. You may omit this information from the label if there is not enough room for it and you put it in the owners manual instead.
(11) State the useful life for your engine family if we approve a shortened useful life under § 1039.101(g)(2).
(12) State: “THIS ENGINE COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA REGULATIONS FOR [MODEL YEAR] NONROAD DIESEL ENGINES.”.
(13) For engines above 560 kW, include the following things:
(i) For engines certified to the emission standards for generator-set engines, add the phrase “FOR GENERATOR SETS AND OTHER APPLICATIONS”.
(ii) For all other engines, add the phrase “NOT FOR USE IN A GENERATOR SET”.
(14) If your engines are certified only for constant-speed operation, state “USE IN CONSTANT-SPEED APPLICATIONS ONLY”.
(15) For engines with one or more approved auxiliary emission control devices for emergency equipment applications under § 1039.115(g)(4), the statement: “THIS ENGINE IS FOR INSTALLATION IN EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT ONLY.” Note that this label requirement does not apply for engines that include emergency AECDs under § 1039.665 rather than § 1039.115(g)(4).
(d) You may add information to the emission control information label as follows:
(1) You may identify other emission standards that the engine meets or does not meet (such as international standards), as long as this does not cause you to omit any of the information described in paragraphs (c)(5) through (10) of this section. You may add the information about the other emission standards to the statement we specify, or you may include it in a separate statement.
(2) You may add other information to ensure that the engine will be properly maintained and used.
(3) You may add appropriate features to prevent counterfeit labels. For example, you may include the engine's unique identification number on the label.
(e) For model year 2019 and earlier, create a separate label with the statement: “ULTRA LOW SULFUR FUEL ONLY”. Permanently attach this label to the equipment near the fuel inlet or, if you do not manufacture the equipment, take one of the following steps to ensure that the equipment will be properly labeled:
(1) Provide the label to the equipment manufacturer and include the appropriate information in the emission-related installation instructions.
(2) Confirm that the equipment manufacturers install their own complying labels.
(f) You may ask us to approve modified labeling requirements in this part 1039 if you show that it is necessary or appropriate. We will approve your request if your alternate label is consistent with the requirements of this part.
(g) If you obscure the engine label while installing the engine in the equipment such that the label cannot be read during normal maintenance, you must place a duplicate label on the equipment. If others install your engine in their equipment in a way that obscures the engine label, we require them to add a duplicate label on the equipment (see 40 CFR 1068.105); in that case, give them the number of duplicate labels they request and keep the following records for at least five years:
(1) Written documentation of the request from the equipment manufacturer.
(2) The number of duplicate labels you send for each engine family and the date you sent them.

§ 1039.140
What is my engine's maximum engine power?
(a) An engine configuration's maximum engine power is the maximum brake power point on the nominal power curve for the engine configuration, as defined in this section. Round
the power value to the nearest whole kilowatt.
(b) The nominal power curve of an engine configuration is the relationship between maximum available engine brake power and engine speed for an engine, using the mapping procedures of 40 CFR part 1065, based on the manufacturer's design and production specifications for the engine. This information may also be expressed by a torque curve that relates maximum available engine torque with engine speed.
(c) The nominal power curve must be within the range of the actual power curves of production engines considering normal production variability. If after production begins it is determined that your nominal power curve does not represent production engines, we may require you to amend your application for certification under § 1039.225.
(d) Throughout this part, references to a specific power value or a range of power values for an engine are based on maximum engine power. For example, the group of engines with maximum engine power above 560 kW may be referred to as engines above 560 kW.

# Subpart C—Certifying Engine Families
§ 1039.201
What are the general requirements for obtaining a certificate of conformity?
(a) You must send us a separate application for a certificate of conformity for each engine family. A certificate of conformity is valid for new production from the indicated effective date until the end of the model year for which it is issued, which may not extend beyond December 31 of that year. No new certificate will be issued after December 31 of the model year. You may amend your application for certification after the end of the model year in certain circumstances as described in §§ 1039.220 and 1039.225. You must renew your certification annually for any engines you continue to produce.
(b) The application must contain all the information required by this part and must not include false or incomplete statements or information (see § 1039.255).
(c) We may ask you to include less information than we specify in this subpart, as long as you maintain all the information required by § 1039.250.
(d) You must use good engineering judgment for all decisions related to your application (see 40 CFR 1068.5).
(e) An authorized representative of your company must approve and sign the application.
(f) See § 1039.255 for provisions describing how we will process your application.
(g) We may require you to deliver your test engines to a facility we designate for our testing (see § 1039.235(c)). Alternatively, you may choose to deliver another engine that is identical in all material respects to the test engine, or another engine that we determine can appropriately serve as an emission-data engine for the engine family.
(h) For engines that become new after being placed into service, such as engines converted to nonroad use after being used in motor vehicles, we may specify alternate certification provisions consistent with the intent of this part.
See
the definition of “new nonroad engine” in § 1039.801.

§ 1039.205
What must I include in my application?
This section specifies the information that must be in your application, unless we ask you to include less information under § 1039.201(c). We may require you to provide additional information to evaluate your application.
(a) Describe the engine family's specifications and other basic parameters of the engine's design and emission controls. List the fuel type on which your engines are designed to operate (for example, ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel). List each distinguishable engine configuration in the engine family. For each engine configuration, list the maximum engine power and the range of values for maximum engine power resulting from production tolerances, as described in § 1039.140.
(b) Explain how the emission-control system operates. Describe in detail all
system components for controlling exhaust emissions, including all auxiliary-emission control devices (AECDs) and all fuel-system components you will install on any production or test engine. Identify the part number of each component you describe. For this paragraph (b), treat as separate AECDs any devices that modulate or activate differently from each other. Include all the following:
(1) Give a general overview of the engine, the emission-control strategies, and all AECDs.
(2) Describe each AECD's general purpose and function.

(5) Identify the location of each sensor the AECD uses.
(6) Identify the threshold values for the sensed parameters that activate the AECD.
(7) Describe the parameters that the AECD modulates (controls) in response to any sensed parameters, including the range of modulation for each parameter, the relationship between the sensed parameters and the controlled parameters and how the modulation achieves the AECD's stated purpose. Use graphs and tables, as necessary.
(8) Describe each AECD's specific calibration details. This may be in the form of data tables, graphical representations, or some other description.
(9) Describe the hierarchy among the AECDs when multiple AECDs sense or modulate the same parameter. Describe whether the strategies interact in a comparative or additive manner and identify which AECD takes precedence in responding, if applicable.
(10) Explain the extent to which the AECD is included in the applicable test procedures specified in subpart F of this part.
(11) Do the following additional things for AECDs designed to protect engines or equipment:
(i) Identify the engine and/or equipment design limits that make protection necessary and describe any damage that would occur without the AECD.
(ii) Describe how each sensed parameter relates to the protected components' design limits or those operating conditions that cause the need for protection.
(iii) Describe the relationship between the design limits/parameters being protected and the parameters sensed or calculated as surrogates for those design limits/parameters, if applicable.
(iv) Describe how the modulation by the AECD prevents engines and/or equipment from exceeding design limits.
(v) Explain why it is necessary to estimate any parameters instead of measuring them directly and describe how the AECD calculates the estimated value, if applicable.
(vi) Describe how you calibrate the AECD modulation to activate only during conditions related to the stated need to protect components and only as needed to sufficiently protect those components in a way that minimizes the emission impact.
(c) If your engines are equipped with an engine diagnostic system as required under § 1039.110, explain how it works, describing especially the engine conditions (with the corresponding diagnostic trouble codes) that cause the warning lamp to go on and the design features that minimize the potential for operation without reductant. Also identify the communication protocol (SAE J1939, SAE J1979, etc.)

(g) List the specifications of the test fuel to show that it falls within the required ranges we specify in 40 CFR part 1065.
(h) Identify the engine family's useful life.
(i) Include the maintenance instructions you will give to the ultimate purchaser of each new nonroad engine (see § 1039.125).
(j) Include the emission-related installation instructions you will provide if someone else installs your engines in a piece of nonroad equipment (see § 1039.130).
(k) Describe your emission control information label (see § 1039.135).
(l) Identify the emission standards or FELs to which you are certifying engines in the engine family. Identify the ambient operating regions that will apply for NTE testing under § 1039.101(e)(4).
(m) Identify the engine family's deterioration factors and describe how you developed them (see § 1039.245). Present any emission test data you used for this.
(n) State that you operated your emission-data engines as described in the application (including the test procedures, test parameters, and test fuels) to show you meet the requirements of this part.
(o) Present emission data for hydrocarbons (such as NMHC or THCE, as applicable), NO
X
, PM, and CO on an emission-data engine to show your engines meet the applicable duty-cycle emission standards we specify in § 1039.101. Show emission figures before and after applying adjustment factors for regeneration and deterioration factors for each engine. Include emission results for each mode if you do discrete-mode testing under § 1039.505. Present emission data to show that you meet any applicable smoke standards we specify in § 1039.105. If we specify more than one grade of any fuel type (for example, high-sulfur and low-sulfur diesel fuel), you need to submit test data only for one grade, unless the regulations of this part specify otherwise for your engine. Note that § 1039.235 allows you to submit an application in certain cases without new emission data.
(p) State that all the engines in the engine family comply with the not-to-exceed emission standards we specify in subpart B of this part for all normal operation and use when tested as specified in § 1039.515. Describe any relevant testing, engineering analysis, or other information in sufficient detail to support your statement.
(q) For engines above 560 kW, include information showing how your emission controls will function during normal in-use transient operation. For example, this might include the following:
(1) Emission data from transient testing of engines using measurement systems designed for measuring in-use emissions.
(2) Comparison of the engine design for controlling transient emissions with that from engines for which you have emission data over the transient duty cycle for certification.
(3) Detailed descriptions of control algorithms and other design parameters for controlling transient emissions.
(r) Report test results as follows:
(1) Report all valid test results involving measurement of pollutants for which emission standards apply. Also indicate whether there are test results from invalid tests or from any other tests of the emission-data engine, whether or not they were conducted according to the test procedures of subpart F of this part. We may require you to report these additional test results. We may ask you to send other information to confirm that your tests were valid under the requirements of this part and 40 CFR part 1065.
(2) Report measured CO
2
, N
2
O, and CH
4
as described in § 1039.235. Small-volume engine manufacturers may omit reporting N
2
O and CH
4
.
(s) Describe all adjustable operating parameters (see § 1039.115(e)), including production tolerances. For any operating parameters that do not qualify as adjustable parameters, include a description supporting your conclusion (see 40 CFR 1068.50(c)). Include the following in your description of each adjustable parameter:
(1) For practically adjustable parameters, include the nominal or recommended setting, the intended practically adjustable range, and the limits or stops used to limit adjustable ranges. State that the limits, stops, or other means of inhibiting adjustment are effective in preventing adjustment of parameters on in-use engines to settings outside your intended practically adjustable ranges.
(2) For programmable operating parameters, state that you have restricted access to electronic controls to prevent parameter adjustments on in-use engines that would allow operation outside the practically adjustable range. Describe how your engines are designed to prevent unauthorized adjustments.
(t) Provide the information to read, record, and interpret all the information broadcast by an engine's onboard computers and electronic control units. State that, upon request, you will give us any hardware, software, or tools we would need to do this. If you broadcast a surrogate parameter for torque values, you must provide us what we need to convert these into torque units. You may reference any appropriate publicly released standards that define conventions for these messages and parameters. Format your information consistent with publicly released standards.
(u) Confirm that your emission-related installation instructions specify how to ensure that sampling of exhaust emissions will be possible after engines are installed in equipment and placed in service. If this cannot be done by simply adding a 20-centimeter extension to the exhaust pipe, show how to sample exhaust emissions in a way that prevents diluting the exhaust sample with ambient air.
(v) State whether your certification is intended to include engines used in stationary applications. State whether your certification is limited for certain engines. If this is the case, describe how you will prevent use of these engines in applications for which they are not certified. This applies for engines such as the following:
(1) Constant-speed engines.
(2) Engines used for transportation refrigeration units that you certify under the provisions of § 1039.645.
(3) Hand-startable engines certified under the provisions of § 1039.101(c).
(4) Engines above 560 KW that are not certified to emission standards for generator-set engines.
(w) Unconditionally certify that all the engines in the engine family comply with the requirements of this part, other referenced parts of the CFR, and the Clean Air Act.
(x) Include good-faith estimates of U.S.-directed production volumes. Include a justification for the estimated production volumes if they are substantially different than actual production volumes in earlier years for similar models.
(y) Include the information required by other subparts of this part. For example, include the information required by § 1039.725 if you participate in the ABT program.
(z) Include other applicable information, such as information specified in this part or 40 CFR part 1068 related to requests for exemptions.
(aa) Name an agent for service located in the United States. Service on this agent constitutes service on you or any of your officers or employees for any action by EPA or otherwise by the United States related to the requirements of this part.
(bb) For imported engines or equipment, identify the following:
(1) Describe your normal practice for importing engines. For example, this may include identifying the names and addresses of any agents you have authorized to import your engines.
(2) For engines below 560 kW, identify a test facility in the United States where you can test your engines if we select them for testing under a selective enforcement audit, as specified in 40 CFR part 1068, subpart E.

§ 1039.210
May I get preliminary approval before I complete my application?
If you send us information before you finish the application, we will review it and make any appropriate determinations, especially for questions related to engine family definitions, auxiliary emission-control devices, deterioration factors, testing for service accumulation, maintenance, and NTE deficiencies and carve-outs. Decisions made under this section are considered to be preliminary approval, subject to final review and approval. We will generally not reverse a decision where we have given you preliminary approval, unless we find new information supporting a different decision. If you request preliminary approval related to the upcoming model year or the model year after that, we will make best-efforts to make the appropriate determinations as soon as practicable. We will generally not provide preliminary approval related to a future model year more than two years ahead of time.
[72 FR 53131, Sept. 18, 2007]
§ 1039.220
How do I amend my maintenance instructions?
You may amend your emission-related maintenance instructions after you submit your application for certification as long as the amended instructions remain consistent with the provisions of § 1039.125. You must send the Designated Compliance Officer a written request to amend your application for certification for an engine family if you want to change the emission-related maintenance instructions in a way that could affect emissions. In your request, describe the proposed changes to the maintenance instructions. If operators follow the original maintenance instructions rather than the newly specified maintenance, this does not allow you to disqualify those engines from in-use testing or deny a warranty claim.
(a) If you are decreasing or eliminating any specified maintenance, you may distribute the new maintenance instructions to your customers 30 days after we receive your request, unless we disapprove your request. This would generally include replacing one maintenance step with another. We may approve a shorter time or waive this requirement.
(b) If your requested change would not decrease the specified maintenance, you may distribute the new maintenance instructions anytime after you send your request. For example, this paragraph (b) would cover adding instructions to increase the frequency of filter changes for engines in severe-duty applications.
(c) You need not request approval if you are making only minor corrections (such as correcting typographical mistakes), clarifying your maintenance instructions, or changing instructions for maintenance unrelated to emission control. We may ask you to send us copies of maintenance instructions revised under this paragraph (c).
[75 FR 22990, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74135, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1039.225
How do I amend my application for certification?
Before we issue you a certificate of conformity, you may amend your application to include new or modified engine configurations, subject to the provisions of this section. After we have issued your certificate of conformity, you may send us an amended application requesting that we include new or modified engine configurations within the scope of the certificate, subject to the provisions of this section. You must amend your application if any changes occur with respect to any information that is included or should be included in your application.
(a) You must amend your application before you take any of the following actions:
(1) Add an engine configuration to an engine family. In this case, the engine configuration added must be consistent with other engine configurations in the engine family with respect to the criteria listed in § 1039.230.
(2) Change an engine configuration already included in an engine family in a way that may affect emissions, or change any of the components you described in your application for certification. This includes production and design changes that may affect emissions any time during the engine's lifetime.
(3) Modify an FEL for an engine family as described in paragraph (f) of this section.
(b) To amend your application for certification, send the relevant information to the Designated Compliance Officer.
(1) Describe in detail the addition or change in the engine model or configuration you intend to make.
(2) Include engineering evaluations or data showing that the amended engine family complies with all applicable requirements. You may do this by showing that the original emission-data engine is still appropriate for showing that the amended family complies with all applicable requirements.
(3) If the original emission-data engine for the engine family is not appropriate to show compliance for the new or modified engine configuration, include new test data showing that the new or modified engine configuration meets the requirements of this part.
(4) Include any other information needed to make your application correct and complete.
(c) We may ask for more test data or engineering evaluations. You must give us these within 30 days after we request them.
(d) For engine families already covered by a certificate of conformity, we will determine whether the existing certificate of conformity covers your newly added or modified engine. You may ask for a hearing if we deny your request (see § 1039.820).
(e) For engine families already covered by a certificate of conformity, you may start producing the new or modified engine configuration anytime after you send us your amended application and before we make a decision under paragraph (d) of this section. However, if we determine that the affected engines do not meet applicable requirements, we will notify you to cease production of the engines and may require you to recall the engines at no expense to the owner. Choosing to produce engines under this paragraph (e) is deemed to be consent to recall all engines that we determine do not meet applicable emission standards or other requirements and to remedy the nonconformity at no expense to the owner. If you do not provide information required under paragraph (c) of this section within 30 days after we request it, you must stop producing the new or modified engines.
(f) You may ask us to approve a change to your FEL in certain cases after the start of production. The changed FEL may not apply to engines you have already introduced into U.S. commerce, except as described in this paragraph (f). If we approve a changed FEL after the start of production, you must include the new FEL on the emission control information label for all engines produced after the change. You may ask us to approve a change to your FEL in the following cases:
(1) You may ask to raise your FEL for your engine family at any time. In your request, you must show that you will still be able to meet the emission standards as specified in subparts B and H of this part. If you amend your application by submitting new test data to include a newly added or modified engine, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, use the appropriate FELs with corresponding production volumes to calculate emission credits for the model year, as described in subpart H of this part. In all other circumstances, you must use the higher FEL for the entire engine family to calculate emission credits under subpart H of this part.
(2) You may ask to lower the FEL for your engine family only if you have test data from production engines showing that emissions are below the proposed lower FEL. The lower FEL applies only to engines you produce after we approve the new FEL. Use the appropriate FELs with corresponding production volumes to calculate emission credits for the model year, as described in subpart H of this part.
(g) You may produce engines as described in your amended application for certification and consider those engines to be in a certified configuration if we approve a new or modified engine configuration during the model year under paragraph (d) of this section. Similarly, you may modify in-use engines as described in your amended application for certification and consider those engines to be in a certified configuration if we approve a new or modified engine configuration at any time
under paragraph (d) of this section. Modifying a new or in-use engine to be in a certified configuration does not violate the tampering prohibition of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1), as long as this does not involve changing to a certified configuration with a higher family emission limit.

§ 1039.230
How do I select engine families?
(a) For purposes of certification, divide your product line into families of engines that are expected to have similar emission characteristics throughout the useful life as described in this section. Your engine family is limited to a single model year.
(b) Group engines in the same engine family if they are the same in all the following aspects:
(1) The combustion cycle and fuel. However, you do not need to separate dual-fuel and flexible-fuel engines into separate engine families.
(2) The cooling system (water-cooled vs. air-cooled).
(3) Method of air aspiration.
(4) Method of exhaust aftertreatment (for example, catalytic converter or particulate trap).
(5) Combustion chamber design.
(6) Bore and stroke.
(7) Cylinder arrangement (such as in-line vs. vee configurations). This applies for engines with aftertreatment devices only.
(8) Method of control for engine operation other than governing (
i.e.,
mechanical or electronic).
(9) Power category.
(10) Numerical level of the emission standards that apply to the engine.
(c) You may subdivide a group of engines that is identical under paragraph (b) of this section into different engine families if you show the expected emission characteristics are different during the useful life.
(d) In unusual circumstances, you may group engines that are not identical with respect to the things listed in paragraph (b) of this section in the same engine family if you show that their emission characteristics during the useful life will be similar.
(e) If you combine engines from different power categories into a single engine family under paragraph (d) of this section, you must certify the engine family to the more stringent set of standards from the two power categories in that model year.

§ 1039.235
What testing requirements apply for certification?
This section describes the emission testing you must perform to show compliance with the emission standards in § 1039.101(a) and (b) or § 1039.102(a) and (b). See § 1039.205(p) regarding emission testing related to the NTE standards. See § 1039.240, § 1039.245, and 40 CFR part 1065, subpart E, regarding service accumulation before emission testing.
(a) Select an emission-data engine from each engine family for testing. Select the engine configuration with the highest volume of fuel injected per cylinder per combustion cycle at the point of maximum torque—unless good engineering judgment indicates that a different engine configuration is more likely to exceed (or have emissions nearer to) an applicable emission standard or FEL. If two or more engines have the same fueling rate at maximum torque, select the one with the highest fueling rate at rated speed. In making this selection, consider all factors expected to affect emission-control performance and compliance with the standards, including emission levels of all exhaust constituents, especially NO
X
and PM.
(b) Test your emission-data engines using the procedures and equipment specified in subpart F of this part. In the case of dual-fuel engines, measure emissions when operating with each type of fuel for which you intend to certify the engine. In the case of flexible-fuel engines, measure emissions when operating with the fuel mixture that best represents in-use operation or is most likely to have the highest NO
X
emissions (or NO
X
+NMHC emissions for engines subject to NO
X
+NMHC standards), though you may ask us instead
to perform tests with both fuels separately if you can show that intermediate mixtures are not likely to occur in use.
(c) We may perform confirmatory testing by measuring emissions from any of your emission-data engines or other engines from the engine family, as follows:
(1) We may decide to do the testing at your plant or any other facility. If we do this, you must deliver the engine to a test facility we designate. The engine you provide must include appropriate manifolds, aftertreatment devices, electronic control units, and other emission-related components not normally attached directly to the engine block. If we do the testing at your plant, you must schedule it as soon as possible and make available the instruments, personnel, and equipment we need.
(2) If we measure emissions on one of your engines, the results of that testing become the official emission results for the engine. Unless we later invalidate these data, we may decide not to consider your data in determining if your engine family meets applicable requirements.
(3) Before we test one of your engines, we may set its adjustable parameters to any point within the physically adjustable ranges (
see
§ 1039.115(e)).
(4) Before we test one of your engines, we may calibrate it within normal production tolerances for anything we do not consider an adjustable parameter. For example, this would apply for an engine parameter that is subject to production variability because it is adjustable during production, but is not considered an adjustable parameter (as defined in § 1039.801) because it is permanently sealed. For parameters that relate to a level of performance that is itself subject to a specified range (such as maximum power output), we will generally perform any calibration under this paragraph (c)(4) in a way that keeps performance within the specified range.
(d) You may ask to use carryover emission data from a previous model year instead of doing new tests, but only if all the following are true:
(1) The engine family from the previous model year differs from the current engine family only with respect to model year, items identified in § 1039.225(a), or other characteristics unrelated to emissions. We may waive this criterion for differences we determine not to be relevant.
(2) The emission-data engine from the previous model year remains the appropriate emission-data engine under paragraph (b) of this section.
(3) The data show that the emission-data engine would meet all the requirements that apply to the engine family covered by the application for certification.
(e) We may require you to test a second engine of the same or different configuration in addition to the engine tested under paragraph (b) of this section.
(f) If you use an alternate test procedure under 40 CFR 1065.10 and later testing shows that such testing does not produce results that are equivalent to the procedures specified in subpart F of this part, we may reject data you generated using the alternate procedure.
(g) Measure CO
2
and CH
4
with each low-hour certification test using the procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065 in the 2011 and 2012 model years, respectively. Also measure N
2
O with each low-hour certification test using the procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065 starting in the 2013 model year for any engine family that depends on NOx aftertreatment to meet emission standards. Small-volume engine manufacturers may omit measurement of N
2
O and CH
4
. These measurements are not required for NTE testing. Use the same units and modal calculations as for your other results to report a single weighted value for each constituent. Round the final values as follows:
(1) Round CO
2
to the nearest 1 g/kW-hr.
(2) Round N
2
O to the nearest 0.001 g/kW-hr.
(3) Round CH
4
to the nearest 0.001g/kW-hr.

§ 1039.240
How do I demonstrate that my engine family complies with exhaust emission standards?
(a) For purposes of certification, your engine family is considered in compliance with the emission standards in § 1039.101(a) and (b), § 1039.102(a) and (b), § 1039.104, and § 1039.105 if all emission-data engines representing that family have test results showing official emission results and deteriorated emission levels at or below these standards. This also applies for all test points for emission-data engines within the family used to establish deterioration factors. Note that your FELs are considered to be the applicable emission standards with which you must comply if you participate in the ABT program in subpart H of this part.
(b) Your engine family is deemed not to comply if any emission-data engine representing that family has test results showing an official emission result or a deteriorated emission level for any pollutant that is above an applicable emission standard. Similarly, your engine family is deemed not to comply if any emission-data engine representing that family has test results showing any emission level above the applicable not-to-exceed emission standard for any pollutant. This also applies for all test points for emission-data engines within the family used to establish deterioration factors.
(c) To compare emission levels from the emission-data engine with the applicable emission standards, apply deterioration factors to the measured emission levels for each pollutant. Section 1039.245 specifies how to test your engine to develop deterioration factors that represent the deterioration expected in emissions over your engines' full useful life. Your deterioration factors must take into account any available data from in-use testing with similar engines. Small-volume engine manufacturers may use assigned deterioration factors that we establish. Apply deterioration factors as follows:
(1)
Additive deterioration factor for exhaust emissions.
Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, use an additive deterioration factor for exhaust emissions. An additive deterioration factor is the difference between exhaust emissions at the end of the useful life and exhaust emissions at the low-hour test point. In these cases, adjust the official emission results for each tested engine at the selected test point by adding the factor to the measured emissions. If the factor is less than zero, use zero. Additive deterioration factors must be specified to one more decimal place than the applicable standard.
(2)
Multiplicative deterioration factor for exhaust emissions.
Use a multiplicative deterioration factor if good engineering judgment calls for the deterioration factor for a pollutant to be the ratio of exhaust emissions at the end of the useful life to exhaust emissions at the low-hour test point. For example, if you use aftertreatment technology that controls emissions of a pollutant proportionally to engine-out emissions, it is often appropriate to use a multiplicative deterioration factor. Adjust the official emission results for each tested engine at the selected test point by multiplying the measured emissions by the deterioration factor. If the factor is less than one, use one. A multiplicative deterioration factor may not be appropriate in cases where testing variability is significantly greater than engine-to-engine variability. Multiplicative deterioration factors must be specified to one more significant figure than the applicable standard.
(3)
Sawtooth and other nonlinear deterioration patterns.
The deterioration factors described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section assume that the highest useful life emissions occur either at the end of useful life or at the low-hour test point. The provisions of this paragraph (c)(3) apply where good engineering judgment indicates that the highest emissions over the useful life will occur between these two points. For example, emissions may increase with service accumulation until a certain maintenance step is performed, then return to the low-hour emission levels and begin increasing again. Base deterioration factors for engines with such emission patterns on the difference between (or ratio of) the point at which the highest emissions occur and the low-hour test point. Note that this applies for maintenance-related deterioration only where we
allow such critical emission-related maintenance.
(4)
Deterioration factor for smoke.
Deterioration factors for smoke are always additive, as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(5)
Deterioration factor for crankcase emissions.
If your engine vents crankcase emissions to the exhaust or to the atmosphere, you must account for crankcase emission deterioration, using good engineering judgment. You may use separate deterioration factors for crankcase emissions of each pollutant (either multiplicative or additive) or include the effects in combined deterioration factors that include exhaust and crankcase emissions together for each pollutant.
(6)
Dual-fuel and flexible-fuel engines.
In the case of dual-fuel and flexible-fuel engines, apply deterioration factors separately for each fuel type. You may accumulate service hours on a single emission-data engine using the type of fuel or the fuel mixture expected to have the highest combustion and exhaust temperatures; you may ask us to approve a different fuel mixture if you demonstrate that a different criterion is more appropriate.
(d) Determine the official emission result for each pollutant to at least one more decimal place than the applicable standard. Apply the deterioration factor to the official emission result, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, then round the adjusted figure to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard. Compare the rounded emission levels to the emission standard for each emission-data engine. In the case of NO
X
+NMHC standards, apply the deterioration factor to each pollutant and then add the results before rounding.

§ 1039.245
How do I determine deterioration factors from exhaust durability testing?
This section describes how to determine deterioration factors, either with an engineering analysis, with pre-existing test data, or with new emission measurements. Apply these deterioration factors to determine whether your engines will meet the duty-cycle emission standards throughout the useful life as described in § 1039.240.
(a) You may ask us to approve deterioration factors for an engine family with established technology based on engineering analysis instead of testing. Engines certified to a NO
X
+ NMHC standard or FEL greater than the Tier 3 NO
X
+ NMHC standard described in appendix I of this part are considered to rely on established technology for gaseous emission control, except that this does not include any engines that use exhaust-gas recirculation or aftertreatment. In most cases, technologies used to meet the Tier 1 and Tier 2 emission standards would be considered to be established technology.
(b) You may ask us to approve deterioration factors for an engine family based on emission measurements from similar highway or nonroad engines if you have already given us these data for certifying the other engines in the same or earlier model years. Use good engineering judgment to decide whether the two engines are similar. We will approve your request if you show us that the emission measurements from other engines reasonably represent in-use deterioration for the engine family for which you have not yet determined deterioration factors.
(c) If you are unable to determine deterioration factors for an engine family under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, select engines, subsystems, or components for testing. Determine deterioration factors based on service accumulation and related testing to represent the deterioration expected from in-use engines over the full useful life. You must measure emissions from the emission-data engine at least three times with evenly spaced intervals of service accumulation. You may use extrapolation to determine deterioration factors once you have established a trend of changing emissions with age for each pollutant. You may use an engine installed in nonroad equipment to accumulate service hours instead of running the engine only in the laboratory. You may perform maintenance on emission-data engines as described in § 1039.125 and 40 CFR part 1065, subpart E. Use good engineering judgment for
all aspects of the effort to establish deterioration factors under this paragraph (c).
(d) Include the following information in your application for certification:
(1) If you use test data from a different engine family, explain why this is appropriate and include all the emission measurements on which you base the deterioration factor.
(2) If you determine your deterioration factors based on engineering analysis, explain why this is appropriate and include a statement that all data, analyses, evaluations, and other information you used are available for our review upon request.
(3) If you do testing to determine deterioration factors, describe the form and extent of service accumulation, including a rationale for selecting the service-accumulation period and the method you use to accumulate hours.
(e) You may alternatively determine and verify deterioration factors based on bench-aged aftertreatment as described in 40 CFR 1036.245 and 1036.246, with the following exceptions:
(1) The minimum required aging for engines as specified in 40 CFR 1036.245(c)(2) is 1,500 hours. Operate the engine for service accumulation using the same sequence of duty cycles that would apply for determining a deterioration factor under paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) Use good engineering judgment to perform verification testing using the procedures of § 1039.515 rather than 40 CFR 1036.555. For PEMS testing, measure emissions as the equipment goes through its normal operation over the course of the day (or shift-day).
(3) Apply infrequent regeneration adjustment factors as specified in § 1039.525 rather than 40 CFR 1036.580.

§ 1039.250
What records must I keep and what reports must I send to EPA?
(a) Within 45 days after the end of the model year, send the Designated Compliance Officer a report describing the following information about engines you produced during the model year:
(1) Report the total number of engines you produced in each engine family by maximum engine power, total displacement, and the type of fuel system.
(2) If you produced exempted engines under the provisions of § 1039.625, report the number of exempted engines you produced for each engine model and identify the buyer or shipping destination for each exempted engine.
(b) Organize and maintain the following records:
(1) A copy of all applications and any summary information you send us.
(2) Any of the information we specify in § 1039.205 that you were not required to include in your application.
(3) A detailed history of each emission-data engine. For each engine, describe all of the following:
(i) The emission-data engine's construction, including its origin and buildup, steps you took to ensure that it represents production engines, any components you built specially for it, and all the components you include in your application for certification.
(ii) How you accumulated engine operating hours (service accumulation), including the dates and the number of hours accumulated.
(iii) All maintenance, including modifications, parts changes, and other service, and the dates and reasons for the maintenance.
(iv) All your emission tests, including the date and purpose of each test and documentation of test parameters as specified in part 40 CFR part 1065.
(v) All tests to diagnose engine or emission-control performance, giving the date and time of each and the reasons for the test.
(vi) Any other significant events.
(4) Production figures for each engine family divided by assembly plant.
(5) Keep a list of engine identification numbers for all the engines you produce under each certificate of conformity.
(c) Keep required data from emission tests and all other information specified in this section for eight years after we issue your certificate. If you use the same emission data or other information for a later model year, the eight-year period restarts with each year
that you continue to rely on the information.
(d) Store these records in any format and on any media, as long as you can promptly send us organized, written records in English if we ask for them. You must keep these records readily available. We may review them at any time.
[69 FR 39213, June 29, 2004, as amended at 75 FR 22991, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74136, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1039.255
What decisions may EPA make regarding a certificate of conformity?
(a) If we determine an application is complete and shows that the engine family meets all the requirements of this part and the Act, we will issue a certificate of conformity for the engine family for that model year. We may make the approval subject to additional conditions.
(b) We may deny an application for certification if we determine that an engine family fails to comply with emission standards or other requirements of this part or the Clean Air Act. We will base our decision on all available information. If we deny an application, we will explain why in writing.
(c) In addition, we may deny your application or suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity if you do any of the following:
(1) Refuse to comply with any testing or reporting requirements in this part.
(2) Submit false or incomplete information. This includes doing anything after submitting an application that causes submitted information to be false or incomplete.
(3) Cause any test data to become inaccurate.
(4) Deny us from completing authorized activities (see 40 CFR 1068.20). This includes a failure to provide reasonable assistance.
(5) Produce engines for importation into the United States at a location where local law prohibits us from carrying out authorized activities.
(6) Fail to supply requested information or amend an application to include all engines being produced.
(7) Take any action that otherwise circumvents the intent of the Act or this part.
(d) We may void a certificate of conformity if you fail to keep records, send reports, or give us information as required under this part or the Act. Note that these are also violations of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(2).
(e) We may void a certificate of conformity if we find that you intentionally submitted false or incomplete information. This includes doing anything after submitting an application that causes submitted information to be false or incomplete.
(f) If we deny an application or suspend, revoke, or void a certificate, you may ask for a hearing (see § 1039.820).

Subpart D [Reserved]

# Subpart E—In-Use Testing
§ 1039.401
General provisions.
We may perform in-use testing of any engine subject to the standards of this part. However, we will limit recall testing to the first 75 percent of each engine's useful life as specified in § 1039.101(g).

# Subpart F—Test Procedures
§ 1039.501
How do I run a valid emission test?
(a) Use the equipment and procedures for compression-ignition engines in 40 CFR part 1065 to determine whether engines meet the duty-cycle emission standards in subpart B of this part. Measure the emissions of all the exhaust constituents subject to emission standards as specified in 40 CFR part 1065. Measure CO

as described in § 1039.235. Use the applicable duty cycles specified in §§ 1039.505 and 1039.510.
(b) Section 1039.515 describes the supplemental procedures for evaluating whether engines meet the not-to-exceed emission standards in subpart B of this part.
(c) Measure smoke opacity using the procedures in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart L, for evaluating whether engines meet the smoke opacity standards in § 1039.105, except that you may test two-cylinder engines with an exhaust
muffler like those installed on in-use engines.
(d) Use the fuels specified in § 1039.104(e) and 40 CFR part 1065 to perform valid tests.
(1) For service accumulation, use the test fuel or any commercially available fuel that is representative of the fuel that in-use engines will use.
(2) For diesel-fueled engines, use the appropriate diesel fuel specified in 40 CFR part 1065 for emission testing. Unless we specify otherwise, the appropriate diesel test fuel is the ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel. If we allow you to use a test fuel with higher sulfur levels, identify the test fuel in your application for certification and ensure that the emission control information label is consistent with your selection of the test fuel (see § 1039.135(c)(9)). For example, do not test with ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel if you intend to label your engines to allow use of diesel fuel with sulfur concentrations up to 500 ppm.
(e) The following provisions apply for engines using aftertreatment technology with infrequent regeneration events that may occur during testing:
(1) Adjust measured emissions to account for aftertreatment technology with infrequent regeneration as described in § 1039.525.
(2) If your engine family includes engines with one or more emergency AECDs approved under § 1039.115(g)(4) or (5), do not consider additional regenerations resulting from those AECDs when developing adjustments to measured values under this paragraph (e).
(3) Invalidate a smoke test if active regeneration starts to occur during the test.
(f) You may disable any AECDs that have been approved solely for emergency equipment applications under § 1039.115(g)(4). Note that the emission standards do not apply when any of these AECDs are active.
(g) You may use special or alternate procedures to the extent we allow them under 40 CFR 1065.10.
(h) This subpart is addressed to you as a manufacturer, but it applies equally to anyone who does testing for you, and to us when we perform testing to determine if your engines meet emission standards.

§ 1039.505
How do I test engines using steady-state duty cycles, including ramped-modal testing?
This section describes how to test engines under steady-state conditions. In some cases, we allow you to choose the appropriate steady-state duty cycle for an engine; you may also choose between discrete-mode and ramped-modal testing. In all cases, you must use the duty cycle you select in your application for certification for all testing you perform for that engine family. If we test your engines to confirm that they meet emission standards, we will use the duty cycle you select for your own testing. If you submit certification test data using more than one duty cycle, any of the selected duty cycles may be used for any subsequent testing. We may also perform other testing as allowed by the Clean Air Act.
(a) You may perform steady-state testing with either discrete-mode or ramped-modal cycles as described in 40 CFR part 1065.
(b) Measure emissions by testing the engine on a dynamometer with one of the following duty cycles to determine whether it meets the steady-state emission standards in § 1039.101(b):
(1) Use the 5-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in paragraph (a) of Appendix II of this part for constant-speed engines. Note that these cycles do not apply to all engines used in constant-speed applications, as described in § 1039.801.
(2) Use the 6-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in paragraph (b) of Appendix II of this part for variable-speed engines below 19 kW. You may instead use the 8-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in paragraph (c) of Appendix II of this part if some engines from your engine family will be used in applications that do not involve governing to maintain engine operation around rated speed.
(3) Use the 8-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in paragraph (c) of Appendix II of this part for variable-speed engines at or above 19 kW.
(c) For constant-speed engines whose design prevents full-load operation for extended periods, you may ask for approval under 40 CFR 1065.10(c) to replace full-load operation with the maximum load for which the engine is designed to operate for extended periods.
(d) To allow non-motoring dynamometers on cycles with idle, you may omit additional points from the duty-cycle regression as follows:
(1) For variable-speed engines with low-speed governors, you may omit speed, torque, and power points from the duty-cycle regression statistics if the following are met:
(i) The engine operator demand is at its minimum.
(ii) The dynamometer demand is at its minimum.
(iii) It is an idle point f

§ 1039.510
Which duty cycles do I use for transient testing?
(a) Measure emissions by testing the engine on a dynamometer with one of the following transient duty cycles to determine whether it meets the transient emission standards in § 1039.101(a):
(1) For variable-speed engines, use the transient duty cycle described in appendix VI of this part.
(2) [Reserved]
(b) The transient test sequence consists of an initial run through the transient duty cycle from a cold start, 20 minutes with no engine operation, then a final run through the same transient duty cycle. Calculate the official transient emission result from the following equation:

§ 1039.515
What are the test procedures related to not-to-exceed standards?
(a)
General provisions.
The provisions in 40 CFR 86.1370 apply for determining whether an engine meets the not-to-exceed emission standards in § 1039.101(e), except as noted in this section. Interpret references to vehicles and vehicle operation to mean equipment and equipment operation.
(b)
Special PM zone.
For engines certified to a PM standard or FEL above 0.07 g/kW-hr, a modified NTE control area applies for PM emissions only. The speeds and loads to be excluded are determined based on speeds B and C, determined according to the provisions of 40 CFR 86.1360-2007(c). One of the following provisions applies:
(1) If the C speed is below 2400 rpm, exclude the speed and load points to the right of or below the line formed by connecting the following two points on a plot of speed-vs.-power:
(i) 30% of maximum power at the B speed; however, use the power value corresponding to the engine operation at 30% of maximum torque at the B speed if this is greater than 30% of maximum power at the B speed.
(ii) 70% of maximum power at 100% speed.
(2) If the C speed is at or above 2400 rpm, exclude the speed and load points to the right of the line formed by connecting the two points in paragraphs
(b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section (the 30% and 50% torque/power points) and below the line formed by connecting the two points in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section (the 50% and 70% torque/power points). The 30%, 50%, and 70% torque/power points are defined as follows:
(i) 30% of maximum power at the B speed; however, use the power value corresponding to the engine operation at 30% of maximum torque at the B speed if this is greater than 30% of maximum power at the B speed.
(ii) 50% of maximum power at 2400 rpm.
(iii) 70% of maximum power at 100% speed.

§ 1039.520
What testing must I perform to establish deterioration factors?
Sections 1039.240 and 1039.245 describe the method for testing that must be performed to establish deterioration factors for an engine family.
§ 1039.525
How do I adjust emission levels to account for infrequently regenerating aftertreatment devices?
For engines using aftertreatment technology with infrequent regeneration events that may occur during testing, take one of the following approaches to account for the emission impact of regeneration:
(a) You may use the calculation methodology described in 40 CFR 1065.680 to adjust measured emission results. Do this by developing an upward adjustment factor and a downward adjustment factor for each pollutant based on measured emission data and observed regeneration frequency as follows:
(1) Adjustment factors should generally apply to an entire engine family, but you may develop separate adjustment factors for different configurations within an engine family. Use the adjustment factors from this section for all testing for the engine family.
(2) You may use carryover or carry-across data to establish adjustment factors for an engine family as described in § 1039.235, consistent with good engineering judgment.
(3) For engines that are required to certify to both transient and steady-state duty cycles, calculate a separate adjustment factor for steady-state and transient operation.
(b) You may ask us to approve an alternate methodology to account for regeneration events. We will generally limit approval to cases where your engines use aftertreatment technology with extremely infrequent regeneration and you are unable to apply the provisions of this section.
(c) You may choose to make no adjustments to measured emission results if you determine that regeneration does not significantly affect emission levels for an engine family (or configuration) or if it is not practical to identify when regeneration occurs. If you choose not to make adjustments under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, your engines must meet emission standards for all testing, without regard to regeneration.
[81 FR 74137, Oct. 25, 2016]

# Subpart G—Special Compliance Provisions
§ 1039.601
What compliance provisions apply?
(a) Engine and equipment manufacturers, as well as owners, operators, and rebuilders of engines subject to the requirements of this part, and all other persons, must observe the provisions of this part, the requirements and prohibitions in 40 CFR part 1068, and the provisions of the Act.
(b) Subpart C of this part describes how to test and certify dual-fuel and flexible-fuel engines. Some multi-fuel engines may not fit either of those defined terms. For such engines, we will determine whether it is most appropriate to treat them as single-fuel engines, dual-fuel engines, or flexible-fuel engines based on the range of possible and expected fuel mixtures. For example, an engine might burn natural gas but initiate combustion with a pilot injection of diesel fuel. If the engine is designed to operate with a single fueling algorithm (
i.e.
, fueling rates are fixed at a given engine speed and load condition), we would generally treat it as a single-fuel engine. In this context,
the combination of diesel fuel and natural gas would be its own fuel type. If the engine is designed to also operate on diesel fuel alone, we would generally treat it as a dual-fuel engine. If the engine is designed to operate on varying mixtures of the two fuels, we would generally treat it as a flexible-fuel engine. To the extent that requirements vary for the different fuels or fuel mixtures, we may apply the more stringent requirements.
[81 FR 74137, Oct. 25, 2016, as amended at 86 FR 34505, June 29, 2021]
§ 1039.605
What provisions apply to engines certified under the motor-vehicle program?
(a)
General provisions.
If you are an engine manufacturer, this section allows you to introduce new nonroad engines into commerce if they are already certified to the requirements that apply to compression-ignition engines under 40 CFR parts 85 and 86 for the appropriate model year. If you comply with all the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part 1039 for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the requirements of this part 1039. See § 1039.610 for similar provisions that apply to engines certified to chassis-based standards for motor vehicles.
(b)
Equipment-manufacturer provisions.
If you are not an engine manufacturer, you may install motor-vehicle engines certified for the appropriate model year under 40 CFR part 86 in nonroad equipment as long as you meet all the requirements and conditions specified in paragraph (d) of this section. You must also add the fuel-inlet label we specify in § 1039.135(e). If you modify the motor-vehicle engine in any of the ways described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, we will consider you a manufacturer of a new nonroad engine. Such engine modifications prevent you from using the provisions of this section.
(c)
Liability.
Engines for which you meet the requirements of this section are exempt from all the requirements and prohibitions of this part, except for those specified in this section. Engines exempted under this section must meet all the applicable requirements from 40 CFR parts 85 and 86. This applies to engine manufacturers, equipment manufacturers who use these engines, and all other persons as if these engines were used in a motor vehicle. The prohibited acts of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) apply to these new engines and equipment; however, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part 1039 for its model year. If we make a determination that these engines do not conform to the regulations during their useful life, we may require you to recall them under 40 CFR part 86 or 40 CFR 1068.505.
(d)
Specific requirements.
If you are an engine manufacturer or equipment manufacturer and meet all the following criteria and requirements regarding your new nonroad engine, the engine is eligible for an exemption under this section:
(1) Your engine must be covered by a valid certificate of conformity issued under 40 CFR part 86.
(2) You must not make any changes to the certified engine that could reasonably be expected to increase its exhaust emissions for any pollutant, or its evaporative emissions if it is subject to evaporative-emission standards. For example, if you make any of the following changes to one of these engines, you do not qualify for this exemption:
(i) Change any fuel system parameters from the certified configuration.
(ii) Change, remove, or fail to properly install any other component, element of design, or calibration specified in the engine manufacturer's application for certification. This includes aftertreatment devices and all related components.
(iii) Modify or design the engine cooling system so that temperatures or heat rejection rates are outside the original engine manufacturer's specified ranges.
(3) You must show that fewer than 50 percent of the engine family's total sales in the United States are used in nonroad applications. This includes engines used in any application without regard to which company manufactures
the vehicle or equipment. Show this as follows:
(i) If you are the original manufacturer of the engine, base this showing on your sales information.
(ii) In all other cases, you must get the original manufacturer of the engine to confirm this based on its sales information.
(4) You must ensure that the engine has the label we require under 40 CFR part 86.
(5) You must add a permanent supplemental label to the engine in a position where it will remain clearly visible after installation in the equipment. In the supplemental label, do the following:
(i) Include the heading: “NONROAD ENGINE EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION”.
(ii) Include your full corporate name and trademark. You may identify another company and use its trademark instead of yours if you comply with the branding provisions of 40 CFR 1068.45.
(iii) State: “THIS ENGINE WAS ADAPTED FOR NONROAD USE WITHOUT AFFECTING ITS EMISSION CONTROLS. THE EMISSION-CONTROL SYSTEM DEPENDS ON THE USE OF FUEL MEETING SPECIFICATIONS THAT APPLY FOR MOTOR-VEHICLE APPLICATIONS. OPERATING THE ENGINE ON OTHER FUELS MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW.”
(iv) State the date you finished modifying the engine (month and year), if applicable.
(6) The original and supplemental labels must be readily visible after the engine is installed in the equipment or, if the equipment obscures the engine's emission control information label, the equipment manufacturer must attach duplicate labels, as described in 40 CFR 1068.105.
(7) You must make sure that nonroad equipment produced under this section will have the fueling label we specify in § 1039.135(c)(9)(i).
(8) Send the Designated Compliance Officer written notification describing your plans before using the provisions of this section. In addition, by February 28 of each calendar year (or less often if we tell you), send the Designated Compliance Officer a signed letter with all the following information:
(i) Identify your full corporate name, address, and telephone number.
(ii) List the engine or equipment models for which you used this exemption in the previous year and describe your basis for meeting the sales restrictions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(iii) State: “We prepared each listed [engine or equipment] model for nonroad application without making any changes that could increase its certified emission levels, as described in 40 CFR 1039.605.”
(e)
Failure to comply.
If your engines do not meet the criteria listed in paragraph (d) of this section, they will be subject to the standards, requirements, and prohibitions of this part 1039 and the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 will not be deemed to also be a certificate issued under this part 1039. Introducing these engines into commerce without a valid exemption or certificate of conformity under this part violates the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1).
(f)
Data submission.
We may require you to send us emission test data on any applicable nonroad duty cycles.
(g)
Participation in averaging, banking and trading.
Engines adapted for nonroad use under this section may not generate or use emission credits under this part 1039. These engines may generate credits under the ABT provisions in 40 CFR part 86. These engines must use emission credits under 40 CFR part 86 if they are certified to an FEL that exceeds an applicable standard under 40 CFR part 86.

§ 1039.610
What provisions apply to vehicles certified under the motor-vehicle program?
(a)
General provisions.
If you are a motor-vehicle manufacturer, this section allows you to introduce new nonroad engines or equipment into commerce if the vehicle is already certified to the requirements that apply under 40 CFR parts 85 and 86 for the appropriate model year. If you comply
with all of the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 for each motor vehicle to also be a valid certificate of conformity for the engine under this part 1039 for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the requirements of this part 1039. See § 1039.605 for similar provisions that apply to motor-vehicle engines produced for nonroad equipment.
(b)
Equipment-manufacturer provisions.
If you are not a motor-vehicle manufacturer, you may produce nonroad equipment from motor vehicles under this section as long as you meet all the requirements and conditions specified in paragraph (d) of this section. You must also add the fuel-inlet label we specify in § 1039.135(e). If you modify the motor vehicle or its engine in any of the ways described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, we will consider you a manufacturer of a new nonroad engine. Such modifications prevent you from using the provisions of this section.
(c)
Liability.
Engines, vehicles, and equipment for which you meet the requirements of this section are exempt from all the requirements and prohibitions of this part, except for those specified in this section. Engines exempted under this section must meet all the applicable requirements from 40 CFR parts 85 and 86. This applies to engine manufacturers, equipment manufacturers, and all other persons as if the nonroad equipment were motor vehicles. The prohibited acts of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) apply to these new pieces of equipment; however, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 for each motor vehicle to also be a valid certificate of conformity for the engine under this part 1039 for its model year. If we make a determination that these engines, vehicles, or equipment do not conform to the regulations during their useful life, we may require you to recall them under 40 CFR part 86 or 40 CFR 1068.505.
(d)
Specific requirements.
If you are a motor-vehicle manufacturer and meet all the following criteria and requirements regarding your new nonroad equipment and its engine, the engine is eligible for an exemption under this section:
(1) Your equipment must be covered by a valid certificate of conformity as a motor vehicle issued under 40 CFR part 86.
(2) You must not make any changes to the certified vehicle that we could reasonably expect to increase its exhaust emissions for any pollutant, or its evaporative emissions if it is subject to evaporative-emission standards. For example, if you make any of the following changes, you do not qualify for this exemption:
(i) Change any fuel system parameters from the certified configuration.
(ii) Change, remove, or fail to properly install any other component, element of design, or calibration specified in the vehicle manufacturer's application for certification. This includes aftertreatment devices and all related components.
(iii) Modify or design the engine cooling system so that temperatures or heat rejection rates are outside the original vehicle manufacturer's specified ranges.
(iv) Add more than 500 pounds to the curb weight of the originally certified motor vehicle.
(3) You must show that fewer than 50 percent of the engine family's total sales in the United States are used in nonroad applications. This includes any type of vehicle, without regard to which company completes the manufacturing of the nonroad equipment. Show this as follows:
(i) If you are the original manufacturer of the vehicle, base this showing on your sales information.
(ii) In all other cases, you must get the original manufacturer of the vehicle to confirm this based on their sales information.
(4) The equipment must have the vehicle emission control information and fuel labels we require under 40 CFR 86.007-35.
(5) You must add a permanent supplemental label to the equipment in a position where it will remain clearly visible. In the supplemental label, do the following:
(i) Include the heading: “NONROAD ENGINE EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION”.
(ii) Include your full corporate name and trademark. You may identify another company and use its trademark instead of yours if you comply with the branding provisions of 40 CFR 1068.45.
(iii) State: “THIS VEHICLE WAS ADAPTED FOR NONROAD USE WITHOUT AFFECTING ITS EMISSION CONTROLS. THE EMISSION-CONTROL SYSTEM DEPENDS ON THE USE OF FUEL MEETING SPECIFICATIONS THAT APPLY FOR MOTOR-VEHICLE APPLICATIONS. OPERATING THE ENGINE ON OTHER FUELS MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW.”.
(iv) State the date you finished modifying the vehicle (month and year), if applicable.
(6) The original and supplemental labels must be readily visible in the fully assembled equipment.
(7) Send the Designated Compliance Officer written notification describing your plans before using the provisions of this section. In addition, by February 28 of each calendar year (or less often if we tell you), send the Designated Compliance Officer a signed letter with all the following information:
(i) Identify your full corporate name, address, and telephone number.
(ii) List the equipment models for which you used this exemption in the previous year and describe your basis for meeting the sales restrictions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(iii) State: “We prepared each listed engine or equipment model for nonroad application without making any changes that could increase its certified emission levels, as described in 40 CFR 1039.610.”
(e)
Failure to comply.
If your engines, vehicles, or equipment do not meet the criteria listed in paragraph (d) of this section, the engines will be subject to the standards, requirements, and prohibitions of this part 1039, and the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86 will not be deemed to also be a certificate issued under this part 1039. Introducing these engines into commerce without a valid exemption or certificate of conformity under this part violates the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1).
(f)
Data submission.
We may require you to send us emission test data on any applicable nonroad duty cycles.
(g)
Participation in averaging, banking and trading.
Vehicles adapted for nonroad use under this section may not generate or use emission credits under this part 1039. These vehicles may generate credits under the ABT provisions in 40 CFR part 86. These vehicles must be included in the calculation of the applicable fleet average in 40 CFR part 86.
[69 FR 39213, June 29, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 40463, July 13, 2005; 72 FR 53132, Sept. 18, 2007; 75 FR 22992, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74138, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1039.615
What special provisions apply to engines using noncommercial fuels?
In § 1039.115(e), we generally require that engines meet emission standards for any adjustment within the full range of any adjustable parameters. For engines that use noncommercial fuels significantly different than the specified test fuel of the same type, you may ask to use the parameter-adjustment provisions of this section instead of those in § 1039.115(e). Engines certified under this section must be in a separate engine family.
(a) If we approve your request, the following provisions apply:
(1) You must certify the engine using the test fuel specified in § 1039.501.
(2) You may produce the engine without limits or stops that keep the engine adjusted within the certified range.
(3) You must specify in-use adjustments different than the adjustable settings appropriate for the specified test fuel, consistent with the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(b) To produce engines under this section, you must do the following:
(1) Specify in-use adjustments needed so the engine's level of emission control for each regulated pollutant is equivalent to that from the certified configuration.
(2) Add the following information to the emission control information label specified in § 1039.135:
(i) Include instructions describing how to adjust the engine to operate in a way that maintains the effectiveness of the emission-control system.
(ii) State: “THIS ENGINE IS CERTIFIED TO OPERATE IN APPLICATIONS USING NONCOMMERCIAL FUEL. MALADJUSTMENT OF THE ENGINE IS A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.”.
(3) Keep records to document the destinations and quantities of engines produced under this section.
§ 1039.620
What are the provisions for exempting engines used solely for competition?
The provisions of this section apply for new engines built on or after January 1, 2006.
(a) Equipment manufacturers may use uncertified engines if the vehicles or equipment in which they are installed will be used solely for competition.
(b) The definition of nonroad engine in 40 CFR 1068.30 excludes engines used solely for competition. These engines are not required to comply with this part, but 40 CFR 1068.101 prohibits the use of competition engines for noncompetition purposes.
(c) We consider a vehicle or piece of equipment to be one that will be used solely for competition if it has features that are not easily removed that would make its use other than in competition unsafe, impractical, or highly unlikely.
(d) As an engine manufacturer, your engine is exempt without our prior approval if you have a written request for an exempted engine from the equipment manufacturer showing the basis for believing that the equipment will be used solely for competition. You must permanently label engines exempted under this section to clearly indicate that they are to be used solely for competition. Failure to properly label an engine will void the exemption.
(e) We may discontinue an exemption under this section if we find that engines are not used solely for competition.

§ 1039.625
What requirements apply under the program for equipment-manufacturer flexibility?
The provisions of this section allow equipment manufacturers to produce equipment with engines that are subject to less stringent emission standards after the Tier 4 emission standards begin to apply. To be eligible to use the provisions of this section, you must follow all the instructions in this section. See § 1039.626 for requirements that apply specifically to companies that manufacture equipment outside the United States and to companies that import such equipment without manufacturing it. Engines and equipment you produce under this section are exempt from the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1), subject to the provisions of this section.
(a)
General.
If you are an equipment manufacturer, you may introduce into commerce in the United States limited numbers of nonroad equipment with engines exempted under this section. You may use the exemptions in this section only if you have primary responsibility for designing and manufacturing equipment and your manufacturing procedures include installing some engines in this equipment. Consider all U.S.-directed equipment sales in showing that you meet the requirements of this section, including those from any parent or subsidiary companies and those from any other companies you license to produce equipment for you. If you produce a type of equipment that has more than one engine, count each engine separately. These provisions are available over the following periods:
(1) These provisions are available for the years shown in the following table, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section:

(b)
Allowances.
You may choose one of the following options for each power category to produce equipment with exempted engines under this section, except as allowed under § 1039.627:
(1)
Percent-of-production allowances.
You may produce a certain number of units with exempted engines calculated using a percentage of your total sales within a power category relative to your total U.S.-directed production volume. The sum of these percentages within a power category during the seven-year period specified in paragraph (a) of this section may not exceed 80 percent, except as allowed under paragraph (b)(2) or (m) of this section.
(2)
Small-volume allowances.
You may determine an alternate allowance for a specific number of exempted engines under this section using one of the following approaches for your U.S.-directed production volumes:
(i) You may produce up to 700 units with exempted engines within a power category during the seven-year period specified in paragraph (a) of this section, with no more than 200 units in any single year within a power category, except as provided in paragraph (m) of this section. Engines within a power category that are exempted under this section must be from a single engine family within a given year.
(ii) For engines below 130 kW, you may produce up to 525 units with exempted engines within a power category during the seven-year period specified in paragraph (a) of this section, with no more than 150 units in any single year within a power category, except as provided in paragraph (m) of this section. For engines at or above 130 kW, you may produce up to 350 units with exempted engines within a power category during the seven-year period, with no more than 100 units in any single year within a power category. Exemptions under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) may apply to engines from multiple engine families in a given year.
(iii) In each power category at or above 56 kW, you may apply the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section in the first two model years for which Tier 4 standards apply, regardless of the number of engine families you use in your equipment, provided you exceed the single engine family restriction of that paragraph primarily due to production of equipment intended specifically to travel on snow and to commonly operate at more than 9,000 feet above sea level. After the first two Tier 4 model years in a power category, you may continue to apply the provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, subject to the single engine family restriction.
(c)
Percentage calculation.
Calculate for each calendar year the percentage of equipment with exempted engines from your total U.S.-directed production within a power category if you need to show that you meet the percent-of-production allowances in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(d)
Inclusion of engines not subject to Tier 4 standards.
The following provisions apply to engines that are not subject to Tier 4 standards:
(1) If you use the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.105(a) to use up your inventories of engines not certified to new emission standards, do not include these units in your count of equipment with exempted engines under paragraph (b) of this section. However, you may include these units in your count of total equipment you produce for the given year for the percentage calculation in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(2) If you install engines that are exempted from the Tier 4 standards for any reason, other than for equipment-manufacturer allowances under this section, do not include these units in your count of exempted engines under paragraph (b) of this section. However, you may include these units in your count of total equipment you produce for the given year for the percentage
calculation in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. For example, if we grant a hardship exemption for the engine manufacturer, you may count these as compliant engines under this section. This paragraph (d)(2) applies only if the engine has a permanent label describing why it is exempted from the Tier 4 standards.
(3) Do not include equipment using model year 2008 or 2009 engines certified under the provisions of § 1039.101(c) in your count of equipment using exempted engines. However, you may include these units in your count of total equipment you produce for the given year for the percentage calculation in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(4) You may start using the allowances under this section for engines that are not yet subject to Tier 4 standards, as long as the seven-year period for using allowances under the Tier 2 or Tier 3 program has expired. Table 3 of this section shows the years for which this paragraph (d)(4) applies. To use these early allowances, you must use engines that meet the emission standards described in paragraph (e) of this section. You must also count these units or calculate these percentages as described in paragraph (c) of this section and apply them toward the total number or percentage of equipment with exempted engines we allow for the Tier 4 standards as described in paragraph (b) of this section. The maximum number of cumulative early allowances under this paragraph (d)(4) is 10 percent under the percent-of-production allowance or 100 units under the small-volume allowance. For example, if you produce 5 percent of your equipment with engines between 130 and 560 kW that use allowances under this paragraph (d)(4) in 2009, you may use up to an additional 5 percent of your allowances in 2010. If you use allowances for 5 percent of your equipment in both 2009 and 2010, your 80 percent allowance for 2011-2017 in the 130-560 kW power category decreases to 70 percent. Manufacturers using allowances under this paragraph (d)(4) must comply with the notification and reporting requirements specified in paragraph (g) of this section.

Standards.
If you produce equipment with exempted engines under this section, the engines must meet emission standards specified in this paragraph (e), or more stringent standards. Note that we consider engines to be meeting emission standards even if they are certified with a family emission limit that is higher than the emission standard that would otherwise apply.
(1) If you are using the provisions of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, engines must meet the applicable Tier 1 or Tier 2 emission standards described in appendix I of this part.
(2) If you are using the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, engines must be identical in all material respects to engines certified under this part 1039 as follows:
Engines in the following power category. . .
Must meet all standards and requirements that applied in the following model year. . .
(i) 19 ≤kW

(3) In all other cases, engines at or above 56 kW and at or below 560 kW must meet the appropriate Tier 3 standards described in appendix I of this part. Engines below 56 kW and engines above 560 kW must meet the appropriate Tier 2 standards described in appendix I of this part.
(f)
Equipment labeling.
You must add a permanent label, written legibly in English, to the engine or another readily visible part of each piece of equipment you produce with exempted engines under this section. This label, which supplements the engine manufacturer's emission control information label, must include at least the following items:
(1) The label heading “EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION”.
(2) Your corporate name and trademark.
(3) The calendar year in which the equipment is manufactured.
(4) An e-mail address and phone number to contact for further information, or a Web site that includes this contact information.
(5) The following statement:
THIS EQUIPMENT [or identify the type of equipment] HAS AN ENGINE THAT MEETS U.S. EPA EMISSION STANDARDS UNDER 40 CFR 1039.625.
(g)
Notification and reporting.
You must notify us of your intent to use the provisions of this section and send us an annual report to verify that you are not exceeding the allowances, as follows:
(1) Before you use the provisions of this section, send the Designated Compliance Officer a written notice of your intent, including:
(i) Your company's name and address, and your parent company's name and address, if applicable.
(ii) The name, phone number and e-mail address of a person to contact for more information.
(iii) The calendar years in which you expect to use the exemption provisions of this section.
(iv) The name and address of each company you expect to produce engines for the equipment you manufacture under this section.
(v) Your best estimate of the number of units in each power category you will produce under this section and whether you intend to comply under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.
(vi) The number of units in each power category you have sold in years for which the Tier 2 and Tier 3 standards apply.
(2) For each year that you use the provisions of this section, send the Designated Compliance Officer a written report by March 31 of the following year. Identify the following things in your report:
(i) The total count of units you sold in the preceding year for each power category, based on actual U.S.-directed production information.
(ii) The percentages of U.S.-directed production that correspond to the number of units in each power category and the cumulative numbers and percentages of units for all the units you have sold under this section for each power category. You may omit the percentage figures if you include in the report a statement that you will not be using the percent-of-production allowances in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(iii) The manufacturer of the engine installed in the equipment you produce under this section if this is different than you specified under paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section.
(h)
Recordkeeping.
Keep the following records of all equipment with exempted engines you produce under this section for at least five full years after the final year in which allowances are available for each power category:
(1) The model number, serial number, and the date of manufacture for each engine and piece of equipment.
(2) The maximum power of each engine.
(3) The total number or percentage of equipment with exempted engines, as described in paragraph (b) of this section and all documentation supporting your calculation.
(4) The notifications and reports we require under paragraph (g) of this section.
(i)
Enforcement.
Producing more exempted engines or equipment than we allow under this section or installing engines that do not meet the emission standards of paragraph (e) of this section violates the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1). You must give us the records we require under this section if we ask for them (
see
40 CFR 1068.101(a)(2)).
(j)
Provisions for engine manufacturers.
As an engine manufacturer, you may produce exempted engines as needed under this section. You do not have to request this exemption for your engines, but you must have written assurance from equipment manufacturers that they need a certain number of exempted engines under this section. Send us an annual report of the engines you produce under this section, as described in § 1039.250(a). Exempt engines must meet the emission standards in
paragraph (e) of this section and you must meet all the requirements of 40 CFR 1068.265, except that engines produced under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section must be identical in all material respects to engines previously certified under this part 1039. If you show under 40 CFR 1068.265(c) that the engines are identical in all material respects to engines that you have previously certified to one or more FELs above the standards specified in paragraph (e) of this section, you must supply sufficient credits for these engines. Calculate these credits under subpart H of this part using the previously certified FELs and the alternate standards. You must meet the labeling requirements in § 1039.135, as applicable, with the following exceptions:
(1) Add the following statement instead of the compliance statement in § 1039.135(c)(12):
THIS ENGINE MEETS U.S. EPA EMISSION STANDARDS UNDER 40 CFR 1039.625. SELLING OR INSTALLING THIS ENGINE FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN FOR THE EQUIPMENT FLEXIBILITY PROVISIONS OF 40 CFR 1039.625 MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.
(2) You may omit the family emission limits if they are below the emission standards.
(k)
Other exemptions. See
40 CFR 1068.255 for exemptions based on hardship for equipment manufacturers and secondary engine manufacturers.
(l) [Reserved]
(m)
Additional exemptions for technical or engineering hardship.
You may request additional engine allowances under paragraph (b) of this section; however, you may use these extra allowances only for those equipment models for which you, or an affiliated company, do not also produce the engine. Additional allowances under this paragraph (m) must be used within the specified seven-year period. After considering the circumstances, we may permit you to introduce into U.S. commerce equipment with such engines that do not comply with Tier 4 emission standards, as follows:
(1) We may approve additional exemptions if extreme and unusual circumstances that are clearly outside your control and that could not have been avoided with reasonable discretion have resulted in technical or engineering problems that prevent you from meeting the requirements of this part. You must show that you exercised prudent planning and have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the scope of your request for additional allowances.
(2) To apply for exemptions under this paragraph (m), send the Designated Compliance Officer a written request as soon as possible before you are in violation. In your request, include the following information:
(i) Describe your process for designing equipment.
(ii) Describe how you normally work cooperatively or concurrently with your engine supplier to design products.
(iii) Describe the engineering or technical problems causing you to request the exemption and explain why you have not been able to solve them. Describe the extreme and unusual circumstances that led to these problems and explain how they were unavoidable.
(iv) Describe any information or products you received from your engine supplier related to equipment design—such as written specifications, performance data, or prototype engines—and when you received it.
(v) Compare the design processes of the equipment model for which you need additional exemptions and that for other models for which you do not need additional exemptions. Explain the technical differences that justify your request.
(vi) Describe your efforts to find and use other compliant engines, or otherwise explain why none is available.
(vii) Describe the steps you have taken to minimize the scope of your request.
(viii) Include other relevant information. You must give us other relevant information if we ask for it.
(ix) Estimate the increased percent of production you need for each equipment model covered by your request, as described in paragraph (m)(3) of this section. Estimate the increased number of allowances you need for each
equipment model covered by your request, as described in paragraph (m)(4) of this section.
(3) We may approve your request to increase the allowances under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, subject to the following limitations:
(i) You must use up the allowances under paragraph (b)(1) of this section before using any additional allowances under this paragraph (m).
(ii) The additional allowances under this paragraph (m)(3) may not exceed 200 percent for each power category.
(iii) You may use these additional allowances only for the specific equipment models covered by your request.
(4) We may approve your request to increase the small-volume allowances under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, subject to the following limitations:
(i) You are eligible for additional allowances under this paragraph (m)(4) only if you do not use the provisions of paragraph (m)(3) of this section to obtain additional allowances within a given power category.
(ii) You must use up the allowances under paragraph (b)(2) of this section before using any additional allowances under this paragraph (m).
(iii) The additional allowances under this paragraph (m)(4) may not exceed 2,000 units.
(iv) We may approve additional allowances in the form of waiving the annual limits specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section instead of or in addition to increasing the total number of allowances under this paragraph (m)(4).
(v) If we increase the total number of allowances, you may use these allowances only for the specific equipment models covered by your request.

§ 1039.626
What special provisions apply to equipment imported under the equipment-manufacturer flexibility program?
This section describes requirements that apply to equipment manufacturers using the provisions of § 1039.625 for equipment produced outside the United States. Note that § 1039.625 limits these provisions to equipment manufacturers that install some engines and have primary responsibility for designing and manufacturing equipment. Companies that import equipment into the United States without meeting these criteria are not eligible for these allowances. Such importers may import equipment with exempted engines only as described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(a) As a foreign equipment manufacturer, you or someone else may import equipment with exempted engines under this section if you comply with the provisions in § 1039.625 and commit to the following:
(1) Give any EPA inspector or auditor complete and immediate access to inspect and audit, as follows:
(i) Inspections and audits may be announced or unannounced.
(ii) Inspections and audits may be by EPA employees or EPA contractors.
(iii) You must provide access to any location where—
(A) Any nonroad engine, equipment, or vehicle is produced or stored.
(B) Documents related to manufacturer operations are kept.
(C) Equipment, engines, or vehicles are tested or stored for testing.
(iv) You must provide any documents requested by an EPA inspector or auditor that are related to matters covered by the inspections or audit.
(v) EPA inspections and audits may include review and copying of any documents related to demonstrating compliance with the exemptions in § 1039.625.
(vi) EPA inspections and audits may include inspection and evaluation of complete or incomplete equipment, engines, or vehicles, and interviewing employees.
(vii) You must make any of your employees available for interview by the EPA inspector or auditor, on request, within a reasonable time period.

(9) You must post a bond to cover any potential enforcement actions under the Clean Air Act before you or anyone else imports your equipment under this section, as follows:
(i) The value of the bond is based on the per-engine bond values shown in Table 1 of this section and on the highest number of engines in each power category you produce in any single calendar year under the provisions of § 1039.625. For example, if you have projected U.S.-directed production volumes of 100 exempt engines in the 19-56 kW power category and 300 exempt engines in the 56-130 kW power category in 2013, the appropriate bond amount is $180,000. If your estimated or actual engine imports increase beyond the level appropriate for your current bond payment, you must post additional bond to reflect the increased sales within 90 days after you change your estimate or determine the actual sales. You may not decrease your bond.
(ii) You may meet the bond requirements of this section with any of the following methods:
(A) Get a bond from a third-party surety that is cited in the U.S. Department of Treasury Circular 570, “Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies.” Maintain this bond for five years after the applicable allowance period expires, or five years after you use up all the available allowances under § 1039.625, whichever comes first.
(B) Get us to approve a waiver from the bonding requirement if you can show that you meet the asset thresholds described in 40 CFR 1054.690.
(iii) If you forfeit some or all of your bond in an enforcement action, you must post any appropriate bond for continuing importation within 90 days after you forfeit the bond amount.

§ 1039.627
What are the incentives for equipment manufacturers to use cleaner engines?
This section allows equipment manufacturers to generate additional allowances under the provisions of § 1039.625 by producing equipment using engines at or above 19 kW certified to specified levels earlier than otherwise required.
(a) For early-compliant engines to generate offsets for use under this section, the following general provisions apply:
(1) The engine manufacturer must comply with the provisions of § 1039.104(a)(1) for the offset-generating engines.
(2) Engines you install in your equipment after December 31 of the years specified in § 1039.104(a)(1) do not generate allowances under this section, even if the engine manufacturer generated offsets for that engine under § 1039.104(a).
(3) Offset-generating engines must be certified to the following standards under this part 1039:

(b)
Using engine offsets.
(1) You may use engine offsets generated under paragraph (a) of this section to generate additional allowances under § 1039.625, as follows:
(i) For each engine offset, you may increase the number of available allowances under § 1039.625(b) for that power category by one engine for the years indicated.
(ii) For engines in 56-560 kW power categories, you may transfer engine offsets across power categories within this power range. Calculate the number of additional allowances by scaling the number of generated engine offsets according to the ratio of engine power for offset and allowance engines. Make this calculation for all your offset engines for which you will transfer offsets under this paragraph (b)(1)(ii), then round the result to determine the total number of available power-weighted allowances. For example, if you generate engine offsets for 75 500-kW engines, you may generate up to 37,500 kW-engines of power-weighted allowances. You may apply this to 375 100-kW engines or any other combination that totals 37,500 kW-engines.
(2) You may decline to use the offsets. If you decline, the engine manufacturer may use the provisions of § 1039.104(a)(1).
(c)
Limitation on offsets for engines above 560 kW.
For engines above 560 kW, you must track how many engines you install in generator sets and how many you install in other applications under the provisions of this section. Offsets from generator-set engines may be used only for generator-set engines. Offsets from engines for other applications may be used only for other applications besides generator sets.
(d)
Reporting.
When you submit your first annual report under § 1039.625(g), include the following additional information related to the engines you use to generate offsets under this section:
(1) The name of each engine family involved.
(2) The number of engines from each power category.
(3) The maximum engine power of each engine.
(4) For engines above 560 kW, whether you use engines certified to the standards for generator-set engines.
(e)
In-use fuel.
If the engine manufacturer certifies using ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel, you must take steps to ensure that the in-use engines in the family will use diesel fuel with a sulfur concentration no greater than 15 ppm. For example, selling equipment only into applications where the operator commits to a central-fueling facility with ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel throughout its lifetime would meet this requirement.

(c) Engines certified under this section must be certified in a separate engine family that contains only TRU engines.
(d) You must do the following for each engine certified under this section:
(1) State on the emission control information label: “THIS ENGINE IS CERTIFIED TO OPERATE ONLY IN TRANSPORTATION REFRIGERATION UNITS. INSTALLING OR USING THIS ENGINE IN ANY OTHER APPLICATION MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.”.
(2) State in the emission-related installation instructions all steps necessary to ensure that the engine will operate only in the modes covered by the test cycle described in this section.
(3) Keep records to document the destinations and quantities of engines produced under this section.
(e) All engines certified under this section must comply with NTE standards, as described in § 1039.101 or § 1039.102 for the applicable model year, except that the NTE standards are not limited with respect to operating speeds and loads. In your application for certification, certify that all the engines in the engine family comply with the not-to-exceed emission standards for all normal operation and use. The deficiency provisions of § 1039.104(d) do not apply to these engines. This paragraph (e) applies whether or not
the engine would otherwise be subject to NTE standards.
(f) An engine is not considered to be used in a TRU if any of the following is true:
(1) The engine is installed in any equipment other than refrigeration units for railcars, truck trailers, or other freight vehicles.
(2) The engine operates in any mode not covered by the test cycle described in this section, except as follows:
(i) The engine may operate briefly at idle. Note, however, that TRU engines must meet NTE emission standards under any type of operation, including idle, as described in paragraph (e) of this section.
(ii) The engine may have a minimal amount of transitional operation between two allowable modes. As an example, a thirty-second transition period would clearly not be considered minimal.
(iii) The engine as installed may experience up to a 2-percent decrease in load at a given setpoint over any 10-minute period, and up to a 15-percent decrease in load at a given setpoint over any 60-minute period.
(3) The engine is sold in a configuration that allows the engine to operate in any mode not covered by the test cycle described in this section. For example, this section does not apply to an engine sold without a governor limiting operation only to those modes covered by the test cycle described in this section.
(4) The engine is subject to Tier 3 or earlier standards, or phase-out Tier 4 standards.

[88 FR 4659, Jan. 24, 2023]
§ 1039.665
Special provisions for use of engines in emergency situations.
This section specifies provisions that allow for temporarily disabling emission controls during qualified emergency situations. For purposes of this section, a qualified emergency situation is one in which the condition of an engine's emission controls poses a significant direct or indirect risk to human life. An example of a direct risk would be an emission control condition that inhibits the performance of an engine being used to rescue a person from a life-threatening situation. An example of an indirect risk would be an emission control condition that inhibits the performance of an engine being used to provide electrical power to a data center that routes “911” emergency response telecommunications.
(a)
Scope.
To facilitate temporarily disabling emission controls during a qualified emergency situation, manufacturers may apply for approval of auxiliary emission control devices (AECDs) under this section. Once activated, an AECD approved under this section may disable any emission controls as necessary to address a qualified emergency situation, subject to the limitations in this section. For the purposes of this section, automatically limiting engine performance to induce an operator to perform emission-related maintenance—such as refilling a DEF tank—is considered an emission control. AECDs approved under this section are not defeat devices, and their proper use during a qualified emergency situation is not prohibited under Clean Air Act section 203 (42 U.S.C. 7522). Manufacturers may apply for AECD approval at any time; however, we encourage manufacturers to obtain preliminary approval before submitting an application for certification. We may allow manufacturers to apply an approved AECD to engines and equipment that have already been placed into service.
(b)
AECD approval criteria.
We will approve an AECD where we determine that the following criteria have been met:
(1) The AECD's design must be consistent with good engineering judgment and the manufacturer must show that the AECD deactivates emission controls only to the extent necessary to address the expected emergency situation.
(2) Manufacturers must discourage improper activation of the AECD by displaying information where it is clearly visible to the equipment operator when the operator is in a position to activate the AECD. Unless we approve alternate language, state the following: “EMERGENCY USE ONLY. SEE OWNERS MANUAL. PENALTIES APPLY FOR MISUSE.”
(3) Manufacturers may design and produce their engines with the AECD initially armed to allow operators to activate the AECD one time per engine without any further input or permission from the manufacturer. The AECD may be subsequently reset as specified in paragraph (b)(8) of this section.
(4) Except as allowed by paragraph (b)(3) of this section, AECD activation must require either input of a temporary code, reconfiguration of the engine's electronic control module by a qualified service technician, or an equivalent security feature that is unique to each engine.
(5) The engine controls must be configured to record the total number of AECD activations in that engine's nonvolatile electronic memory.
(6) The engine controls must include an operator-activated switch or other element of design to allow the operator to manually deactivate the AECD once a qualified emergency situation has ended. This manual control may include a “confirm-delete” function, as needed, to prevent unintentionally deactivating the AECD. This control may allow for manual reactivation of the AECD provided that the AECD's automatic deactivation limits in paragraph (b)(7) of this section have not yet been reached, but such reactivation by operators would be allowed only under emergency situations. This manual deactivation control must not deactivate operator inducements required by paragraph (b)(9) of this section.
(7) The AECD must automatically deactivate within a cumulative engine run time of 120 hours after the AECD was initially activated (excluding any time the AECD was deactivated). The AECD may be subsequently reset as specified in paragraph (b)(8) of this section. For emission controls that involve a sequence of increasingly severe engine performance limits to induce operators to perform emission-related maintenance, the emission controls may be reset to the initial point of that sequence when the AECD is deactivated.
(8) The manufacturer must ensure that resetting the AECD cannot occur without the manufacturer's specific permission, and that resetting the AECD requires either input of a temporary code, reconfiguration of the engine's electronic control module by a qualified service technician, or an equivalent security feature that is unique to each engine. AECD resets may not occur unless either the manufacturer has evidence that the emergency situation is continuing or the
operator provides the information required in paragraph (e) of this section, in writing or by any other means.
(9) The manufacturer must take appropriate additional steps to induce operators to report AECD activation and request resetting the AECD. We recommend including one or more persistent visible and/or audible alarms that are active from the point when the AECD is activated to the point when it is reset.
(c)
Required information.
Manufacturers producing engines equipped with an AECD approved under this section must communicate at least the following information in writing to the operator:
(1) Instructions for activating, deactivating, and reactivating the AECD; reporting AECD use; and requesting AECD resets.
(2) A warning that federal regulations prohibit activating the emergency AECD for something other than a qualified emergency situation, failing to disable the emergency AECD after a qualified emergency situation ends, and failing to notify the manufacturer and send reports as required under paragraph (e) of this section. The warning must also identify the maximum civil penalty for such violations as described in 40 CFR 1068.101.
(3) Notification that the manufacturer will send the information from the operator's report under paragraph (e) of this section to EPA and that federal regulation separately prohibits submitting false information.
(d)
Resetting AECDs.
The operator (or other person responsible for the engine/equipment) may request resetting the AECD at any time. The manufacturer may reset the AECD only if the manufacturer has evidence that the emergency situation is continuing, or after the operator provides the information required in paragraph (e) of this section, in writing or by any other means.
(e)
Operator reporting of AECD use.
The operator (or other person responsible for the engine/equipment) must send a written report to the manufacturer within 60 calendar days after activating an AECD approved under this section. The report must include the following:
(1) Contact name, mail and email addresses, and telephone number for the responsible company or entity.
(2) A description of the emergency situation, the location of the engine during the emergency, and the contact information for an official who can verify the emergency situation (such as a county sheriff, fire marshal, or hospital administrator).
(3) The reason for AECD activation during the emergency situation, such as the lack of DEF, or the failure of an emission-related sensor when the engine was needed to respond to an emergency situation.
(4) The engine's serial number (or equivalent).
(5) A description of the extent and duration of the engine operation while the AECD was active, including a statement describing whether or not the AECD was manually deactivated after the emergency situation ended.
(f)
Operator failure to report.
If the operator fails to submit the report required by paragraph (e) of this section to the manufacturer within 60 days of activating an AECD approved under this section, the manufacturer, to the extent it has been made aware of the AECD activation, must send written notification to the operator that failure to meet the submission requirements may subject the operator to penalties under 40 CFR 1068.101.
(g)
Prohibited acts.
The following actions by the operator are improper use of the AECD and are prohibited under Clean Air Act section 203 (42 U.S.C. 7522):
(1) Activating the emergency AECD for any use other than a qualified emergency situation where the emission control strategy would curtail engine performance.
(2) Failing to disable the emergency AECD after a qualified emergency situation has ended.
(3) Failing to disable the emergency AECD after the problem causing the emission control strategy to interfere with engine performance has been or can reasonably be fixed.
(4) Failing to provide the information required under paragraph (e) of this section within 60 days of AECD activation.
(h)
Manufacturer reporting to EPA.
Within 90 days after each calendar year, the manufacturer must send an annual report to the Designated Compliance Officer describing the use of AECDs approved under this section. A manufacturer may request an extension if it is impractical to meet this deadline as the result of an emergency situation occurring late in a given calendar year. The annual report must include a description of each emergency situation leading to each AECD activation and copies of the reports submitted by operators (or statements that an operator did not submit a report, to the extent of the manufacturer's knowledge).
(i)
Submissions to EPA.
Notifications and reports submitted to comply with this section are deemed to be submissions to EPA.
(j)
Recordkeeping.
The manufacturer must keep records to document the use of AECDs approved under this section until the end of the calendar year five years after the onset of the relevant emergency situation. We may approve alternate recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
(k)
Anti-circumvention.
We may set other reasonable conditions to ensure that the provisions in this section are not used to circumvent the emission standards of this part.

§ 1039.670
Approval of an emergency equipment field modification (EEFM).
This section describes how you may implement design changes for emergency equipment that has already been placed into service to ensure that the equipment will perform properly in emergency situations.
(a) You must notify us in writing of your intent to install or distribute an emergency equipment field modification (EEFM). In some cases you may install or distribute an EEFM only with our advance approval, as specified in this section.
(b) Include in your notification a full description of the EEFM and any documentation to support your determination that the EEFM is necessary to prevent the equipment from losing speed, torque, or power due to abnormal conditions of its emission control system during operation related to emergency response, or to prevent such abnormal conditions from occurring during operation related to emergency response. Examples of such abnormal conditions may include excessive exhaust backpressure from an overloaded particulate trap, or running out of diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) for engines that rely on urea-based selective catalytic reduction. Your determination must be based on an engineering evaluation or testing or both.
(c) You may need our advance approval for your EEFM, as follows:
(1) Where the proposed EEFM is identical to an AECD we approved under this part for an engine family currently in production, no approval of the proposed EEFM is necessary.
(2) Where the proposed EEFM is for an engine family currently in production but the applicable demonstration is based on an AECD we approved under this part for an engine family no longer in production, you must describe to us how your proposed EEFM differs from the approved AECD. Unless we say otherwise, your proposed EEFM is deemed approved 30 days after you notify us.
(3) If we have not approved an EEFM comparable to the one you are proposing, you must get our approval before installing or distributing it. In this case, we may request additional information to support your determination under paragraph (b) of this section, as follows:
(i) If we request additional information and you do not provide it within 30 days after we ask, we may deem that you have retracted your request for our approval; however, we may extend this deadline for submitting the additional information.
(ii) We will deny your request if we determine that the EEFM is not necessary to prevent the equipment from losing speed, torque, or power due to abnormal conditions of the emission control system during operation related to emergency response, or to prevent such abnormal conditions from occurring during operation related to emergency response.
(iii) Unless we say otherwise, your proposed EEFM is deemed approved 30
days after we acknowledge that you have provided us with all the additional information we have specified.
(4) If your proposed EEFM is deemed to be approved under paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section and we find later that your EEFM in fact does not meet the requirements of this section, we may require you to no longer install or distribute it.

(e) The APU may draw power from the installed engine to regenerate a particulate filter, but you must not make any other changes to the certified engine that could reasonably be expected to increase its emissions of any pollutant.
(f) Sections 1039.115, 1039.120, 1039.125, and 1039.130 apply for APUs as written. You must exercise due diligence in ensuring that your system will not adversely affect safety or otherwise violate the prohibition of § 1039.115(f).
(g) All your APUs are considered to be part of a single emission family; however, you may subdivide your APUs into multiple emission families if you show the expected emission characteristics are different during the useful life.
(h) Testing requirements apply for certification as follows:
(1) Select an emission-data APU representing a worst-case condition for PM emissions. Measure emissions from the test engine with the APU installed according to your specifications.
(2) We may require you to provide an engineering analysis showing that the performance of your emission controls will not deteriorate during the useful life with proper maintenance. If we determine that your emission controls are likely to deteriorate during the useful life, we may require you to develop and apply deterioration factors consistent with good engineering judgment.
(3) Collect emission data and round to the nearest 0.01 g/kW-hr for comparing to the standard. Calculate full-life emissions as described in § 1039.240(d) if you need to apply a deterioration factor.
(4) You may ask to use emission data from a previous production period instead of doing new tests as described in § 1039.235(d).
(5) Additional testing provisions apply as described in § 1039.235(c), (e), and (f).
(i) Your APU certificate is valid for any engine certified under this part 1039, as long as the engine has a maximum engine power no more than 10 percent greater than the maximum engine power of the engine used for certification testing under this section.
(j) The following provisions apply for determining whether your APU complies with the requirements of this section:
(1) For purposes of certification, your emission family is considered in compliance with the emission standards of this section if all emission-data APUs representing that family have test results showing compliance with the standards.
(2) Your engine family is deemed not to comply if any emission-data APU
representing that family for certification has test results showing a full-life emission level above the PM standard.
(k) At the time of manufacture, affix a permanent and legible label identifying each APU. This applies even if the engine manufacturer certifies a compliant engine as described in paragraph (d) of this section. The label must meet the specifications described in 40 CFR 1068.45(a). The label must—
(1) Include the heading “EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION”.
(2) Include your full corporate name and trademark.
(3) State: “THIS APU ENGINE COMPLIES WITH 40 CFR 1039.699.”
(l) [Reserved]

(5) Describe how you operated the emission-data APU before testing, including any operation to break in the APU or otherwise stabilize emission levels. Describe any scheduled maintenance you did.
(6) List the specifications of the test fuel to show that it falls within the required ranges we specify in 40 CFR part 1065.
(7) Include the maintenance and warranty instructions you will provide (see §§ 1039.120 and 1039.125).
(8) Describe your emission control information label.
(9) Identify the emission family's deterioration factors and describe how you developed them, or summarize your analysis describing why you don't expect performance of emission controls to deteriorate. Present any emission test data you used for this.
(10) State that you operated your emission-data APU as described in the application (including the test procedures, test parameters, and test fuels) to show you meet the requirements of this part.
(11) Present emission data for PM.
(12) Report all test results, including those from invalid tests, whether or not they were conducted according to the test procedures of subpart F of this part. We may ask you to send other information to confirm that your tests were valid under the requirements of this part and 40 CFR part 1065.

# Subpart H—Averaging, Banking, and Trading for Certification
§ 1039.701
General provisions.
(a) You may average, bank, and trade (ABT) emission credits for purposes of certification as described in this subpart to show compliance with the standards of this part. Participation in this program is voluntary.
(b) Section 1039.740 restricts the use of emission credits to certain averaging sets.
(c) The definitions of Subpart I of this part apply to this subpart. The following definitions also apply:
(1)
Actual emission credits
means emission credits you have generated that we have verified by reviewing your final report.
(2)
Averaging set
means a set of engines in which emission credits may be exchanged only with other engines in the same averaging set.
(3)
Broker
means any entity that facilitates a trade of emission credits between a buyer and seller.
(4)
Buyer
means the entity that receives emission credits as a result of a trade.
(5)
Reserved emission credits
means emission credits you have generated that we have not yet verified by reviewing your final report.
(6)
Seller
means the entity that provides emission credits during a trade.
(7)
Standard
means the emission standard that applies under subpart B of this part for engines not participating in the ABT program of this subpart.
(8)
Trade
means to exchange emission credits, either as a buyer or seller.
(d) You may not use emission credits generated under this subpart to offset any emissions that exceed an FEL or standard. This applies for all testing, including certification testing, in-use testing, selective enforcement audits, and other production-line testing. However, if emissions from an engine exceed an FEL or standard (for example, during a selective enforcement audit), you may use emission credits to recertify the engine family with a higher FEL that applies only to future production.
(e) Engine families that use emission credits for one or more pollutants may not generate positive emission credits for another pollutant.
(f) Emission credits may be used in the model year they are generated or in future model years. Emission credits may not be used for past model years.
(g) You may increase or decrease an FEL during the model year by amending your application for certification under § 1039.225. The new FEL may apply only to engines you have not already introduced into commerce. Each engine's emission control information label must include the applicable FELs.
(h) You may use either of the following approaches to retire or forego emission credits:
(1) You may retire emission credits generated from any number of your engines. This may be considered donating emission credits to the environment. Identify any such credits in the reports described in § 1039.730. Engines must comply with the applicable FELs even if you donate or sell the corresponding emission credits under this paragraph (h). Those credits may no longer be used by anyone to demonstrate compliance with any EPA emission standards.
(2) You may certify a family using an FEL below the emission standard as described in this part and choose not to generate emission credits for that family. If you do this, you do not need to calculate emission credits for those families and you do not need to submit or keep the associated records described in this subpart for that family.
[69 FR 39213, June 29, 2004, as amended at 81 FR 74139, Oct. 25, 2016]

(1) Engines with a permanent exemption under subpart G of this part or under 40 CFR part 1068.
(2) Exported engines.
(3) Engines not subject to the requirements of this part, such as those excluded under § 1039.5.
(4) Engines in families that include only stationary engines, except for engines in families certified to standards that are identical to standards applicable under this part 1039 to nonroad engines of the same type for the same model year.
(5) Any other engines, where we indicate elsewhere in this part 1039 that they are not to be included in the calculations of this subpart.

§ 1039.710
How do I average emission credits?
(a) Averaging is the exchange of emission credits among your engine families. You may average emission credits only within the same averaging set.
(b) You may certify one or more engine families to an FEL above the applicable standard, subject to the FEL caps and other provisions in subpart B of this part, if you show in your application for certification that your projected balance of all emission-credit transactions in that model year is greater than or equal to zero.
(c) If you certify an engine family to an FEL that exceeds the otherwise applicable standard, you must obtain enough emission credits to offset the engine family's deficit by the due date for the final report required in § 1039.730. The emission credits used to address the deficit may come from your other engine families that generate emission credits in the same model year, from emission credits you have banked from previous model years, or from emission credits generated in the same or previous model years that you obtained through trading.
[69 FR 39213, June 29, 2004, as amended at 81 FR 74140, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1039.715
How do I bank emission credits?
(a) Banking is the retention of emission credits by the manufacturer generating the emission credits for use in future model years for averaging or trading.
(b) You may designate any emission credits you plan to bank in the reports you submit under § 1039.730 as reserved credits. During the model year and before the due date for the final report, you may designate your reserved emission credits for averaging or trading.
(c) Reserved credits become actual emission credits when you submit your final report. However, we may revoke these emission credits if we are unable to verify them after reviewing your reports or auditing your records.
[75 FR 22992, Apr. 30, 2010]
§ 1039.720
How do I trade emission credits?
(a) Trading is the exchange of emission credits between manufacturers. You may use traded emission credits for averaging, banking, or further trading transactions. Traded emission credits may be used only within the averaging set in which they were generated.
(b) You may trade actual emission credits as described in this subpart. You may also trade reserved emission credits, but we may revoke these emission credits based on our review of your records or reports or those of the company with which you traded emission credits. You may trade banked credits within an averaging set to any certifying manufacturer.
(c) If a negative emission credit balance results from a transaction, both the buyer and seller are liable, except in cases we deem to involve fraud. See § 1039.255(e) for cases involving fraud. We may void the certificates of all engine families participating in a trade that results in a manufacturer having a negative balance of emission credits. See § 1039.745.
[69 FR 39213, June 29, 2004, as amended at 75 FR 22992, Apr. 30, 2010]
§ 1039.725
What must I include in my application for certification?
(a) You must declare in your application for certification your intent to use the provisions of this subpart for each engine family that will be certified using the ABT program. You must also declare the FELs you select for the engine family for each pollutant for which you are using the ABT program. Your FELs must comply with the specifications of subpart B of this part, including the FEL caps. FELs must be expressed to the same number of decimal places as the applicable standards.
(b) Include the following in your application for certification:
(1) A statement that, to the best of your belief, you will not have a negative balance of emission credits for any averaging set when all emission credits are calculated at the end of the year.
(2) Detailed calculations of projected emission credits (positive or negative) based on projected production volumes. We may require you to include similar calculations from your other engine families to demonstrate that you will be able to avoid negative credit balances for the model year. If you project negative emission credits for a family, state the source of positive emission credits you expect to use to offset the negative emission credits.
[69 FR 39213, June 29, 2004, as amended at 75 FR 22992, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74140, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1039.730
What ABT reports must I send to EPA?
(a) If any of your engine families are certified using the ABT provisions of this subpart, you must send an end-of-year report within 90 days after the end of the model year and a final report within 270 days after the end of the model year. We may waive the requirement to send the end-of year report, as long as you send the final report on time.
(b) Your end-of-year and final reports must include the following information for each engine family participating in the ABT program:
(1) Engine-family designation and averaging set.
(2) The emission standards that would otherwise apply to the engine family.
(3) The FEL for each pollutant. If you change the FEL after the start of production, identify the date that you started using the new FEL and/or give the engine identification number for the first engine covered by the new FEL. In this case, identify each applicable FEL and calculate the positive or negative emission credits as specified in § 1039.225.
(4) The projected and actual U.S.-directed production volumes for the model year. If you changed an FEL during the model year, identify the actual U.S.-directed production volume associated with each FEL.
(5) Maximum engine power for each engine configuration, and the average engine power weighted by U.S.-directed production volumes for the engine family.
(6) Useful life.
(7) Calculated positive or negative emission credits for the whole engine family. Identify any emission credits
that you traded, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(c) Your end-of-year and final reports must include the following additional information:
(1) Show that your net balance of emission credits from all your participating engine families in each averaging set in the applicable model year is not negative.
(2) State whether you will retain any emission credits for banking. If you choose to retire emission credits that would otherwise be eligible for banking, identify the engine families that generated the emission credits, including the number of emission credits from each family.
(3) State that the report's contents are accurate.
(d) If you trade emission credits, you must send us a report within 90 days after the transaction, as follows:
(1) As the seller, you must include the following information in your report:
(i) The corporate names of the buyer and any brokers.
(ii) A copy of any contracts related to the trade.
(iii) The averaging set corresponding to the engine families that generated emission credits for the trade, including the number of emission credits from each averaging set.

(iii) How you intend to use the emission credits, including the number of emission credits you intend to apply for each averaging set.
(e) Send your reports electronically to the Designated Compliance Officer using an approved information format. If you want to use a different format, send us a written request with justification for a waiver.
(f) Correct errors in your end-of-year report or final report as follows:
(1) You may correct any errors in your end-of-year report when you prepare the final report, as long as you send us the final report by the time it is due.
(2) If you or we determine within 270 days after the end of the model year that errors mistakenly decreased your balance of emission credits, you may correct the errors and recalculate the balance of emission credits. You may not make these corrections for errors that are determined more than 270 days after the end of the model year. If you report a negative balance of emission credits, we may disallow corrections under this paragraph (f)(2).
(3) If you or we determine anytime that errors mistakenly increased your balance of emission credits, you must correct the errors and recalculate the balance of emission credits.

§ 1039.745
What can happen if I do not comply with the provisions of this subpart?
(a) For each engine family participating in the ABT program, the certificate of conformity is conditional upon full compliance with the provisions of this subpart during and after the model year. You are responsible to establish to our satisfaction that you fully comply with applicable requirements. We may void the certificate of conformity for an engine family if you fail to comply with any provisions of this subpart.
(b) You may certify your engine family to an FEL above an applicable standard based on a projection that you will have enough emission credits to offset the deficit for the engine family. However, we may void the certificate of conformity if you cannot show in your final report that you have enough actual emission credits to offset a deficit for any pollutant in an engine family.
(c) We may void the certificate of conformity for an engine family if you fail to keep records, send reports, or give us information we request.
(d) You may ask for a hearing if we void your certificate under this section (see § 1039.820).

Brake power
means the usable power output of the engine, not including power required to fuel, lubricate, or heat the engine, circulate coolant to the engine, or to operate aftertreatment devices.
Calibration
means the set of specifications and tolerances specific to a particular design, version, or application of a component or assembly capable of functionally describing its operation over its working range.
Carryover
means relating to certification based on emission data generated from an earlier model year as described in § 1039.235(d).
Certification
means relating to the process of obtaining a certificate of conformity for an engine family that complies with the emission standards and requirements in this part.
Certified emission level

means the emission level that results from applying the appropriate deterioration factor to the official emission result of the emission-data engine.
Deterioration factor
means the relationship between emissions at the end of useful life and emissions at the low-hour test point, expressed in one of the following ways:
(1) For multiplicative deterioration factors, the ratio of emissions at the end of useful life to emissions at the low-hour test point.
(2) For additive deterioration factors, the difference between emissions at the end of useful life and emissions at the low-hour test point.
Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF)
means a liquid reducing agent (other than the engine fuel) used in conjunction with selective catalytic reduction to reduce NO
X
emissions.

is generally understood to be an aqueous solution of urea conforming to the specifications of ISO 22241.
Discrete-mode
means relating to the discrete-mode type of steady-state test described in § 1039.505.
Dual-fuel
means relating to an engine designed for operation on two different fuels but not on a continuous mixture of those fuels (see § 1039.601(b)). For purposes of this part, such an engine remains a dual-fuel engine even if it is
designed for operation on three or more different fuels.
Emergency equipment
means any of the following types of equipment that is not a motor vehicle:
(1) Specialized vehicles used to perform aircraft rescue and/or fire-fighting functions at airports, with particular emphasis on saving lives and reducing injuries coincident with aircraft fires following impact, or aircraft ground fires.
(2) Wildland firefighting equipment designed primarily to support wildland fire suppression operations. For example, a bulldozer designed with special features for fighting wildfires would be a piece of emergency equipment.
(3) Any other equipment that we have determined will likely be used in emergency situations where emission control function or malfunction may cause a significant risk to human life. For example, we would consider nonroad equipment that is certain to be retrofitted with a slip-on firefighting module to be emergency equipment, irrespective of the equipment manufacturer's original design. In making this determination, we may consider any factor that has an effect on the totality of the actual risk to human life. For example, we may consider how frequently the equipment will be used in emergency situations or how likely it is that the emission controls will cause a significant risk to human life when the equipment is used in emergency situations. We will consider to what extent the flexibility provisions of § 1039.665 already address the risk. In the example above, we would not consider equipment to be emergency equipment if there is merely a possibility (rather than a certainty) that the equipment will be retrofitted with a slip-on firefighting module.
Emission-control system
means any device, system, or element of design that controls or reduces the emissions of regulated pollutants from an engine.
Emission-data engine
means an engine that is tested for certification. This includes engines tested to establish deterioration factors.
Emission-related maintenance
means maintenance that substantially affects emissions or is likely to substantially affect emission deterioration.
Engine configuration
means a unique combination of engine hardware and calibration within an engine family. Engines within a single engine configuration differ only with respect to normal production variability or factors unrelated to emissions.
Engine family
has the meaning given in § 1039.230.
Engine manufacturer
means the manufacturer of the engine. See the definition of “manufacturer” in this section.
Engine used in a locomotive
means either an engine placed in the locomotive to move other equipment, freight, or passenger traffic; or an engine mounted on the locomotive to provide auxiliary power.
Equipment manufacturer

In this case, the engine is no longer a motor vehicle or stationary engine and becomes a “new nonroad engine.” The engine is no longer new when it is placed into nonroad service. This paragraph (2) applies if a motor vehicle engine or a stationary engine is installed in nonroad equipment, or if a motor vehicle or a piece of stationary equipment is modified (or moved) to become nonroad equipment.
(3) A nonroad engine that has been previously placed into service in an application we exclude under § 1039.5, when that engine is installed in a piece of equipment that is covered by this part 1039. The engine is no longer new when it is placed into nonroad service covered by this part 1039. For example, this would apply to marine diesel engine that is no longer used in a marine vessel but is instead installed in a piece of nonroad equipment subject to the provisions of this part.
(4) An engine not covered by paragraphs (1) through (3) of this definition that is intended to be installed in new nonroad equipment.

(ii) An imported engine covered by a certificate of conformity issued under this part, where someone other than the original engine manufacturer holds the certificate (such as when the engine is modified after its initial assembly), is a new nonroad engine when it is imported. It is no longer new when the ultimate purchaser receives a title for the engine or it is placed into service, whichever comes first.
(iii) An imported nonroad engine that is not covered by a certificate of conformity issued under this part at the time of importation is new, but only if it was produced on or after the dates shown in the following table. This addresses uncertified engines and equipment initially placed into service that someone seeks to import into the United States. Importation of this kind of engine (or equipment containing such an engine) is generally prohibited by 40 CFR part 1068. However, the importation of such an engine is not prohibited if the engine has an earlier model year than that identified in the following table:

a
See § 1042.140, which describes how to determine maximum engine power.
b
See Table 1 of § 1042.101 for the first model year in which this part 1042 applies for engines with maximum engine power below 75 kW and displacement at or above 0.9 L/cyl.
(b) New engines with maximum engine power below 37 kW and originally manufactured and certified before the model years identified in Table 1 to this section are subject to emission standards as specified in appendix I of this part. The provisions of this part do not apply for such engines, except as follows beginning June 29, 2010:
(1) The allowances of this part apply.
(2) The definitions of “new marine engine” and “model year” apply.
(c) Marine engines originally meeting Tier 1 or Tier 2 standards as specified in appendix I of this part remain subject to those standards. This includes uncertified engines that meet standards under 40 CFR 1068.265. Those engines remain subject to recall provisions as specified in 40 CFR part 1068, subpart F, throughout the useful life corresponding to the original certification. Also, tampering and defeat-device prohibitions continue to apply for those engines as specified in 40 CFR 1068.101. The remanufacturing provisions in subpart I of this part may apply for remanufactured engines
originally manufactured in model years before the model years identified in Table 1 to this section.
(d) [Reserved]
(e) The requirements of subpart I of this part apply to remanufactured Category 1 and Category 2 engines beginning July 7, 2008.
(f) The marine engines listed in this paragraph (f) are subject to all the requirements of this part even if they do not meet the definition of “compression-ignition” in § 1042.901. The following engines are deemed to be compression-ignition engines for purposes of this part:
(1) Marine engines powered by natural gas or other gaseous fuels with maximum engine power at or above 250 kW. Note that gaseous-fueled engines with maximum engine power below 250 kW may or may not meet the definition of “compression-ignition” in § 1042.901.
(2) Marine gas turbine engines.
(3) Other marine internal combustion engines that do not meet the definition of “spark-ignition” in § 1042.901.
(g) Some of the provisions of this part may apply for other engines as specified in 40 CFR part 1043.
(h) Starting with the model years noted in Table 1 of this section, all of the subparts of this part, except subpart I, apply as specified in 40 CFR part 60, subpart IIII, to freshly manufactured stationary compression-ignition engines subject to the standards of 40 CFR part 60, subpart IIII, that have a per-cylinder displacement at or above 10 liters and below 30 liters per cylinder. Such engines are considered Category 2 engines for purposes of this part 1042.

§ 1042.2
Who is responsible for compliance?
The regulations in this part 1042 contain provisions that affect both engine manufacturers and others. However, the requirements of this part, other than those of subpart I of this part, are generally addressed to the engine manufacturer for freshly manufactured marine engines or other certificate holders. The term “you” generally means the engine manufacturer, as defined in § 1042.901, especially for issues related to certification (including production-line testing, reporting, etc.). Note that for engines that become new after being placed into service (such as engines converted from highway or stationary use, or engines installed on vessels that are reflagged to become U.S. vessels), the requirements that normally apply for manufacturers of freshly manufactured engines apply to the importer or any other entity we allow to obtain a certificate of conformity.
[81 FR 74142, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1042.5
Exclusions.
This part does not apply to the following marine engines:
(a)
Foreign vessels.
The requirements and prohibitions of this part do not apply to engines installed on foreign vessels, as defined in § 1042.901. Note however, that the requirements and prohibitions of this part do apply to engines installed on any formerly foreign vessels that are reflagged as U.S.-flagged vessels.
(b)
Hobby engines.
Engines installed in reduced-scale models of vessels that are not capable of transporting a person are not subject to the provisions of this part 1042.
(c)
Recreational gas turbine engines.
The requirements and prohibitions of this part do not apply to gas turbine engines installed on recreational vessels, as defined in § 1042.901.

See paragraph (a)(6) of this section for interim PM standards that apply for model years 2014 and 2015 for engines between 2000 and 3700 kW. The Tier 4 NO
X
FEL cap for engines at or above 2000 kW and below 3700 kW is 7.0 g/kW-hr. Starting in the 2016 model year, the Tier 4 PM FEL cap for engines at or above 2000 kW and below 3700 kW is 0.34 g/kW-hr.
(8) The following optional provisions apply for complying with the Tier 3 and Tier 4 standards specified in paragraphs (a)(3) through (7) of this section:
(i) You may use NO
X
credits accumulated through the ABT program to certify Tier 4 engines to a NO
X
+HC emission standard of 1.9 g/kW-hr instead of the NO
X
and HC standards that would otherwise apply by certifying your family to a NO
X
+HC FEL. Calculate the NO
X
credits needed as specified in subpart H of this part using the NO
X
+HC emission standard and FEL in the calculation instead of the otherwise applicable NO
X
standard and FEL. You may not generate credits relative to the alternate standard or certify to the standard without using credits.
(ii) For engines below 1000 kW, you may delay complying with the Tier 4 standards in the 2017 model year for up to nine months, but you must comply no later than October 1, 2017.
(iii) For engines at or above 3700 kW, you may delay complying with the Tier 4 standards in the 2016 model year for up to twelve months, but you must comply no later than December 31, 2016.
(iv) For Category 2 engines at or above 1400 kW, you may alternatively comply with the Tier 3 and Tier 4 standards specified in Table 4 of this section instead of the NO
X

Averaging, banking, and trading.
You may generate or use emission credits under the averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program as described in subpart H of this part for demonstrating compliance with NO
X
, NO
X
+HC, and PM emission standards for Category 1 and Category 2 engines. You may also use NO
X
or NO
X
+HC emission credits to comply with the alternate NO
X
+HC standard in paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section. Generating or using emission credits requires that you specify a family emission limit (FEL) for each pollutant you include in the ABT program for each engine family. These FELs serve as the emission standards for the engine family with respect to all required testing instead of the standards specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The FELs determine the not-to-exceed standards for your engine family, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Unless otherwise specified, the following FEL caps apply:
(1) FELs for Tier 3 engines may not be higher than the applicable Tier 2 standards specified in Appendix I of this part.
(2) FELs for Tier 4 engines may not be higher than the applicable Tier 3 standards specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(3) The following FEL caps apply for engines at or above 3700 kW that are not subject to Tier 3 standards under paragraph (a)(3) of this section:
(i) FELs may not be higher than the applicable Tier 1 NO
X
standards specified in Appendix I of this part before the Tier 4 standards start to apply.
(ii) FELs may not be higher than the applicable Tier 2 NO
X
+THC standards specified in Appendix I of this part after the Tier 4 standards start to apply.
(c)
Not-to-exceed standards.
Except as noted in § 1042.145(e), exhaust emissions from all engines subject to the requirements of this part may not exceed the not-to-exceed (NTE) standards as follows:
(1) Use the following equation to determine the NTE standards:
(i) NTE standard for each pollutant = STD × M.
Where:
STD = The standard specified for that pollutant in this section if you certify without using ABT for that pollutant; or the FEL for that pollutant if you certify using ABT.
M = The NTE multiplier for that pollutant.
(ii) Round each NTE standard to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard.
(2) Determine the applicable NTE zone and subzones as described in § 1042.515. Determine NTE multipliers for specific zones and subzones and pollutants as follows:
(i) For marine engines certified using the duty cycle specified in § 1042.505(b)(1), except for variable-speed propulsion marine engines used with controllable-pitch propellers or with electrically coupled propellers, apply the following NTE multipliers:
(A) Subzone 1: 1.2 for Tier 3 NO
X
+HC standards.
(B) Subzone 1: 1.5 for Tier 4 standards and Tier 3 PM and CO standards.
(C) Subzone 2: 1.5 for Tier 4 NO
X
and HC standards and for Tier 3 NO
X
+HC standards.
(D) Subzone 2: 1.9 for PM and CO standards.
(ii) For recreational marine engines certified using the duty cycle specified in § 1042.505(b)(2), except for variable-speed marine engines used with controllable-pitch propellers or with electrically coupled propellers, apply the following NTE multipliers:
(A) Subzone 1: 1.2 for Tier 3 NO
X
+HC standards.
(B) Subzone 1: 1.5 for Tier 3 PM and CO standards.
(C) Subzones 2 and 3: 1.5 for Tier 3 NO
X
+HC standards.
(D) Subzones 2 and 3: 1.9 for PM and CO standards.
(iii) For variable-speed marine engines used with controllable-pitch propellers or with electrically coupled propellers that are certified using the duty cycle specified in § 1042.505(b)(1), (2), or (3), apply the following NTE multipliers:
(A) Subzone 1: 1.2 for Tier 3 NO
X
+HC standards.
(B) Subzone 1: 1.5 for Tier 4 standards and Tier 3 PM and CO standards.
(C) Subzone 2: 1.5 for Tier 4 NO
X
and HC standards and for Tier 3 NO
X
+HC standards.
(D) Subzone 2: 1.9 for PM and CO standards. However, there is no NTE standard in Subzone 2b for PM emissions if the engine family's applicable standard for PM is at or above 0.07 g/kW-hr.
(iv) For constant-speed engines certified using a duty cycle specified in § 1042.505(b)(3) or (4), apply the following NTE multipliers:
(A) Subzone 1: 1.2 for Tier 3 NO
X
+HC standards.
(B) Subzone 1: 1.5 for Tier 4 standards and Tier 3 PM and CO standards.
(C) Subzone 2: 1.5 for Tier 4 NO
X
and HC standards and for Tier 3 NO
X
+HC standards.
(D) Subzone 2: 1.9 for PM and CO standards. However, there is no NTE standard for PM emissions if the engine family's applicable standard for PM is at or above 0.07 g/kW-hr.
(v) For variable-speed auxiliary marine engines certified using the duty cycle specified in § 1042.505(b)(5)(ii) or (iii):
(A) Subzone 1: 1.2 for Tier 3 NO
X
+HC standards.
(B) Subzone 1: 1.5 for Tier 4 standards and Tier 3 PM and CO standards.
(C) Subzone 2: 1.2 for Tier 3 NO
X
+HC standards.
(D) Subzone 2: 1.5 for Tier 4 standards and Tier 3 PM and CO standards. However, there is no NTE standard for PM emissions if the engine family's applicable standard for PM is at or above 0.07 g/kW-hr.
(3) The NTE standards apply to your engines whenever they operate within the NTE zone for an NTE sampling period of at least thirty seconds, during which only a single operator demand set point may be selected. Engine operation during a change in operator demand is excluded from any NTE sampling period. There is no maximum NTE sampling period.
(4) Collect emission data for determining compliance with the NTE standards using the procedures described in subpart F of this part.
(5) You may ask us to accept as compliant an engine that does not fully meet specific requirements under the applicable NTE standards where such deficiencies are necessary for safety.
(d)
Fuel types.
The exhaust emission standards in this section apply for engines using the fuel type on which the engines in the engine family are designed to operate.
(1) You must meet the numerical emission standards for hydrocarbons in this section based on the following types of hydrocarbon emissions for engines powered by the following fuels:
(i) Alcohol-fueled engines must comply with Tier 3 HC standards based on THCE emissions and with Tier 4 standards based on NMHCE emissions.
(ii) Gaseous-fueled engines must comply with HC standards based on nonmethane-nonethane hydrocarbon emissions.
(iii) Diesel-fueled and all other engines not described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section must comply with Tier 3 HC standards based on THC emissions and with Tier 4 standards based on NMHC emissions.
(2) Tier 3 and later engines must comply with the exhaust emission standards when tested using test fuels containing 15 ppm or less sulfur (ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel). Manufacturers may use low-sulfur diesel fuel (without request) to certify an engine otherwise requiring an ultra low-sulfur test fuel; however, emissions may not be corrected to account for the effects of using higher sulfur fuel.
(3) Engines designed to operate using residual fuel must comply with the standards and requirements of this part when operated using residual fuel in addition to complying with the requirements of this part when operated using diesel fuel.
(e)
Useful life.
Your engines must meet the exhaust emission standards of this section over their full useful life, expressed as a period in years or hours of engine operation, whichever comes first.
(1) The minimum useful life values are as follows, except as specified by paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section:
(i) 10 years or 1,000 hours of operation for recreational Category 1 engines
(ii) 5 years or 3,000 hours of operation for commercial engines below 19 kW.
(iii) 7 years or 5,000 hours of operation for commercial engines at or above 19 kW and below 37kW.
(iv) 10 years or 10,000 hours of operation for commercial Category 1 engines at or above 37 kW.
(v) 10 years or 20,000 hours of operation for Category 2 engines.
(2) Specify a longer useful life in hours for an engine family under either of two conditions:
(i) If you design your engine to operate longer than the minimum useful life. Indicators of design life include your recommended overhaul interval and may also include your advertising and marketing materials.
(ii) If your basic mechanical warranty is longer than the minimum useful life.
(3) You may request in your application for certification that we approve a shorter useful life for an engine family. We may approve a shorter useful life, in hours of engine operation but not in years, if we determine that these engines will rarely operate longer than the shorter useful life. If engines identical to those in the engine family have already been produced and are in use, your demonstration must include documentation from such in-use engines. In other cases, your demonstration must include an engineering analysis of information equivalent to such in-use data, such as data from research engines or similar engine models that are already in production. Your demonstration must also include any overhaul interval that you recommend, any mechanical warranty that you offer for the engine or its components, and any relevant customer design specifications. Your demonstration may include any other relevant information. The useful life value may not be shorter than any of the following:
(i) 1,000 hours of operation.
(ii) Your recommended overhaul interval.
(iii) Your mechanical warranty for the engine.
(f)
Applicability for testing.
The duty-cycle emission standards in this subpart apply to all testing performed according to the procedures in § 1042.505, including certification, production-line, and in-use testing. The not-to-exceed standards apply for all testing performed according to the procedures of subpart F of this part.

§ 1042.104
Exhaust emission standards for Category 3 engines.
(a)
Duty-cycle standards.
Exhaust emissions from your engines may not exceed emission standards, as follows:
(1) Measure emissions using the test procedures described in subpart F of this part. Note that while no PM standards apply for Category 3 engines, PM emissions must be measured for certification testing and reported under § 1042.205. Note also that you are not required to measure PM emissions for other testing.
(2) NO
X
standards apply based on the engine's model year and maximum in-use engine speed as shown in the following table:

emission controls.
(3) The HC standard for Tier 2 and later engines is 2.0 g/kW-hr. This standard applies as follows:
(i) Alcohol-fueled engines must comply with HC standards based on THCE emissions.
(ii) Natural gas-fueled engines must comply with HC standards based on NMHC emissions.
(iii) Diesel-fueled and all other engines not described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section must comply with HC standards based on THC emissions.
(4) The CO standard for Tier 2 and later engines is 5.0 g/kW-hr.
(b)
Averaging, banking, and trading.
Category 3 engines are not eligible for participation in the averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program as described in subpart H of this part.
(c)
Mode caps.
Measured NO
X
emissions from Tier 3 engines may not exceed the cap specified in this paragraph (c) for any applicable duty-cycle test modes with power greater than 10 percent maximum engine power. Calculate the mode cap by multiplying the applicable Tier 3 NO
X
standard by 1.5 and rounding to the nearest 0.1 g/kW-hr. Note that mode caps do not apply for pollutants other than NO
X
and do not apply for any modes of operation outside of the applicable duty cycles in § 1042.505. Category 3 engines are not subject to not-to-exceed standards.
(d)
Useful life.
Your engines must meet the exhaust emission standards of this section over their full useful life, expressed as a period in years or hours of engine operation, whichever comes first.
(1) The minimum useful life value is 3 years or 10,000 hours of operation.
(2) Specify a longer useful life in hours for an engine family under either of two conditions:
(i) If you design, advertise, or market your engine to operate longer than the minimum useful life (your recommended hours until rebuild indicates a longer design life).
(ii) If your basic mechanical warranty is longer than the minimum useful life.
(e)
Applicability for testing.
The duty-cycle emission standards in this section apply to all testing performed according to the procedures in § 1042.505, including certification, production-line, and in-use testing.
See
paragraph (g) of this section for standards that apply for certain other test procedures, such as some production-line testing.
(f)
Domestic engines.
Engines installed on vessels excluded from 40 CFR part 1043 because they operate only domestically may not be certified for use with residual fuels.
(g)
Alternate installed-engine standards.
NO
X
emissions may not exceed the standard specified in this paragraph (g) for test of engines installed on vessels when you are unable to operate the engine at the test points for the specified duty cycle, and you approximate these points consistent with the specifications of section 6 of Appendix 8 to the NO
X
Technical Code (incorporated by reference in § 1042.910). Calculate the alternate installed-engine standard by multiplying the applicable NO
X
standard by 1.1 and rounding to the nearest 0.1 g/kW-hr.

§ 1042.107
Evaporative emission standards.
(a) There are no evaporative emission standards for diesel-fueled engines, or engines using other nonvolatile or nonliquid fuels (for example, natural gas).
(b) If an engine uses a volatile liquid fuel, such as methanol, the engine's fuel system and the vessel in which the engine is installed must meet the evaporative emission requirements of 40 CFR part 1045 that apply with respect to spark-ignition engines. Manufacturers subject to evaporative emission standards must meet the requirements of 40 CFR 1045.112 as described in 40 CFR part 1060 and do all the following things in the application for certification:
(1) Describe how evaporative emissions are controlled.
(2) Present test data to show that fuel systems and vessels meet the evaporative emission standards we specify in this section if you do not use design-based certification under 40 CFR 1060.240. Show these figures before and after applying deterioration factors, where applicable.
[73 FR 59193, Oct. 8, 2008]
§ 1042.110
Recording reductant use and other diagnostic functions.
(a) Engines equipped with SCR systems using a reductant other than the
engine's fuel must meet the following requirements:
(1) The diagnostic system must monitor reductant supply and alert operators to the need to restore the reductant supply, or to replace the reductant if it does not meet your concentration specifications. Unless we approve other alerts, use a warning lamp and an audible alarm. You do not need to separately monitor reductant quality if your system uses input from an exhaust NO
X
sensor (or other sensor) to alert operators when reductant quality is inadequate. However, tank level or DEF flow must be monitored in all cases.
(2) The onboard computer log must record in nonvolatile computer memory all incidents of engine operation with inadequate reductant injection or reductant quality. Use good engineering judgment to ensure that the operator can readily access the information to submit the report required by § 1042.660. For example, you may meet this requirement by documenting the incident in a text file that can be downloaded or printed by the operator.
(3) SCR systems must also conform to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section if they are equipped with on-off controls as allowed under § 1042.115(g).
(b) [Reserved]
(c) You may equip your engine with other diagnostic features. If you do, they must be designed to allow us to read and interpret the codes. Note that §§ 1042.115 and 1042.205 require that you provide us any information needed to read, record, and interpret all the information broadcast by an engine's onboard computers and electronic control units.
(d) For Category 3 engines equipped with on-off NO
X
controls (as allowed by § 1042.115(g)), you must also equip your engine to continuously monitor NO
X
concentrations in the exhaust. See § 1042.650 to determine if this requirement applies for a given Category 1 or Category 2 engine. For measurement technologies involving discrete sampling events, measurements are considered continuous if they repeat at least once every 60 seconds; we may approve a longer sampling period if it is necessary or appropriate for sufficiently accurate measurements. Describe your system for onboard NO
X
measurements in your application for certification. Use good engineering judgment to alert operators if measured NO
X
concentrations indicate malfunctioning emission controls. Record any such operation in nonvolatile computer memory. You are not required to monitor NO
X
concentrations during operation for which the emission controls may be disabled under § 1042.115(g). For the purpose of this paragraph (d), “malfunctioning emission controls” means any condition in which the measured NO
X
concentration exceeds the highest value expected when the engine is in compliance with the installed engine standard of § 1042.104(g). Use good engineering judgment to determine these expected values during production-line testing of the engine using linear interpolation between test points and accounting for the degree to which the cycle-weighted emissions of the engine are below the standard. You may also use additional intermediate test points measured during the production-line test. Note that the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section also apply for SCR systems covered by this paragraph (d). For engines subject to both the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section and this paragraph (d), use good engineering judgment to integrate diagnostic features to comply with both paragraphs. For example, engines may use on-off NO
X
controls to disable certain emission control functions only if the diagnostic system indicates that the monitoring described in this paragraph (d) is active.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 22998, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74145, Oct. 25, 2016; 88 FR 4660, Jan. 24, 2023]
§ 1042.115
Other requirements.
Engines that are required to comply with the emission standards of this part must meet the following requirements:
(a)
Crankcase emissions.
Crankcase emissions may not be discharged directly into the ambient atmosphere from any engine throughout its useful life, except as follows:
(1) Engines may discharge crankcase emissions to the ambient atmosphere if the emissions are added to the exhaust
emissions (either physically or mathematically) during all emission testing. If you take advantage of this exception, you must do both of the following things:
(i) Manufacture the engines so that all crankcase emissions can be routed into the applicable sampling systems specified in 40 CFR part 1065.
(ii) Account for deterioration in crankcase emissions when determining exhaust deterioration factors.
(2) For purposes of this paragraph (a), crankcase emissions that are routed to the exhaust upstream of exhaust aftertreatment during all operation are not considered to be discharged directly into the ambient atmosphere.
(b)
Torque broadcasting.
Electronically controlled engines must broadcast their speed and output shaft torque (in newton-meters). Engines may alternatively broadcast a surrogate value for determining torque. Engines must broadcast engine parameters such that they can be read with a remote device, or broadcast them directly to their controller area networks. This information is necessary for testing engines in the field (see § 1042.515).
(c)
EPA access to broadcast information.
If we request it, you must provide us any hardware or tools we would need to readily read, interpret, and record all information broadcast by an engine's on-board computers and electronic control modules. If you broadcast a surrogate parameter for torque values, you must provide us what we need to convert these into torque units. We will not ask for hardware or tools if they are readily available commercially.
(d)
Adjustable parameters.
General provisions for adjustable parameters apply as specified in 40 CFR 1068.50. The following additional category-specific provisions apply:
(1) Category 1 engines that have adjustable parameters must meet all the requirements of this part for any adjustment in the physically adjustable range. We may require that you set adjustable parameters to any specification within the adjustable range during any testing, including certification testing, selective enforcement auditing, or in-use testing.
(2) Category 2 and Category 3 engines that have adjustable parameters must meet all the requirements of this part for any adjustment in the specified adjustable range. You must specify in your application for certification the adjustable range of each adjustable parameter on a new engine to—
(i) Ensure that safe engine operating characteristics are available within that range, as required by section 202(a)(4) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7521(a)(4)), taking into consideration the production tolerances.
(ii) Limit the physical range of adjustability to the maximum extent practicable to the range that is necessary for proper operation of the engine.
(e)
Prohibited controls
—(1)
General provisions.
You may not design your engines with emission control devices, systems, or elements of design that cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety while operating. For example, an engine may not emit a noxious or toxic substance it would otherwise not emit that contributes to such an unreasonable risk.
(2)
Vanadium sublimation in SCR catalysts.
For engines equipped with vanadium-based SCR catalysts, you must design the engine and its emission controls to prevent vanadium sublimation and protect the catalyst from high temperatures. We will evaluate your engine design based on the following information that you must include in your application for certification:
(i) Identify the threshold temperature for vanadium sublimation for your specified SCR catalyst formulation as described in 40 CFR 1065.1113 through 1065.1121.
(ii) Describe how you designed your engine to prevent catalyst inlet temperatures from exceeding the temperature you identify in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, including consideration of engine wear through the useful life. Also describe your design for catalyst protection in case catalyst temperatures exceed the specified temperature. In your description, include how you considered elevated catalyst temperature resulting from sustained high-load engine operation, catalyst exotherms,
DPF regeneration, and component failure resulting in unburned fuel in the exhaust stream.
(f)
Defeat devices.
You may not equip your engines with a defeat device. A defeat device is an auxiliary emission control device that reduces the effectiveness of emission controls under conditions that the engine may reasonably be expected to encounter during normal operation and use. (Note that this means emission control for operation outside of and between the official test modes is generally expected to be similar to emission control demonstrated at the test modes.) This does not apply to auxiliary emission control devices you identify in your application for certification if any of the following is true:
(1) The conditions of concern were substantially included in the applicable duty-cycle test procedures described in subpart F of this part (the portion during which emissions are measured).
(2) You show your design is necessary to prevent engine (or vessel) damage or accidents.
(3) The reduced effectiveness applies only to starting the engine.
(4) The engine is a Category 3 engine and the AECD conforms to the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.
See
§ 1042.650 to determine if this allowance applies for a given Category 1 or Category 2 engine.
(g)
On-off controls for engines on Category 3 vessels.
Manufacturers may equip Category 3 propulsion engines with features that disable Tier 3 NO
X
emission controls subject to the provisions of this paragraph (g). For auxiliary engines allowed to use on-off controls as specified in § 1042.650(d), read “Tier 2” to mean “IMO Tier II” and read “Tier 3” to mean “IMO Tier III”.
(1) Features that disable Tier 3 NO
X
emission controls are considered to be AECDs whether or not they meet the definition of an AECD. For example, manually operated on-off features are AECDs under this paragraph (g). The features must be identified in your application for certification as AECDs. For purposes of this paragraph (g), the term “features that disable Tier 3 emission controls” includes (but is not limited to) any combination of the following that cause the engine's emissions to exceed any Tier 3 emission standard:
(i) Bypassing of exhaust aftertreatment.
(ii) Reducing or eliminating flow of reductant to an SCR system.
(iii) Modulating engine calibration in a manner that increases engine-out emissions of a regulated pollutant.
(2) You must demonstrate that the AECD will not disable NO
X
emission controls while operating shoreward of the boundaries of the North American ECA and the U.S. Caribbean Sea ECA. You must demonstrate that the AECD will not disable emission control while operating in these waters. (Note: See the regulations in 40 CFR part 1043 for requirements related to operation in ECAs, including foreign ECAs.) Compliance with this paragraph (g)(2) will generally require that the AECD operation be based on Global Positioning System (GPS) inputs. We may consider any relevant information to determine whether your AECD conforms to this paragraph (g).
(3) The onboard computer log must record in nonvolatile computer memory all incidents of engine operation with the Tier 3 NO
X
emission controls disabled.
(4) The engine must comply with the Tier 2 NO
X
standard when the Tier 3 NO
X
emission controls are disabled.

§ 1042.120
Emission-related warranty requirements.
(a)
General requirements.
You must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that the new engine, including all parts of its emission control system, meets two conditions:
(1) It is designed, built, and equipped so it conforms at the time of sale to the ultimate purchaser with the requirements of this part.
(2) It is free from defects in materials and workmanship that may keep it from meeting these requirements.
(b)
Warranty period.
Your emission-related warranty must be valid for at least as long as the minimum warranty
periods listed in this paragraph (b) in hours of operation and years, whichever comes first. You may offer an emission-related warranty more generous than we require. The emission-related warranty for the engine may not be shorter than any basic mechanical warranty you provide without charge for the engine. Similarly, the emission-related warranty for any component may not be shorter than any warranty you provide without charge for that component. This means that your warranty may not treat emission-related and nonemission-related defects differently for any component. If an engine has no hour meter, we base the warranty periods in this paragraph (b) only on the engine's age (in years). The warranty period begins when the engine is placed into service. The following minimum warranty periods apply:
(1) For Category 1 and Category 2 engines, your emission-related warranty must be valid for at least 50 percent of the engine's useful life in hours of operation or a number of years equal to at least 50 percent of the useful life in years, whichever comes first.
(2) For Category 3 engines, your emission-related warranty must be valid throughout the engine's full useful life as specified in § 1042.104(d).
(c)
Components covered.
The emission-related warranty covers all components whose failure would increase an engine's emissions of any regulated pollutant, including components listed in 40 CFR part 1068, Appendix I, and components from any other system you develop to control emissions. The emission-related warranty for freshly manufactured marine engines covers these components even if another company produces the component. Your emission-related warranty does not need to cover components whose failure would not increase an engine's emissions of any regulated pollutant. For remanufactured engines, your emission-related warranty is required to cover only those parts that you supply or those parts for which you specify allowable part manufacturers. It does not need to cover used parts that are not replaced during the remanufacture.
(d)
Limited applicability.
You may deny warranty claims under this section if the operator caused the problem through improper maintenance or use, as described in 40 CFR 1068.115.
(e)
Owners manual.
Describe in the owners manual the emission-related warranty provisions from this section that apply to the engine.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 22999, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74146, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1042.125
Maintenance instructions.
Give the ultimate purchaser of each new engine written instructions for properly maintaining and using the engine, including the emission control system, as described in this section. The maintenance instructions also apply to service accumulation on your emission-data engines as described in § 1042.245 and in 40 CFR part 1065. The restrictions specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section related to allowable maintenance apply only to Category 1 and Category 2 engines. Manufacturers may specify any maintenance for Category 3 engines.
(a)
Critical emission-related maintenance.
Critical emission-related maintenance includes any adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of critical emission-related components. This may also include additional emission-related maintenance that you determine is critical if we approve it in advance. You may schedule critical emission-related maintenance on these components if you meet the following conditions:
(1) You demonstrate that the maintenance is reasonably likely to be done at the recommended intervals on in-use engines. We will accept scheduled maintenance as reasonably likely to occur if you satisfy any of the following conditions:
(i) You present data showing that any lack of maintenance that increases emissions also unacceptably degrades the engine's performance.
(ii) You present survey data showing that at least 80 percent of engines in the field get the maintenance you specify at the recommended intervals.
(iii) You provide the maintenance free of charge and clearly say so in your maintenance instructions.
(iv) You otherwise show us that the maintenance is reasonably likely to be done at the recommended intervals.
(2) For engines below 130 kW, you may not schedule critical emission-related maintenance more frequently than the following minimum intervals, except as specified in paragraphs (a)(4), (b), and (c) of this section:
(i) For EGR-related filters and coolers, DEF filters, crankcase ventilation valves and filters, and fuel injector tips (cleaning only), the minimum interval is 1,500 hours.
(ii) For the following components, including associated sensors and actuators, the minimum interval is 3,000 hours: Fuel injectors, turbochargers, catalytic converters, electronic control units, particulate traps, trap oxidizers, components related to particulate traps and trap oxidizers, EGR systems (including related components, but excluding filters and coolers), and other add-on components. For particulate traps, trap oxidizers, and components related to either of these, maintenance is limited to cleaning and repair only.
(3) For Category 1 and Category 2 engines at or above 130 kW, you may not schedule critical emission-related maintenance more frequently than the following minimum intervals, except as specified in paragraphs (a)(4), (b), and (c) of this section:
(i) For EGR-related filters and coolers, DEF filters, crankcase ventilation valves and filters, and fuel injector tips (cleaning only), the minimum interval is 1,500 hours.
(ii) For the following components, including associated sensors and actuators, the minimum interval is 4500 hours: Fuel injectors, turbochargers, catalytic converters, electronic control units, particulate traps, trap oxidizers, components related to particulate traps and trap oxidizers, EGR systems (including related components, but excluding filters and coolers), and other add-on components. For particulate traps, trap oxidizers, and components related to either of these, maintenance is limited to cleaning and repair only.
(4) We may approve shorter maintenance intervals than those listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section where technologically necessary.
(5) If your engine family has an alternate useful life under § 1042.101(e) that is shorter than the period specified in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, you may not schedule critical emission-related maintenance more frequently than the alternate useful life, except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Recommended additional maintenance.
You may recommend any additional amount of maintenance on the components listed in paragraph (a) of this section, as long as you state clearly that these maintenance steps are not necessary to keep the emission-related warranty valid. If operators do the maintenance specified in paragraph (a) of this section, but not the recommended additional maintenance, this does not allow you to disqualify those engines from in-use testing or deny a warranty claim. Do not take these maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data engines.
(c)
Special maintenance.
You may specify more frequent maintenance to address problems related to special situations, such as atypical engine operation. You must clearly state that this additional maintenance is associated with the special situation you are addressing. You may also address maintenance of low-use engines (such as recreational or stand-by engines) by specifying the maintenance interval in terms of calendar months or years in addition to your specifications in terms of engine operating hours. All special maintenance instructions must be consistent with good engineering judgment. We may disapprove your maintenance instructions if we determine that you have specified special maintenance steps to address maintenance that is unlikely to occur in use, or engine operation that is not atypical. For example, this paragraph (c) does not allow you to design engines that require special maintenance for a certain type of expected operation. If we determine that certain maintenance items do not qualify as special maintenance under this paragraph (c), you may identify this as recommended additional maintenance under paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Noncritical emission-related maintenance.
Subject to the provisions of this paragraph (d), you may schedule any amount of emission-related inspection or maintenance that is not covered by paragraph (a) of this section (that is, maintenance that is neither explicitly identified as critical emission-related maintenance, nor that we approve as critical emission-related maintenance). Noncritical emission-related maintenance generally includes maintenance on the components we specify in 40 CFR part 1068, Appendix I that is not covered in paragraph (a) of this section. You must state in the owners manual that these steps are not necessary to keep the emission-related warranty valid. If operators fail to do this maintenance, this does not allow you to disqualify those engines from in-use testing or deny a warranty claim. Do not take these inspection or maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data engines.
(e)
Maintenance that is not emission-related.
For maintenance unrelated to emission controls, you may schedule any amount of inspection or maintenance. You may also take these inspection or maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data engines, as long as they are reasonable and technologically necessary. This might include adding engine oil, changing air, fuel, or oil filters, servicing engine-cooling systems or fuel-water separator cartridges or elements, and adjusting idle speed, governor, engine bolt torque, valve lash, or injector lash. You may not perform this nonemission-related maintenance on emission-data engines more often than the least frequent intervals that you recommend to the ultimate purchaser.
(f)
Source of parts and repairs.
State clearly in your written maintenance instructions that a repair shop or person of the owner's choosing may maintain, replace, or repair emission control devices and systems. Your instructions may not require components or service identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. Also, do not directly or indirectly condition your warranty on a requirement that the engine be serviced by your franchised dealers or any other service establishments with which you have a commercial relationship. You may disregard the requirements in this paragraph (f) if you do one of two things:
(1) Provide a component or service without charge under the purchase agreement.
(2) Get us to waive this prohibition in the public's interest by convincing us the engine will work properly only with the identified component or service.
(g)
Payment for scheduled maintenance.
Owners are responsible for properly maintaining their engines. This generally includes paying for scheduled maintenance. However, manufacturers must pay for scheduled maintenance during the useful life if it meets all the following criteria:
(1) Each affected component was not in general use on similar engines before the applicable dates shown in paragraph (6) of the definition of “new marine engine” in § 1042.901.
(2) The primary function of each affected component is to reduce emissions.
(3) The cost of the scheduled maintenance is more than 2 percent of the price of the engine.
(4) Failure to perform the maintenance would not cause clear problems that would significantly degrade the engine's performance.
(h)
Owners manual.
Explain the owner's responsibility for proper maintenance in the owners manual.

§ 1042.130
Installation instructions for vessel manufacturers.
(a) If you sell an engine for someone else to install in a vessel, give the engine installer instructions for installing it consistent with the requirements of this part. Include all information necessary to ensure that an engine will be installed in its certified configuration.
(b) Make sure these instructions have the following information:
(1) Include the heading: “Emission-related installation instructions”.
(2) State: “Failing to follow these instructions when installing a certified engine in a vessel violates federal law
(40 CFR 1068.105(b)), subject to fines or other penalties as described in the Clean Air Act.”
(3) Describe the instructions needed to properly install the exhaust system and any other components. Include instructions consistent with the requirements of § 1042.205(u).
(4) Describe any necessary steps for installing the diagnostic system described in § 1042.110.
(5) Describe how your certification is limited for any type of application. For example, if your engines are certified only for constant-speed operation, tell vessel manufacturers not to install the engines in variable-speed applications or modify the governor.
(6) Describe any other instructions to make sure the installed engine will operate according to design specifications in your application for certification. This may include, for example, instructions for installing aftertreatment devices when installing the engines.
(7) State: “If you install the engine in a way that makes the engine's emission control information label hard to read during normal engine maintenance, you must place a duplicate label on the vessel, as described in 40 CFR 1068.105.”
(8) Describe any vessel labeling requirements specified in § 1042.135.
(c) You do not need installation instructions for engines you install in your own vessels.
(d) Provide instructions in writing or in an equivalent format. For example, you may post instructions on a publicly available Web site for downloading or printing. If you do not provide the instructions in writing, explain in your application for certification how you will ensure that each installer is informed of the installation requirements.

§ 1042.135
Labeling.
(a) Assign each engine a unique identification number and permanently affix, engrave, or stamp it on the engine in a legible way.
(b) At the time of manufacture, affix a permanent and legible label identifying each engine. The label must meet the requirements of 40 CFR 1068.45.
(c) The label must—
(1) Include the heading “EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION”.
(2) Include your full corporate name and trademark. You may identify another company and use its trademark instead of yours if you comply with the branding provisions of 40 CFR 1068.45.
(3) Include EPA's standardized designation for the engine family (and subfamily, where applicable).
(4) Identify all the emission standards that apply to the engine (or FELs, if applicable). If you do not declare an FEL under subpart H of this part, you may alternatively state the engine's category, displacement (in liters or L/cyl), maximum engine power (in kW), and power density (in kW/L) as needed to determine the emission standards for the engine family. You may specify displacement, maximum engine power, or power density as a range consistent with the ranges listed in § 1042.101. See § 1042.140 for descriptions of how to specify per-cylinder displacement, maximum engine power, and power density.
(5) State the date of manufacture [DAY (optional), MONTH, and YEAR]; however, you may omit this from the label if you stamp, engrave, or otherwise permanently identify it elsewhere on the engine, in which case you must also describe in your application for certification where you will identify the date on the engine.
(6) Identify the application(s) for which the engine family is certified (such as constant-speed auxiliary, variable-speed propulsion engines used with fixed-pitch propellers, etc.). If the engine is certified as a recreational engine, state: “INSTALLING THIS RECREATIONAL ENGINE IN A COMMERCIAL VESSEL OR USING THE VESSEL FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES MAY VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY (40 CFR 1042.601).”
(7) For engines using sulfur-sensitive technologies, state: “ULTRA LOW SULFUR DIESEL FUEL ONLY”.
(8) State the useful life for your engine family if the applicable useful life is based on the provisions of § 1042.101(e)(2) or (3), or § 1042.104(d)(2).
(9) Identify the emission control system. Use terms and abbreviations as
described in 40 CFR 1068.45. You may omit this information from the label if there is not enough room for it and you put it in the owners manual instead.
(10) State: “THIS MARINE ENGINE COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA REGULATIONS FOR [MODEL YEAR].”
(11) For a Category 1 or Category 2 engine that can be modified to operate on residual fuel, but has not been certified to meet the standards on such a fuel, include the statement: “THIS ENGINE IS CERTIFIED FOR OPERATION ONLY WITH DIESEL FUEL. MODIFYING THE ENGINE TO OPERATE ON RESIDUAL OR INTERMEDIATE FUEL MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTIES.”
(12) For an engine equipped with on-off emission controls as allowed by § 1042.115, include the statement: “THIS ENGINE IS CERTIFIED WITH ON-OFF EMISSION CONTROLS. OPERATION OF THE ENGINE CONTRARY TO 40 CFR 1042.115(g) IS A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTIES.”
(13) For engines above 130 kW that are intended for installation on domestic or public vessels, include the following statement: “THIS ENGINE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH INTERNATIONAL MARINE REGULATIONS UNLESS IT IS ALSO COVERED BY AN EIAPP CERTIFICATE.”
(d) You may add information to the emission control information label as follows:
(1) You may identify other emission standards that the engine meets or does not meet (such as international standards), as long as this does not cause you to omit any of the information described in paragraphs (c)(5) through (9) of this section. You may add the information about the other emission standards to the statement we specify, or you may include it in a separate statement.
(2) You may add other information to ensure that the engine will be properly maintained and used.
(3) You may add appropriate features to prevent counterfeit labels. For example, you may include the engine's unique identification number on the label.
(e) For engines using sulfur-sensitive technologies, create a separate label with the statement: “ULTRA LOW SULFUR DIESEL FUEL ONLY”. Permanently attach this label to the vessel near the fuel inlet or, if you do not manufacture the vessel, take one of the following steps to ensure that the vessel will be properly labeled:
(1) Provide the label to each vessel manufacturer and include in the emission-related installation instructions the requirement to place this label near the fuel inlet.
(2) Confirm that the vessel manufacturers install their own complying labels.
(f) You may ask us to approve modified labeling requirements in this part 1042 if you show that it is necessary or appropriate. We will approve your request if your alternate label is consistent with the intent of the labeling requirements of this part.
(g) If you obscure the engine label while installing the engine in the vessel such that the label will be hard to read during normal maintenance, you must place a duplicate label on the vessel. If others install your engine in their vessels in a way that obscures the engine label, we require them to add a duplicate label on the vessel (see 40 CFR 1068.105); in that case, give them the number of duplicate labels they request and keep the following records for at least five years:
(1) Written documentation of the request from the vessel manufacturer.
(2) The number of duplicate labels you send for each family and the date you sent them.

§ 1042.140
Maximum engine power, displacement, power density, and maximum in-use engine speed.
This section describes how to determine the maximum engine power, displacement, and power density of an engine for the purposes of this part. Note that maximum engine power may differ from the definition of “maximum test power” in § 1042.901. This section also specifies how to determine maximum in-use engine speed for Category 3 engines.
(a) An engine configuration's maximum engine power is the maximum brake power point on the nominal power curve for the engine configuration, as defined in this section. Round the power value to the nearest whole kilowatt.
(b) The nominal power curve of an engine configuration is the relationship between maximum available engine brake power and engine speed for an engine, using the mapping procedures of 40 CFR part 1065, based on the manufacturer's design and production specifications for the engine. This information may also be expressed by a torque curve that relates maximum available engine torque with engine speed.
(c) An engine configuration's per-cylinder displacement is the intended swept volume of each cylinder. The swept volume of the engine is the product of the internal cross-section area of the cylinders, the stroke length, and the number of cylinders. Calculate the engine's intended swept volume from the design specifications for the cylinders using enough significant figures to allow determination of the displacement to the nearest 0.02 liters. Determine the final value by truncating digits to establish the per-cylinder displacement to the nearest 0.1 liters. For example, for an engine with circular cylinders having an internal diameter of 13.0 cm and a 15.5 cm stroke length, the rounded displacement would be: (13.0/2)
2
× (π) × (15.5) ÷ 1000 = 2.0 liters.
(d) The nominal power curve and intended swept volume must be within the range of the actual power curves and swept volumes of production engines considering normal production variability. If after production begins, it is determined that either your nominal power curve or your intended swept volume does not represent production engines, we may require you to amend your application for certification under § 1042.225.
(e) Throughout this part, references to a specific power value for an engine are based on maximum engine power. For example, the group of engines with maximum engine power below 600 kW may be referred to as engines below 600 kW.
(f) Calculate an engine family's power density in kW/L by dividing the unrounded maximum engine power by the engine's unrounded per-cylinder displacement, then dividing by the number of cylinders. Round the calculated value to the nearest whole number.
(g) Calculate a maximum test speed for the nominal power curve as specified in 40 CFR 1065.610. This is the maximum in-use engine speed used for calculating the NO
X
standard in § 1042.104 for Category 3 engines. Alternatively, you may use a lower value if engine speed will be limited in actual use to that lower value.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23000, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74147, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1042.145
Interim provisions.
(a)
General.
The provisions in this section apply instead of other provisions in this part. This section describes when these interim provisions expire. Only the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section apply for Category 3 engines.
(b)-(e) [Reserved]
(f)
In-use compliance limits.
The provisions of this paragraph (f) apply for the first three model years of the Tier 4 standards. For purposes of determining compliance based on testing other than certification or production-line testing, calculate the applicable in-use compliance limits by adjusting the applicable standards/FELs. The PM adjustment does not apply for engines with a PM standard or FEL above 0.04 g/kW-hr. The NO
X
adjustment does not apply for engines with a NO
X
FEL above 2.7 g/kW-hr. Add the applicable adjustments in one of the following tables to the otherwise applicable standards and NTE limits. You must specify during certification which add-ons, if any, will apply for your engines.

(g)
Deficiencies for NTE standards.
You may ask us to accept as compliant an engine that does not fully meet specific requirements under the applicable NTE standards. Such deficiencies are intended to allow for minor deviations from the NTE standards under limited conditions. We expect your engines to have functioning emission control hardware that allows you to comply with the NTE standards.
(1) Request our approval for specific deficiencies in your application for certification, or before you submit your application. We will not approve deficiencies retroactively to cover engines already certified. In your request, identify the scope of each deficiency and describe any auxiliary emission control devices you will use to control emissions to the lowest practical level, considering the deficiency you are requesting.
(2) We will approve a deficiency only if compliance would be infeasible or unreasonable considering such factors as the technical feasibility of the given hardware and the applicable lead time and production cycles. We may consider other relevant factors.
(3) Our approval applies only for a single model year and may be limited to specific engine configurations. We may approve your request for the same deficiency in the following model year if correcting the deficiency would require unreasonable hardware or software modifications and we determine that you have demonstrated an acceptable level of effort toward complying.
(4) You may ask for any number of deficiencies in the first three model years during which NTE standards apply for your engines. For the next four model years, we may approve up to three deficiencies per engine family. Deficiencies of the same type that apply similarly to different power ratings within a family count as one deficiency per family. We may condition approval of any such additional deficiencies during these four years on any additional conditions we determine to be appropriate. We will not approve deficiencies after the seven-year period specified in this paragraph (g)(4), unless they are related to safety.
(h)
Expanded production-line testing.
Production-line testing requirements for Category 1 engine families with a projected U.S.-directed production volume below 100 engines and for all families certified by small-volume engine manufacturers start to apply in model year 2024. All manufacturers must test no more than four engine families in a single model year, and small-volume engine manufacturers must test no more than two engine families in a single model year.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Installing land-based engines in marine vessels.
Vessel manufacturers and marine equipment manufacturers may apply the provisions of §§ 1042.605 and 1042.610 to land-based engines with maximum engine power at or above 37 kW and at or below 560 kW if they meet the Tier 3 emission standards in appendix I of 40 CFR part 1039 as specified in 40 CFR 1068.265. All the provisions of § 1042.605 or § 1042.610 apply as if those engines were certified to emission standards under 40 CFR part 1039. Similarly, engine manufacturers, vessel manufacturers, and marine equipment manufacturers must comply with all the provisions of 40 CFR part 1039 as if those engines were installed in land-based equipment. The following provisions apply for engine manufacturers shipping engines to vessel manufacturers or marine equipment manufacturers under this paragraph (j):
(1) You must label the engine as described in 40 CFR 1039.135, but identify the engine family name as it was last certified under 40 CFR part 1039 and include the following alternate compliance statement:
THIS ENGINE MEETS THE TIER 3 STANDARDS FOR LAND-BASED NONROAD DIESEL ENGINES UNDER 40 CFR PART 1039. THIS ENGINE MAY BE USED ONLY IN A MARINE VESSEL UNDER THE DRESSING PROVISIONS OF 40 CFR 1042.605 OR 40 CFR 1042.610.
(2) You must use the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.262 for shipping uncertified engines under this section to secondary engine manufacturers.
(k)
Adjusted implementation dates for Tier 4 standards.
Engines and vessels may qualify for delaying the Tier 4 standards specified in § 1042.101 as follows:
(1) The delay is limited to model year 2021 and earlier engines and vessels that meet all the following characteristics:
(i) Category 1 propulsion engines with specific power density above 27.0 kW/liter, up to maximum engine power of 1,400 kW.
(ii) Vessels have total propulsion power at or below 2,800 kW.
(iii) Vessel waterline length is at or below 65 feet.
(iv) Vessels have a maximum speed (in knots) at or above 3.0 · L

, where L is the vessel's waterline length, in feet.
(v) Vessels have fiberglass or other nonmetal hulls.
(3) Vessel manufacturers must have a contract or purchase agreement signed before the end of the relief period for each vessel produced under this paragraph (k).
(4) Affected engines must instead be certified to the appropriate Tier 3 emission standards specified in § 1042.101. Engine manufacturers may include engine configurations with maximum engine power below 600 kW in the same engine family even if the power density is below the value specified in paragraph (k)(1) or (2) of this section.
(5) If you introduce an engine into U.S. commerce under this section, you must meet the labeling requirements in § 1042.135, but add the following statement instead of the compliance statement in § 1042.135(c)(10):
THIS MARINE ENGINE COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA TIER 3 EMISSION STANDARDS UNDER 40 CFR 1042.145(k). ANY OTHER INSTALLATION OR USE OF THIS ENGINE MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.
(l) [Reserved]
(m)
Tier 4 waiver.
Starting with model year 2024, vessel manufacturers may request an exemption from the Tier 4 standards as follows:
(1) The subject vessels and engines must meet the qualifications of paragraph (k)(2) of this section.
(2) Vessel manufacturers must send a written request for the exemption to the Designated Compliance Officer. The request must describe efforts
taken to identify available engines certified to the Tier 4 standards, describe design efforts for installing engines in the subject vessels, identify the number of vessels needing exempt engines, demonstrate that the vessel cannot meet essential performance specifications using available Tier 4 engines, and state that engine and vessel manufacturers will meet all the terms and conditions that apply. We may approve an exemption from the Tier 4 standards based on the submitted information.
(3) Engine manufacturers may ship exempt engines under this paragraph (m) only after receiving a written request from a vessel manufacturer who has received our written approval to build a specific number of vessels. The prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) do not apply to a new engine that is subject to Tier 4 standards, subject to the following conditions:
(i) The engine meets the appropriate Tier 3 emission standards in § 1042.101 consistent with the provisions specified in 40 CFR 1068.265.
(ii) The engine is installed on a vessel consistent with the conditions of this paragraph (m).
(iii) The engine meets the labeling requirements in § 1042.135, with the following statement instead of the compliance statement in § 1042.135(c)(10):
THIS MARINE ENGINE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH CURRENT U.S. EPA EMISSION STANDARDS UNDER 40 CFR 1042.145(m). ANY OTHER INSTALLATION OR USE OF THIS ENGINE MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.
(n)
Assigned deterioration factors.
Engine manufacturers may use assigned deterioration factors for certifying Tier 4 engines with maximum power up to 1,400 kW, as follows:
(1) For engine families that have at least one configuration with maximum engine power at or below 1,400 kW and power density above 30.0 kW/liter, you may use assigned deterioration factors through model year 2024.
(2) For engine families that have at least one configuration with maximum engine power at or below 1,000 kW and power density above 30.0 kW/liter, you may use assigned deterioration factors through model year 2026.
(3) The assigned deterioration factors are multiplicative values of 1.1 for NO
X
and 1.4 for HC and CO, and an additive value of 0.003 g/kW-hr for PM, unless we approve your request to use different values. We will approve your proposed values if we determine based on data from similar engines and supporting rationale you submit with your request that they better represent your engines.
(o)
Useful life for light-commercial engines.
You may certify commercial Category 1 engines at or above 600 kW with power density above 45.00 kW/liter to the exhaust emission standards of this part over a full useful life of 10 years or 5,000 hours of operation instead of the useful-life values specified in § 1042.101(e). Engines certified to this shorter useful life must be in their own engine family.

A certificate of conformity is valid for new production from the indicated effective date until the end of the model year for which it is issued, which may not extend beyond December 31 of that year. No certificate will be issued after December 31 of the model year. You may amend your application for certification after the end of the model year in certain circumstances as described in §§ 1042.220 and 1042.225. You must renew your certification annually for any engines you continue to produce.
(b) The application must contain all the information required by this part and must not include false or incomplete statements or information (see § 1042.255).
(c) We may ask you to include less information than we specify in this subpart, as long as you maintain all the information required by § 1042.250.
(d) You must use good engineering judgment for all decisions related to your application (see 40 CFR 1068.5).
(e) An authorized representative of your company must approve and sign the application.
(f) See § 1042.255 for provisions describing how we will process your application.
(g) We may require you to deliver your test engines to a facility we designate for our testing (see § 1042.235(c)). Alternatively, you may choose to deliver another engine that is identical in all material respects to the test engine, or another engine that we determine can appropriately serve as an emission-data engine for the engine family.
(h) For engines that become new after being placed into service, such as engines installed on imported vessels, we may specify alternate certification provisions consistent with the intent of this part.
See
the definition of “new marine engine” in § 1042.901.

(11) Do the following additional things for AECDs designed to protect engines or vessels:
(i) Identify the engine and/or vessel design limits that make protection necessary and describe any damage that would occur without the AECD.
(ii) Describe how each sensed parameter relates to the protected components' design limits or those operating conditions that cause the need for protection.
(iii) Describe the relationship between the design limits/parameters being protected and the parameters sensed or calculated as surrogates for those design limits/parameters, if applicable.
(iv) Describe how the modulation by the AECD prevents engines and/or vessels from exceeding design limits.
(v) Explain why it is necessary to estimate any parameters instead of measuring them directly and describe how the AECD calculates the estimated value, if applicable.
(vi) Describe how you calibrate the AECD modulation to activate only during conditions related to the stated need to protect components and only as needed to sufficiently protect those components in a way that minimizes the emission impact.

, PM, and CO on an emission-data engine to show your engines meet emission standards as specified in §§ 1042.101 or 1042.104. Note that you must submit PM data for all engines, whether or not a PM standard applies. Show emission figures before and after applying adjustment factors for regeneration and deterioration factors for each pollutant and for each engine. If we specify more than one grade of any fuel type (for example, high-sulfur and low-sulfur diesel fuel), you need to submit test data only for one grade, unless the regulations of this part specify otherwise for your engine. Include emission results for each mode for Category 3 engines or for other engines if you do discrete-mode testing under § 1042.505. For engines using on-off controls as described in § 1042.115(g), include emission data demonstrating compliance with the Tier 2 standards when the engines Tier 3 NO
X
emission controls are disabled. Note that §§ 1042.235 and 1042.245 allows you to submit an application in certain cases without new emission data.
(p) For Category 1 and Category 2 engines, state that all the engines in the engine family comply with the applicable not-to-exceed emission standards in
§ 1042.101 for all normal operation and use when tested as specified in § 1042.515. Describe any relevant testing, engineering analysis, or other information in sufficient detail to support your statement.
(q) [Reserved]
(r) Report test results as follows:
(1) Report all valid test results involving measurement of pollutants for which emission standards apply. Also indicate whether there are test results from invalid tests or from any other tests of the emission-data engine, whether or not they were conducted according to the test procedures of subpart F of this part. We may require you to report these additional test results. We may ask you to send other information to confirm that your tests were valid under the requirements of this part and 40 CFR part 1065.

.
(s) Describe all adjustable operating parameters (see § 1042.115(d)), including production tolerances. For any operating parameters that do not qualify as adjustable parameters, include a description supporting your conclusion (see 40 CFR 1068.50(c)). Include the following in your description of each adjustable parameter:
(1) For practically adjustable parameters, include the nominal or recommended setting, the intended practically adjustable range, and the limits or stops used to establish adjustable ranges.
(i) For Category 1 engines, state that the limits, stops, or other means of inhibiting mechanical adjustment are effective in preventing adjustment of parameters on in-use engines to settings outside your intended practically adjustable ranges and provide information to support this statement.
(ii) For Category 2 and Category 3 engines, propose a range of mechanical adjustment for each adjustable parameter, as described in § 1042.115(d). State that the limits, stops, or other means of inhibiting mechanical adjustment are effective in preventing adjustment of parameters on in-use engines to settings outside your proposed adjustable ranges and provide information to support this statement.
(2) For programmable operating parameters, state that you have restricted access to electronic controls to prevent parameter adjustments on in-use engines that would allow operation outside the practically adjustable range. Describe how your engines are designed to prevent unauthorized adjustments.
(t) Provide the information to read, record, and interpret all the information broadcast by an engine's onboard computers and electronic control units. State that, upon request, you will give us any hardware, software, or tools we would need to do this. If you broadcast a surrogate parameter for torque values, you must provide us what we need to convert these into torque units. You may reference any appropriate publicly released standards that define conventions for these messages and parameters. Format your information consistent with publicly released standards.
(u) Confirm that your emission-related installation instructions specify how to ensure that sampling of exhaust emissions will be possible after engines are installed in vessels and placed in service. Show how to sample exhaust emissions in a way that prevents diluting the exhaust sample with ambient air.
(v) State whether your certification is limited for certain engines. If this is the case, describe how you will prevent use of these engines in applications for which they are not certified. This applies for engines such as the following:
(1) Constant-speed engines.
(2) Engines used with controllable-pitch propellers.
(3) Recreational engines.
(w) Unconditionally certify that all the engines in the engine family comply with the requirements of this part, other referenced parts of the CFR, and the Clean Air Act.
(x) Include good-faith estimates of U.S.-directed production volumes. Include a justification for the estimated production volumes if they are substantially different than actual production volumes in earlier years for similar models.
(y) Include the information required by other subparts of this part. For example, include the information required by § 1042.725 if you participate in the ABT program.
(z) Include other applicable information, such as information specified in this part or 40 CFR part 1068 related to requests for exemptions.
(aa) Name an agent for service located in the United States. Service on this agent constitutes service on you or any of your officers or employees for any action by EPA or otherwise by the United States related to the requirements of this part.
(bb) The following provisions apply for imported engines:
(1) Describe your normal practice for importing engines. For example, this may include identifying the names and addresses of any agents you have authorized to import your engines.
(2) For engines below 560 kW, identify a test facility in the United States where you can test your engines if we select them for testing under a selective enforcement audit, as specified in 40 CFR part 1068.

§ 1042.210
Preliminary approval.
If you send us information before you finish the application, we will review it and make any appropriate determinations, especially for questions related to engine family definitions, auxiliary emission control devices, deterioration factors, useful life, testing for service accumulation, maintenance, and compliance with not-to-exceed standards. See § 1042.245 for specific provisions that apply for deterioration factors. Decisions made under this section are considered to be preliminary approval, subject to final review and approval. We will generally not reverse a decision where we have given you preliminary approval, unless we find new information supporting a different decision. If you request preliminary approval related to the upcoming model year or the model year after that, we will make best-efforts to make the appropriate determinations as soon as practicable. We will generally not provide preliminary approval related to a future model year more than two years ahead of time.
§ 1042.220
Amending maintenance instructions.
You may amend your emission-related maintenance instructions after you submit your application for certification as long as the amended instructions remain consistent with the provisions of § 1042.125. You must send the Designated Compliance Officer a written request to amend your application for certification for an engine family if you want to change the emission-related maintenance instructions in a way that could affect emissions. In your request, describe the proposed changes to the maintenance instructions. If operators follow the original maintenance instructions rather than the newly specified maintenance, this does not allow you to disqualify those engines from in-use testing or deny a warranty claim.
(a) If you are decreasing or eliminating any specified maintenance, you may distribute the new maintenance instructions to your customers 30 days after we receive your request, unless we disapprove your request. This would generally include replacing one maintenance step with another. We may approve a shorter time or waive this requirement.
(b) If your requested change would not decrease the specified maintenance, you may distribute the new maintenance instructions anytime after you send your request. For example, this paragraph (b) would cover adding instructions to increase the frequency of filter changes for engines in severe-duty applications.
(c) You need not request approval if you are making only minor corrections (such as correcting typographical mistakes), clarifying your maintenance instructions, or changing instructions for maintenance unrelated to emission control. We may ask you to send us copies of maintenance instructions revised under this paragraph (c).
[75 FR 23001, Apr. 30, 2010]
§ 1042.225
Amending applications for certification.
Before we issue you a certificate of conformity, you may amend your application to include new or modified engine configurations, subject to the provisions of this section. After we have issued your certificate of conformity, you may send us an amended application requesting that we include new or modified engine configurations within the scope of the certificate, subject to the provisions of this section. You must amend your application if any changes occur with respect to any information that is included or should be included in your application.
(a) You must amend your application before you take any of the following actions:
(1) Add an engine configuration to an engine family. In this case, the engine configuration added must be consistent with other engine configurations in the engine family with respect to the criteria listed in § 1042.230.
(2) Change an engine configuration already included in an engine family in a way that may affect emissions, or change any of the components you described in your application for certification. This includes production and design changes that may affect emissions any time during the engine's lifetime.
(3) Modify an FEL for an engine family as described in paragraph (f) of this section.
(b) To amend your application for certification as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, send the relevant information to the Designated Compliance Officer.
(1) Describe in detail the addition or change in the engine model or configuration you intend to make.
(2) Include engineering evaluations or data showing that the amended engine family complies with all applicable requirements. You may do this by showing that the original emission-data engine is still appropriate for showing that the amended family complies with all applicable requirements.
(3) If the original emission-data engine for the engine family is not appropriate to show compliance for the new or modified engine configuration, include new test data showing that the new or modified engine configuration meets the requirements of this part.
(4) Include any other information needed to make your application correct and complete.
(c) We may ask for more test data or engineering evaluations. You must give us these within 30 days after we request them.
(d) For engine families already covered by a certificate of conformity, we will determine whether the existing certificate of conformity covers your newly added or modified engine. You may ask for a hearing if we deny your request (see § 1042.920).
(e) For engine families already covered by a certificate of conformity, you may start producing the new or modified engine configuration anytime after you send us your amended application and before we make a decision under paragraph (d) of this section. However, if we determine that the affected engines do not meet applicable requirements, we will notify you to cease production of the engines and may require you to recall the engines at no expense to the owner. Choosing to produce engines under this paragraph (e) is deemed to be consent to recall all engines that we determine do not meet applicable emission standards or other requirements and to remedy the nonconformity at no expense to the owner. If you do not provide information required under paragraph (c) of this section within 30 days after we request it, you must stop producing the new or modified engines.
(f) You may ask us to approve a change to your FEL in certain cases after the start of production. The changed FEL may not apply to engines you have already introduced into U.S. commerce, except as described in this paragraph (f). If we approve a changed FEL after the start of production, you must include the new FEL on the emission control information label for all engines produced after the change. You may ask us to approve a change to your FEL in the following cases:
(1) You may ask to raise your FEL for your engine family at any time. In your request, you must show that you will still be able to meet the emission standards as specified in subparts B and H of this part. If you amend your
application by submitting new test data to include a newly added or modified engine, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, use the appropriate FELs with corresponding production volumes to calculate emission credits for the model year, as described in subpart H of this part. In all other circumstances, you must use the higher FEL for the entire family to calculate emission credits under subpart H of this part.
(2) You may ask to lower the FEL for your engine family only if you have test data from production engines showing that emissions are below the proposed lower FEL. The lower FEL applies only to engines you produce after we approve the new FEL. Use the appropriate FELs with corresponding production volumes to calculate emission credits for the model year, as described in subpart H of this part.
(g) You may produce engines as described in your amended application for certification and consider those engines to be in a certified configuration if we approve a new or modified engine configuration during the model year under paragraph (d) of this section. Similarly, you may modify in-use engines as described in your amended application for certification and consider those engines to be in a certified configuration if we approve a new or modified engine configuration at any time under paragraph (d) of this section. Modifying a new or in-use engine to be in a certified configuration does not violate the tampering prohibition of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1), as long as this does not involve changing to a certified configuration with a higher family emission limit.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23001, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74148, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1042.230
Engine families.
(a) For purposes of certification, divide your product line into families of engines that are expected to have similar emission characteristics throughout the useful life as described in this section. You may not group engines in different engine categories in the same family. Your engine family is limited to a single model year.
(b) For Category 1 engines, group engines in the same engine family if they are the same in all the following aspects:
(1) The combustion cycle and the fuel with which the engine is intended or designed to be operated.
(2) The cooling system (for example, raw-water vs. separate-circuit cooling).
(3) Method of air aspiration.
(4) Method of exhaust aftertreatment (for example, catalytic converter or particulate trap).
(5) Combustion chamber design.
(6) Nominal bore and stroke.
(7) Cylinder arrangement (such as in-line vs. vee configurations). This applies for engines with aftertreatment devices only.
(8) Method of control for engine operation other than governing (
i.e.,
mechanical or electronic).
(9) Application (commercial or recreational).
(10) Numerical level of the emission standards that apply to the engine, except as allowed under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section.
(c) For Category 2 engines, group engines in the same engine family if they are the same in all the following aspects:
(1) The combustion cycle (e.g., diesel cycle).
(2) The fuel with which the engine is intended or designed to be operated and the fuel system configuration.
(3) The cooling system (for example, air-cooled or water-cooled), and procedure(s) employed to maintain engine temperature within desired limits (thermostat, on-off radiator fans, radiator shutters, etc.).
(4) The method of air aspiration (turbocharged, supercharged, naturally aspirated, Roots blown).
(5) The turbocharger or supercharger general performance characteristics (e.g., approximate boost pressure, approximate response time, approximate size relative to engine displacement).
(6) The type of air inlet cooler (air-to-air, air-to-liquid, approximate degree to which inlet air is cooled).
(7) The type of exhaust aftertreatment system (oxidation catalyst, particulate trap), and characteristics of the aftertreatment system (catalyst loading, converter size vs. engine size).
(8) The combustion chamber configuration and the surface-to-volume ratio of the combustion chamber when the piston is at top dead center position, using nominal combustion chamber dimensions.
(9) Nominal bore and stroke dimensions.
(10) The location of the piston rings on the piston.
(11) The intake manifold induction port size and configuration.
(12) The exhaust manifold port size and configuration.
(13) The location of the intake and exhaust valves (or ports).
(14) The size of the intake and exhaust valves (or ports).
(15) The approximate intake and exhaust event timing and duration (valve or port).
(16) The configuration of the fuel injectors and approximate injection pressure.
(17) The type of fuel injection system controls (i.e., mechanical or electronic).
(18) The overall injection timing characteristics, or as appropriate ignition timing characteristics (i.e., the deviation of the timing curves from the optimal fuel economy timing curve must be similar in degree).
(19) The type of smoke control system.
(d) For Category 3 engines, group engines into engine families based on the criteria specified in Section 4.3 of the NO
X
Technical Code (incorporated by reference in § 1042.910), except as allowed in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.
(e) You may subdivide a group of engines that is identical under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section into different engine families if you show the expected emission characteristics are different during the useful life. However, for the purpose of applying small-volume family provisions of this part, we will consider the otherwise applicable engine family criteria of this section.
(f) You may group engines that are not identical with respect to the things listed in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section in the same engine family, as follows:
(1) In unusual circumstances, you may group such engines in the same engine family if you show that their emission characteristics during the useful life will be similar.
(2) If you are a small-volume engine manufacturer, you may group any Category 1 engines into a single engine family or you may group any Category 2 engines into a single engine family. This also applies if you are a post-manufacture marinizer modifying a base engine that has a valid certificate of conformity for any kind of nonroad or heavy-duty highway engine under this chapter.
(3) The provisions of this paragraph (f) do not exempt any engines from meeting the standards and requirements in subpart B of this part.
(g) If you combine engines that are subject to different emission standards into a single engine family under paragraph (f) of this section, you must certify the engine family to the more stringent set of standards for that model year. For Category 3 engine families that include a range of maximum in-use engine speeds, use the highest value of maximum in-use engine speed to establish the applicable NO
X
emission standard.

§ 1042.235
Emission testing related to certification.
This section describes the emission testing you must perform to show compliance with the emission standards in § 1042.101(a) or § 1042.104.
See
§ 1042.205(p) regarding emission testing related to the NTE standards.
See
§§ 1042.240 and 1042.245 and 40 CFR part 1065, subpart E, regarding service accumulation before emission testing.
See
§ 1042.655 for special testing provisions available for Category 3 engines subject to Tier 3 standards.
(a) Select an emission-data engine from each engine family for testing. For engines at or above 560 kW, you may use a development engine that is equivalent in design to the engine
being certified. For Category 3 engines, you may use a single-cylinder version of the engine. Using good engineering judgment, select the engine configuration most likely to exceed an applicable emission standard over the useful life, considering all exhaust emission constituents and the range of installation options available to vessel manufacturers.
(b) Test your emission-data engines using the procedures and equipment specified in subpart F of this part. In the case of dual-fuel engines, measure emissions when operating with each type of fuel for which you intend to certify the engine. In the case of flexible-fuel engines, measure emissions when operating with the fuel mixture that best represents in-use operation or is most likely to have the highest NO
X
emissions (or NO
X
+HC emissions for engines subject to NO
X
+HC standards), though you may ask us to instead to perform tests with both fuels separately if you can show that intermediate mixtures are not likely to occur in use.
(c) We may perform confirmatory testing by measuring emissions from any of your emission-data engines or other engines from the engine family, as follows:
(1) We may decide to do the testing at your plant or any other facility. If we do this, you must deliver the engine to a test facility we designate. The engine you provide must include appropriate manifolds, aftertreatment devices, electronic control units, and other emission-related components not normally attached directly to the engine block. If we do the testing at your plant, you must schedule it as soon as possible and make available the instruments, personnel, and equipment we need.
(2) If we measure emissions from one of your engines, the results of that testing become the official emission results for the engine. Unless we later invalidate these data, we may decide not to consider your data in determining if your engine family meets applicable requirements.
(3) Before we test one of your engines, we may set its adjustable parameters to any point within the specified adjustable ranges (
see
§ 1042.115(d)).
(4) Before we test one of your engines, we may calibrate it within normal production tolerances for anything we do not consider an adjustable parameter. For example, this would apply for an engine parameter that is subject to production variability because it is adjustable during production, but is not considered an adjustable parameter (as defined in § 1042.901) because it is permanently sealed. For parameters that relate to a level of performance that is itself subject to a specified range (such as maximum power output), we will generally perform any calibration under this paragraph (c)(4) in a way that keeps performance within the specified range.
(d) You may ask to use carryover emission data from a previous model year instead of doing new tests, but only if all the following are true:
(1) The engine family from the previous model year differs from the current engine family only with respect to model year, items identified in § 1042.225(a), or other characteristics unrelated to emissions. We may waive this criterion for differences we determine not to be relevant.
(2) The emission-data engine from the previous model year remains the appropriate emission-data engine under paragraph (b) of this section.
(3) The data show that the emission-data engine would meet all the requirements of this part that apply to the engine family covered by the application for certification. For engines originally tested to demonstrate compliance with Tier 1 or Tier 2 standards, you may consider those test procedures to be equivalent to the procedures we specify in subpart F of this part.
(e) We may require you to test a second engine of the same or different configuration in addition to the engine tested under paragraph (b) of this section.
(f) If you use an alternate test procedure under 40 CFR 1065.10 and later testing shows that such testing does not produce results that are equivalent to the procedures specified in subpart F of this part, we may reject data you generated using the alternate procedure.
(g) Measure CO
2
with each low-hour certification test using the procedures
specified in 40 CFR part 1065 starting in the 2011 model year. Also measure CH
4
from Category 1 and Category 2 engines with each low-hour certification test using the procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065 starting in the 2012 model year. Measure N
2
O from Category 1 and Category 2 engines with each low-hour certification test using the procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065 for any engine family that depends on NOx aftertreatment to meet emission standards. Small-volume engine manufacturers may omit measurement of N
2
O and CH
4
. These measurements are not required for NTE testing. Use the same units and modal calculations as for your other results to report a single weighted value for each constituent. Round the final values as follows:
(1) Round CO
2
to the nearest 1 g/kW-hr.
(2) Round N
2
O to the nearest 0.001 g/kW-hr.
(3) Round CH
4
to the nearest 0.001 g/kW-hr.

§ 1042.240
Demonstrating compliance with exhaust emission standards.
(a) For purposes of certification, your engine family is considered in compliance with the emission standards in § 1042.101(a) or § 1042.104 if all emission-data engines representing that family have test results showing official emission results and deteriorated emission levels at or below these standards. This also applies for all test points for emission-data engines within the family used to establish deterioration factors.
See
paragraph (f) of this section for provisions related to demonstrating compliance with non-duty-cycle standards, such as NTE standards. Note that your FELs are considered to be the applicable emission standards with which you must comply if you participate in the ABT program in subpart H of this part.
(b) Your engine family is deemed not to comply if any emission-data engine representing that family has test results showing an official emission result or a deteriorated emission level for any pollutant that is above an applicable emission standard. Similarly, your engine family is deemed not to comply if any emission-data engine representing that family has test results showing any emission level above the applicable not-to-exceed emission standard for any pollutant. This also applies for all test points for emission-data engines within the family used to establish deterioration factors.
(c) To compare emission levels from the emission-data engine with the applicable emission standards, apply deterioration factors to the measured emission levels for each pollutant. Section 1042.245 specifies how to test your Category 1 or Category 2 engine to develop deterioration factors that represent the deterioration expected in emissions over your engines' full useful life.
See
paragraph (e) of this section for determining deterioration factors for Category 3 engines. Your deterioration factors must take into account any available data from in-use testing with similar engines. Small-volume engine manufacturers and post-manufacture marinizers may use assigned deterioration factors that we establish. Apply deterioration factors as follows:
(1)
Additive deterioration factor for exhaust emissions.
Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, use an additive deterioration factor for exhaust emissions. An additive deterioration factor is the difference between exhaust emissions at the end of the useful life and exhaust emissions at the low-hour test point. In these cases, adjust the official emission results for each tested engine at the selected test point by adding the factor to the measured emissions. If the deterioration factor is less than zero, use zero. Additive deterioration factors must be specified to one more decimal place than the applicable standard.
(2)
Multiplicative deterioration factor for exhaust emissions.
Use a multiplicative deterioration factor if good engineering judgment calls for the deterioration factor for a pollutant to be the ratio of exhaust emissions at the end of the useful life to exhaust emissions at the low-hour test point. For example, if you use aftertreatment technology that controls emissions of a pollutant proportionally to engine-out emissions,
it is often appropriate to use a multiplicative deterioration factor. Adjust the official emission results for each tested engine at the selected test point by multiplying the measured emissions by the deterioration factor. If the deterioration factor is less than one, use one. A multiplicative deterioration factor may not be appropriate in cases where testing variability is significantly greater than engine-to-engine variability. Multiplicative deterioration factors must be specified to one more significant figure than the applicable standard.
(3)
Sawtooth and other nonlinear deterioration patterns.
The deterioration factors described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section assume that the highest useful life emissions occur either at the end of useful life or at the low-hour test point. The provisions of this paragraph (c)(3) apply where good engineering judgment indicates that the highest emissions over the useful life will occur between these two points. For example, emissions may increase with service accumulation until a certain maintenance step is performed, then return to the low-hour emission levels and begin increasing again. Base deterioration factors for engines with such emission patterns on the difference between (or ratio of) the point at which the highest emissions occur and the low-hour test point. Note that this applies for maintenance-related deterioration only where we allow such critical emission-related maintenance.
(4)
Deterioration factor for crankcase emissions.
If your engine vents crankcase emissions to the exhaust or to the atmosphere, you must account for crankcase emission deterioration, using good engineering judgment. You may use separate deterioration factors for crankcase emissions of each pollutant (either multiplicative or additive) or include the effects in combined deterioration factors that include exhaust and crankcase emissions together for each pollutant.
(5)
Dual-fuel and flexible-fuel engines.
In the case of dual-fuel and flexible-fuel engines, apply deterioration factors separately for each fuel type. You may accumulate service hours on a single emission-data engine using the type of fuel or the fuel mixture expected to have the highest combustion and exhaust temperatures; you may ask us to approve a different fuel mixture if you demonstrate that a different criterion is more appropriate.
(d) Determine the official emission result for each pollutant to at least one more decimal place than the applicable standard. Apply the deterioration factor to the official emission result, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, then round the adjusted figure to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard. Compare the rounded emission levels to the emission standard for each emission-data engine. In the case of NO
X
+HC standards, apply the deterioration factor to each pollutant and then add the results before rounding.
(e) For Category 3 engines, determine a deterioration factor based on an engineering analysis. The engineering analysis must describe how the measured emission levels from the emission-data engine show that engines comply with applicable emission standards throughout the useful life. Include this analysis in your application for certification and add a statement that all data, analyses, evaluations, and other information you used are available for our review upon request.
(f) For NTE standards and mode caps, use good engineering judgment to demonstrate compliance throughout the useful life. You may, but are not required to, apply the same deterioration factors used to show compliance with the applicable duty-cycle standards. We will deny your application for certification if we determine that your test data show that your engines would exceed one or more NTE standard or mode cap during their useful lives.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23002, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74148, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1042.245
Deterioration factors.
This section describes how to determine deterioration factors for Category 1 and Category 2 engines, either with an engineering analysis, with pre-existing test data, or with new emission measurements. Apply these deterioration factors to determine whether your
engines will meet the duty-cycle emission standards throughout the useful life as described in § 1042.240. This section does not apply for Category 3 engines.
(a) You may ask us to approve deterioration factors for an engine family with established technology based on engineering analysis instead of testing. Engines certified to a NO
X
+ HC standard or FEL greater than the Tier 3 NO
X
+ HC standard are considered to rely on established technology for control of gaseous emissions, except that this does not include any engines that use exhaust-gas recirculation or aftertreatment. In most cases, technologies used to meet the Tier 1 and Tier 2 emission standards would qualify as established technology. We must approve your plan to establish a deterioration factor under this paragraph (a) before you submit your application for certification.
(b) You may ask us to approve deterioration factors for an engine family based on emission measurements from similar highway, stationary, or nonroad engines (including locomotive engines or other marine engines) if you have already given us these data for certifying the other engines in the same or earlier model years. Use good engineering judgment to decide whether the two engines are similar. We must approve your plan to establish a deterioration factor under this paragraph (b) before you submit your application for certification. We will approve your request if you show us that the emission measurements from other engines reasonably represent in-use deterioration for the engine family for which you have not yet determined deterioration factors.
(c) If you are unable to determine deterioration factors for an engine family under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, first get us to approve a plan for determining deterioration factors based on service accumulation and related testing. We will respond to your proposed plan within 45 days of receiving your request. Your plan must involve measuring emissions from an emission-data engine at least three times, which are evenly spaced over the service-accumulation period unless we specify otherwise, such that the resulting measurements and calculations will represent the deterioration expected from in-use engines over the full useful life. You may use extrapolation to determine deterioration factors once you have established a trend of changing emissions with age for each pollutant. You may use an engine installed in a vessel to accumulate service hours instead of running the engine only in the laboratory. You may perform maintenance on emission-data engines as described in § 1042.125 and 40 CFR part 1065, subpart E.
(d) Include the following information in your application for certification:
(1) If you determine your deterioration factors based on test data from a different engine family, explain why this is appropriate and include all the emission measurements on which you base the deterioration factor.
(2) If you determine your deterioration factors based on engineering analysis, explain why this is appropriate and include a statement that all data, analyses, evaluations, and other information you used are available for our review upon request.
(3) If you do testing to determine deterioration factors, describe the form and extent of service accumulation, including a rationale for selecting the service-accumulation period and the method you use to accumulate hours.
(e) You may alternatively determine and verify deterioration factors based on bench-aged aftertreatment as described in 40 CFR 1036.245 and 1036.246, with the following exceptions:
(1) The minimum required aging as specified in 40 CFR 1036.245(c)(2) is 1,500 hours for Category 1 engines and 3,000 hours for Category 2 engines. Operate the engine for service accumulation using the same sequence of duty cycles that would apply for determining a deterioration factor under paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) Use good engineering judgment to perform verification testing using the procedures of § 1042.515 rather than 40 CFR 1036.555. For PEMS testing, measure emissions as the vessel goes through its normal operation over the course of the day (or shift-day).
(3) Apply infrequent regeneration adjustment factors as specified in § 1042.525 rather than 40 CFR 1036.580.

Recordkeeping and reporting.
(a) Send the Designated Compliance Officer information related to your U.S.-directed production volumes as described in § 1042.345. In addition, within 45 days after the end of the model year, you must send us a report describing information about engines you produced during the model year as follows:
(1) State the total production volume for each engine family that is not subject to reporting under § 1042.345.
(2) State the total production volume for any engine family for which you produce engines after completing the reports required in § 1042.345.

(ii) How you accumulated engine operating hours (service accumulation), including the dates and the number of hours accumulated.
(iii) All maintenance, including modifications, parts changes, and other service, and the dates and reasons for the maintenance.
(iv) All your emission tests, including the date and purpose of each test and documentation of test parameters as specified in part 40 CFR part 1065.
(v) All tests to diagnose engine or emission control performance, giving the date and time of each and the reasons for the test.
(vi) Any other significant events.
(4) Production figures for each engine family divided by assembly plant.
(5) Keep a list of engine identification numbers for all the engines you produce under each certificate of conformity.
(c) Keep required data from emission tests and all other information specified in this section for eight years after we issue your certificate. If you use the same emission data or other information for a later model year, the eight-year period restarts with each year that you continue to rely on the information.
(d) Store these records in any format and on any media, as long as you can promptly send us organized, written records in English if we ask for them. You must keep these records readily available. We may review them at any time.

§ 1042.255
EPA decisions.
(a) If we determine an application is complete and shows that the engine family meets all the requirements of this part and the Clean Air Act, we will issue a certificate of conformity for the engine family for that model year. We may make the approval subject to additional conditions.
(b) We may deny an application for certification if we determine that an engine family fails to comply with emission standards or other requirements of this part or the Clean Air Act. We will base our decision on all available information. If we deny an application, we will explain why in writing.
(c) In addition, we may deny your application or suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity if you do any of the following:
(1) Refuse to comply with any testing or reporting requirements in this part.
(2) Submit false or incomplete information. This includes doing anything after submitting an application that causes submitted information to be false or incomplete.
(3) Cause any test data to become inaccurate.
(4) Deny us from completing authorized activities (see 40 CFR 1068.20). This
includes a failure to provide reasonable assistance.
(5) Produce engines for importation into the United States at a location where local law prohibits us from carrying out authorized activities.
(6) Fail to supply requested information or amend an application to include all engines being produced.
(7) Take any action that otherwise circumvents the intent of the Clean Air Act or this part.
(d) We may void a certificate of conformity if you fail to keep records, send reports, or give us information as required under this part or the Clean Air Act. Note that these are also violations of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(2).
(e) We may void a certificate of conformity if we find that you intentionally submitted false or incomplete information. This includes doing anything after submitting an application that causes submitted information to be false or incomplete after submission.
(f) If we deny an application or suspend, revoke, or void a certificate, you may ask for a hearing (see § 1042.920).

# Subpart D—Testing Production-line Engines
§ 1042.301
General provisions.
(a) If you produce freshly manufactured marine engines that are subject to the requirements of this part, you must test them as described in this subpart.
(b) We may suspend or revoke your certificate of conformity for certain engine families if your production-line engines do not meet the requirements of this part or you do not fulfill your obligations under this subpart (see §§ 1042.325 and 1042.340). Similarly, we may deny applications for certification for the upcoming model year if you do not fulfill your obligations under this subpart (see § 1042.255(c)(1)).
(c) Other regulatory provisions authorize us to suspend, revoke, or void your certificate of conformity, or order recalls for engine families, without regard to whether they have passed production-line testing requirements. The requirements of this subpart do not affect our ability to do selective enforcement audits, as described in 40 CFR part 1068. Individual engines in families that pass production-line testing requirements must also conform to all applicable regulations of this part and 40 CFR part 1068.
(d) You may ask to use another alternate program or measurement method for testing production-line engines. In your request, you must show us that the alternate program gives equal assurance that your engines meet the requirements of this part. We may waive some or all of this subpart's requirements if we approve your alternate program.
(e) If you certify a Category 1 or Category 2 engine family with carryover emission data, as described in § 1042.235(d), you may omit production-line testing if you fulfilled your testing requirements with a related engine family in an earlier year, except as follows:
(1) We may require that you perform additional production-line testing under this subpart in any model year for cause, such as if you file a defect report related to the engine family or if you amend your application for certification in any of the following ways:
(i) You designate a different supplier or change technical specifications for any critical emission-related components.
(ii) You add a new or modified engine configuration such that the test data from the original emission-data engine do not clearly continue to serve as worst-case testing for certification.
(iii) You change your family emission limit without submitting new emission data.
(2) If you certify an engine family with carryover emission data with no production-line testing for more than five model years, we may require that you perform production-line testing again for one of those later model years unless you demonstrate that none of the circumstances identified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section apply for the engine family.
(f) We may ask you to make a reasonable number of production-line engines available for a reasonable time so we can test or inspect them for compliance with the requirements of this
part. For Category 3 engines, you are not required to deliver engines to us, but we may inspect and test your engines at any facility at which they are assembled or installed in vessels.
[88 FR 4661, Jan. 24, 2023]
§ 1042.302
Applicability of this subpart for Category 3 engines.
If you produce Tier 3 or later Category 3 engines that are subject to the requirements of this part, you must test them as described in this subpart, except as specified in this section.
(a) You must test each Category 3 engine at the sea trial of the vessel in which it is installed or within the first 300 hours of operation, whichever occurs first. This may involve testing a fully assembled production engine before it is installed in the vessel. For engines with on-off controls, you may omit testing to demonstrate compliance with Tier 2 standards if the engine does not rely on aftertreatment when Tier 3 emission controls are disabled. Since you must test each engine, the provisions of §§ 1042.310 and 1042.315(b) do not apply for Category 3 engines. If we determine that an engine failure under this subpart is caused by defective components or design deficiencies, we may revoke or suspend your certificate for the engine family as described in § 1042.340. If we determine that an engine failure under this subpart is caused only by incorrect assembly, we may suspend your certificate for the engine family as described in § 1042.325. If the engine fails, you may continue operating only to complete the sea trial and return to port. It is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1) to operate the vessel further until you remedy the cause of failure. Each two-hour period of such operation constitutes a separate offense. A violation lasting less than two hours constitutes a single offense.
(b) You are only required to measure NO
X
emissions. You do not need to measure HC, CO or PM emissions under this subpart.
(c) If you are unable to operate the engine at the test points for the specified duty cycle, you may approximate these points consistent with the specifications of section 6 of Appendix 8 to the NO
X
Technical Code (incorporated by reference in § 1042.910) and show compliance with the alternate installed-engine standard of § 1042.104(g). You must obtain EPA approval of your test procedure prior to testing the engine. Include in your request a description of your basis for concluding that the engine cannot be tested at the actual test points of the specified duty cycle.
(d) You may measure NO
X
emissions at additional test points for the purposes of the continuous NO
X
monitoring requirements of § 1042.110(d). If you do, you must report these values along with your other test results. Describe in your application for certification how you plan to use these values for continuous NO
X
monitoring.
(e) You may ask to measure emissions according to the Direct Measurement and Monitoring method specified in section 6.4 of the NO
X
Technical Code (incorporated by reference in § 1042.910).
[75 FR 23003, Apr. 30, 2010, as amended at 81 FR 74149, Oct. 25, 2016; 86 FR 34510, June 29, 2021; 88 FR 4662, Jan. 24, 2023]
§ 1042.305
Preparing and testing production-line engines.
This section describes how to prepare and test production-line engines. You must assemble the test engine in a way that represents the assembly procedures for other engines in the engine family. You must ask us to approve any deviations from your normal assembly procedures for other production engines in the engine family.
(a)
Test procedures.
Test your production-line engines using the applicable testing procedures in subpart F of this part to show you meet the duty-cycle emission standards in subpart B of this part. For Category 1 and Category 2 engines, the not-to-exceed standards apply for this testing of Category 1 and Category 2 engines, but you need not do additional testing to show that production-line engines meet the not-to-exceed standards. The mode cap standards apply for testing Category 3 engines subject to Tier 3 standards (or for engines subject to the Annex VI Tier III NOx standards under § 1042.650(d)).
(b)
Modifying a test engine.
Once an engine is selected for testing (see
§ 1042.310), you may adjust, repair, prepare, or modify it or check its emissions only if one of the following is true:
(1) You document the need for doing so in your procedures for assembling and inspecting all your production engines and make the action routine for all the engines in the engine family.
(2) This subpart otherwise specifically allows your action.
(3) We approve your action in advance.
(c)
Engine malfunction.
If an engine malfunction prevents further emission testing, ask us to approve your decision to either repair the engine or delete it from the test sequence.
(d)
Setting adjustable parameters.
Before any test, we may require you to adjust any adjustable parameter on a Category 1 engine to any setting within its physically adjustable range. We may adjust or require you to adjust any adjustable parameter on a Category 2 or Category 3 engine to any setting within its specified adjustable range.
(1) We may require you to adjust idle speed outside the physically adjustable range as needed, but only until the engine has stabilized emission levels (see paragraph (e) of this section). We may ask you for information needed to establish an alternate minimum idle speed.
(2) We may specify adjustments within the physically adjustable range or the specified adjustable range by considering their effect on emission levels. We may also consider how likely it is that someone will make such an adjustment with in-use engines.
(e)
Stabilizing emission levels.
You may stabilize emission levels (or establish a Green Engine Factor for Category 2 engines) before you test production-line engines, as follows:
(1) You may stabilize emission levels by operating the engine in a way that represents the way production engines will be used, using good engineering judgment, for no more than the greater of two periods:
(i) 300 hours.
(ii) The number of hours you operated your emission-data engine for certifying the engine family (see 40 CFR part 1065, subpart E, or the applicable regulations governing how you should prepare your test engine).
(2) For Category 2 or Category 3 engines, you may ask us to approve a Green Engine Factor for each regulated pollutant for each engine family. Use the Green Engine Factor to adjust measured emission levels to establish a stabilized low-hour emission level.
(f)
Damage during shipment.
If shipping an engine to a remote facility for production-line testing makes necessary an adjustment or repair, you must wait until after the initial emission test to do this work. We may waive this requirement if the test would be impossible or unsafe, or if it would permanently damage the engine. Report to us in your written report under § 1042.345 all adjustments or repairs you make on test engines before each test.
(g)
Retesting after invalid tests.
You may retest an engine if you determine an emission test is invalid under subpart F of this part. Explain in your written report reasons for invalidating any test and the emission results from all tests. If we determine that you improperly invalidated a test, we may require you to ask for our approval for future testing before substituting results of the new tests for invalid ones.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23004, Apr. 30, 2010; 88 FR 4662, Jan. 24, 2023]
§ 1042.310
Engine selection for Category 1 and Category 2 engines.
(a) For Category 1 and Category 2 engine families, the minimum sample size is one engine. You may ask us to approve treating commercial and recreational engines as being from the same engine family for purposes of production-line testing if you certify them using the same emission-data engine.
(b) Select engines for testing as follows:
(1) For Category 1 engines, randomly select one engine within the first 60 days of the start of production for each engine family.
(2) For Category 2 engines, randomly select one engine within 60 days after you produce the fifth engine from an engine family (or from successive families that are related based on your use of carryover data under § 1042.230(d)).
(3) If you do not produce an engine from the engine family in the specified time frame, test the next engine you produce.
(4) Test engines promptly after selecting them. You may preferentially select and test engines earlier than we specify.
(5) You meet the requirement to randomly select engines under this section if you assemble the engine in a way that fully represents your normal production and quality procedures.
(c) For each engine that fails to meet emission standards, select two engines from the same engine family from the next fifteen engines produced or within seven days, whichever is later. If you do not produce fifteen additional engines within 90 days, select two additional engines within 90 days or as soon as practicable. Test engines promptly after selecting them. If an engine fails to meet emission standards for any pollutant, count it as a failing engine under this paragraph (c).
(d) Continue testing until one of the following things happens:
(1) You test the number of engines required under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. For example, if the initial engine fails and then two engines pass, testing is complete for that engine family.
(2) The engine family does not comply according to § 1042.315 or you choose to declare that the engine family does not comply with the requirements of this subpart.
(e) You may elect to test more randomly chosen engines than we require under this section.
[88 FR 4662, Jan. 24, 2023]
§ 1042.315
Determining compliance.
This section describes the pass-fail criteria for the production-line testing requirements. We apply these criteria on an engine-family basis. See § 1042.320 for the requirements that apply to individual engines that fail a production-line test.
(a) Calculate your test results as follows:
(1)
Initial and final test results.
Calculate and round the test results for each engine. If you do multiple tests on an engine in a given configuration (without modifying the engine), calculate the initial results for each test, then add all the test results together and divide by the number of tests. Round this final calculated value for the final test results on that engine. Include the Green Engine Factor to determine low-hour emission results, if applicable.
(2)
Final deteriorated test results.
Apply the deterioration factor for the engine family to the final test results (
see
§ 1042.240(c)).
(3)
Round deteriorated test results.
Round the results to the number of decimal places in the emission standard expressed to one more decimal place.
(b) For Category 1 and Category 2 engines, if a production-line engine fails to meet emission standards and you test additional engines as described in § 1042.310, calculate the average emission level for each pollutant for all the engines. If the calculated average emission level for any pollutant exceeds the applicable emission standard, the engine family fails the production-line testing requirements of this subpart. Tell us within ten working days if an engine fails. You may request to amend the application for certification to raise the FEL of the engine family as described in § 1042.225(f).
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23004, Apr. 30, 2010; 88 FR 4662, Jan. 24, 2023]
§ 1042.320
What happens if one of my production-line engines fails to meet emission standards?
(a) If you have a production-line engine with final deteriorated test results exceeding one or more emission standards (see § 1042.315(a)), the certificate of conformity is automatically suspended for that failing engine. You must take the following actions before your certificate of conformity can cover that engine:
(1) Correct the problem and retest the engine to show it complies with all emission standards.
(2) Include the test results and describe the remedy for each engine in the written report required under § 1042.345.
(b) You may request to amend the application for certification to raise the
FEL of the entire engine family at this point (see § 1042.225).
(c) Use test data from a failing engine for the compliance demonstration under § 1042.315 as follows:
(1) Use the original, failing test results as described in § 1042.315, whether or not you modify the engine or destroy it. However, for catalyst-equipped engines, you may ask us to allow you to exclude an initial failed test if all the following are true:
(i) The catalyst was in a green condition when tested initially.
(ii) The engine met all emission standards when retested after degreening the catalyst.
(iii) No additional emission-related maintenance or repair was performed between the initial failed test and the subsequent passing test.
(2) Do not use test results from a modified engine as final test results under § 1042.315, unless you change your production process for all engines to match the adjustments you made to the failing engine. If you change production processes and use the test results from a modified engine, count the modified engine as the next engine in the sequence, rather than averaging the results with the testing that occurred before modifying the engine.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23004, Apr. 30, 2010; 88 FR 4662, Jan. 24, 2023]
§ 1042.325
What happens if an engine family fails the production-line testing requirements?
(a) We may suspend your certificate of conformity for an engine family if it fails under § 1042.315. The suspension may apply to all facilities producing engines from an engine family, even if you find noncompliant engines only at one facility.
(b) We will tell you in writing if we suspend your certificate in whole or in part. We will not suspend a certificate until at least 15 days after the engine family fails as described in § 1042.315(b). The suspension is effective when you receive our notice.
(c) Up to 15 days after we suspend the certificate for an engine family, you may ask for a hearing (see § 1042.920). If we agree before a hearing occurs that we used erroneous information in deciding to suspend the certificate, we will reinstate the certificate.
(d) Section 1042.335 specifies steps you must take to remedy the cause of the engine family's production-line failure. All the engines you have produced since the end of the last test period are presumed noncompliant and should be addressed in your proposed remedy. We may require you to apply the remedy to engines produced earlier if we determine that the cause of the failure is likely to have affected the earlier engines.
(e) You may request to amend the application for certification to raise the FEL of the entire engine family before or after we suspend your certificate as described in § 1042.225(f). We will approve your request if the failure is not caused by a defect and it is clear that you used good engineering judgment in establishing the original FEL.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23004, Apr. 30, 2010; 88 FR 4662, Jan. 24, 2023]
§ 1042.330
Selling engines from an engine family with a suspended certificate of conformity.
You may sell engines that you produce after we suspend the engine family's certificate of conformity under § 1042.315 only if one of the following occurs:
(a) You test each engine you produce and show it complies with emission standards that apply.
(b) We conditionally reinstate the certificate for the engine family. We may do so if you agree to recall all the affected engines and remedy any noncompliance at no expense to the owner if later testing shows that the engine family still does not comply.
§ 1042.335
Reinstating suspended certificates.
(a) Send us a written report asking us to reinstate your suspended certificate. In your report, identify the reason for noncompliance, propose a remedy for the engine family, and commit to a date for carrying it out. In your proposed remedy include any quality control measures you propose to keep the problem from happening again.
(b) Give us data from production-line testing that shows the remedied engine
family complies with all the emission standards that apply.
§ 1042.340
When may EPA revoke my certificate under this subpart and how may I sell these engines again?
(a) We may revoke your certificate for an engine family in the following cases:
(1) You do not meet the reporting requirements.
(2) Your engine family fails to comply with the requirements of this subpart and your proposed remedy to address a suspended certificate under § 1042.325 is inadequate to solve the problem or requires you to change the engine's design or emission control system.
(b) To sell engines from an engine family with a revoked certificate of conformity, you must modify the engine family and then show it complies with the requirements of this part.
(1) If we determine your proposed design change may not control emissions for the engine's full useful life, we will tell you within five working days after receiving your report. In this case we will decide whether production-line testing will be enough for us to evaluate the change or whether you need to do more testing.
(2) Unless we require more testing, you may show compliance by testing production-line engines as described in this subpart.
(3) We will issue a new or updated certificate of conformity when you have met these requirements.
§ 1042.345
Reporting.
(a) Send us a test report within 45 days after you complete production-line testing for a Category 1 or Category 2 engine family, and within 45 days after you finish testing each Category 3 engine. We may approve a later submission for Category 3 engines if it allows you to combine test reports for multiple engines.
(b) Include the following information in the report:
(1) Describe any facility used to test production-line engines and state its location.
(2) For Category 1 and Category 2 engines, describe how you randomly selected engines.
(3) Describe each test engine, including the engine family's identification and the engine's model year, build date, model number, identification number, and number of hours of operation before testing. Also describe how you developed and applied the Green Engine Factor, if applicable.
(4) Identify how you accumulated hours of operation on the engines and describe the procedure and schedule you used.
(5) Provide the test number; the date, time and duration of testing; test procedure; all initial test results; final test results; and final deteriorated test results for all tests. Provide the emission results for all measured pollutants. Include information for both valid and invalid tests and the reason for any invalidation.
(6) Describe completely and justify any nonroutine adjustment, modification, repair, preparation, maintenance, or test for the test engine if you did not report it separately under this subpart. Include the results of any emission measurements, regardless of the procedure or type of engine.
(c) We may ask you to add information to your written report so we can determine whether your new engines conform with the requirements of this subpart. We may also ask you to send less information.
(d) An authorized representative of your company must sign the following statement:
We submit this report under sections 208 and 213 of the Clean Air Act. Our production-line testing conformed completely with the requirements of 40 CFR part 1042. We have not changed production processes or quality-control procedures for test engines in a way that might affect emission controls. All the information in this report is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge. I know of the penalties for violating the Clean Air Act and the regulations. (Authorized Company Representative)
(e) Send electronic reports of production-line testing to the Designated Compliance Officer using an approved information format. If you want to use a different format, send us a written request with justification for a waiver. You may combine reports from multiple engines and engine families into a single report.
(f) We will send copies of your reports to anyone from the public who asks for them. See § 1042.915 for information on how we treat information you consider confidential.
[88 FR 4663, Jan. 24, 2023]
§ 1042.350
Recordkeeping.
(a) Organize and maintain your records as described in this section. We may review your records at any time.
(b) Keep paper or electronic records of your production-line testing for eight years after you complete all the testing required for an engine family in a model year.
(c) Keep a copy of the written reports described in § 1042.345.
(d) Keep the following additional records:
(1) A description of all test equipment for each test cell that you can use to test production-line engines.
(2) The names of supervisors involved in each test.
(3) The name of anyone who authorizes adjusting, repairing, preparing, or modifying a test engine and the names of all supervisors who oversee this work.
(4) If you shipped the engine for testing, the date you shipped it, the associated storage or port facility, and the date the engine arrived at the testing facility.
(5) Any records related to your production-line tests that are not in the written report.
(6) A brief description of any significant events during testing not otherwise described in the written report or in this section.
(7) Any information specified in § 1042.345 that you do not include in your written reports.
(e) If we ask, you must give us a more detailed description of projected or actual production figures for an engine family. We may ask you to divide your production figures by maximum engine power, displacement, fuel type, or assembly plant (if you produce engines at more than one plant).
(f) Keep records of the engine identification number for each engine you produce under each certificate of conformity. You may identify these numbers as a range. Give us these records within 30 days if we ask for them.
(g) We may ask you to keep or send other information necessary to implement this subpart.

# Subpart E—In-use Testing
§ 1042.401
General Provisions.
We may perform in-use testing of any engine subject to the standards of this part.

# Subpart F—Test Procedures
§ 1042.501
How do I run a valid emission test?
(a) Use the equipment and procedures for compression-ignition engines in 40 CFR part 1065 to determine whether engines meet the duty-cycle emission standards in §§ 1042.101 or 1042.104. Measure the emissions of all regulated pollutants as specified in 40 CFR part 1065. Use the applicable duty cycles specified in § 1042.505. The following exceptions from the 40 CFR part 1065 procedures apply:
(1) If you perform discrete-mode testing and use only one batch fuel measurement to determine your mean raw exhaust flow rate, you must target a constant sample flow rate over the mode. Verify proportional sampling as described in 40 CFR 1065.545 using the mean raw exhaust molar flow rate paired with each recorded sample flow rate.
(2) If you perform discrete-mode testing, you may verify proportional sampling over the whole duty cycle instead of verifying proportional sampling for each discrete mode.
(b) Section 1042.515 describes the supplemental test procedures for evaluating whether engines meet the not-to-exceed emission standards in § 1042.101(c).
(c) Use the fuels and lubricants specified in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart H, for all the testing we require in this part, except as specified in this section and § 1042.515.
(1) For service accumulation, use the test fuel or any commercially available fuel that is representative of the fuel that in-use engines will use.
(2) For diesel-fueled engines, use the appropriate diesel fuel specified in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart H, for emission testing. Unless we specify otherwise, the appropriate diesel test fuel for Category 1 and Category 2 engines is the ultra low-sulfur diesel fuel. If we allow you to use a test fuel with higher sulfur levels, identify the test fuel in your application for certification. Unless we specify otherwise, the appropriate diesel test fuel for Category 3 engines is the high-sulfur diesel fuel. For Category 2 and Category 3 engines, you may ask to use commercially available diesel fuel similar but not necessarily identical to the applicable fuel specified in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart H; we will approve your request if you show us that it does not affect your ability to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission standards.
(3) For Category 1 and Category 2 engines that are expected to use a type of fuel (or mixed fuel) other than diesel fuel (such as natural gas, methanol, or residual fuel), use a commercially available fuel of that type for emission testing. If a given engine is designed to operate on different fuels, we may (at our discretion) require testing on each fuel. Propose test fuel specifications that take into account the engine design and the properties of commercially available fuels. Describe these test fuel specifications in the application for certification.
(d) Adjust measured emissions to account for aftertreatment technology with infrequent regeneration as described in § 1042.525.
(e) Duty-cycle testing is limited to atmospheric pressures between 91.000 and 103.325 kPa.
(f) You may use special or alternate procedures to the extent we allow them under 40 CFR 1065.10.
(g) For Category 3 engines, instead of test data collected as specified in 40 CFR part 1065, you may submit test data for NO
X
, HC, and CO emissions that were collected as specified in the NO
X
Technical Code (incorporated by reference in § 1042.910). For example, this allowance includes the allowance to perform the testing using test fuels allowed under the NO
X
Technical Code that do not meet the sulfur specifications of this section. We may require you to include a brief engineering analysis showing how these data demonstrate that your engines would meet the applicable emission standards if you had used the test procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065.
(h) This subpart is addressed to you as a manufacturer, but it applies equally to anyone who does testing for you, and to us when we perform testing to determine if your engines meet emission standards.

§ 1042.505
Testing engines using discrete-mode or ramped-modal duty cycles.
This section describes how to test engines under steady-state conditions. In some cases, we allow you to choose the appropriate steady-state duty cycle for an engine; you may also choose between discrete-mode and ramped-modal testing. In all cases, you must use the duty cycle you select in your application for certification for all testing you perform for that engine family. If we test your engines to confirm that they meet emission standards, we will use the duty cycles you select for your own testing. If you submit certification test data using more than one duty cycle, any of the selected duty cycles may be used for any subsequent testing. We may also perform other testing as allowed by the Clean Air Act.
(a) You may perform steady-state testing with either discrete-mode or ramped-modal cycles as described in 40 CFR Part 1065.
(b) Measure emissions by testing the engine on a dynamometer with the following duty cycles (as specified) to determine whether it meets the emission standards in § 1042.101 or § 1042.104:
(1)
General cycle.
Use the 4-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in paragraph (a) of Appendix II of this part for commercial propulsion marine engines that are used with (or intended to be used with) fixed-pitch propellers, propeller-law auxiliary engines, and any other engines for which the other duty cycles of this section do not apply. Use this duty cycle also for commercial variable-speed propulsion marine engines that
are used with (or intended to be used with) controllable-pitch propellers or with electrically coupled propellers, unless these engines are not intended for sustained operation (e.g., for at least 30 minutes) at all four modes when installed in the vessel.
(2)
Duty cycle for engines with high power density.
Except as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, use the 5-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in paragraph (b) of Appendix II of this part for light-commercial engines and recreational marine engines with maximum engine power at or above 37 kW. You may also use this duty cycle for other commercial engines instead of the duty cycle specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the power density for every configuration in an engine family is above 30.0 kW/liter.
(3)
Controllable-pitch and electrically coupled propellers.
Use the 4-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in paragraph (c) of Appendix II of this part for constant-speed propulsion marine engines that are used with (or intended to be used with) controllable-pitch propellers or with electrically coupled propellers. Use this duty cycle also for variable-speed propulsion marine engines that are used with (or intended to be used with) controllable-pitch propellers or with electrically coupled propellers if the duty cycles in paragraph (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section do not apply.
(4)
Constant-speed auxiliary engines.
Use the 5-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in 40 CFR Part 1039, Appendix II, paragraph (a) for constant-speed auxiliary engines.
(5)
Variable-speed auxiliary engines.
(i) Use the duty cycle specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for propeller-law auxiliary engines.
(ii) Use the 6-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in 40 CFR Part 1039, Appendix II, paragraph (b) for variable-speed auxiliary engines with maximum engine power below 19 kW that are not propeller-law engines.
(iii) Use the 8-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in 40 CFR part 1039, Appendix II, paragraph (c) for variable-speed auxiliary engines with maximum engine power at or above 19 kW that are not propeller-law engines.
(c) For constant-speed engines whose design prevents full-load operation for extended periods, you may ask for approval under 40 CFR 1065.10(c) to replace full-load operation with the maximum load for which the engine is designed to operate for extended periods.
[79 FR 23751, Apr. 28, 2014, as amended at 81 FR 74149, Oct. 25, 2016; 85 FR 62232, Oct. 2, 2020]
§ 1042.515
Test procedures related to not-to-exceed standards.
(a) This section describes the procedures to determine whether your engines meet the not-to-exceed emission standards in § 1042.101(c). These procedures may include any normal engine operation and ambient conditions that the engines may experience in use. Paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section define the limits of what we will consider normal engine operation and ambient conditions.
(b) Measure emissions with one of the following procedures:
(1) Remove the selected engines for testing in a laboratory. You may use an engine dynamometer to simulate normal operation, as described in this section. Use the equipment and procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065 to conduct laboratory testing.
(2) Test the selected engines while they remain installed in a vessel. Use the equipment and procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065 subpart J, to conduct field testing. Use fuel meeting the specifications of 40 CFR part 1065, subpart H, or a fuel typical of what you would expect the engine to use in service.
(c) Engine testing may occur under the following ranges of ambient conditions without correcting measured emission levels:
(1) Atmospheric pressure must be between 96.000 and 103.325 kPa, except that manufacturers may test at lower atmospheric pressures if their test facility is located at an altitude that makes it impractical to stay within this range. This pressure range is intended to allow testing under most weather conditions at all altitudes up to 1,100 feet above sea level.
(2) Ambient air temperature must be between 13 and 35 °C (or between 13 °C and 30 °C for engines not drawing intake air directly from a space that could be heated by the engine).
(3) Ambient water temperature must be between 5 and 27 °C.
(4) Ambient humidity must be between 7.1 and 10.7 grams of moisture per kilogram of dry air.
(d) Engine testing may occur at any conditions expected during normal operation but that are outside the conditions described in paragraph (c) of this section, as long as measured values are corrected to be equivalent to the nearest end of the specified range, using good engineering judgment. Correct NO
X
emissions for humidity as specified in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart G.
(e) The sampling period may not begin until the engine has reached stable operating temperatures. For example, this would include only engine operation after starting and after the engine thermostat starts modulating the engine's coolant temperature. The sampling period may not include engine starting.
(f) Apply the NTE standards specified in § 1042.101(c) to an engine family based on the zones and subzones corresponding to specific duty cycles and engine types as defined in Appendix III of this part. For an engine family certified to multiple duty cycles, the broadest applicable NTE zone applies for that family at the time of certification. Whenever an engine family is certified to multiple duty cycles and a specific engine from that family is tested for NTE compliance in use, determine the applicable NTE zone for that engine according to its in-use application. An engine family's NTE zone may be modified as follows:
(1) You may ask us to approve a narrower NTE zone for an engine family at the time of certification, based on information such as how that engine family is expected to normally operate in use. For example, if an engine family is always coupled to a pump or jet drive, the engine might be able to operate only within a narrow range of engine speed and power.
(2) You may ask us to approve a Limited Testing Region (LTR). An LTR is a region of engine operation, within the applicable NTE zone, where you have demonstrated that your engine family operates for no more than 5.0 percent of its normal in-use operation, on a time-weighted basis. You must specify an LTR using boundaries based on engine speed and power (or torque), where the LTR boundaries must coincide with some portion of the boundary defining the overall NTE zone. Any emission data collected within an LTR for a time duration that exceeds 5.0 percent of the duration of its respective NTE sampling period will be excluded when determining compliance with the applicable NTE standards. Any emission data collected within an LTR for a time duration of 5.0 percent or less of the duration of the respective NTE sampling period will be included when determining compliance with the NTE standards.
(3) You must notify us if you design your engines for normal in-use operation outside the applicable NTE zone. If we learn that normal in-use operation for your engines includes other speeds and loads, we may specify a broader NTE zone, as long as the modified zone is limited to normal in-use operation for speeds greater than 70 percent of maximum test speed and loads greater than 30 percent of maximum power at maximum test speed (or 30 percent of maximum test torque for constant-speed engines).
(4) You may exclude emission data based on catalytic aftertreatment temperatures as follows:
(i) For an engine equipped with a catalytic NO
X
aftertreatment system, exclude NO
X
emission data that is collected when the exhaust temperature at any time during the NTE event is less than 250 °C.
(ii) For an engine equipped with an oxidizing catalytic aftertreatment system, exclude HC and CO emission data that is collected when the exhaust temperature at any time during the NTE event is less than 250 °C. Similarly, exclude PM emission data during operation involving exhaust temperature below 250 °C for an engine equipped with an oxidizing flow-through catalyst.
(iii) Measure exhaust temperature within 30 cm downstream of the last
applicable catalytic aftertreatment device. Where there are parallel paths, use good engineering judgment to measure the temperature within 30 cm downstream of the last applicable catalytic aftertreatment device in the path with the greatest exhaust flow.
(g) Emission sampling is not valid for NTE testing if it includes any active regeneration, unless the emission averaging period includes the complete regeneration event(s) and the full period of engine operation until the start of the next regeneration event. This provision applies only for engines that send an electronic signal indicating the start of the regeneration event.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 81 FR 74149, Oct. 25, 2016; 88 FR 4663, Jan. 24, 2023]
§ 1042.520
What testing must I perform to establish deterioration factors?
Sections 1042.240 and 1042.245 describe the required methods for testing to establish deterioration factors for an engine family.
§ 1042.525
How do I adjust emission levels to account for infrequently regenerating aftertreatment devices?
For engines using aftertreatment technology with infrequent regeneration events that may occur during testing, take one of the following approaches to account for the emission impact of regeneration, or use an alternate methodology that we approve for Category 3 engines:
(a) You may use the calculation methodology described in 40 CFR 1065.680 to adjust measured emission results. Do this by developing an upward adjustment factor and a downward adjustment factor for each pollutant based on measured emission data and observed regeneration frequency as follows:
(1) Adjustment factors should generally apply to an entire engine family, but you may develop separate adjustment factors for different configurations within an engine family. Use the adjustment factors from this section in all testing for the engine family.
(2) You may use carryover or carry-across data to establish adjustment factors for an engine family as described in § 1042.235, consistent with good engineering judgment.
(3) Determine the frequency of regeneration,
F,
as described in 40 CFR 1065.680 from in-use operating data or from running repetitive tests in a laboratory. If the engine is designed for regeneration at fixed time intervals, you may apply good engineering judgment to determine
F
based on those design parameters.
(4) Identify the value of
F
in each application for certification for which it applies.
(b) You may ask us to approve an alternate methodology to account for regeneration events. We will generally limit approval to cases where your engines use aftertreatment technology with extremely infrequent regeneration and you are unable to apply the provisions of this section.
(c) You may choose to make no adjustments to measured emission results if you determine that regeneration does not significantly affect emission levels for an engine family (or configuration) or if it is not practical to identify when regeneration occurs. If you choose not to make adjustments under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, your engines must meet emission standards for all testing, without regard to regeneration.
[81 FR 74150, Oct. 25, 2016]

# Subpart G—Special Compliance Provisions
§ 1042.601
General compliance provisions for marine engines and vessels.
Engine and vessel manufacturers, as well as owners, operators, and rebuilders of engines and vessels subject to the requirements of this part, and all other persons, must observe the provisions of this part, the requirements and prohibitions in 40 CFR part 1068, and the provisions of the Clean Air Act. The provisions of 40 CFR part 1068 apply for compression-ignition marine engines as specified in that part, subject to the following provisions:
(a) The following prohibitions apply with respect to recreational marine engines and recreational vessels:
(1) Installing a recreational marine engine in a vessel that is not a recreational vessel is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1).
(2) For a vessel with an engine that is certified and labeled as a recreational marine engine, using it in a manner inconsistent with its intended use as a recreational vessel violates 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1), except as allowed by this chapter.
(b) Subpart I of this part describes how the prohibitions of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) apply for certain remanufactured engines. The provisions of 40 CFR 1068.105 do not allow the installation of a new remanufactured engine in a vessel that is defined as a new vessel unless the remanufactured engine is subject to the same standards as the standards applicable to freshly manufactured engines of the required model year.
(c) The provisions of 40 CFR 1068.120 apply when rebuilding marine engines, except as specified in subpart I of this part. The following additional requirements also apply when rebuilding marine engines equipped with exhaust aftertreatment:
(1) Follow all instructions from the engine manufacturer and aftertreatment manufacturer for checking, repairing, and replacing aftertreatment components. For example, you must replace the catalyst if the catalyst assembly is stamped with a build date more than ten years ago and the manufacturer's instructions state that catalysts over ten years old must be replaced when the engine is rebuilt.
(2) Measure pressure drop across the catalyst assembly to ensure that it is neither higher nor lower than the manufacturer's specifications and repair or replace exhaust-system components as needed to bring the pressure drop within the manufacturer's specifications.
(3) For engines equipped with exhaust sensors, verify that sensor outputs are within the manufacturer's recommended range and repair or replace any malfunctioning components (sensors, catalysts, or other components).
(d) The provisions of § 1042.635 for the national security exemption apply in addition to the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.225.
(e) For replacement engines, apply the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.240 as described in § 1042.615.
(f) For the purpose of meeting the defect-reporting requirements in 40 CFR 1068.501, if you manufacture other nonroad engines that are substantially similar to your marine engines, you may consider defects using combined marine and non-marine families.
(g) The selective enforcement audit provisions of 40 CFR part 1068 do not apply for Category 3 engines.
(h) The defect reporting requirements of 40 CFR 1068.501 apply for Category 3 engines, except the threshold for filing a defect report is two engines.
(i) You may not circumvent the requirements of this part or the Clean Air Act by manufacturing a vessel outside the United States or initially flagging a vessel in another country. The definition of “new marine engine” in § 1042.901 includes provisions for U.S.-flagged vessels that are manufactured or reflagged outside of U.S. waters. These provisions have the effect of applying the prohibitions of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) to such vessels no later than when they first enter U.S. waters. The inclusion of these provisions does not affect requirements or prohibitions of the Clean Air Act or other statutes that may apply to the vessel before it first enters U.S. waters.
(j) Subpart C of this part describes how to test and certify dual-fuel and flexible-fuel engines. Some multi-fuel engines may not fit either of those defined terms. For such engines, we will determine whether it is most appropriate to treat them as single-fuel engines, dual-fuel engines, or flexible-fuel engines based on the range of possible and expected fuel mixtures. For example, an engine might burn natural gas but initiate combustion with a pilot injection of diesel fuel. If the engine is designed to operate with a single fueling algorithm (
i.e.,
fueling rates are fixed at a given engine speed and load condition), we would generally treat it as a single-fuel engine. In this context, the combination of diesel fuel and natural gas would be its own fuel type. If the engine is designed to also operate on diesel fuel alone, we would generally treat it as a dual-fuel engine. If the engine is designed to operate on varying
mixtures of the two fuels, we would generally treat it as a flexible-fuel engine. To the extent that requirements vary for the different fuels or fuel mixtures, we may apply the more stringent requirements.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 73 FR 59194, Oct. 8, 2008; 75 FR 23005, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74150, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1042.605
Dressing engines already certified to other standards for nonroad or heavy-duty highway engines for marine use.
(a)
General provisions.
If you are an engine manufacturer (including someone who marinizes a land-based engine), this section allows you to introduce new marine engines into U.S. commerce if they are already certified to the requirements that apply to compression-ignition engines under 40 CFR parts 85 and 86 or 40 CFR part 1033 or 1039 for the appropriate model year. If you comply with all the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86, 1033, or 1039 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the requirements of this part. This section does not apply for Category 3 engines.
(b)
Vessel-manufacturer provisions.
If you are not an engine manufacturer, you may install an engine certified for the appropriate model year under 40 CFR part 86, 1033, or 1039 in a marine vessel as long as you do not make any of the changes described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section and you meet the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. If you modify the non-marine engine in any of the ways described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, we will consider you a manufacturer of a new marine engine. Such engine modifications prevent you from using the provisions of this section.
(c)
Liability.
Engines for which you meet the requirements of this section are exempt from all the requirements and prohibitions of this part, except for those specified in this section. Engines exempted under this section must meet all the applicable requirements from 40 CFR parts 85 and 86 or 40 CFR part 1033 or 1039. This paragraph (c) applies to engine manufacturers, vessel manufacturers that use such an engine, and all other persons as if the engine were used in its originally intended application. The prohibited acts of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) apply to these new engines and vessels; however, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86, 1033, or 1039 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part for its model year. If we make a determination that these engines do not conform to the regulations in this chapter during their useful life, we may require you to recall them under 40 CFR part 85 or 1068.
(d)
Specific criteria and requirements.
If you are an engine manufacturer and meet all the following criteria and requirements regarding your new marine engine, the engine is eligible for an exemption under this section:
(1) You must produce it by marinizing an engine covered by a valid certificate of conformity from one of the following programs:
(i) Heavy-duty highway engines (40 CFR part 86).
(ii) Land-based compression-ignition nonroad engines (40 CFR part 1039).
(iii) Locomotives (40 CFR part 92 or 1033). To be eligible for dressing under this section, the engine must be from a locomotive certified to standards that are at least as stringent as either the standards applicable to new marine engines or freshly manufactured locomotives in the model year that the engine is being dressed.
(2) The engine must have the label required under 40 CFR part 86, 1033, or 1039.
(3) You must not make any changes to the certified engine that could reasonably be expected to increase its emissions. For example, if you make any of the following changes to one of these engines, you do not qualify for the engine dressing exemption:
(i) Change any fuel system parameters from the certified configuration, or change, remove, or fail to properly install any other component, element of design, or calibration specified in the engine manufacturer's application for certification. This includes aftertreatment devices and all related components.
(ii) Replacing an original turbocharger, except that small-volume engine manufacturers may replace an original turbocharger on a recreational engine with one that matches the performance of the original turbocharger.
(iii) Modify or design the marine engine cooling or aftercooling system so that temperatures or heat rejection rates are outside the original engine manufacturer's specified ranges.
(4) You must show that fewer than 10 percent of the engine family's total sales in the United States are used in marine applications. This includes engines used in any application, without regard to which company manufactures the vessel or equipment. Show this as follows:
(i) If you are the original manufacturer of the engine, base this showing on your sales information.
(ii) In all other cases, you must confirm this based on your best estimate of the original manufacturer's sales information.
(e)
Labeling and documentation.
If you are an engine manufacturer or vessel manufacturer using this exemption, you must do all of the following:
(1) Make sure the original engine label will remain clearly visible after installation in the vessel.
(2) Add a permanent supplemental label to the engine in a position where it will remain clearly visible after installation in the vessel. In your engine label, do the following:
(i) Include the heading: “Marine Engine Emission Control Information”.
(ii) Include your full corporate name and trademark.
(iii) State: “This engine was marinized without affecting its emission controls.”.
(iv) State the date you finished marinizing the engine (month and year).
(3) Send the Designated Compliance Officer written notification describing your plans before using the provisions of this section. In addition, by February 28 of each calendar year (or less often if we tell you), send the Designated Compliance Officer a signed letter with all the following information:
(i) Identify your full corporate name, address, and telephone number.
(ii) List the engine models for which you used this exemption in the previous year and describe your basis for meeting the sales restrictions of paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(iii) State: “We prepared each listed engine model for marine application without making any changes that could increase its certified emission levels, as described in 40 CFR 1042.605.”
(f)
Failure to comply.
If your engines do not meet the criteria listed in paragraph (d) of this section, they will be subject to the standards, requirements, and prohibitions of this part and the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 86, 1033, or 1039 will not be deemed to also be a certificate issued under this part. Introducing these engines into U.S. commerce as marine engines without a valid exemption or certificate of conformity under this part violates the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1).
(g)
Data submission.
(1) If you are both the original manufacturer and marinizer of an exempted engine, you must send us emission test data on the appropriate marine duty cycles. You can include the data in your application for certification or in the letter described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(2) If you are the original manufacturer of an exempted engine that is marinized by a post-manufacture marinizer, you may be required to send us emission test data on the appropriate marine duty cycles. If such data are requested you will be allowed a reasonable amount of time to collect the data.
(h)
Participation in averaging, banking and trading.
Engines adapted for marine use under this section may not generate or use emission credits under this part. These engines may generate credits under the ABT provisions in 40 CFR part 86, 1033, or 1039, as applicable. These engines must use emission credits under 40 CFR part 86, 1033, or 1039 as applicable if they are certified to an FEL that exceeds an emission standard.
(i)
Operator requirements.
The requirements specified for vessel manufacturers, owners, and operators in this subpart (including requirements in 40 CFR part 1068) apply to these engines whether they are certified under this
part 1042 or another part as allowed by this section.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23005, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74150, Oct. 25, 2016; 86 FR 34510, June 29, 2021]
§ 1042.610
Certifying auxiliary marine engines to land-based standards.
This section applies to auxiliary marine engines that are identical to certified land-based engines.
See
§ 1042.605 for provisions that apply to propulsion marine engines or auxiliary marine engines that are modified for marine applications. This section does not apply for Category 3 engines.
(a)
General provisions.
If you are an engine manufacturer, this section allows you to introduce new marine engines into U.S. commerce if they are already certified to the requirements that apply to compression-ignition engines under 40 CFR part 1039 for the appropriate model year. If you comply with all the provisions of this section, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 1039 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part for its model year, without a separate application for certification under the requirements of this part.
(b)
Vessel-manufacturer provisions.
If you are not an engine manufacturer, you may install an engine certified for land-based applications in a marine vessel as long as you meet all the qualifying criteria and requirements specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. If you modify the non-marine engine, we will consider you a manufacturer of a new marine engine. Such engine modifications prevent you from using the provisions of this section.
(c)
Liability.
Engines for which you meet the requirements of this section are exempt from all the requirements and prohibitions of this part, except for those specified in this section. Engines exempted under this section must meet all the applicable requirements from 40 CFR part 1039. This paragraph (c) applies to engine manufacturers, vessel manufacturers that use such an engine, and all other persons as if the engine were used in its originally intended application. The prohibited acts of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) apply to these new engines and vessels; however, we consider the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 1039 for each engine to also be a valid certificate of conformity under this part for its model year. If we make a determination that these engines do not conform to the regulations in this chapter during their useful life, we may require you to recall them under 40 CFR part 1068.
(d)
Qualifying criteria.
If you are an engine manufacturer and meet all the following criteria and requirements regarding your new marine engine, the engine is eligible for an exemption under this section:
(1) The marine engine must be identical in all material respects to a land-based engine covered by a valid certificate of conformity for the appropriate model year showing that it meets emission standards for engines of that power rating under 40 CFR part 1039.
(2) The engines may not be used as propulsion marine engines.
(3) You must show that the number of auxiliary marine engines from the engine family must be smaller than the number of land-based engines from the engine family sold in the United States, as follows:
(i) If you are the original manufacturer of the engine, base this showing on your sales information.
(ii) In all other cases, you must get the original manufacturer of the engine to confirm this based on its sales information.
(e)
Specific requirements.
If you are an engine manufacturer or vessel manufacturer using this exemption, you must do all of the following:
(1) Make sure the original engine label will remain clearly visible after installation in the vessel. This label or a supplemental label must identify that the original certification is valid for auxiliary marine applications.
(2) Send the Designated Compliance Officer written notification describing your plans before using the provisions of this section. In addition, by February 28 of each calendar year (or less often if we tell you), send the Designated Compliance Officer a signed letter with all the following information:
(i) Identify your full corporate name, address, and telephone number.
(ii) List the engine models for which you used this exemption in the previous year and describe your basis for meeting the sales restrictions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(iii) State: “We prepared each listed engine model for marine application without making any changes that could increase its certified emission levels, as described in 40 CFR 1042.610.”
(3) If you are the certificate holder, you must describe in your application for certification how you plan to produce engines for both land-based and auxiliary marine applications, including projected sales of auxiliary marine engines to the extent this can be determined. If the projected marine sales are substantial, we may ask for the year-end report of production volumes to include actual auxiliary marine engine sales.
(f)
Failure to comply.
If your engines do not meet the criteria listed in paragraph (d) of this section, they will be subject to the standards, requirements, and prohibitions of this part and the certificate issued under 40 CFR part 1039 will not be deemed to also be a certificate issued under this part. Introducing these engines into U.S. commerce as marine engines without a valid exemption or certificate of conformity under this part violates the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1).
(g)
Participation in averaging, banking, and trading.
Engines using the exemption in this section may not generate or use emission credits under this part. These engines may generate credits under the ABT provisions in 40 CFR part 1039, as applicable. These engines must use emission credits under 40 CFR part 1039 as applicable if they are certified to an FEL that exceeds an emission standard.
(h)
Operator requirements.
The requirements specified for vessel manufacturers, owners, and operators in this subpart (including requirements in 40 CFR part 1068) apply to these engines whether they are certified under this part 1042 or another part as allowed by this section.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23006, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74150, Oct. 25, 2016; 86 FR 34511, June 29, 2021]
§ 1042.615
Replacement engine exemption.
For Category 1 and Category 2 replacement engines, the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.240 apply except as described in this section. In unusual circumstances, you may ask us to allow you to apply these provisions for a new Category 3 engine.
(a) This paragraph (a) applies instead of the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.240(b)(2) for installing new marine engines in vessels that are not “new vessels”. The prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) do not apply to a new replacement engine if all the following conditions are met:
(1) You use good engineering judgment to determine that no engine certified to the current requirements of this part is produced by any manufacturer with the appropriate physical or performance characteristics to repower the vessel. We have determined that Tier 4 engines with aftertreatment technology do not have the appropriate physical or performance characteristics to replace uncertified engines or engines certified to emission standards that are less stringent than the Tier 4 standards.
(2) You make a record of your determination for each replacement engine with the following information and keep these records for eight years:
(i) If you determine that no engine certified to the current requirements of this part is available with the appropriate performance characteristics, explain why certified engines produced by you and other manufacturers cannot be used as a replacement because they are not similar to the engine being replaced in terms of power or speed.
(ii) You may determine that all engines certified to the current requirements of this part that have appropriate performance characteristics are not available because they do not have the appropriate physical characteristics. If this is the case, explain why these certified engines produced by you and other manufacturers cannot be used as a replacement because their weight or dimensions are substantially different than those of the engine being replaced, or because they will not fit within the vessel's engine compartment or engine room.
(iii) In evaluating appropriate physical or performance characteristics, you may account for compatibility with vessel components you would not otherwise replace when installing a new engine, including transmissions or reduction gears, drive shafts or propeller shafts, propellers, cooling systems, operator controls, or electrical systems for generators or indirect-drive configurations. If you make your determination on this basis, you must identify the vessel components that are incompatible with engines certified to current standards and explain how they are incompatible and why it would be unreasonable to replace them.
(iv) In evaluating appropriate physical or performance characteristics, you may account for compatibility in a set of two or more propulsion engines on a vessel where only one of the engines needs replacement, but only if each engine not needing replacement has operated for less than 75 percent of its applicable useful life in hours or years (see § 1042.101). If any engine not otherwise needing replacement exceeds this 75 percent threshold, your determination must consider replacement of all the propulsion engines.
(v) In addition to the determination specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must make a separate determination for your own product line addressing every tier of emission standards that is more stringent than the emission standards for the engine being replaced. For example, if the engine being replaced was built before the Tier 1 standards started to apply and engines of that size are currently subject to Tier 3 standards, you must consider whether any Tier 1 or Tier 2 engines that you produce have the appropriate physical and performance characteristics for replacing the old engine; if you can produce a Tier 2 engine with the appropriate physical and performance characteristics, you must use it as the replacement engine.
(3) Send us a report by September 30 of each year describing your engine shipments under this section from the preceding calendar year. Your report must include all the following things and be signed by an authorized representative of your company:
(i) Identify the number of Category 1 and Category 2 exempt replacement engines that meet Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 standards, or that meet no EPA standards. Count engines separately for each tier of standards. Identify the number of those engines that have been shipped (directly or indirectly) to a vessel owner. This includes engines shipped to anyone intending to install engines on behalf of a specific engine owner. Also include commercial Tier 3 engines with maximum engine power at or above 600 kW even if they have not been shipped to or designated for a specific vessel owner in the specified time frame.
(ii) Describe how you made the determinations described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for each Category 1 and Category 2 exempt replacement engine for each vessel during the preceding year. For Tier 3 replacement engines at or above 600 kW, describe why any engines certified to Tier 4 standards without aftertreatment are not suitable.
(iii) Identify the number of Category 3 exempt replacement engines. We may require you to describe how you made the determinations described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for each engine.
(iv) Include the following statement:
I certify that the statements and information in the enclosed document are true, accurate, and complete to the best of my knowledge. I am aware that there are significant civil and criminal penalties for submitting false statements and information, or omitting required statements and information.
(4) The replacement engine must conform to the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 1043. Note that 40 CFR 1043.10 specifies allowances for vessels that operate only domestically.
(b) The 40-year limit specified in 40 CFR 1068.240(a) does not apply for engines subject to this part 1042. You may accordingly omit the statement on the permanent labels specified in 40 CFR 1068.240 describing this limitation.
(c) Modifying a vessel to significantly increase its value within six months after installing a replacement engine produced under this section is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1).
(d) We may void an exemption for an engine if we determine that any of the
conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section are not met.
(e) We may reduce the reporting and recordkeeping requirements in this section.
(f) The provisions of 40 CFR 1068.240(c) allow you to ship a limited number of exempt replacement engines to vessel owners or distributors without making the determinations described in paragraph (a) of this section. Note that such engines do not count toward the production limits of 40 CFR 1068.240(c) if you meet all the requirements of this section by the due date for the annual report. You may count Tier 3 commercial marine replacement engines at or above 600 kW as tracked engines under 40 CFR 1068.240(b) even if they have not been shipped to or designated for a specific vessel owner in the specified time frame.
(g) In unusual circumstances, you may ask us to allow you to apply the replacement engine exemption of this section for repowering a steamship or a vessel that becomes a “new vessel” under § 1042.901 as a result of modifications, as follows:
(1) You must demonstrate that no manufacturer produces an engine certified to Tier 4 standards with the appropriate physical or performance characteristics to repower the vessel. We will consider concerns about the size of the replacement engine and its compatibility with vessel components relative to the overall scope of the project.
(2) Exempt replacement engines under this paragraph (g) must meet the Tier 3 standards specified in § 1042.101 (or the Tier 2 standards if there are no Tier 3 standards).
(3) We will not approve a request for an exemption from the Tier 3 standards for any engines.
(4) You may not use the exemption provisions for untracked replacement engines under 40 CFR 1068.240(c) for repowering a vessel that becomes a “new vessel” under § 1042.901 as a result of modifications.

§ 1042.620
Engines used solely for competition.
The provisions of this section apply for new Category 1 engines and vessels built on or after January 1, 2009.
(a) We may grant you an exemption from the standards and requirements of this part for a new engine on the grounds that it is to be used solely for competition. The requirements of this part, other than those in this section, do not apply to engines that we exempt for use solely for competition.
(b) We will exempt engines that we determine will be used solely for competition. The basis of our determination is described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Exemptions granted under this section are good for only one model year and you must request renewal for each subsequent model year. We will not approve your renewal request if we determine the engine will not be used solely for competition.
(c) Engines meeting all the following criteria are considered to be used solely for competition:
(1) Neither the engine nor any vessels containing the engine may be displayed for sale in any public dealership or otherwise offered for sale to the general public. Note that this does not preclude display of these engines as long as they are not available for sale to the general public.
(2) Sale of the vessel in which the engine is installed must be limited to professional racing teams, professional racers, or other qualified racers. For replacement engines, the sale of the engine itself must be limited to professional racing teams, professional racers, other qualified racers, or to the original vessel manufacturer.
(3) The engine and the vessel in which it is installed must have performance characteristics that are substantially superior to noncompetitive models.
(4) The engines are intended for use only as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
(d) You may ask us to approve an exemption for engines not meeting the criteria listed in paragraph (c) of this section as long as you have clear and convincing evidence that the engines will be used solely for competition.
(e) Engines are considered to be used solely for competition only if their use is limited to competition events sanctioned by the U.S. Coast Guard or another public organization with authorizing permits for participating competitors. Operation of such engines may include only racing events, trials to qualify for racing events, and practice associated with racing events. Authorized attempts to set speed records are also considered racing events. Engines will not be considered to be used solely for competition if they are ever used for any recreational or other noncompetitive purpose. Use of exempt engines in any recreational events, such as poker runs and lobsterboat races, is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(4).
(f) You must permanently label engines exempted under this section to clearly indicate that they are to be used only for competition. Failure to properly label an engine will void the exemption for that engine.
(g) If we request it, you must provide us any information we need to determine whether the engines are used solely for competition. This would include documentation regarding the number of engines and the ultimate purchaser of each engine as well as any documentation showing a vessel manufacturer's request for an exempted engine. Keep these records for five years.

§ 1042.625
Special provisions for engines used in emergency applications.
This section describes an exemption that is available for certain Category 1 and Category 2 engines. This exemption is not available for Category 3 engines.
(a) Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the prohibitions in § 1068.101(a)(1) do not apply to a new engine that is subject to Tier 4 standards if the following conditions are met:
(1) The engine is intended for installation in one of the following vessels or applications:
(i) A lifeboat approved by the U.S. Coast Guard under approval series 160.135 (see for example 46 CFR 199.201(a)(1)), as long as such a vessel is not also used as a launch or tender.
(ii) A rescue boat approved by the U.S. Coast Guard under approval series 160.156 (see for example 46 CFR 199.202(a)).
(iii) Generator sets or other auxiliary equipment that qualify as final emergency power sources under 46 CFR part 112.
(2) The engine meets the Tier 3 emission standards specified in § 1042.101 as specified in 40 CFR 1068.265.
(3) The engine is used only for its intended purpose, as specified on the emission control information label.
(b) Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the prohibitions in § 1068.101(a)(1) do not apply to a new engine that is subject to Tier 3 standards according to the following provisions:
(1) The engine must be intended for installation in a lifeboat or a rescue boat as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(2) This exemption is available from the initial effective date for the Tier 3 standards until the engine model (or one of comparable size, weight, and performance) has been certified as complying with the Tier 3 standards and Coast Guard requirements.
(3) The engine must meet the Tier 2 emission standards specified in Appendix I of this part as specified in 40 CFR 1068.265.
(c) If you introduce an engine into U.S. commerce under this section, you must meet the labeling requirements in § 1042.135, but add one of the following statements instead of the compliance statement in § 1042.135(c)(10):
(1) For lifeboats and rescue boats, add the following statement:
THIS ENGINE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH CURRENT U.S. EPA EMISSION STANDARDS UNDER 40 CFR 1042.625 AND IS FOR USE SOLELY IN LIFEBOATS OR RESCUE BOATS (COAST GUARD APPROVAL SERIES 160.135 OR 160.156). INSTALLATION OR USE OF THIS ENGINE IN ANY OTHER APPLICATION MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.
(2) For engines serving as final emergency power sources, add the following statement:
THIS ENGINE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH CURRENT U.S. EPA EMISSION STANDARDS UNDER 40 CFR 1042.625 AND IS FOR
USE SOLELY IN EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT REGULATED BY 46 CFR 112. INSTALLATION OR USE OF THIS ENGINE IN ANY OTHER APPLICATION MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.
(d) Introducing into commerce a vessel containing an engine exempted under this section violates the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) where the vessel is not covered by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, unless it is exempt under a different provision. Similarly, using such an engine or vessel as something other than a lifeboat, rescue boat, or emergency engine as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section violates the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1), unless it is exempt under a different provision.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23006, Apr. 30, 2010]
§ 1042.630
Personal-use exemption.
This section applies to individuals who manufacture vessels for personal use with used Category 1 engines. If you and your vessel meet all the conditions of this section, the vessel and its engine are considered to be exempt from the standards and requirements of this part that apply to new engines and new vessels. The prohibitions in § 1068.101(a)(1) do not apply to engines exempted under this section. For example, you may install an engine that was not certified as a marine engine.
(a) The vessel may not be manufactured from a previously certified vessel, nor may it be manufactured from a partially complete vessel that is equivalent to a certified vessel. The vessel must be manufactured primarily from unassembled components, but may incorporate some preassembled components. For example, fully preassembled steering assemblies may be used. You may also power the vessel with an engine that was previously used in a highway or land-based nonroad application.
(b) The vessel may not be sold within five years after the date of final assembly.
(c) No individual may manufacture more than one vessel in any ten-year period under this exemption.
(d) You may not use the vessel in any revenue-generating service or for any other commercial purpose, except that you may use a vessel exempt under this section for commercial fishing that you personally do.
(e) This exemption may not be used to circumvent the requirements of this part or the requirements of the Clean Air Act. For example, this exemption would not cover a case in which a person sells an almost completely assembled vessel to another person, who would then complete the assembly. This would be considered equivalent to the sale of the complete new vessel. This section also does not allow engine manufacturers to produce new engines that are exempt from emission standards and it does not provide an exemption from the prohibition against tampering with certified engines.
(f) The vessel must be a vessel that is not classed or subject to Coast Guard inspections or surveys. Note that dockside examinations performed by the Coast Guard are not considered inspections (see 46 U.S.C. 3301 and 46 U.S.C. 4502).
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23006, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74151, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1042.635
National security exemption.
Engines qualify for a national security exemption as described in 40 CFR 1068.225. This applies to both freshly manufactured and remanufactured engines.
[81 FR 74151, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1042.650
Exemptions for migratory vessels and auxiliary engines on Category 3 vessels.
The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section apply for Category 1 and Category 2 engines, including auxiliary engines installed on vessels with Category 3 propulsion engines. Paragraphs (a) through (c) do not apply for any Category 3 engines. All engines exempted under this section must comply with the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 1043.
(a)
Temporary exemption.
A vessel owner may ask us for a temporary exemption from the tampering prohibition in 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1) for a vessel if it will operate for an extended period outside the United States where ULSD
is not available. In your request, describe where the vessel will operate, how long it will operate there, why ULSD will be unavailable, and how you will modify the engine, including its emission controls. If we approve your request, you may modify the engine, but only as needed to disable or remove the emission controls needed for meeting the Tier 4 standards. You must return the engine to its original certified configuration before the vessel returns to the United States to avoid violating the tampering prohibition in 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1). We may set additional conditions to prevent circumvention of the provisions of this part.
(b)
SOLAS exemption.
We may approve a permanent exemption from the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) for an engine that is subject to Tier 4 standards as described in this paragraph (b).
(1) Vessel owners may ask for a permanent exemption from the Tier 4 standards for an engine that will be installed on vessels that will operate for extended periods outside the United States, provided they demonstrate all of the following are true:
(i) Prior to introduction into service, the vessel will comply with applicable certification requirements for international safety pursuant to the U.S. Coast Guard and the International Convention for the Protection of Life at Sea (SOLAS). The vessel owner must maintain compliance with these requirements for the life of the exempted engine.
(ii) The vessel will be used in areas outside of the United States where ULSD will not be available.
(iii) The mix of vessels with engines certified to Tier 3 or earlier standards in the owner's current fleet and the owner's current business operation of those vessels makes the exemption necessary. Note that because of the large fraction of pre-Tier 4 engines in the fleet prior to 2021, a request for a Tier 4 exemption prior to that year must clearly demonstrate that unusual circumstances apply.
(2) An engine exempted under this paragraph (b) must meet the Tier 3 emission standards described in § 1402.101, subject to the procedural requirements of 40 CFR 1068.265.
(3) If you introduce an engine into U.S. commerce under this section, you must meet the labeling requirements in § 1042.135, but add the following statement instead of the compliance statement in § 1042.135(c)(10):
THIS ENGINE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH CURRENT U.S. EPA EMISSION STANDARDS UNDER 40 CFR 1042.650 AND IS FOR USE SOLELY IN SOLAS VESSELS. INSTALLATION OR USE OF THIS ENGINE IN ANY OTHER APPLICATION MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.
(4) Operating a vessel containing an engine exempted under this paragraph (b) violates the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) if the vessel is not in full compliance with applicable requirements for international safety specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(c)
Vessels less than 500 gross tons.
In unusual circumstances for vessels less than 500 gross tons, we may approve a vessel owner's request for a permanent exemption from the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1) for an engine that is subject to Tier 4 standards that will operate for extended periods outside the United States without it being in compliance with applicable certification requirements for international safety. We may set appropriate additional conditions on such exemptions, and may void the exemption if those conditions are not met.
(d)
Auxiliary engines on Category 3 vessels.
Auxiliary engines that will be installed on vessels with Category 3 propulsion engines qualify for an exemption from the standards of this part provided all the following conditions are met:
(1) To be eligible for this exemption, the engine must meet all the following criteria.
(i) The engine must have an EIAPP certificate demonstrating compliance with the applicable NO
X
standards of Annex VI and meet all other applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 1043. Engines installed on vessels constructed on or after January 1, 2016 must conform fully to the Annex VI Tier III NO
X
standards as described in 40 CFR part 1043 and meet all other applicable requirements in 40 CFR part 1043. Engines that would otherwise be subject
to the Tier 4 standards of this part must also conform fully to the Annex VITier III NO
X
standards as described in 40 CFR part 1043.
(ii) The engine may not be used for propulsion (except for emergency engines).
(iii) Engines certified to the Annex VI Tier III standards may be equipped with on-off NO
X
controls, as long as they conform to the requirements of §§ 1042.110(d) and 1042.115(g); however, the engines must comply fully with the Annex VI Tier II standards when the emission controls are disabled, and meet any other requirements that apply underAnnex VI.
(2) You must notify the Designated Compliance Officer of your intent to use this exemption before you introduce engines into U.S. commerce, not later than the time that you apply for an EIAPP certificate for the engine under 40 CFR part 1043.
(3) The remanufactured engine requirements of subpart I of this part do not apply.
(4) If you introduce an engine into U.S. commerce under this paragraph (d), you must meet the labeling requirements in § 1042.135, but add the following statement instead of the compliance statement in § 1042.135(c)(10):
THIS ENGINE DOES NOT COMPLY WITH CURRENT U.S. EPA EMISSION STANDARDS UNDER 40 CFR 1042.650 AND IS FOR USE SOLELY IN VESSELS WITH CATEGORY 3 PROPULSION ENGINES. INSTALLATION OR USE OF THIS ENGINE IN ANY OTHER APPLICATION MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY.
(5) The reporting requirements of § 1042.660 apply for engines exempted under this paragraph (d).
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23007, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74151, Oct. 25, 2016; 86 FR 34512, June 29, 2021]
§ 1042.655
Special certification provisions for Category 3 engines with aftertreatment.
This section describes an optional approach for demonstrating for certification that catalyst-equipped engines (or engines equipped with other aftertreatment devices) comply with applicable emission standards. You must use good engineering judgment for all aspects of this allowance.
(a)
Eligibility.
You may use the provisions of this section without our prior approval to demonstrate that aftertreatment-equipped Category 3 engines meet the Tier 3 standards. In unusual circumstances, we may also allow you to use this approach to demonstrate that aftertreatment-equipped Category 2 engines meet the Tier 4 standards. We will generally approve this for Category 2 engines only if the engines are too large to be practically tested in a laboratory with a fully assembled aftertreatment system. If we approve this approach for a Category 2 engine, interpret references to Tier 3 in this section to mean Tier 4, and interpret references to Tier 2 in this section to mean Tier 3.
(b)
Required testing.
The emission-data engine must be tested as specified in subpart F of this part. Testing engine-out emissions to simulate operation with disabled Tier 3 emission controls must simulate backpressure and other parameters as needed to represent in-use operation with an SCR catalyst. The catalyst material or other aftertreatment device must be tested under conditions that accurately represent actual engine conditions for the test points. This catalyst or aftertreatment testing may be performed on a bench scale.
(c)
Engineering analysis.
Include with your application a detailed engineering analysis describing how the test data collected for the engine and aftertreatment demonstrate that all engines in the family will meet all applicable emission standards. We may require that you submit this analysis separately from your application, or that you obtain preliminary approval under § 1042.210.
(d)
Verification.
You must verify your design by testing a complete production engine with installed aftertreatment in the final assembled configuration. Unless we specify otherwise, do this by complying with production-line testing requirements of subpart D of this part.
(e)
Other requirements.
All other requirements of this part, including the
non-testing requirements for certification, apply for these engines. Nothing in this section affects requirements in other regulatory parts, such as Coast Guard safety requirements.
[75 FR 23007, Apr. 30, 2010, as amended at 81 FR 74151, Oct. 25, 2016; 86 FR 34512, June 29, 2021]
§ 1042.660
Requirements for vessel manufacturers, owners, and operators.
(a) For vessels equipped with emission controls requiring the use of specific fuels, lubricants, or other fluids, owners and operators must comply with the manufacturer/remanufacturer's specifications for such fluids when operating the vessels. Failure to comply with the requirements of this paragraph is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1). For marine vessels that are excluded from the requirements of 40 CFR part 1043 because they operate only domestically, it is also a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1) to operate the vessel using residual fuel on or after January 1, 2015. Note that 40 CFR part 1090 also includes provisions that restrict the use of certain fuels by certain marine engines.
(b) For vessels equipped with SCR systems requiring the use of urea or other reductants, owners and operators must report to the Designated Compliance Officer within 30 days any operation of such vessels without the appropriate reductant. For each reportable incident, include the cause of the noncompliant operation, the remedy, and an estimate of the extent of operation without reductant. You must remedy the problem as soon as practicable to avoid violating the tampering prohibition in 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1). If the remedy is not complete within 30 days of the incident, notify the Designated Compliance Officer when the issue is resolved, along with any relevant additional information related to the repair. This reporting requirement applies for all engines on covered vessels even if the engines are certified to Annex VI standards instead of or in addition to EPA standards under this part. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements of this paragraph (b) is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(2). Note that operating such engines without reductant is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1).
(c) The provisions of this paragraph (c) apply for marine vessels containing Category 3 engines.
(1) The requirements of this paragraph (c)(1) apply only for Category 3 engines. All maintenance, repair, adjustment, and alteration of Category 3 engines subject to the provisions of this part performed by any owner, operator or other maintenance provider must be performed using good engineering judgment, in such a manner that the engine continues (after the maintenance, repair, adjustment or alteration) to meet the emission standards it was certified as meeting prior to the need for service. This includes but is not limited to complying with the maintenance instructions described in § 1042.125. Adjustments are limited to the range specified by the engine manufacturer in the approved application for certification. Note that where a repair (or other maintenance) cannot be completed while at sea, it is not a violation to continue operating the engine to reach your destination.
(2) It is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1) to operate the vessel with the engine adjusted outside of the specified adjustable range. Each two-hour period of such operation constitutes a separate offense. A violation lasting less than two hours constitutes a single offense.
(3) The owner and operator of the engine must maintain on board the vessel records of all maintenance, repair, and adjustment that could reasonably affect the emission performance of any engine subject to the provision of this part. Owners and operators must also maintain, on board the vessel, records regarding certification, parameter adjustment, and fuels used. For engines that are automatically adjusted electronically, all adjustments must be logged automatically. Owners and operators must make these records available to EPA upon request. These records must include the following:
(i) The Technical File, Record Book of Engine Parameters, and bunker delivery notes as specified in 40 CFR 1043.70. The Technical File must be transferred to subsequent purchasers in
the event of a sale of the engine or vessel. (ii) Specific descriptions of engine maintenance, repair, adjustment, and alteration (including rebuilding). The descriptions must include at least the date, time, and nature of the maintenance, repair, adjustment, or alteration and the position of the vessel when the maintenance, repair, adjustment, or alteration was made.
(iii) Emission-related maintenance instructions provided by the manufacturer. These instructions must be transferred to subsequent purchasers in the event of a sale of the engine or vessel.
(4) Owners and operators of engines equipped with on-off emission controls must comply with the requirements of this paragraph (c)(4) whenever a malfunction of the emission controls is indicated as specified in § 1042.110(d). You must determine the cause of the malfunction and remedy it consistent with paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
See
paragraph (b) of this section if the malfunction is due to either a lack of reductant or inadequate reductant quality. If the malfunction occurs during the useful life, report the malfunction to the certificate holder for investigation and compliance with defect reporting requirements of 40 CFR 1068.501 (unless the malfunction is due to operation without adequate urea or other malmaintenance).
(d) For each marine vessel containing a Category 3 engine, the owner must annually review the vessel's records and submit to EPA a signed statement certifying compliance during the preceding year with the requirements of this part that are applicable to owners and operators of such vessels. Alternately, if review of the vessel's records indicates that there has been one or more violations of the requirements of this part, the owner must submit to EPA a signed statement specifying the noncompliance, including the nature of the noncompliance, the time of the noncompliance, and any efforts made to remedy the noncompliance. The statement of compliance (or noncompliance) required by this paragraph must be signed by the executive with responsibility for marine activities of the owner. If the vessel is operated by a different business entity than the vessel owner, the reporting requirements of this paragraph (e) apply to both the owner and the operator. Compliance with these review and certification requirements by either the vessel owner or the vessel operator with respect to a compliance statement will be considered compliance with these requirements by both of these parties for that compliance statement. The executive(s) may authorize a captain or other primary operator to conduct this review and submit the certification, provided that the certification statement is accompanied by written authorization for that individual to submit such statements. The Administrator may waive the requirements of this paragraph when equivalent assurance of compliance is otherwise available.
(e) Manufacturers, owners and operators must allow emission tests and inspections required by this part to be conducted and must provide reasonable assistance to perform such tests or inspections.

Equivalent displacement.
Apply displacement-based provisions of this part by calculating an equivalent displacement from maximum engine power.
The equivalent per-cylinder displacement (in liters) equals maximum engine power in kW multiplied by 0.00311, except that all gas turbines with maximum engine power above 9,300 kW are considered to have an equivalent per-cylinder displacement of 29.0 liters. Also, determine the appropriate Tier 3 standards for Category 1 engines based on the engine having an equivalent power density below 35 kW per liter.
(e)
Emission-related components.
All components meeting the criteria of 40 CFR 1068.501(a)(1) are considered to be emission-related components with respect to maintenance, warranty, and defect reporting for gas turbine engines.
(f)
Engines used for national defense. See
§ 1042.635 for provisions related to exempting gas turbine engines used for national defense.

# Subpart H—Averaging, Banking, and Trading for Certification
§ 1042.701
General provisions.
This subpart describes how you may use emission credits to demonstrate that Category 1 and Category 2 engines comply with emission standards under this part. The provisions of this subpart do not apply for Category 3 engines.
(a) You may average, bank, and trade (ABT) emission credits for purposes of certification as described in this subpart to show compliance with the standards of this part. Participation in this program is voluntary.
(b) The definitions of subpart J of this part apply to this subpart. The following definitions also apply:
(1)
Actual emission credits
means emission credits you have generated that we have verified by reviewing your final report.
(2)
Applicable emission standard
means an emission standard that is specified in subpart B of this part. Note that for other subparts, “applicable emission standard” is defined to also include FELs.
(3)
Averaging set
means a set of engines in which emission credits may be exchanged only with other engines in the same averaging set.
(4)
Broker
means any entity that facilitates a trade of emission credits between a buyer and seller.
(5)
Buyer
means the entity that receives emission credits as a result of a trade.
(6)
Reserved emission credits
means emission credits you have generated that we have not yet verified by reviewing your final report.
(7)
Seller
means the entity that provides emission credits during a trade.
(8)
Standard
means the emission standard that applies under subpart B of this part for engines not participating in the ABT program of this subpart.
(9)
Trade
means to exchange emission credits, either as a buyer or seller.
(c) Emission credits may be exchanged only within an averaging set. Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the following criteria define the applicable averaging sets:
(1) Recreational engines.
(2) Commercial Category 1 engines.
(3) Category 2 engines.
(d) Emission credits generated by commercial Category 1 engine families may be used for compliance by Category 2 engine families. Such credits must be discounted by 25 percent.
(e) You may not use emission credits generated under this subpart to offset any emissions that exceed an FEL or standard. This applies for all testing, including certification testing, in-use testing, selective enforcement audits, and other production-line testing. However, if emissions from an engine exceed an FEL or standard (for example, during a selective enforcement audit), you may use emission credits to recertify the engine family with a higher FEL that applies only to future production.
(f) Engine families that use emission credits for one or more pollutants may not generate positive emission credits for another pollutant.
(g) Emission credits may be used in the model year they are generated or in future model years. Emission credits may not be used for past model years.
(h) You may increase or decrease an FEL during the model year by amending your application for certification under § 1042.225.
(i) You may use NO
X
+ HC credits to show compliance with a NO
X
emission standard or use NO
X
credits to show compliance with a NO
X
+ HC emission standard.
(j) [Reserved]
(k) You may use either of the following approaches to retire or forego emission credits:
(1) You may retire emission credits generated from any number of your engines. This may be considered donating emission credits to the environment. Identify any such credits in the reports described in § 1042.730. Engines must comply with the applicable FELs even if you donate or sell the corresponding emission credits under this paragraph (k). Those credits may no longer be used by anyone to demonstrate compliance with any EPA emission standards.
(2) You may certify a family using an FEL below the emission standard as described in this part and choose not to generate emission credits for that family. If you do this, you do not need to calculate emission credits for those families and you do not need to submit or keep the associated records described in this subpart for that family.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23008, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74152, Oct. 25, 2016; 86 FR 34512, June 29, 2021]
§ 1042.705
Generating and calculating emission credits.
The provisions of this section apply separately for calculating emission credits for NO
X
, NO
X
+ HC, or PM.
(a) For each participating family, calculate positive or negative emission credits relative to the otherwise applicable emission standard. Calculate positive emission credits for a family that has an FEL below the standard. Calculate negative emission credits for a family that has an FEL above the standard. Sum your positive and negative credits for the model year before rounding. Round the sum of emission credits to the nearest kilogram (kg) using consistent units throughout the following equation:
Emission credits (kg) = (Std − FEL) × (Volume) × (Power) × (LF) × (UL) × (10
−3
)
Where:
Std = The emission standard, in g/kW-hr.
FEL = The family emission limit for the engine family, in g/kW-hr.
Volume = The number of engines eligible to participate in the averaging, banking, and trading program within the given engine family during the model year, as described in paragraph (c) of this section.
Power = The average value of maximum engine power of all the engine configurations within an engine family, calculated on a production-weighted basis, in kilowatts.
LF = Load factor. Use 0.69 for propulsion marine engines and 0.51 for auxiliary marine engines. We may specify a different load factor if we approve the use of special test procedures for an engine family under 40 CFR 1065.10(c)(2), consistent with good engineering judgment.
UL = The useful life for the given engine family, in hours.
(b) [Reserved]
(c) As described in § 1042.730, compliance with the requirements of this subpart is determined at the end of the model year based on actual U.S.-directed production volumes. Do not include any of the following engines to calculate emission credits:
(1) Engines with a permanent exemption under subpart G of this part or under 40 CFR part 1068.
(2) Exported engines.
(3) Engines not subject to the requirements of this part, such as those excluded under § 1042.5.
(4) [Reserved]
(5) Any other engines, where we indicate elsewhere in this part 1042 that they are not to be included in the calculations of this subpart.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23008, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74152, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1042.710
Averaging emission credits.
(a) Averaging is the exchange of emission credits among your engine families.
(b) You may certify one or more engine families to an FEL above the emission standard, subject to the FEL caps and other provisions in subpart B
of this part, if you show in your application for certification that your projected balance of all emission-credit transactions in that model year is greater than or equal to zero.
(c) If you certify an engine family to an FEL that exceeds the otherwise applicable emission standard, you must obtain enough emission credits to offset the engine family's deficit by the due date for the final report required in § 1042.730. The emission credits used to address the deficit may come from your other engine families that generate emission credits in the same model year, from emission credits you have banked from previous model years, or from emission credits generated in the same or previous model years that you obtained through trading.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 81 FR 74152, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1042.715
Banking emission credits.
(a) Banking is the retention of emission credits by the manufacturer generating the emission credits for use in future model years for averaging or trading.
(b) You may designate any emission credits you plan to bank in the reports you submit under § 1042.730 as reserved credits. During the model year and before the due date for the final report, you may designate your reserved emission credits for averaging or trading.
(c) Reserved credits become actual emission credits when you submit your final report. However, we may revoke these emission credits if we are unable to verify them after reviewing your reports or auditing your records.
[75 FR 23009, Apr. 30, 2010]
§ 1042.720
Trading emission credits.
(a) Trading is the exchange of emission credits between manufacturers. You may use traded emission credits for averaging, banking, or further trading transactions.
(b) You may trade actual emission credits as described in this subpart. You may also trade reserved emission credits, but we may revoke these emission credits based on our review of your records or reports or those of the company with which you traded emission credits. You may trade banked credits within an averaging set to any certifying manufacturer.
(c) If a negative emission credit balance results from a transaction, both the buyer and seller are liable, except in cases we deem to involve fraud. See § 1042.255(e) for cases involving fraud. We may void the certificates of all engine families participating in a trade that results in a manufacturer having a negative balance of emission credits. See § 1042.745.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23009, Apr. 30, 2010]
§ 1042.725
Information required for the application for certification.
(a) You must declare in your application for certification your intent to use the provisions of this subpart for each engine family that will be certified using the ABT program. You must also declare the FELs you select for the engine family for each pollutant for which you are using the ABT program. Your FELs must comply with the specifications of subpart B of this part, including the FEL caps. FELs must be expressed to the same number of decimal places as the emission standards.
(b) Include the following in your application for certification:
(1) A statement that, to the best of your belief, you will not have a negative balance of emission credits for any averaging set when all emission credits are calculated at the end of the year.
(2) Detailed calculations of projected emission credits (positive or negative) based on projected production volumes. We may require you to include similar calculations from your other engine families to demonstrate that you will be able to avoid negative credit balances for the model year. If you project negative emission credits for a family, state the source of positive emission credits you expect to use to offset the negative emission credits.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23009, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74152, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1042.730
ABT reports.
(a) If any of your engine families are certified using the ABT provisions of this subpart, you must send an end-of-year report within 90 days after the end
of the model year and a final report within 270 days after the end of the model year. We may waive the requirement to send the end-of-year report, as long as you send the final report on time.
(b) Your end-of-year and final reports must include the following information for each engine family participating in the ABT program:
(1) Engine-family designation and averaging set.
(2) The emission standards that would otherwise apply to the engine family.
(3) The FEL for each pollutant. If you change the FEL after the start of production, identify the date that you started using the new FEL and/or give the engine identification number for the first engine covered by the new FEL. In this case, identify each applicable FEL and calculate the positive or negative emission credits as specified in § 1042.225.
(4) The projected and actual U.S.-directed production volumes for the model year, as described in § 1042.705(c). If you changed an FEL during the model year, identify the actual U.S.-directed production volume associated with each FEL.
(5) Maximum engine power for each engine configuration, and the average engine power weighted by U.S.-directed production volumes for the engine family.
(6) Useful life.
(7) Calculated positive or negative emission credits for the whole engine family. Identify any emission credits that you traded, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(c) Your end-of-year and final reports must include the following additional information:
(1) Show that your net balance of emission credits from all your participating engine families in each averaging set in the applicable model year is not negative.
(2) State whether you will retain any emission credits for banking. If you choose to retire emission credits that would otherwise be eligible for banking, identify the engine families that generated the emission credits, including the number of emission credits from each family.
(3) State that the report's contents are accurate.
(d) If you trade emission credits, you must send us a report within 90 days after the transaction, as follows:
(1) As the seller, you must include the following information in your report:
(i) The corporate names of the buyer and any brokers.
(ii) A copy of any contracts related to the trade.
(iii) The averaging set corresponding to the engine families that generated emission credits for the trade, including the number of emission credits from each averaging set.
(2) As the buyer, you must include the following information in your report:
(i) The corporate names of the seller and any brokers.
(ii) A copy of any contracts related to the trade.
(iii) How you intend to use the emission credits, including the number of emission credits you intend to apply for each averaging set.
(e) Send your reports electronically to the Designated Compliance Officer using an approved information format. If you want to use a different format, send us a written request with justification for a waiver.
(f) Correct errors in your end-of-year report or final report as follows:
(1) You may correct any errors in your end-of-year report when you prepare the final report, as long as you send us the final report by the time it is due.
(2) If you or we determine within 270 days after the end of the model year that errors mistakenly decreased your balance of emission credits, you may correct the errors and recalculate the balance of emission credits. You may not make these corrections for errors that are determined more than 270 days after the end of the model year. If you report a negative balance of emission credits, we may disallow corrections under this paragraph (f)(2).
(3) If you or we determine anytime that errors mistakenly increased your balance of emission credits, you must
correct the errors and recalculate the balance of emission credits.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23009, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74152, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1042.735
Recordkeeping.
(a) You must organize and maintain your records as described in this section.
(b) Keep the records required by this section for at least eight years after the due date for the end-of-year report. You may not use emission credits for any engines if you do not keep all the records required under this section. You must therefore keep these records to continue to bank valid credits.
(c) Keep a copy of the reports we require in § 1042.730.
(d) Keep records of the engine identification number for each engine you produce that generates or uses emission credits under the ABT program. You may identify these numbers as a range. If you change the FEL after the start of production, identify the date you started using each FEL and the range of engine identification numbers associated with each FEL. You must also identify the purchaser and destination for each engine you produce to the extent this information is available.
(e) We may require you to keep additional records or to send us relevant information not required by this section in accordance with the Clean Air Act.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23009, Apr. 30, 2010; 81 FR 74153, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1042.745
Noncompliance.
(a) For each engine family participating in the ABT program, the certificate of conformity is conditional upon full compliance with the provisions of this subpart during and after the model year. You are responsible to establish to our satisfaction that you fully comply with applicable requirements. We may void the certificate of conformity for an engine family if you fail to comply with any provisions of this subpart.
(b) You may certify your engine family to an FEL above an emission standard based on a projection that you will have enough emission credits to offset the deficit for the engine family. However, we may void the certificate of conformity if you cannot show in your final report that you have enough actual emission credits to offset a deficit for any pollutant in an engine family.
(c) We may void the certificate of conformity for an engine family if you fail to keep records, send reports, or give us information we request.
(d) You may ask for a hearing if we void your certificate under this section (see § 1042.920).

# Subpart I—Special Provisions for Remanufactured Marine Engines
§ 1042.801
General provisions.
This subpart describes how the provisions of this part 1042 apply for certain remanufactured marine engines.
(a) The requirements of this subpart apply for remanufactured Tier 2 and earlier commercial Category 1 and Category 2 marine engines at or above 600 kW, excluding those engines originally manufactured before 1973. Note that the requirements of this subpart do not apply for engines below 600 kW, Category 3 engines, engines installed on recreational vessels, or Tier 3 and later engines.
(b) Any person meeting the definition of “remanufacturer” in § 1042.901 may apply for a certificate of conformity for a remanufactured engine family.
(c) The rebuilding requirements of 40 CFR 1068.120 do not apply to remanufacturing of engines using a certified remanufacturing system under this subpart. However, the requirements of 40 CFR 1068.120 do apply to all other remanufacturing of engines.
(d) Unless specified otherwise, engines certified under this subpart are also subject to the other requirements of this part.
(e) For remanufactured engines required to have a valid certificate of conformity, placing a new marine engine back into service following remanufacturing is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1), unless it has a valid certificate of conformity for its model year and the required label.
(f) Remanufacturing systems that require a fuel change or use of a fuel additive may be certified under this part. However, they are not considered to be “available” with respect to triggering
the requirement for an engine to be covered by a certificate of conformity under § 1042.815. The following provisions apply:
(1) Only fuel additives registered under 40 CFR part 79 may be used under this paragraph (f).
(2) You must demonstrate in your application that the fuel or additive will actually be used by operators, including a description of how the vessels and dispensing tanks will be labeled. We may require you to provide the labels to the operators.
(3) You must also describe analytical methods that can be used by EPA or others to verify that fuel meets your specifications.
(4) You must provide clear instructions to the operators specifying that they may only use the specified fuel/additive, label their vessels and fuel dispensing tanks, and keep records of their use of the fuel/additive in order for their engine to be covered by your certificate. Use of the incorrect fuel (or fuel without the specified additive) or any other failure to comply with the requirements of this paragraph is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(b)(1).
(g) Vessels equipped with emission controls as part of a state or local retrofit program prior to January 1, 2017 are exempt from the requirements of this subpart, as specified in this paragraph (g).
(1) This exemption only applies for retrofit programs sponsored by a state government (or one of its political subdivisions) for the purpose of reducing emissions. The exemption does not apply where the sponsoring government specifies that inclusion in the retrofit program is not intended to provide an exemption from the requirements of this subpart.
(2) The prohibitions against tampering and defeat devices in 40 CFR 1068.101(b) and the rebuilding requirements in 40 CFR 1068.120 apply for the exempt engines in the same manner as if they were covered by a certificate.
(3) Vessel owners must request an exemption prior to remanufacturing the engine. Your request must include documentation that your vessel has been retrofitted consistent with the specifications of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, and a signed statement declaring that to be true. Except for the initial request for a specific vessel and a specific retrofit, you may consider your request to be approved unless we notify you otherwise within 30 days of the date that we receive your request.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 73 FR 59194, Oct. 8, 2008; 75 FR 23009, Apr. 30, 2010; 86 FR 34512, June 29, 2021]
§ 1042.810
Requirements for owner/operators and installers during remanufacture.
This section describes how the remanufacturing regulations affect owner/operators and installers for engines subject to this subpart.
(a) See the definition of “remanufacture” in § 1042.901 to determine if you are remanufacturing your engine. (
Note:
Replacing cylinders one at a time may qualify as remanufacturing, depending on the interval between replacement.)
(b) See the definition of “new marine engine” in § 1042.901 to determine if remanufacturing your engine makes it subject to the requirements of this part. If the engine is considered to be new, it is subject to the certification requirements of this subpart, unless it is exempt under subpart G of this part.
(c) Your engine is not subject to the standards of this subpart if we determine that no certified remanufacturing system is available for your engine as described in § 1042.815. For engines that are remanufactured during multiple events within a five-year period, you are not required to use a certified system until all of your engine's cylinders have been replaced after the system became available. For example, if you remanufacture your 16-cylinder engine by replacing four cylinders each January and a system becomes available for your engine June 1, 2010, your engine must be in a certified configuration when you replace four cylinders in January of 2014. At that point, all 16 cylinders would have been replaced after June 1, 2010.
(d) You may comply with the certification requirements of this part for your remanufactured engine by either obtaining your own certificate of conformity as specified in subpart C of this part or by having a certifying remanufacturer include your engine under its
certificate of conformity. In either case, your remanufactured engine must be covered by a certificate before it is reintroduced into service.
(e) Contact a certifying remanufacturer to have your engine included under its certificate of conformity. You must comply with the certificate holder's emission-related installation instructions.
[73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 81 FR 74153, Oct. 25, 2016]
§ 1042.815
Demonstrating availability.
(a) A certified remanufacturing system is considered to be available for a specific engine only if EPA has certified the remanufacturing system as being in compliance with the provisions of this part and the certificate holder has demonstrated during certification that the system meets the criteria of this paragraph (a). We may issue a certificate for a remanufacturing system that does not meet these criteria, but such systems would not be considered available.
(1) The engine configuration must be included in the engine family for the remanufacturing system.
(2) The total marginal cost of the remanufacturing system, as calculated under paragraph (c) of this section, must be less than $45,000 per ton of PM reduction.
(3) It must be possible to obtain and install the remanufacturing system in a timely manner consistent with normal remanufacturing procedures. For example, a remanufacturing system would generally not be considered to be available if it required that the engine be removed from the vessel and shipped to a factory to be remanufactured.
(4) The remanufacturing system may result in increased maintenance costs, provided the incremental maintenance costs are included in the total costs. The remanufacturing system may not adversely affect engine reliability or power. Note that owner/operators may ask us to determine that a remanufacturing system is not considered available for their vessels because of excessive costs under § 1042.850.
(b) We will maintain a list of available remanufacturing systems. A new remanufacturing system is considered to be available 120 days after we first issue a certificate of conformity for it. Where we issue a certificate of conformity based on carryover data for a system that is already considered to be available for the configuration, the 120-day delay does not apply and the new system is considered to be available when we issue the certificate.
(c) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, marginal cost means the difference in costs between remanufacturing the engine using the remanufacturing system and remanufacturing the engine conventionally, divided by the projected amount that PM emissions will be reduced over the engine's useful life.
(1) Total costs include:
(i) Incremental hardware costs.
(ii) Incremental labor costs.
(iii) Incremental operating costs over one useful life period.
(iv) Other costs (such as shipping).
(2) Calculate the projected amount that PM emissions will be reduced over the engine's useful life using the following equation:
PM tons = (EF
base
− EF
cont
) × (PR) × (UL) × (LF) × (10
−6
)
Where:
EF
base
= deteriorated baseline PM emission rate (g/kW-hr).
EF
cont
= deteriorated controlled PM emission rate (g/kW-hr).
PR = maximum engine power for the engine (kW).
UL = useful life (hr).
LF = the load factor that would apply for your engine under § 1042.705.
§ 1042.820
Emission standards and required emission reductions for remanufactured engines.
(a) The requirements of this section apply with respect to emissions as measured according to subpart F of this part. See paragraph (g) of this section for special provisions related to remanufacturing systems certified for both locomotive and marine engines. Remanufactured Tier 2 and earlier engines may be certified under this subpart only if they have NO
X
emissions equivalent to or less than baseline NO
X
levels and PM emissions at least 25.0 percent less than baseline PM emission levels. See § 1042.825 for provisions for determining baseline NO
X
and PM emissions. See § 1042.835 for provisions
related to demonstrating compliance with these requirements.
(b) The NTE and ABT provisions of this part do not apply for remanufactured engines.
(c) The exhaust emission standards in this section apply for engines using the fuel type on which the engines in the engine family are designed to operate. Engines designed to operate using residual fuel must comply with the standards and requirements of this part when operated using residual fuel.
(d) Your engines must meet the exhaust emission standards of this section over their full useful life, as defined in § 1042.101(e).
(e) The duty-cycle emission standards in this subpart apply to all testing performed according to the procedures in § 1042.505, including certification, production-line, and in-use testing.
(f) Sections 1042.120, 1042.125, 1042.130, 1042.140 apply for remanufactured engines as written. Section 1042.115 applies for remanufactured engines as written, except for the requirement that electronically controlled engines broadcast their speed and output shaft torque.
(g) A remanufacturing system certified for locomotive engines under 40 CFR part 1033 may be deemed to also meet the requirements of this section, as specified in § 1042.836.
§ 1042.825
Baseline determination.
(a) For the purpose of this subpart, the term “baseline emissions” means the average measured emission rate specified by this section. Baseline emissions are specific to a given certificate holder and a given engine configuration.
(b) Select a used engine to be the emission-data engine for the engine family for testing. Using good engineering judgment, select the engine configuration expected to represent the most common configuration in the family.
(c) Remanufacture the engine according to OEM specifications (or equivalent). The engine is considered “the baseline engine” at this point. If the OEM specifications include a range of adjustment for any parameter, set the parameter to the midpoint of the range. You may ask us to allow you to adjust it differently, consistent with good engineering judgment.
(d) Test the baseline engine four times according to the test procedures in subpart F of this part. The baseline emissions are the average of those four tests.
(e) We may require you to test a second engine of the same or different configuration in addition to the engine tested under this section. If we require you to test the same configuration, average the results of the testing with previous results, unless we determine that your previous results are not valid.
(f) Use good engineering judgment for all aspects of the baseline determination. We may reject your baseline if we determine that you did not use good engineering judgment, consistent with the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.5.
§ 1042.830
Labeling.
(a) The labeling requirements of this paragraph (a) apply for remanufacturing that is subject to the standards of this subpart. At the time of remanufacture, affix a permanent and legible label identifying each engine. The label must be—
(1) Attached in one piece so it is not removable without being destroyed or defaced.
(2) Secured to a part of the engine needed for normal operation and not normally requiring replacement.
(3) Durable and readable for the engine's entire useful life.
(4) Written in English.
(b) The label required under paragraph (a) of this section must—
(1) Include the heading “EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION”.
(2) Include your full corporate name and trademark.
(3) Include EPA's standardized designation for the engine family.
(4) State the engine's category, displacement (in liters or L/cyl), maximum engine power (in kW), and power density (in kW/L) as needed to determine the emission standards for the engine family. You may specify displacement, maximum engine power, and power density as ranges consistent with the ranges listed in § 1042.101. See § 1042.140 for descriptions of how to specify per-cylinder displacement,
maximum engine power, and power density.
(5) State: “THIS MARINE ENGINE MEETS THE STANDARDS OF 40 CFR PART 1042, SUBPART I, FOR [CALENDAR YEAR OF REMANUFACTURE].”

§ 1042.835
Certification of remanufactured engines.
(a)
General requirements.
See §§ 1042.201, 1042.210, 1042.220, 1042.225, 1042.250, and 1042.255 for the general requirements related to obtaining a certificate of conformity. See § 1042.836 for special certification provisions for remanufacturing systems certified for locomotive engines under 40 CFR 1033.936.
(b)
Applications.
See § 1042.840 for a description of what you must include in your application.
(c)
Engine families.
See § 1042.845 for instruction about dividing your engines into engine families.
(d)
Test data.
(1) Measure baseline emissions for the test configuration as specified in § 1042.825.
(2) Measure emissions from the test engine for your remanufacturing system according to the procedures of subpart F of this part.
(3) We may measure emissions from any of your test engines or other engines from the engine family, as follows:
(i) We may decide to do the testing at your plant or any other facility. If we do this, you must deliver the test engine to a test facility we designate. The test engine you provide must include appropriate manifolds, aftertreatment devices, electronic control units, and other emission-related components not normally attached directly to the engine block. If we do the testing at your plant, you must schedule it as soon as possible and make available the instruments, personnel, and equipment we need.
(ii) If we measure emissions from one of your test engines, the results of that testing become the official emission results for the engine. Unless we later invalidate these data, we may decide not to consider your data in determining if your engine family meets applicable requirements.
(iii) Before we test one of your engines, we may set its adjustable parameters to any point within the specified adjustable ranges (see § 1042.115(d)).
(iv) Before we test one of your engines, we may calibrate it within normal production tolerances for anything we do not consider an adjustable parameter.
(4) You may ask to use emission data from a previous model year instead of doing new tests, but only if all the following are true:
(i) The engine family from the previous model year differs from the current engine family only with respect to model year or other characteristics unrelated to emissions. You may also ask to add a configuration subject to § 1042.225.
(ii) The emission-data engine from the previous model year remains the appropriate emission-data engine.
(iii) The data show that the emission-data engine would meet all the requirements that apply to the engine family
covered by the application for certification.
(5) We may require you to test a second engine of the same or different configuration in addition to the engine tested under this section.
(6) If you use an alternate test procedure under 40 CFR 1065.10 and later testing shows that such testing does not produce results that are equivalent to the procedures specified in subpart F of this part, we may reject data you generated using the alternate procedure.
(e)
Demonstrating compliance.
(1) For purposes of certification, your engine family is considered in compliance with the emission standards in § 1042.820 if all emission-data engines representing that family have test results showing compliance with the standards and percent reductions required by that section. To compare emission levels from the emission-data engine with the applicable emission standards, apply an additive deterioration factor of 0.015 g/kW-hr to the measured emission levels for PM. Alternatively, you may test your engine as specified in § 1042.245 to develop deterioration factors that represent the deterioration expected in emissions over your engines' full useful life.
(2) Collect emission data using measurements to one more decimal place than the applicable standard. Apply the deterioration factor to the official emission result, then round the adjusted figure to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard. Compare the rounded emission levels to the emission standard for each emission-data engine.
(3) Your applicable NO
X
standard for each configuration is the baseline NO
X
emission rate for that configuration plus 5.0 percent (to account for test-to-test and engine-to-engine variability). Your applicable PM standard for each configuration is the baseline PM emission rate for that configuration multiplied by 0.750 plus the deterioration factor. If you choose to include configurations in your engine family for which you do not measure baseline emissions, you must demonstrate through engineering analysis that your remanufacturing system will reduce PM emissions by at least 25.0 percent for those configurations and not increase NO
X
emissions.
(4) Your engine family is deemed not to comply if any emission-data engine representing that family for certification has test results showing a deteriorated emission level above an applicable emission standard for any pollutant.
(f)
Safety Evaluation.
You must exercise due diligence in ensuring that your system will not adversely affect safety or otherwise violate the prohibition of § 1042.115(e).
(g)
Compatibility Evaluation.
If you are not the original manufacturer of the engine, you must contact the original manufacturer of the engine to verify that your system is compatible with the engine. Keep records of your contact with the original manufacturer.
§ 1042.836
Marine certification of locomotive remanufacturing systems.

(2) If there are significant differences in how your remanufacture system will be applied to marine engines relative to locomotives, in an engineering analysis demonstrating that your system will achieve emission reductions from marine engines similar to those from locomotives.
(3) A description of modifications needed for marine applications.
(4) A demonstration of availability as described in § 1042.815, except that the total marginal cost threshold does not apply.
(5) An unconditional statement that all the engines in the engine family comply with the requirements of this part, other referenced parts of the CFR, and the Clean Air Act.
(b) Sections 1042.835 and 1042.840 do not apply for engines certified under this section.
(c) Systems that were certified to the standards of 40 CFR part 92 are subject to the following restrictions:
(1) Tier 0 locomotive systems may not be used for any Category 1 engines or Tier 1 or later Category 2 engines.
(2) Where systems certified to the standards of 40 CFR part 1033 are also available for an engine, you may not use a system certified to the standards of 40 CFR part 92.

www.bls.gov
). Include all revenues from any parent company and its subsidiaries. The exemption applies only
for years in which you meet this criterion.
(b) In unusual circumstances, we may exempt you from an otherwise applicable requirement that you apply a certified remanufacturing system when remanufacturing your marine engine.
(1) To be eligible, you must demonstrate that all of the following are true:
(i) Unusual circumstances prevent you from meeting requirements from this chapter.
(ii) You have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the extent of the nonconformity.
(iii) Not having the exemption will jeopardize the solvency of your company.

(3) For an uncertified marine engine excluded under § 1042.5 that is later subject to this part as a result of being installed in a different vessel, model year means the calendar year in which the engine was installed in the non-excluded vessel. For a marine engine excluded under § 1042.5 that is later subject to this part as a result of reflagging the vessel, model year means the calendar year in which the engine was originally manufactured. For a marine engine that becomes new under paragraph (7) of the definition of “new marine engine,” model year means the calendar year in which the engine was originally manufactured. (See definition of “new marine engine,” paragraphs (3) and (7).)
(4) For engines that do not meet the definition of “freshly manufactured” but are installed in new vessels, model year means the calendar year in which the engine is installed in the new vessel (see definition of “new marine engine,” paragraph (4)).
(5) For remanufactured engines, model year means the calendar year in which the remanufacture takes place.
(6) For imported engines:
(i) For imported engines described in paragraph (6)(i) of the definition of “new marine engine,”

Motor vehicle
has the meaning given in 40 CFR 85.1703(a).
New marine engine
means any of the following:
(1) A freshly manufactured marine engine for which the ultimate purchaser has never received the equitable or legal title. This kind of engine might commonly be thought of as “brand new.” In the case of this paragraph (1), the engine is new from the time it is produced until the ultimate purchaser receives the title or the product is placed into service, whichever comes first.
(2) An engine originally manufactured as a motor vehicle engine, a nonroad engine that is not a marine engine, or a stationary engine that is later used or intended to be used as a marine engine. In this case, the engine is no longer a motor vehicle, nonmarine, or stationary engine and becomes a “new marine engine.” The engine is no longer new when it is placed into marine service as a marine engine. This paragraph (2) applies for engines we exclude under § 1042.5, where that engine is later installed as a marine engine in a vessel that is covered by this part 1042. For example, this would apply to an engine that is no longer used in a foreign vessel. An engine converted to a marine engine without having been certified is treated as a freshly manufactured engine under this part 1042.
(3) A marine engine that has been previously placed into service in an application we exclude under § 1042.5, where that engine is installed in a vessel that is covered by this part 1042. The engine is new when it first enters U.S. waters on a vessel covered by this part 1042. For example, this would apply to an engine that is no longer used in a foreign vessel and for engines on a vessel that is reflagged as a U.S. vessel. Note paragraph (7) of this definition may also apply.
(4) An engine not covered by paragraphs (1) through (3) of this definition that is intended to be installed in a new vessel. This generally includes installation of used engines in new vessels. The engine is no longer new when the ultimate purchaser receives a title for the vessel or it is placed into service, whichever comes first. Such an engine is treated as a freshly manufactured engine under this part 1042, whether or not it meets the definition of “freshly manufactured marine engine.”
(5) A remanufactured marine engine. An engine becomes new when it is remanufactured (as defined in this section) and ceases to be new when placed back into service.
(6) An imported marine engine, subject to the following provisions:
(i) An imported marine engine covered by a certificate of conformity issued under this part that meets the criteria of one or more of paragraphs (1) through (4) of this definition, where the original engine manufacturer holds the certificate, is new as defined by those applicable paragraphs.
(ii) An imported remanufactured engine that would have been required to be certified if it had been remanufactured in the United States.
(iii) An imported engine that will be covered by a certificate of conformity issued under this part, where someone other than the original engine manufacturer holds the certificate (such as when the engine is modified after its initial assembly), is a new marine engine when it is imported. It is no longer new when the ultimate purchaser receives a title for the engine or it is placed into service, whichever comes first.
(iv) An imported marine engine that is not covered by a certificate of conformity issued under this part at the time of importation is new, but only if it was produced on or after the dates shown in the following table. This addresses uncertified engines and vessels
initially placed into service that someone seeks to import into the United States. Importation of this kind of engine (or vessel containing such an engine) is generally prohibited by 40 CFR part 1068.

§ 1043.1
Overview.
The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) requires engine manufacturers, owners and operators of vessels, and other persons to comply with Annex VI of the MARPOL Protocol. This part implements portions of APPS as it relates to Regulations 13, 14 and 18 of Annex VI. These regulations clarify the application of some Annex VI provisions; provide procedures and criteria for the issuance of EIAPP certificates; and specify requirements applicable to ships that are not registered by Parties to Annex VI. This part includes provisions to apply the equivalency provisions of Regulation 4 of Annex VI with respect to Regulations 14 and 18 of Annex VI. Additional regulations may also apply with respect to the Annex VI, such as those issued separately by the U.S. Coast Guard. Note that references in this part to a specific subsection of an Annex VI regulation (such as Regulation 13.5.1) reflect the regulation numbering of the 2008 Annex VI (incorporated by reference in § 1043.100).
(a) The general requirements for non-public U.S.-flagged and other Party vessels are specified in Annex VI, as
implemented by 33 U.S.C. 1901-1915. These requirements apply to engine manufacturers, owners and operators of vessels, and other persons.
(b) The provisions of this part specify how Regulations 13, 14 and 18 of Annex VI, as implemented by APPS, will be applied to U.S.-flagged vessels that operate only domestically.
(c) This part implements section 33 U.S.C. 1902(e) by specifying that non-public vessels flagged by a country that is not a party to Annex VI are subject to certain provisions under this part that are equivalent to the substantive requirements of Regulations 13, 14 and 18 of Annex VI as implemented by APPS.
(d) This part also describes where the requirements of Regulation 13.5.1 of Annex VI and Regulation 14.4 of Annex VI will apply.
(e) This part 1043 does not limit the requirements specified in Annex VI, as implemented by APPS, except as specified in § 1043.10(a)(2) and (b)(3).
(f) Nothing in this part limits the operating requirements and restrictions applicable for engines and vessels subject to 40 CFR part 1042 or the requirements and restrictions applicable for fuels subject to 40 CFR part 1090.
(g) The provisions of this part specify how to obtain EIAPP certificates and certificates for Approved Methods.

The provisions of this part apply for all U.S.-flagged vessels wherever they are located (including engines installed or intended to be installed on such vessels), except as specified in this paragraph (a) or in § 1043.95.
(1) Public vessels are excluded from this part.
(2) Vessels that operate only domestically and conform to the requirements of this paragraph (a)(2) are excluded from Regulation 13 of Annex VI and the NO
X
-related requirements of this part (including the requirement to obtain an EIAPP certificate and to keep a Technical File and an Engine Book of Record Parameters). For the purpose of this exclusion, the phrase “operate only domestically” means the vessels do not enter waters subject to the jurisdiction or control of any foreign country, except for Canadian portions of the Great Lakes. (See §§ 1043.60 and 1043.70 for provisions related to fuel use by such vessels). To be excluded, the vessel must conform to each of the following provisions:
(i) All compression-ignition engines on the vessel must conform fully to all applicable provisions of 40 CFR parts 94 and 1042.
(ii) The vessel may not contain any engines with a specific engine displacement at or above 30.0 liters per cylinder.
(iii) Any engine installed in the vessel that is not covered by an EIAPP certificate must be labeled as specified in 40 CFR 1042.135 with respect to whether it meets the requirements of Regulation 13 of Annex VI.
(b)
Foreign-flagged vessels.
The provisions of this part apply for all non-public foreign-flagged vessels (including
engines installed on such vessels) as follows:
(1) The requirements of this part apply for foreign-flagged vessels operating in U.S. navigable waters or the U.S. EEZ.
(2) For non-public vessels flagged by a country that is not a party to Annex VI, the requirements of this part apply in the same manner as apply for Party vessels, except as otherwise provided in this part. For example, see § 1043.30(c)(4) for provisions related to showing compliance with this requirement without an EIAPP certificate. See § 1043.60 for specific operating requirements.
(3) Canadian vessels that operate only within the Great Lakes and are subject to an alternative NO
X
control measure established by the Canadian government are excluded from the NO
X
-related requirements of this part.
(c)
Fuel suppliers.
The provisions of § 1043.80 apply for all persons supplying fuel to any vessel subject to this part.
(d)
Sea bed mineral exploration.
This part does not apply to emissions directly arising from the exploration, exploitation, and associated offshore processing of sea-bed mineral resources.

(a) 33 U.S.C. 1907 prohibits any person from violating any provisions of the MARPOL Protocol, whether or not they are a manufacturer, owner or operator. For manufacturers, owners and operators of vessels subject to this part, it is the responsibility of such manufacturers, owners and operators to ensure that all employees and other agents operating on their behalf comply with these requirements.
(b) Manufacturers of engines to be installed on U.S. vessels subject to this part must obtain an EIAPP certificate for an engine prior to it being installed in a vessel.
(c) Engines with power output of more than 130 kW that are listed in this paragraph (c) must be covered by a valid EIAPP certificate, certifying the engine meets the applicable emission standards of Annex VI, unless the engine is excluded under § 1043.10 or paragraph (d) of this section. An EIAPP certificate is valid for a given engine only if it certifies compliance with the tier of standards applicable to that engine and the vessel into which it is being installed (or a later tier). Note that none of the requirements of this paragraph (c) are limited to new engines.
(1) Engines meeting any of the following criteria must be covered by a valid EIAPP certificate:
(i) Engines installed (or intended to be installed) on vessels that were constructed on or after January 1, 2000. This includes engines that met the definition of “new marine engine” in 40 CFR 1042.901 at any time on or after January 1, 2000, unless such engines are installed on vessels that were constructed before January 1, 2000.
(ii) Engines that undergo a major conversion on or after January 1, 2000, unless the engines have been exempt from this requirement under paragraph (e) of this section.
(2) For such engines intended to be installed on U.S.-flagged vessels, the engine may not be introduced into U.S. commerce before it is covered by a valid EIAPP certificate, except as allowed by this paragraph (c)(2).
(i) This paragraph (c)(2) does not apply for engines installed on vessels excluded under this part 1043.
(ii) Engines without a valid EIAPP certificate (because they are intended for domestic use only) may be introduced into U.S. commerce, but may not be installed on vessels that do not meet the requirements of § 1043.10(a)(2).
(iii) Engines that have been temporarily exempted by EPA under 40 CFR part 1042 or part 1068 may be introduced into U.S. commerce without a valid EIAPP certificate to the same extent they are allowed to be introduced
into U.S. commerce without a valid part 1042 certificate of conformity, however, this allowance does not affect whether the engine must ultimately be covered by an EIAPP certificate. Unless otherwise excluded or exempted under this part 1043, the engine must be covered by an EIAPP certificate before being placed into service. For example, engines allowed to be temporarily distributed in an uncertified configuration under 40 CFR 1068.260 would not be required to be covered by an EIAPP certificate while it is covered by the temporary exemption under 40 CFR 1068.260; however, it would be required to be covered by an EIAPP certificate before being placed into service.
(iv) All uninstalled marine engines within the United States are presumed to be intended to be installed on a U.S.-flagged vessel, unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
(3) For engines installed on Party vessels, the engine may not operate in the U.S. navigable waters or the U.S. exclusive economic zone, or other areas designated under 33 U.S.C. 1902(a)(5)(B)(iii), (C)(iii), or (D)(iv) unless it is covered by a valid EIAPP certificate.
(4) Engines installed on non-Party vessels are not required to have EIAPP certificates, but the operator must have evidence of conformity with Regulation 13 of Annex VI issued by either the government of a country that is party to Annex VI or a recognized classification society. For the purposes of this paragraph, “recognized classification society” means a classification society that is a participating member of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS).
(d) In addition to the engines excluded under § 1043.10, the following engines are excluded from the requirement to have an EIAPP certificate (or equivalent demonstration of compliance in the case of non-Party vessels) or otherwise meet the requirements of Regulation 13 of Annex VI.
(1) Spark-ignition engines.
(2) Non-reciprocating engines.
(3) Engines that do not use liquid fuel.
(4) Engines intended to be used solely for emergencies. This includes engines that power equipment such as pumps that are intended to be used solely for emergencies and engines installed in lifeboats intended to be used solely for emergencies. It does not include engines to be used for both emergency and non-emergency purposes.
(e) The following requirements apply to Party vessels, including U.S.-flagged vessels:
(1) The requirements specified in Annex VI apply for vessels subject to this part for operation in U.S. navigable waters or the U.S. EEZ. (
See
§ 1043.60 for a summary of the standards included in these requirements.)
(2) Vessels operating in an ECA must also comply with the requirements of Annex VI applicable to operation in an ECA.
(3) Vessels operating in waters of an ECA associated area must also comply with the requirements in § 1043.60.
(f) The following requirements apply to non-Party vessels:
(1) Non-Party vessels operating in U.S. navigable waters or the U.S. EEZ must comply with the operating and recordkeeping requirements of the 2008 Annex VI (incorporated by reference in § 1043.100) related to Regulations 13, 14 and 18 of the 2008 Annex VI. This paragraph (f)(1) does not address requirements of other portions of Annex VI.
(2) Non-Party vessels operating in an ECA or ECA associated area must also comply with the requirements in § 1043.60.
(g) A replacement engine may be exempted by EPA from Regulation 13 of Annex VI and the NO
X
-related requirements of this part if it is identical to the engine being replaced and the old engine was not subject to Regulation 13 of Annex VI. Send requests for such exemptions to the Designated Certification Officer.
(h) Compliance with the provisions of this part 1043 does not affect your responsibilities under 40 CFR part 1042 for engines subject to that part 1042.
§ 1043.40
EIAPP certificates.
(a) Engine manufacturers seeking EIAPP certificates for new engines to be used in U.S.-flagged vessels must apply to EPA for an EIAPP certificate in compliance with the requirements of this section (which references 40 CFR
part 1042). Note that under APPS engine manufacturers must comply with the applicable requirements of Regulation 13 of Annex VI to obtain a certificate. Note also that only the Administrator or the EPA official designated by the Administrator may issue EIAPP certificates on behalf of the U.S. Government.
(b) Persons other than engine manufacturers may apply for and obtain EIAPP certificates for new engines to be used in U.S.-flagged vessels by complying with the requirements of this section (which references 40 CFR part 1042) and the applicable requirements of Regulation 13 of Annex VI.
(c) In appropriate circumstances, EPA may issue an EIAPP certificate under this section for non-new engines or engines for vessels that will not initially be flagged in the U.S.
(d) EPA may issue both an EPA certificate and an EIAPP certificate for the same engine, as long as the manufacturer and the engine meet all applicable requirements. EPA may not issue an EIAPP certificate if the engine is certified with an FEL under 40 CFR part 1042 that is higher than the applicable NO
X
emission standard under Annex VI.
(e) The process for obtaining an EIAPP certificate is described in § 1043.41. That section references regulations in 40 CFR part 1042, which apply under the Clean Air Act. References in that part to certificates of conformity are deemed to mean EIAPP certificates. References in that part to the Clean Air Act as the applicable statute are deemed to mean 33 U.S.C. 1901-1915.
(f) For engines that undergo a major conversion or for engines installed on imported vessels that become subject to the requirements of this part, we may specify alternate certification provisions consistent with the intent of this part.
(g) This paragraph (g) applies for engines that were originally excluded from this part because they were intended for domestic use and were introduced into U.S. commerce without an EIAPP certificate. Note that such engines must be labeled as specified under 40 CFR 1042.135 to indicate that they are intended for domestic use. Such engines may be installed on vessels not intended only for domestic operation provided the engine manufacturer, vessel manufacturer, or vessel owner obtains an EIAPP certificate. Similarly, vessels originally intended only for domestic operation may be used internationally provided the engine manufacturer, vessel manufacturer, or vessel owner obtains an EIAPP certificate. The limitations for engine manufacturers described in paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section also apply for all EIAPP certificates issued under this paragraph (g). In either case, the Technical File must specify that the engine was originally certified for domestic use only, prior to being covered by an EIAPP certificate. Engine manufacturers may provide a supplemental label to clarify that the engine is no longer limited to domestic service. An engine manufacturer, vessel manufacturer, or vessel owner may also ask to apply the provisions of this paragraph (g) to engines originally certified for public vessels.

§ 1043.41
EIAPP certification process.
This section describes the process for obtaining the EIAPP certificate required by § 1043.40.
(a) You must send the Designated Certification Officer a separate application for an EIAPP certificate for each engine family. An EIAPP certificate is valid starting with the indicated effective date and is valid for any production until such time as the design of the engine family changes or more stringent emission standards become applicable, whichever comes first. Note that an EIAPP certificate demonstrating compliance with Tier I or Tier II standards (but not the Tier III standard) is only a limited authorization to install engines on vessels. For example, you may produce such Tier I or Tier II engines, but those engines may not be installed in vessels that are subject to Tier III standards. You may obtain preliminary approval of portions of the application under 40 CFR 1042.210.
(b) The application must contain all the information required by this part. It must not include false or incomplete statements or information (
see
40 CFR
1042.255). Include the information specified in 40 CFR 1042.205 except as follows:
(1) You must include the dates on which the test engines were built and the locations where the test engines were built.
(2) Include a copy of documentation required by this part related to maintenance and in-use compliance for operators, such as the Technical File and onboard NO
X
verification procedures as specified by the NO
X
Technical Code (incorporated by reference in § 1043.100).
(3) You are not required to provide information specified in 40 CFR 1042.205 regarding useful life, emission labels, deterioration factors, PM emissions, or not-to-exceed standards.
(4) You must include a copy of your warranty instructions, but are not required to describe how you will meet warranty obligations.
(c) We may ask you to include less information than we specify in this section as long as you maintain all the information required by paragraph (b) of this section.
(d) You must use good engineering judgment for all decisions related to your application (
see
40 CFR 1068.5).
(e) An authorized representative of your company must approve and sign the application.
(f)
See
40 CFR 1042.255 for provisions describing how we will process your application.
(g) Your application, including the Technical File and onboard NO
X
verification procedures, is subject to amendment as described in 40 CFR 1042.225.
(h) Perform emission tests as follows:
(1) Select an emission-data engine from each engine family for testing. For engines at or above 560 kW, you may use a development engine that is equivalent in design to the engine being certified. For Category 3 engines, you may use a single-cylinder version of the engine. Using good engineering judgment, select the engine configuration most likely to exceed an applicable emission standard, considering all exhaust emission constituents and the range of installation options available to vessel manufacturers.
(2) Test your emission-data engines using the procedures and equipment specified in 40 CFR part 1042, subpart F, or in the NO
X
Technical Code (incorporated by reference in § 1043.100). We may require that your test be witnessed by an EPA official.
(3) We may measure emissions from any of your test engines or other engines from the engine family, as follows:
(i) We may decide to do the testing at your plant or any other facility. You must deliver the test engine to any test facility we designate. The test engine you provide must include appropriate manifolds, aftertreatment devices, electronic control units, and other emission-related components not normally attached directly to the engine block. If we do the testing at your plant, you must schedule it as soon as possible and make available the instruments, personnel, and equipment we need.
(ii) If we measure emissions from one of your test engines, the results of that testing become the official emission results for the engine. Unless we later invalidate these data, we may decide not to consider your data in determining if your engine family meets applicable requirements.
(iii) Before we test one of your engines, we may set its adjustable parameters to any point within the specified adjustable ranges (
see
40 CFR 1042.115(d)).
(iv) Before we test one of your engines, we may calibrate it within normal production tolerances for anything we do not consider an adjustable parameter.
(4) We may require you to test a second engine of the same or different configuration in addition to the engine tested under paragraph (b) of this section.
(5) If you use an alternate test procedure under 40 CFR 1065.10 and later testing shows that such testing does not produce results that are equivalent to the procedures otherwise required by this part, we may reject data you generated using the alternate procedure.
(i) Collect emission data using measurements to one more decimal place than the applicable standard, then round the value to the same number of
decimal places as the emission standard. Compare the rounded emission levels to the emission standard for each emission-data engine.
(j) Your engine family is considered in compliance with the emission standards in Regulation 13 of Annex VI if all emission-data engines representing that family have test results showing emission levels at or below these standards. Your engine family is deemed not to comply if any emission-data engine representing that family has test results showing an emission level above an applicable emission standard for any pollutant.
(k) If we determine your application is complete and shows that the engines meet all the requirements of this part, we will issue an EIAPP certificate for your engines. We may make the approval subject to additional conditions.

§ 1043.50
Approval of methods to meet Tier 1 retrofit NO
X
standards.
Regulation 13 of Annex VI provides for certification of Approved Methods, which are retrofit procedures that enable Pre-Tier 1 engines to meet the Tier 1 NO
X
standard of regulation 13 of Annex VI. Any person may request approval of such a method by submitting an application for certification of an Approve Method to the Designated Certification Officer. If we determine that your application conforms to the requirements of Regulation 13 of Annex VI, we will issue a certificate and notify IMO that your Approved Method has been certified.
§ 1043.55
Applying equivalent controls instead of complying with fuel requirements.
Regulation 4 of Annex VI allows Administrations to approve the use of fuels not meeting the requirements of Regulation 14 of the Annex, provided the vessel applies a method that results in equivalent emission reductions. This section describes provisions related to applying this allowance.
(a) The U.S. Coast Guard is the approving authority under APPS for such equivalent methods for U.S.-flagged vessels.
(b) The provisions of this paragraph (b) apply for vessels equipped with controls certified by the U.S. Coast Guard or the Administration of a foreign-flag vessel to achieve emission levels equivalent to those achieved by the use of fuels meeting the applicable fuel sulfur limits of Regulation 14 of Annex VI. Fuels not meeting the applicable fuel sulfur limits of Regulation 14 of Annex VI may be used on such vessels consistent with the provisions of the IAPP certificate, APPS and Annex VI.
(c) Compliance with the requirements of this section does not affect the applicability of requirements or prohibitions specified by other statutes or regulations with respect to water pollution.

[75 FR 23013, Apr. 30, 2010, as amended at 80 FR 9113, Feb. 19, 2015; 85 FR 78468, Dec. 4, 2020]
§ 1043.80
Recordkeeping and reporting requirements for fuel suppliers.
Under APPS, fuel suppliers must provide bunker delivery notes to vessel operators for any fuel for an engine on any vessel identified in paragraph (a) of this section. Fuel suppliers must also keep copies of these records.
(a) The requirements of this section apply for fuel delivered to any of the following vessels:
(1) Vessels of 400 gross tonnage and above engaged in voyages to ports or offshore terminals under the jurisdiction of other Parties.
(2) Platforms and drilling rigs engaged in voyages to waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of other Parties.
(b) Except as allowed by paragraph (c) of this section, the bunker delivery note must contain the following:
(1) The name and IMO number of the receiving vessel.
(2) Port (or other description of the location, if the delivery does not take place at a port).
(3) Date the fuel is delivered to the vessel (or date on which the delivery begins where the delivery begins on one day and ends on a later day).
(4) Name, address, and telephone number of fuel supplier.
(5) Fuel type and designation under 40 CFR part 1090.
(6) Quantity in metric tons.

.
(8) Sulfur content in weight percent.
(9) A signed statement by an authorized representative of the fuel supplier certifying that the fuel supplied conforms to Regulations 14 and 18 of Annex VI consistent with its designation, intended use, and the date on which it is to be used. For example, with respect to conformity to Regulation 14 of Annex VI, a fuel designated and intended for use in an ECA any time on or after January 1, 2015 may not have a sulfur content above 0.10 weight percent. This statement is not required if the vessel is not subject to fuel standards of Regulation 14 of Annex VI. The statement described in this paragraph (b)(9) is deemed to be a submission to EPA.
(c) You may measure density and sulfur content according to the specifications of Annex VI, or according to other equivalent methods that we approve. Where the density and/or sulfur content of the delivered fuel cannot be measured, we may allow the use of alternate methods to specify the density and/or sulfur content of the fuel. For example, where fuel is supplied from multiple tanks on a supply vessel, we may allow the density and sulfur content of the fuel to be calculated as a weighted average of the measured densities and sulfur contents of the fuel that is supplied from each tank.

# Subpart A—Overview and Applicability
§ 1045.1
Does this part apply for my products?
(a) Except as provided in § 1045.5, the regulations in this part 1045 apply as follows:
(1) The requirements of this part related to exhaust emissions apply to new, spark-ignition propulsion marine engines beginning with the 2010 model year.
(2) The requirements of this part related to evaporative emissions apply to fuel lines and fuel tanks used with marine engines that use a volatile liquid fuel (such as gasoline) as specified in 40 CFR part 1045.112. This includes fuel lines and fuel tanks used with auxiliary marine engines. This also includes portable marine fuel tanks and associated fuel lines.
(b) We specify optional standards for certifying sterndrive/inboard engines before the 2010 model year in § 1045.145(a). Engines certified to these standards are subject to all the requirements of this part as if these optional standards were mandatory.
(c) Outboard and personal watercraft engines originally meeting the standards specified in appendix I of this part remain subject to those standards. Those engines remain subject to recall provisions as specified in 40 CFR part 1068, subpart F, throughout the useful life corresponding to the original certification. Also, tampering and defeat-device prohibitions continue to apply for those engines as specified in 40 CFR 1068.101.
(d) The provisions of §§ 1045.620 and 1045.801 apply for new engines used solely for competition beginning January 1, 2010.
[73 FR 59194, Oct. 8, 2008, as amended at 86 FR 34513, June 29, 2021]
§ 1045.2
Who is responsible for compliance?
The requirements and prohibitions of this part apply to manufacturers of engines and fuel-system components as described in § 1045.1. The requirements of this part are generally addressed to manufacturers subject to this part's requirements. The term “you” generally means the certifying manufacturer. For provisions related to exhaust emissions, this generally means the engine manufacturer, especially for issues related to certification (including production-line testing, reporting, etc.). For provisions related to certification with respect to evaporative emissions, this generally means the vessel manufacturer. Vessel manufacturers must meet applicable requirements as described in § 1045.20. Engine manufacturers must meet requirements related to evaporative emissions as described in § 1045.25.
§ 1045.5
Which engines are excluded from this part's requirements?
(a)
Auxiliary engines.
The exhaust emission standards of this part do not apply to auxiliary marine engines. See 40 CFR part 90, 1048, or 1054 for the exhaust emission standards that apply. Evaporative emission standards apply as specified in § 1045.112.
(b)
Hobby engines and vessels.
This part does not apply with respect to reduced-scale models of vessels that are not capable of transporting a person.
(c)
Large natural gas engines.
Propulsion marine engines powered by natural gas with maximum engine power at or above 250 kW are deemed to be compression-ignition engines. These engines are therefore subject to all the requirements of 40 CFR part 1042 instead of this part even if they would otherwise meet the definition of “spark-ignition” in § 1045.801.
§ 1045.10
How is this part organized?
This part 1045 is divided into the following subparts:
(a) Subpart A of this part defines the applicability of this part 1045 and gives an overview of regulatory requirements.
(b) Subpart B of this part describes the emission standards and other requirements that must be met to certify
engines under this part 1045. Note that § 1045.145 discusses certain interim requirements and compliance provisions that apply only for a limited time.
(c) Subpart C of this part describes how to apply for a certificate of conformity.
(d) Subpart D of this part describes general provisions for testing production-line engines.
(e) Subpart E of this part describes general provisions for testing in-use engines.
(f) Subpart F of this part describes how to test your engines (including references to other parts of the Code of Federal Regulations).
(g) Subpart G of this part and 40 CFR part 1068 describe requirements, prohibitions, and other provisions that apply to engine manufacturers, vessel manufacturers, owners, operators, rebuilders, and all others.
(h) Subpart H of this part describes how you may generate and use exhaust and evaporative emission credits to certify your engines and vessels.
(i) Subpart I of this part contains definitions and other reference information.
§ 1045.15
Do any other CFR parts apply to me?
(a) Part 1060 of this chapter describes standards and procedures that apply for controlling evaporative emissions from engines fueled by gasoline or other volatile liquid fuels and the associated fuel systems. See § 1045.112 for information about how that part applies.
(b) Part 1065 of this chapter describes procedures and equipment specifications for testing engines to measure exhaust emissions. Subpart F of this part 1045 describes how to apply the provisions of part 1065 of this chapter to determine whether engines meet the exhaust emission standards in this part.
(c) The requirements and prohibitions of part 1068 of this chapter apply to everyone, including anyone who manufactures, imports, installs, owns, operates, or rebuilds any of the engines subject to this part 1045, or vessels powered by these engines. Part 1068 of this chapter describes general provisions, including these seven areas:
(1) Prohibited acts and penalties for engine manufacturers, vessel manufacturers, and others.
(2) Rebuilding and other aftermarket changes.
(3) Exclusions and exemptions for certain engines.
(4) Importing engines.
(5) Selective enforcement audits of your production.
(6) Defect reporting and recall.
(7) Procedures for hearings.
(d) Other parts of this chapter apply if referenced in this part 1045.
§ 1045.20
What requirements apply to my vessels?
(a) If you manufacture vessels with engines certified to the exhaust emission standards in this part, your vessels must meet all emission standards with the engine and fuel system installed.
(b) You may need to certify your vessels or fuel systems as described in 40 CFR 1060.1 and 1060.601. If you produce vessels subject to this part without obtaining a certificate, you must still meet the requirements of 40 CFR 1060.101(e) and (f) and keep records as described in 40 CFR 1060.210.
(c) You must identify and label vessels you produce under this section consistent with the requirements of § 1045.135 and 40 CFR part 1060.
(d) You must follow all emission-related installation instructions from the certifying manufacturers as described in § 1045.130 and 40 CFR 1068.105. If you do not follow the installation instructions, we may consider your vessel to be not covered by the certificates of conformity. Introduction of such vessels into U.S. commerce violates 40 CFR 1068.101.
§ 1045.25
How do the requirements related to evaporative emissions apply to engines and their fuel systems?
(a) Engine manufacturers must provide the installation instructions required by § 1045.130 to the ultimate purchasers of the engine. These instructions may be combined with the maintenance instructions required by § 1045.125.
(b) Engines sold with attached fuel lines or installed fuel tanks must be covered by the appropriate certificates
of conformity issued under 40 CFR part 1060.
(c) Fuel lines intended to be used with new engines and new portable marine fuel tanks must be certified to the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 1060. Similarly, fuel tanks intended to be used with new engines must be certified to the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 1060.
(d) All persons installing engines certified under this part 1045 must follow the certifying manufacturer's emission-related installation instructions (see § 1045.130 and 40 CFR 1068.105).
§ 1045.30
Submission of information.
(a) This part includes various requirements to record data or other information. Refer to § 1045.825 and 40 CFR 1068.25 regarding recordkeeping requirements. If recordkeeping requirements are not specified, store these records in any format and on any media and keep them readily available for one year after you send an associated application for certification, or one year after you generate the data if they do not support an application for certification. You must promptly send us organized, written records in English if we ask for them. We may review them at any time.
(b) The regulations in § 1045.255 and 40 CFR 1068.101 describe your obligation to report truthful and complete information and the consequences of failing to meet this obligation. This includes information not related to certification.
(c) Send all reports and requests for approval to the Designated Compliance Officer (see § 1045.801).
(d) Any written information we require you to send to or receive from another company is deemed to be a required record under this section. Such records are also deemed to be submissions to EPA. We may require you to send us these records whether or not you are a certificate holder.

# Subpart B—Emission Standards and Related Requirements
§ 1045.101
What exhaust emission standards and requirements must my engines meet?
(a) You must show that your engines meet the following requirements:
(1) Outboard and personal watercraft engines must meet the exhaust emission standards specified in § 1045.103.
(2) Sterndrive/inboard engines must meet the exhaust emission standards specified in § 1045.105. You may optionally meet these standards earlier than we require, as specified in § 1045.145(b).
(3) Sterndrive/inboard engines must meet the engine-diagnostic requirements in § 1045.110.
(4) All engines must meet the requirements in § 1045.115.
(b) It is important that you read § 1045.145 to determine if there are other interim requirements or interim compliance provisions that apply for a limited time.
§ 1045.103
What exhaust emission standards must my outboard and personal watercraft engines meet?
(a) Duty-cycle emission standards. Starting in the 2010 model year, exhaust emissions from your outboard and personal watercraft engines may not exceed emission standards as follows:
(1) Measure emissions using the applicable steady-state test procedures described in subpart F of this part.
(2) The exhaust emission standards from the following table apply:

emission standard to the nearest 0.1 g/kW-hr; round the calculated CO emission standard to the nearest g/kW-hr. Determine maximum engine power for the engine family as described in § 1045.140.
(b)
Averaging, banking, and trading.
You may generate or use emission credits under the averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program described in subpart H of this part for demonstrating compliance with HC + NO
X
emission standards. For CO emissions, you may generate or use emission credits for averaging as described in subpart H of this part, but such credits may not be banked or traded. To generate or use emission credits, you must specify a family emission limit for each pollutant you include in the ABT program for each engine family. These family emission limits serve as the emission standards for the engine family with respect to all required testing instead of the standards specified in this section. An engine family meets emission standards even if its family emission limit is higher than the standard, as long as you show that the whole averaging set of applicable engine families meets the emission standards using emission credits and the engines within the family meet the family emission limit. The following FEL caps apply:
(1) For engines with maximum engine power at or below 4.3 kW, the maximum value of the family emission limit for HC + NO
X
is 81.0 g/kW-hr. For all other engines, the maximum value of the family emission limit for HC + NO

(c)
Not-to-exceed emission standards.
Exhaust emissions may not exceed the not-to-exceed standards specified in § 1045.107.
(d)
Fuel types.
The exhaust emission standards in this section apply for engines using the fuel type on which the engines in the engine family are designed to operate. You must meet the numerical emission standards for hydrocarbons in this section based on the following types of hydrocarbon emissions for engines powered by the following fuels:
(1) Alcohol-fueled engines: THCE emissions.
(2) Natural gas-fueled engines: NMHC emissions.
(3) Other engines: THC emissions.
(e)
Useful life.
Your engines must meet the exhaust emission standards in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section over the full useful life as follows:
(1) For outboard engines, the minimum useful life is 350 hours of engine operation or 10 years, whichever comes first.
(2) For personal watercraft engines, the minimum useful life is 350 hours of engine operation or 5 years, whichever comes first.
(3) You must specify a longer useful life in terms of hours for the engine family if the average service life of your vehicles is longer than the minimum value, as follows:
(i) Except as allowed by paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, your useful life (in hours) may not be less than either of the following:
(A) Your projected operating life from advertisements or other marketing materials for any engines in the engine family.
(B) Your basic mechanical warranty for any engines in the engine family.
(ii) Your useful life may be based on the average service life of vehicles in the engine family if you show that the average service life is less than the useful life required by paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, but more than the minimum useful life (350 hours of engine operation). In determining the actual average service life of vehicles in an engine family, we will consider all available information and analyses. Survey data is allowed but not required to make this showing.
(f)
Applicability for testing.
The duty-cycle emission standards in this subpart apply to all testing performed according to the procedures in § 1045.505, including certification, production-line, and in-use testing. The not-to-exceed standards apply for all testing performed according to the procedures of subpart F of this part.

You may not generate or use emission credits for high-performance engines. You may generate or use emission credits under the averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program described in subpart H of this part for demonstrating compliance with HC + NO
X
and CO emission standards for conventional sterndrive-inboard engines. To generate or use emission credits, you must specify a family emission limit for each pollutant you include in the ABT program for each engine family. These family emission limits serve as the emission standards for the engine family with respect to all required testing instead of the standards specified in this section. An engine family meets emission standards even if its family emission limit is higher than the standard, as long as you show that the whole averaging set of applicable engine families meets the emission standards using emission credits and the engines within the family meet the family emission limit. Family emission limits for conventional sterndrive/inboard engines may not be higher than 16.0 g/kW-hr for HC + NO
X
and 150 g/kW-hr for CO except as specified in § 1045.145(c).
(c)
Not-to-exceed emission standards.
Exhaust emissions may not exceed the not-to-exceed standards specified in § 1045.107 for conventional sterndrive/inboard engines. These standards do not apply for high-performance engines.
(d)
Fuel types.
The exhaust emission standards in this section apply for engines using the fuel type on which the engines in the engine family are designed to operate. You must meet the numerical emission standards for hydrocarbons in this section based on the following types of hydrocarbon emissions for engines powered by the following fuels:
(1) Alcohol-fueled engines: THCE emissions.
(2) Natural gas-fueled engines: NMHC emissions.
(3) Other engines: THC emissions.
(e)
Useful life.
Your engines must meet the exhaust emission standards in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section over their full useful life, as follows:
(1) For high-performance engines with maximum engine power above 485 kW, the useful life is 50 hours of operation or 1 year, whichever comes first. For high-performance engines with maximum engine power at or below 485
kW, the useful life is 150 hours of operation or 3 years, whichever comes first.
(2) For conventional sterndrive/inboard engines, the minimum useful life is 480 hours of operation or ten years, whichever comes first. However, you may request in your application for certification that we approve a shorter useful life for an engine family. We may approve a shorter useful life, in hours of engine operation but not in years, if we determine that these engines will rarely operate longer than the shorter useful life. If engines identical to those in the engine family have already been produced and are in use, your demonstration must include documentation from such in-use engines. In other cases, your demonstration must include an engineering analysis of information equivalent to such in-use data, such as data from research engines or similar engine models that are already in production. Your demonstration must also include any overhaul interval that you recommend, any mechanical warranty that you offer for the engine or its components, and any relevant customer design specifications. Your demonstration may include any other relevant information. The useful life value may not be shorter than any of the following:
(i) 150 hours of operation.
(ii) Your recommended overhaul interval.
(iii) Your mechanical warranty for the engine.
(3) You must specify a longer useful life for conventional sterndrive/inboard engines in terms of hours if the average service life of engines from the engine family is longer than the minimum useful life value, as follows:
(i) Except as allowed by paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, your useful life (in hours) may not be less than either of the following:
(A) Your projected operating life from advertisements or other marketing materials for any engines in the engine family.
(B) Your basic mechanical warranty for any engines in the engine family.
(ii) Your useful life may be based on the average service life of engines in the engine family if you show that the average service life is less than the useful life required by paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, but more than the minimum useful life (480 hours of engine operation). In determining the actual average service life of engines in an engine family, we will consider all available information and analyses. Survey data is allowed but not required to make this showing.
(f)
Applicability for testing.
The duty-cycle emission standards in this section apply to all testing performed according to the procedures in § 1045.505, including certification, production-line, and in-use testing. The not-to-exceed standards apply for all testing performed according to the procedures of subpart F of this part.
§ 1045.107
What are the not-to-exceed emission standards?
Not-to-exceed emission standards apply as follows:
(a) Measure emissions using the not-to-exceed procedures in subpart F of this part:
(b) Determine the not-to-exceed standard, rounded to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard in Table 1 to this section from the following equation:
Not-to-exceed standard = (STD) × (M)
Where:
STD = The standard specified in paragraph (a) of this section if you certify without using ABT for that pollutant; or the FEL for that pollutant if you certify using ABT.
M = The NTE multiplier for that pollutant, as defined in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.
(c) For engines equipped with a catalyst, use NTE multipliers from the following table across the applicable zone specified in § 1045.515:

§ 1045.110
How must my engines diagnose malfunctions?
The following engine-diagnostic requirements apply for engines equipped with three-way catalysts and closed-loop control of air-fuel ratios:
(a)
Equip your engines with a diagnostic system.
Equip each engine with a diagnostic system that will detect significant malfunctions in its emission control system using one of the following protocols:
(1) If your emission control strategy depends on maintaining air-fuel ratios at stoichiometry, an acceptable diagnostic design would identify a malfunction whenever the air-fuel ratio does not cross stoichiometry for one minute of intended closed-loop operation. You may use other diagnostic strategies if we approve them in advance.
(2) If the protocol described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to your engine, you must use an alternative approach that we approve in advance. Your alternative approach must generally detect when the emission control system is not functioning properly.
(3) Diagnostic systems approved by the California Air Resources Board for use with sterndrive/inboard engines fully satisfy the requirements of this section.
(b)
Use a malfunction indicator.
The malfunction indicator must be designed such that the operator can readily see or hear it; visible signals may be any color except red. Visible malfunction indicators must display “Check Engine,” “Service Engine Soon,” or a similar message that we approve. The malfunction indicator must go on under each of the following circumstances:
(1) When a malfunction occurs, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
(2) When the diagnostic system cannot send signals to meet the requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(3) When the engine's ignition is in the “key-on” position before starting or cranking. The malfunction indicator should turn off after engine starting if the system detects no malfunction.
(c)
Control when the malfunction can turn off.
If the malfunction indicator goes on to show a malfunction, it must remain on during all later engine operation until servicing corrects the malfunction. If the engine is not serviced, but the malfunction does not recur for three consecutive engine starts during which the malfunctioning system is evaluated and found to be working properly, the malfunction indicator may stay off during later engine operation.
(d)
Store trouble codes in computer memory.
Record and store in computer memory any diagnostic trouble codes showing a malfunction that should activate the malfunction indicator. The stored codes must identify the malfunctioning system or component as uniquely as possible. Make these codes available through the data link connector as described in paragraph (g) of this section. You may store codes for conditions that do not activate the malfunction indicator. The system must store a separate code to show when the diagnostic system is disabled (from malfunction or tampering).
(e)
Make data, access codes, and devices accessible.
Make all required data accessible to us without any access codes or devices that only you can supply. Ensure that anyone servicing your engine can read and understand the diagnostic trouble codes stored in the onboard computer with generic tools and information.
(f)
Consider exceptions for certain conditions.
Your diagnostic systems may disregard trouble codes for the first three minutes after engine starting. You may ask us to approve diagnostic-system designs that disregard trouble codes under other conditions that would produce an unreliable reading, damage systems or components, or cause other safety risks.
(g)
Follow standard references for formats, codes, and connections.
Follow conventions defined in SAE J1939-05 (incorporated by reference in § 1045.810) or ask us to approve using updated versions of (or variations from) this standard.
§ 1045.112
What are the standards for evaporative emissions?
Fuel systems must meet the evaporative emission requirements of 40 CFR part 1060 as specified in this section. These standards apply over a useful life period of five years for personal watercraft and ten years for all other vessels and for portable marine fuel tanks.
(a)
Fuel line permeation.
Nonmetal fuel lines must meet the permeation requirements specified in 40 CFR 1060.102 for EPA NRFL fuel lines as described in this paragraph (a).
(1) Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, the emission standard for fuel lines starts for vessels or portable marine fuel tanks with a date of manufacture on or after January 1, 2009.
(2) The emission standard for primer bulbs applies starting January 1, 2011.
(3) The emission standard for under-cowl fuel lines used with outboard engines apply over a phase-in period as specified in this paragraph (a)(3).
(i) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the phase-in period is based on total length of fuel lines as specified in Table 1 to this section. For example, at least 30 percent of the length of under-cowl fuel lines used on your full lineup of 2010 model year outboard engines must meet the specified permeation standards. See § 1045.145(k) for administrative requirements related to this phase-in.

(ii) You may instead meet the permeation standards of this paragraph (a) by complying with the specified standards with 100 percent of your under-cowl fuel lines across your full lineup of 2011 model year outboard engines. In this case, the requirements of this part would not apply to under-cowl fuel lines before the 2011 model year. To use this option, you must notify the Designated Compliance Officer before December 31, 2009 of your intent to meet permeation standards on all your under-cowl fuel lines in the 2011 model year.
(b)
Tank permeation.
Fuel tanks must meet the permeation requirements specified in 40 CFR 1060.103. Portable marine fuel tanks must meet permeation standards starting January 1, 2011. Fuel tanks for personal watercraft must meet permeation standards starting in the 2011 model year. Other installed fuel tanks must meet permeation standards starting in the 2012 model year. Vessel manufacturers may generate or use emission credits to show compliance with the requirements of this paragraph under the averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program, as described in subpart H of this part. Starting in the 2014 model year for personal watercraft and in the 2015 model year for other installed fuel tanks, family emission limits may not exceed 5.0 g/m
2
/day if testing occurs at a nominal temperature of 28 °C, or 8.3 g/m
2
/day if testing occurs at a nominal temperature of 40 °C. These FEL caps do not apply to fuel caps that are certified separately to meet permeation standards. Portable marine fuel tank manufacturers may not generate or use emission credits under subpart H of this part.
(c)
Running loss.
The running loss requirements specified in 40 CFR part 1060 do not apply.
(d)
Diurnal emissions.
Installed fuel tanks must meet the diurnal emission requirements specified in 40 CFR 1060.105. Fuel tanks for personal watercraft must meet diurnal emission standards starting in the 2010 model year. Other installed fuel tanks must meet diurnal emission standards for vessels produced on or after July 31, 2011, except as allowed by § 1045.625. Fuel tanks meeting the definition of
portable marine fuel tank
in § 1045.801
must comply with the diurnal requirements specified in 40 CFR part 1060 starting January 1, 2010.
(e)
Other requirements.
The requirements of 40 CFR 1060.101(e) and (f) apply to vessel manufacturers even if they do not obtain a certificate.
(f)
Engine manufacturers.
To the extent that engine manufacturers produce engines with fuel lines or fuel tanks, those fuel-system components must meet the requirements specified in this section. The timing of new standards is based on the date of manufacture of the engine.
§ 1045.115
What other requirements apply?
The following requirements apply with respect to engines that are required to meet the emission standards of this part:
(a)
Crankcase emissions.
Crankcase emissions may not be discharged directly into the ambient atmosphere from any engine throughout its useful life.
(b)
Torque broadcasting.
Starting in the 2013 model year, electronically controlled engines must broadcast their speed and output shaft torque (in newton-meters). Engines may alternatively broadcast a surrogate value for determining torque. Engines must broadcast engine parameters such that they can be read with a remote device, or broadcast them directly to their controller area networks. Your broadcasting protocol must allow for valid measurements using the field-testing procedures in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart J.
(c)
EPA access to broadcast information.
If we request it, you must provide us any hardware or tools we would need to readily read, interpret, and record all information broadcast by an engine's on-board computers and electronic control modules. If you broadcast a surrogate parameter for torque values, you must provide us what we need to convert these into torque units. We will not ask for hardware or tools if they are readily available commercially.
(d)
Altitude adjustments.
Engines must meet applicable emission standards for valid tests conducted under the ambient conditions specified in 40 CFR 1065.520. Engines must meet applicable emission standards at all specified atmospheric pressures, except that for atmospheric pressures below 94.0 kPa you may rely on an altitude kit for all testing if you meet the requirements specified in § 1054.205(s). If your rely on an altitude kit for certification, you must identify in the owners manual the altitude range for which you expect proper engine performance and emission control with and without the altitude kit; you must also state in the owners manual that operating the engine with the wrong engine configuration at a given altitude may increase its emissions and decrease fuel efficiency and performance.
(e)
Adjustable parameters.
Engines that have adjustable parameters must meet all the requirements of this part for any adjustment in the practically adjustable range. We may require that you set adjustable parameters to any specification within the practically adjustable range during any testing, including certification testing, production-line testing, or in-use testing. General provisions for adjustable parameters apply as specified in 40 CFR 1068.50.
(f)
Prohibited controls.
You may not design your engines with emission control devices, systems, or elements of design that cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety while operating. For example, an engine may not emit a noxious or toxic substance it would otherwise not emit that contributes to such an unreasonable risk.
(g)
Defeat devices.
You may not equip your engines with a defeat device. A defeat device is an auxiliary emission control device that reduces the effectiveness of emission controls under conditions that the engine may reasonably be expected to encounter during normal operation and use. This does not apply for altitude kits installed or removed consistent with § 1045.655. This also does not apply to auxiliary emission control devices you identify in your application for certification if any of the following is true:
(1) The conditions of concern were substantially included in the applicable duty-cycle test procedures described in subpart F of this part.
(2) You show your design is necessary to prevent engine (or vessel) damage or accidents. For example, you may design your engine to include emergency operating modes (sometimes known as limp-home operation) that would allow a vessel to return to land in the event of a malfunction even if such operating modes result in higher emissions.
(3) The reduced effectiveness applies only to starting the engine.

§ 1045.120
What emission-related warranty requirements apply to me?
(a)
General requirements.
You must warrant to the ultimate purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that the new engine, including all parts of its emission control system, meets two conditions:
(1) It is designed, built, and equipped so it conforms at the time of sale to the ultimate purchaser with the requirements of this part.
(2) It is free from defects in materials and workmanship that may keep it from meeting these requirements.
(b)
Warranty period.
Your emission-related warranty must be valid during the periods specified in this paragraph (b). You may offer an emission-related warranty more generous than we require. The emission-related warranty for an engine may not be shorter than any published warranty you offer without charge for that engine. Similarly, the emission-related warranty for any component may not be shorter than any published warranty you offer without charge for that component. If an engine has no hour meter, we base the warranty periods in this paragraph (b) only on the engine's age (in years). The warranty period begins when the engine is placed into service.
(1) The minimum warranty period for outboard engines is 175 hours of engine operation or 5 years, whichever comes first. The minimum warranty period for personal watercraft engines is 175 hours of engine operation or 30 months, whichever comes first.
(2) The minimum warranty period for sterndrive/inboard engines is shown in the following table:

The warranty period expires after the specified time period or number of operating hours, whichever comes first.
(c)
Components covered.
The emission-related warranty covers all components whose failure would increase an engine's emissions of any regulated pollutant, including components listed in 40 CFR part 1068, Appendix I, and components from any other system you develop to control emissions. The emission-related warranty covers these components even if another company produces the component. Your emission-related warranty does not cover components whose failure would not increase an engine's emissions of any regulated pollutant.
(d)
Limited applicability.
You may deny warranty claims under this section if the operator caused the problem through improper maintenance or use, as described in 40 CFR 1068.115.
(e)
Owners manual.
Describe in the owners manual the emission-related warranty provisions from this section that apply to the engine.
§ 1045.125
What maintenance instructions must I give to buyers?
Give the ultimate purchaser of each new engine written instructions for properly maintaining and using the engine, including the emission control system as described in this section. The maintenance instructions also apply to service accumulation on your emission-data engines as described in § 1045.245 and in 40 CFR part 1065.
(a)
Critical emission-related maintenance.
Critical emission-related maintenance includes any adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of critical emission-related components. This may also include additional emission-related maintenance that you determine is critical if we approve it in advance. You may schedule critical emission-related maintenance on these components if you meet the following conditions:
(1) You demonstrate that the maintenance is reasonably likely to be done at the recommended intervals on in-use engines. We will accept scheduled maintenance as reasonably likely to occur if you satisfy any of the following conditions:
(i) You present data showing that any lack of maintenance that increases emissions also unacceptably degrades the engine's performance.
(ii) You present survey data showing that at least 80 percent of engines in the field get the maintenance you specify at the recommended intervals.
(iii) You provide the maintenance free of charge and clearly say so in your maintenance instructions.
(iv) You otherwise show us that the maintenance is reasonably likely to be done at the recommended intervals.
(2) You may not schedule critical emission-related maintenance within the useful life period for aftertreatment devices, pulse-air valves, fuel injectors, oxygen sensors, electronic control units, superchargers, or turbochargers, except as specified in paragraph (a)(3), (b), or (c) of this section.
(3) You may ask us to approve a maintenance interval shorter than that specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In your request you must describe the proposed maintenance step, recommend the maximum feasible interval for this maintenance, include your rationale with supporting evidence to support the need for the maintenance at the recommended interval, and demonstrate that the maintenance will be done at the recommended interval on in-use engines. In considering your request, we will evaluate the information you provide and any other available information to establish alternate specifications for maintenance intervals, if appropriate.
(b)
Recommended additional maintenance.
You may recommend any additional amount of maintenance on the components listed in paragraph (a) of this section, as long as you state clearly that these maintenance steps are not necessary to keep the emission-related warranty valid. If operators do the maintenance specified in paragraph (a) of this section, but not the recommended additional maintenance, this does not allow you to disqualify those engines from in-use testing or deny a warranty claim. Do not take these maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data engines.
(c)
Special maintenance.
You may specify more frequent maintenance to address problems related to special situations, such as atypical engine operation. You must clearly state that this additional maintenance is associated with the special situation you are addressing. We may disapprove your maintenance instructions if we determine that you have specified special maintenance steps to address engine operation that is not atypical, or that the maintenance is unlikely to occur in use. If we determine that certain maintenance items do not qualify as special maintenance under this paragraph (c), you may identify this as recommended additional maintenance under paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Noncritical emission-related maintenance.
Subject to the provisions of this paragraph (d), you may schedule any amount of emission-related inspection or maintenance that is not covered by paragraph (a) of this section (i.e., maintenance that is neither explicitly identified as critical emission-related maintenance, nor that we approve as critical emission-related maintenance). Noncritical emission-related maintenance generally includes changing spark plugs, re-seating valves, or any other emission-related maintenance on the components we specify in 40 CFR part 1068, Appendix I that is not covered in paragraph (a) of this section. You must state in the owners manual that these steps are not necessary to keep the emission-related warranty
valid. If operators fail to do this maintenance, this does not allow you to disqualify those engines from in-use testing or deny a warranty claim. Do not take these inspection or maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data engines.
(e)
Maintenance that is not emission-related.
For maintenance unrelated to emission controls, you may schedule any amount of inspection or maintenance. You may also take these inspection or maintenance steps during service accumulation on your emission-data engines, as long as they are reasonable and technologically necessary. This might include adding engine oil, changing air, fuel, or oil filters, servicing engine-cooling systems, and adjusting idle speed, governor, engine bolt torque, valve lash, or injector lash. You may perform this nonemission-related maintenance on emission-data engines at the least frequent intervals that you recommend to the ultimate purchaser (but not the intervals recommended for severe service).
(f)
Source of parts and repairs.
State clearly on the first page of your written maintenance instructions that a repair shop or person of the owner's choosing may maintain, replace, or repair emission control devices and systems. Your instructions may not require components or service identified by brand, trade, or corporate name. Also, do not directly or indirectly condition your warranty on a requirement that the engine be serviced by your franchised dealers or any other service establishments with which you have a commercial relationship. You may disregard the requirements in this paragraph (f) if you do one of two things:
(1) Provide a component or service without charge under the purchase agreement.
(2) Get us to waive this prohibition in the public's interest by convincing us the engine will work properly only with the identified component or service.
(g)
Payment for scheduled maintenance.
Owners are responsible for properly maintaining their engines. This generally includes paying for scheduled maintenance. However, manufacturers must pay for scheduled maintenance during the useful life if it meets all the following criteria:
(1) Each affected component was not in general use on similar engines before the applicable dates shown in paragraph (5) of the definition of
new propulsion marine engine
in § 1045.801.
(2) The primary function of each affected component is to reduce emissions.
(3) The cost of the scheduled maintenance is more than 2 percent of the price of the engine.
(4) Failure to perform the maintenance would not cause clear problems that would significantly degrade the engine's performance.
(h)
Owners manual.
Explain the owner's responsibility for proper maintenance in the owners manual.

§ 1045.130
What installation instructions must I give to vessel manufacturers?
(a) If you sell an engine for someone else to install in a vessel, give the engine installer instructions for installing it consistent with the requirements of this part. Include all information necessary to ensure that an engine will be installed in its certified configuration.
(b) Make sure the instructions have the following information:
(1) Include the heading: “Emission-related installation instructions”.
(2) State: “Failing to follow these instructions when installing a certified engine in a vessel violates federal law (40 CFR 1068.105(b)), subject to fines or other penalties as described in the Clean Air Act.”
(3) Describe the instructions needed to properly install the exhaust system and any other components. Include instructions consistent with the requirements of § 1045.205(u) related to in-use measurement and the requirements of § 1045.655 related to altitude kits.
(4) Describe the steps needed to control evaporative emissions as described in § 1045.112. This will generally require notification that the installer and/or vessel manufacturer must meet the requirements of § 1045.112 and 40 CFR part 1060.
(5) Describe any necessary steps for installing the diagnostic system described in § 1045.110.
(6) Describe any limits on the range of applications needed to ensure that the engine operates consistently with your application for certification. For example, if your engines are certified only for personal watercraft, tell vessel manufacturers not to install the engines in vessels longer than 4.0 meters.
(7) Describe any other instructions to make sure the installed engine will operate according to design specifications in your application for certification. For example, this may include specified limits for catalyst systems, such as exhaust backpressure, catalyst location, and temperature profiles during engine operation.
(8) State: “If you install the engine in a way that makes the engine's emission control information label hard to read during normal engine maintenance, you must place a duplicate label on the vessel, as described in 40 CFR 1068.105.”
(c) You do not need installation instructions for engines you install in your own vessels.
(d) Provide instructions in writing or in an equivalent format. For example, you may post instructions on a publicly available Web site for downloading or printing. If you do not provide the instructions in writing, explain in your application for certification how you will ensure that each installer is informed of the installation requirements.
§ 1045.135
How must I label and identify the engines I produce?
The provisions of this section apply to engine manufacturers.
(a) Assign each engine a unique identification number and permanently affix, engrave, or stamp it on the engine in a legible way.
(b) At the time of manufacture, affix a permanent and legible label identifying each engine. The label must be—
(1) Attached in one piece so it is not removable without being destroyed or defaced.
(2) Secured to a part of the engine needed for normal operation and not normally requiring replacement.
(3) Durable and readable for the engine's entire life.
(4) Written in English.
(c) The label must—
(1) Include the heading “EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION”.
(2) Include your full corporate name and trademark. You may identify another company and use its trademark instead of yours if you comply with the provisions of § 1045.640.
(3) Include EPA's standardized designation for the engine family (and subfamily, where applicable).
(4) State the engine's displacement (in liters) and maximum engine power (in kW); however, you may omit the displacement from the label if all the engines in the engine family have the same per-cylinder displacement and total displacement.
(5) State the date of manufacture [DAY (optional), MONTH, and YEAR]; however, you may omit this from the label if you stamp, engrave, or otherwise permanently identify it elsewhere on the engine, in which case you must also describe in your application for certification where you will identify the date on the engine.
(6) State the FELs to which the engines are certified (in g/kW-hr) if certification depends on the ABT provisions of subpart H of this part.
(7) Identify the emission control system. Use terms and abbreviations as described in 40 CFR 1068.45. You may omit this information from the label if there is not enough room for it and you put it in the owners manual instead.
(8) List specifications and adjustments for engine tuneups; however, you may omit this information from the label if there is not enough room for it and you put it in the owners manual instead.
(9) Identify the fuel type and any requirements for fuel and lubricants; however, you may omit this information from the label if there is not enough room for it and you put it in the owners manual instead.
(10) State: “THIS MARINE ENGINE COMPLIES WITH U.S. EPA EXHAUST REGULATIONS FOR [MODEL YEAR].”
(11) If your durability demonstration for sterndrive/inboard engines is limited to fresh water, state: “THIS ENGINE IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN SALTWATER.”
(d) You may add information to the emission control information label as follows:
(1) You may identify other emission standards that the engine meets or does not meet (such as California standards). You may include this information by adding it to the statement we specify or by including a separate statement.
(2) You may add other information to ensure that the engine will be properly maintained and used.
(3) You may add appropriate features to prevent counterfeit labels. For example, you may include the engine's unique identification number on the label.
(e) You may ask us to approve modified labeling requirements in this part 1045 if you show that it is necessary or appropriate. We will approve your request if your alternate label is consistent with the requirements of this part.
(f) If you obscure the engine label while installing the engine in the vessel such that the label cannot be read during normal maintenance, you must place a duplicate label on the vessel. If others install your engine in their vessels in a way that obscures the engine label, we require them to add a duplicate label on the vessel (see 40 CFR 1068.105); in that case, give them the number of duplicate labels they request and keep the following records for at least five years:
(1) Written documentation of the request from the vessel manufacturer.
(2) The number of duplicate labels you send for each engine family and the date you sent them.
§ 1045.140
What is my engine's maximum engine power?
(a) An engine configuration's maximum engine power is the maximum brake power point on the nominal power curve for the engine configuration, as defined in this section. Round the power value to the nearest whole kilowatt for engines above 30 kW and to the nearest 0.1 kilowatt for engines at or below 30 kW.
(b) The nominal power curve of an engine configuration is the relationship between maximum available engine brake power and engine speed for an engine, using the mapping procedures of 40 CFR part 1065, based on the manufacturer's design and production specifications for the engine. This information may also be expressed by a torque curve that relates maximum available engine torque with engine speed.
(c) The nominal power curve must be within the range of the actual power curves of production engines considering normal production variability. If after production begins it is determined that your nominal power curve does not represent production engines, we may require you to amend your application for certification under § 1045.225.
(d) Maximum engine power for an engine family is generally the weighted average value of maximum engine power of each engine configuration within the engine family based on your total U.S.-directed production volume of engines you produce from the engine family. However, alternative approaches for defining an engine family's maximum engine power apply in the following circumstances:
(1) For outboard or personal watercraft engines for which you neither generate nor use emission credits, you may identify the greatest value for maximum engine power from all the different configurations within the engine family to determine the appropriate emission standard under § 1045.103.
(2) For high-performance engines, you must use the smallest value for maximum engine power from all the different configurations within the engine family to determine the standards and other requirements that apply under this subpart B.

§ 1045.145
Are there interim provisions that apply only for a limited time?
The provisions in this section apply instead of other provisions in this part.
This section describes how and when these interim provisions apply.
(a)-(g) [Reserved]
(h)
Carryover of California ARB emission data.
The provisions of 40 CFR 1065.10(c)(5) allow for the use of emission data generated for the California Air Resources Board as the basis for EPA certification. For sterndrive/inboard engines certified in California before the 2010 model year, you may use such emission data as the basis for meeting the standards of § 1045.105, as long as you meet the conditions specified in § 1045.235(d).
(i)-(m) [Reserved]
(n)
Continued use of 40 CFR part 91 test data.
You may continue to use test data based on the test procedures that applied for engines built before the requirements of this part started to apply if we allow you to use carryover emission data under § 1045.235(d) for your engine family. You may also use those test procedures for production-line testing with any engine family whose certification is based on testing with those procedures. For any EPA testing, we will rely on the procedures described in subpart F of this part, even if you used carryover data based on older test procedures as allowed under this paragraph (n).
(o)
Banking early credits for jet boat engines.
Banked emission credits that were originally generated from outboard and personal watercraft engines under 40 CFR part 91 may be used to certify jet boat engines under the provisions § 1045.660.

# Subpart C—Certifying Engine Families
§ 1045.201
What are the general requirements for obtaining a certificate of conformity?
Engine manufacturers must certify their engines with respect to the exhaust emission standards in this part. Manufacturers of engines, equipment, or fuel-system components may need to certify their products with respect to evaporative emission standards as described in 40 CFR 1060.1 and 1060.601. The following general requirements apply for obtaining a certificate of conformity:
(a) You must send us a separate application for a certificate of conformity for each engine family. A certificate of conformity is valid starting with the indicated effective date but it is not valid for any production after December 31 of the model year for which it is issued. No certificate will be issued after December 31 of the model year.
(b) The application must contain all the information required by this part and must not include false or incomplete statements or information (see § 1045.255).
(c) We may ask you to include less information than we specify in this subpart as long as you maintain all the information required by § 1045.250.
(d) You must use good engineering judgment for all decisions related to your application (see 40 CFR 1068.5).

§ 1045.205
What must I include in my application?
This section specifies the information that must be in your application, unless we ask you to include less information under § 1045.201(c). We may require you to provide additional information to evaluate your application.
(a) Describe the engine family's specifications and other basic parameters of the engine's design and emission controls. List the fuel type on which your engines are designed to operate (for example, all-season gasoline). List
each distinguishable engine configuration in the engine family. For each engine configuration, list the maximum engine power and the range of values for maximum engine power resulting from production tolerances, as described in § 1045.140. Describe why your engines qualify as high-performance engines, if applicable.
(b) Explain how the emission control systems operate. Describe in detail all system components for controlling exhaust emissions, including all auxiliary emission control devices (AECDs) and all fuel-system components you will install on any production or test engine. Identify the part number of each component you describe. For this paragraph (b), treat as separate AECDs any devices that modulate or activate differently from each other. Include sufficient detail to allow us to evaluate whether the AECDs are consistent with the defeat device prohibition of § 1045.115.
(c) Explain how the engine diagnostic system works, if applicable, describing especially the engine conditions (with the corresponding diagnostic trouble codes) that cause the malfunction indicator to go on. Propose the conditions under which the diagnostic system should disregard trouble codes, as described in § 1045.110(f).
(d) Describe the engines you selected for testing and the reasons for selecting them.
(e) Describe the test equipment and procedures that you used, including any special or alternate test procedures you used.
(f) Describe how you operated the emission-data engine before testing, including the duty cycle and the number of engine operating hours used to stabilize emission levels. Explain why you selected the method of service accumulation. Describe any scheduled maintenance you did.
(g) List the specifications of the test fuel to show that it falls within the required ranges we specify in 40 CFR part 1065.
(h) Identify the engine family's useful life.
(i) Include the maintenance and warranty instructions you will give to the ultimate purchaser of each new engine (see §§ 1045.120 and 1045.125).
(j) Include the emission-related installation instructions you will provide if someone else installs your engines in a vessel (see § 1045.130).
(k) Describe your emission control information label (see § 1045.135).
(l) Identify the emission standards or FELs to which you are certifying engines in the engine family.
(m) Identify the engine family's deterioration factors and describe how you developed them (see § 1045.245). Present any emission test data you used for this.
(n) State that you operated your emission-data engines as described in the application (including the test procedures, test parameters, and test fuels) to show you meet the requirements of this part.
(o) Present emission data to show that you meet emission standards, as follows:
(1) Present emission data by mode for hydrocarbons (such as THC or THCE, as applicable), NO
X
, and CO on an emission-data engine to show your engines meet the duty-cycle emission standards we specify in §§ 1045.103(a) and 1045.105(a). Show weighted emission figures before and after applying deterioration factors for each engine. If we specify more than one grade of any fuel type (for example, low-temperature and all-season gasoline), you need to submit test data only for one grade, unless the regulations of this part specify otherwise for your engine.
(2) Note that §§ 1045.235 and 1045.245 allow you to submit an application in certain cases without new emission data.
(p) State that all the engines in the engine family comply with the not-to-exceed emission standards we specify in subpart B of this part for all normal operation and use when tested as specified in § 1045.515, if applicable. Describe any relevant testing, engineering analysis, or other information in sufficient detail to support your statement.
(q) Report test results as follows:
(1) Report all test results involving measurement of pollutants for which emission standards apply. Include test results from invalid tests or from any other tests, whether or not they were conducted according to the test procedures of subpart F of this part. We may
ask you to send other information to confirm that your tests were valid under the requirements of this part and 40 CFR parts 1060 and 1065.
(2) Report measured CO
2
, N
2
O, and CH
4
as described in § 1045.235. Small-volume engine manufacturers may omit reporting N
2
O and CH
4
.
(r) Describe all adjustable operating parameters (see § 1045.115(e)), including production tolerances. For any operating parameters that do not qualify as adjustable parameters, include a description supporting your conclusion (see 40 CFR 1068.50(c)). Include the following in your description of each adjustable parameter:
(1) For practically adjustable parameters, include the nominal or recommended setting, the intended practically adjustable range, and the limits or stops used to establish adjustable ranges. State that the limits, stops, or other means of inhibiting adjustment are effective in preventing adjustment of parameters on in-use engines to settings outside your intended practically adjustable ranges and provide information to support this statement.
(2) For programmable operating parameters, state that you have restricted access to electronic controls to prevent parameter adjustments on in-use engines that would allow operation outside the practically adjustable range. Describe how your engines are designed to prevent unauthorized adjustments.
(s) Describe how your engines comply with emission standards at varying atmospheric pressures. Include a description of altitude kits you design to comply with the requirements of § 1045.115(d). Identify the part number of each component you describe. Identify the altitude range for which you expect proper engine performance and emission control with and without the altitude kit. State that your engines will comply with applicable emission standards throughout the useful life with the altitude kit installed according to your instructions. Describe any relevant testing, engineering analysis, or other information in sufficient detail to support your statement. In addition, describe your plan for making information and parts available such that you would reasonably expect that altitude kits would be widely used in the high-altitude counties specified in 40 CFR part 1068, Appendix III. For example, engine owners should have ready access to information describing when an altitude kit is needed and how to obtain this service. Similarly, parts and service information should be available to qualified service facilities in addition to authorized service centers if that is needed for owners to have such altitude kits installed locally.
(t) Provide the information needed to read, record, and interpret all the information broadcast by an engine's onboard computers and electronic control units. State that, upon request, you will give us any hardware, software, or tools we would need to do this. If you broadcast a surrogate parameter for torque values, you must provide us what we need to convert these into torque units. You may reference any appropriate publicly released standards that define conventions for these messages and parameters. Format your information consistent with publicly released standards.
(u) Confirm that your emission-related installation instructions specify how to ensure that sampling of exhaust emissions will be possible after engines are installed in vessels and placed in service. Show how to sample exhaust emissions in a way that prevents diluting the exhaust sample with ambient air.
(v) Unconditionally certify that all the engines in the engine family comply with the requirements of this part, other referenced parts of the CFR, and the Clean Air Act.
(w) Include good-faith estimates of U.S.-directed production volumes. Include a justification for the estimated production volumes if they are substantially different than actual production volumes in earlier years for similar models.
(x) Include the information required by other subparts of this part. For example, include the information required by § 1045.725 if you participate in the ABT program.
(y) Include other applicable information, such as information specified in this part or 40 CFR part 1068 related to requests for exemptions.
(z) Name an agent for service located in the United States. Service on this agent constitutes service on you or any of your officers or employees for any action by EPA or otherwise by the United States related to the requirements of this part.
(aa) For imported engines, identify the following:
(1) The port(s) at which you have imported engines over the previous 12 months.
(2) The names and addresses of the agents you have authorized to import your engines.
(3) The location of a test facility in the United States where you can test your engines if we select them for testing under a selective enforcement audit, as specified in 40 CFR part 1068, subpart E.

§ 1045.210
May I get preliminary approval before I complete my application?
If you send us information before you finish the application, we will review it and make any appropriate determinations, especially for questions related to engine family definitions, auxiliary emission control devices, deterioration factors, testing for service accumulation, maintenance, and compliance with not-to-exceed standards. Decisions made under this section are considered to be preliminary approval, subject to final review and approval. We will generally not reverse a decision where we have given you preliminary approval, unless we find new information supporting a different decision. If you request preliminary approval related to the upcoming model year or the model year after that, we will make the appropriate determinations as soon as practicable. We will generally not provide preliminary approval related to a future model year more than two years ahead of time.
§ 1045.220
How do I amend the maintenance instructions in my application?
You may amend your emission-related maintenance instructions after you submit your application for certification as long as the amended instructions remain consistent with the provisions of § 1045.125. You must send the Designated Compliance Officer a written request to amend your application for certification for an engine family if you want to change the emission-related maintenance instructions in a way that could affect emissions. In your request, describe the proposed changes to the maintenance instructions. If operators follow the original maintenance instructions rather than the newly specified maintenance, this does not allow you to disqualify those engines from in-use testing or deny a warranty claim.
(a) If you are decreasing or eliminating any specified maintenance, you may distribute the new maintenance instructions to your customers 30 days after we receive your request, unless we disapprove your request. This would generally include replacing one maintenance step with another. We may approve a shorter time or waive this requirement.
(b) If your requested change would not decrease the specified maintenance, you may distribute the new maintenance instructions anytime after you send your request.
(c) You need not request approval if you are making only minor corrections (such as correcting typographical mistakes), clarifying your maintenance instructions, or changing instructions for maintenance unrelated to emission control. We may ask you to send us copies of maintenance instructions revised under this paragraph (c).

§ 1045.225
How do I amend my application for certification to include new or modified engines or change an FEL?
Before we issue you a certificate of conformity, you may amend your application to include new or modified engine configurations, subject to the provisions of this section. After we have issued your certificate of conformity, you may send us an amended application requesting that we include new or modified engine configurations within the scope of the certificate, subject to the provisions of this section.
You must amend your application if any changes occur with respect to any information included in your application.
(a) You must amend your application before you take any of the following actions:
(1) Add an engine configuration to an engine family. In this case, the engine configuration added must be consistent with other engine configurations in the engine family with respect to the criteria listed in § 1045.230.
(2) Change an engine configuration already included in an engine family in a way that may affect emissions, or change any of the components you described in your application for certification. This includes production and design changes that may affect emissions any time during the engine's lifetime.
(3) Modify an FEL for an engine family as described in paragraph (f) of this section.
(b) To amend your application for certification, send the Designated Compliance Officer the following information:
(1) Describe in detail the addition or change in the engine model or configuration you intend to make.
(2) Include engineering evaluations or data showing that the amended engine family complies with all applicable requirements. You may do this by showing that the original emission-data engine is still appropriate for showing that the amended family complies with all applicable requirements.
(3) If the original emission-data engine for the engine family is not appropriate to show compliance for the new or modified engine configuration, include new test data showing that the new or modified engine configuration meets the requirements of this part.
(c) We may ask for more test data or engineering evaluations. You must give us these within 30 days after we request them.
(d) For engine families already covered by a certificate of conformity, we will determine whether the existing certificate of conformity covers your newly added or modified engine. You may ask for a hearing if we deny your request (see § 1045.820).
(e) For engine families already covered by a certificate of conformity, you may start producing the new or modified engine configuration anytime after you send us your amended application and before we make a decision under paragraph (d) of this section. However, if we determine that the affected engines do not meet applicable requirements, we will notify you to cease production of the engines and may require you to recall the engines at no expense to the owner. Choosing to produce engines under this paragraph (e) is deemed to be consent to recall all engines that we determine do not meet applicable emission standards or other requirements and to remedy the nonconformity at no expense to the owner. If you do not provide information required under paragraph (c) of this section within 30 days after we request it, you must stop producing the new or modified engines.
(f) You may ask us to approve a change to your FEL in certain cases after the start of production. The changed FEL may not apply to engines you have already introduced into U.S. commerce, except as described in this paragraph (f). If we approve a changed FEL after the start of production, you must include the new FEL on the emission control information label for all engines produced after the change. You may ask us to approve a change to your FEL in the following cases:
(1) You may ask to raise your FEL for your engine family at any time. In your request, you must show that you will still be able to meet the emission standards as specified in subparts B and H of this part. If you amend your application by submitting new test data to include a newly added or modified engine, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, use the appropriate FELs with corresponding production volumes to calculate emission credits for the model year, as described in subpart H of this part. In all other circumstances, you must use the higher FEL for the entire family to calculate emission credits under subpart H of this part.
(2) You may ask to lower the FEL for your engine family only if you have test data from production engines showing that emissions are below the
proposed lower FEL. The lower FEL applies only to engines you produce after we approve the new FEL. Use the appropriate FELs with corresponding production volumes to calculate emission credits for the model year, as described in subpart H of this part.
§ 1045.230
How do I select engine families?
(a) For purposes of certification, divide your product line into families of engines that are expected to have similar emission characteristics throughout their useful life as described in this section. Your engine family is limited to a single model year.
(b) Group engines into the same engine family if they are the same in all the following aspects:
(1) The combustion cycle and fuel. See paragraph (e) of this section for special provisions that apply for dual-fuel engines.
(2) Method of air aspiration (for example, turbocharged vs. naturally aspirated).
(3) The number, location, volume, and composition of catalytic converters.
(4) The number, arrangement (such as in-line or vee configuration), and approximate bore diameter of cylinders.
(5) Method of control for engine operation, other than governing (i.e., mechanical or electronic).
