Pt. 734, Supp. No. 1

# Supplement No. 1 to Part 734—Model Certification for Purposes of the FDP Rule
(a)
General.
This supplement is included in the EAR to assist exporters, reexporters, and transferors in determining whether the items being exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) are subject to the EAR based on one or more of the Foreign Direct Product (FDP) rules under § 734.9. The model certificate provided by BIS in supplement no. 1 to this part is not required under the EAR, but through its provision, the certificate may assist exporters, reexporters, and transferors with the process of resolving potential red flags regarding whether an item is subject to the EAR based on one or more of the FDP rules under § 734.9. The model certificate provided in this supplement by BIS contemplates signature by an official or designated employee of the certifying company and inclusion of the information described in paragraph (b) of this supplement. The certificate may be provided by any entity in a supply chain or by an exporter, reexporter, or transferor of the item. For example, the certificate may be provided by an exporter, reexporter, or transferor to any other entity later in a supply chain. Similarly, any entity later in a supply chain may request a certificate from an exporter, reexporter, or transferor earlier in a supply chain. Any certification relied on for this part must be retained pursuant to recordkeeping provisions in part 762 of the EAR. Obtaining the certification set forth in this supplement no. 1 to part 734 does not relieve exporters, reexporters and transferors of their obligation to exercise due diligence in determining whether items are subject to the EAR, including by following the “Know Your Customer” guidance in supplement no. 3 to part 732 of the EAR.
(b)
Model criteria.
A certification will be most useful if it meets the criteria described in this supplement and if it contains at least the following information:
(1) The certification must be signed by an organization official specifically authorized to certify the document as being accurate and complete. The certifying official attests that the information herein supplied in response to this paragraph is complete and correct to the best of his/her “knowledge.”
(2) The organization [INSERT NAME OF THE CERTIFYING OFFICIAL'S COMPANY] has reviewed the criteria for the foreign direct product (FDP) rules under § 734.9 the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR 730-774) and attests that from the certifying official's “knowledge” of the item, [INSERT A DESCRIPTION OF THE ITEMS], provided to [INSERT NAME OF THIS CUSTOMER], are subject to the EAR if future transactions are within the country/destination and/or end use scope or end-user scope of one or more of the following FDP rules [include whichever ones are applicable]:
(i) Country scope of § 734.9(b)(2),
i.e.,
exported or reexported to or transferred within a destination listed in Country Group D:1, E:1, or E:2 (see supplement no.1 to part 740 of the EAR);
(ii) Country scope of § 734.9(c)(2),
i.e.,
exported or reexported to or transferred within a destination listed in Country Group D:5, E:1, or E:2 (see supplement no.1 to part 740 of the EAR);
(iii) Country scope of § 734.9(d)(2),
i.e.,
exported or reexported to or transferred within a destination listed in Country Group D:1, D:3, D:4, D:5, E:1, or E:2 (see supplement no.1 to part 740 of the EAR);
(iv) End-user scope of § 734.9(e)(1)(ii) or (e)(2)(ii) for a Footnote 1 or Footnote 4 entity, respectively (see supplement no. 4 to part 744);
(v) Destination scope of § 734.9(f)(2),
i.e.,
exported or reexported to or transferred within Russia, Belarus, or the temporarily occupied Crimea region of Ukraine or will be incorporated into or used in the “production” or “development” of any “part,” “component,” or “equipment” specified in any ECCN on the CCL or in supplement no. 6 or 7 to part 746 of the EAR and produced in or destined to Russia, Belarus, or the temporarily occupied Crimea region of Ukraine;
(vi) End-user scope of § 734.9(g)(2) for a Footnote 3 entity (see supplement no. 4 to part 744);
(vii) Destination and end-use scope of § 734.9(h)(2),
i.e.,
the foreign-produced item is: destined to a destination specified in Country Groups D:1, D:4, or D:5, excluding any destination also specified in Country Groups A:5 or A:6, or will be incorporated into any “part,” “component,” “computer,” or “equipment” not designated EAR99 that is destined to a destination specified in Country Groups D:1, D:4, or D:5, excluding any destination also specified in Country Groups A:5 or A:6, or worldwide to an entity headquartered in, or whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in, either a destination specified in Country Groups D:1, D:4, or D:5, excluding any destination also specified in Country Groups A:5 or A:6; or technology developed by an entity headquartered in, or whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in, either Country Groups D:1, D:4, or D:5, excluding any destination also specified in Country Groups A:5 or A:6, for the “production” of a mask or an integrated circuit wafer or die;
(viii) Country and end-use scope of § 734.9(i)(2),
i.e.,
used in the design, “development,” “production,” operation, installation (including on-site installation), maintenance (checking), repair, overhaul, or refurbishing of, a “supercomputer” located in or destined to the People's Republic of China (PRC) or Macau; or incorporated into, or used in the “development,” or “production,” of any “part,” “component,” or “equipment” that will be used in a “supercomputer” located in or destined to the PRC or Macau;
(ix) Destination scope of § 734.9(j)(2),
i.e.,
is destined to Iran or will be incorporated into or used in the “production” or “development” of any “part,” “component,” or “equipment,” including any modified or designed “components,” “parts,” “accessories,” and “attachments” therefor, identified in supplement no. 7 to part 746 of the EAR or is specified in any ECCN on the CCL in Categories 3 through 5 or 7 of the CCL that is located in or destined to Iran;
and
(3) My organization affirms its commitment to comply with all applicable requirements under the EAR.
[INSERT NAME(S) OF CONSIGNEE(S) OR EXPORTER(S), REEXPORTERS), OR TRANSFERORS AS APPLICABLE].
[INSERT DATE(S) SIGNED]
Note 1 to paragraph (b):
When multiple consignees engaged in a production process (or other type of collaborative activity, such as joint development) will be exporting, reexporting, transferring, or receiving items subject to the EAR, a single model certification statement for multiple consignees may be used.
(c)
Additional information.
Because this is only a model certification, parties to the transaction may add additional elements to the certification and/or use it for multiple purposes as part of their compliance program. For example, if a company has ten affiliated companies in a multi-step supply chain, instead of obtaining a model certification for each export, reexport, or transfer (in-country), the exporter, reexporter, or transferor may request all ten parties to sign the certification, if appropriate, which may further reduce the burden on parties participating in the supply chain.

Pt. 734, Supp. No. 2

# Supplement No. 2 to Part 734—Guidelines for
De Minimis

# Rules
(a) Calculation of the value of controlled U.S.-origin content in foreign-made items is to be performed for the purposes of § 734.4 of this part, to determine whether the percentage of U.S.-origin content is
de minimis.
(Note that you do not need to make these calculations if the foreign made item does not require a license to the destination in question.) Use the following guidelines to perform such calculations:
(1)
U.S.-origin controlled content.
To identify U.S.-origin controlled content for purposes of the
de minimis
rules, you must determine the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) of each U.S.-origin item incorporated into a foreign-made product. Then, you must identify which, if any, of those U.S.-origin items would require a license from BIS if they were to be exported or reexported (in the form in which you received them) to the foreign-made product's country of destination. For purposes of identifying U.S.-origin controlled content, you should consult the Commerce Country Chart in supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR and controls described in part 746 of the EAR (excluding U.S.-origin content that meets the criteria in § 746.7(a)(1)(v) or § 746.8(a)(12)(iii)(B)). Part 744 of the EAR should not be used to identify controlled U.S. content for purposes of determining the applicability of the
de minimis
rules. In identifying U.S.-origin controlled content, do not take account of commodities, software, or technology that could be exported or reexported to the country of destination without a license (designated as “NLR”) or under License Exception GBS (see part 740 of the EAR). Commodities subject only to short supply controls are not included in calculating U.S. content.

# Note to paragraph (
a

# )(1):
U.S.-origin controlled content is considered ‘incorporated’ for
de minimis
purposes if the U.S.-origin controlled item is: Essential to the functioning of the foreign equipment; customarily included in sales of the foreign equipment; and reexported with the foreign produced item. U.S.-origin software may be ‘bundled’ with foreign produced commodities; see § 734.4 of this part. For purposes of determining
de minimis
levels, technology and source code
used to design or produce foreign-made commodities or software are not considered to be incorporated into such foreign-made commodities or software.
(2)
Value of U.S.-origin controlled content.
The value of the U.S.-origin controlled content shall reflect the fair market price of such content in the market where the foreign product is being produced. In most cases, this value will be the same as the actual cost to the foreign manufacturer of the U.S.-origin commodity, technology, or software. When the foreign manufacturer and the U.S. supplier are affiliated and have special arrangements that result in below-market pricing, the value of the U.S.-origin controlled content should reflect fair market prices that would normally be charged to unaffiliated customers in the same foreign market. If fair market value cannot be determined based upon actual arms-length transaction data for the U.S.-origin controlled content in question, then you must determine another reliable valuation method to calculate or derive the fair market value. Such methods may include the use of comparable market prices or costs of production and distribution. The EAR do not require calculations based upon any one accounting system or U.S. accounting standards. However, the method you use must be consistent with your business practice.
(3)
Foreign-made product value
—(i)
General.
The value of the foreign-made product shall reflect the fair market price of such product in the market where the foreign product is sold. In most cases, this value will be the same as the actual cost to a buyer of the foreign-made product. When the foreign manufacturer and the buyer of their product are affiliated and have special arrangements that result in below-market pricing, the value of the foreign-made product should reflect fair market prices that would normally be charged to unaffiliated customers in the same foreign market. If fair market value cannot be determined based upon actual arms-length transaction data for the foreign-made product in question, then you must determine another reliable valuation method to calculate or derive the fair market value. Such methods may include the use of comparable market prices or costs of production and distribution. The EAR do not require calculations based upon any one accounting system or U.S. accounting standards. However, the method you use must be consistent with your business practice.
(ii)
Foreign-Made Software.
In calculating the value of foreign-made software for purposes of the
de minimis
rules, you may make an estimate of future sales of that foreign software. The total value of foreign-made software will be the sum of: The value of actual sales of that software based on orders received at the time the foreign software incorporates U.S.-origin content and, if applicable; and an estimate of all future sales of that software.

# Note to paragraph (
a

# )(3):
Regardless of the accounting systems, standard, or conventions you use in the operation of your business, you may not depreciate reported fair market values or otherwise reduce fair market values through related accounting conventions. Values may be historic or projected. However, you may rely on projected values only to the extent that they remain consistent with your documentation.
(4)
Calculating percentage value of U.S.-origin items.
To determine the percentage value of U.S-origin controlled content incorporated in, commingled with, or “bundled” with the foreign produced item, divide the total value of the U.S.-origin controlled content by the foreign-made item value, then multiply the resulting number times 100. If the percentage value of incorporated U.S.-origin items is equal to or less than the
de minimis
level described in § 734.4 of the EAR, then the foreign-made item is not subject to the EAR.
(b)
One-time report.
As stated in paragraphs (c) and (d) of § 734.4, a one-time report is required before reliance on the
de minimis
rules for technology. The purpose of the report is solely to permit the U.S. Government to evaluate whether U.S. content calculations were performed correctly.
(1)
Contents of report.
You must include in your report a description of the scope and nature of the foreign technology that is the subject of the report and a description of its fair market value, along with the rationale and basis for the valuation of such foreign technology. Your report must indicate the country of destination for the foreign technology reexports when the U.S.-origin controlled content exceeds 10%, so that BIS can evaluate whether the U.S.-origin controlled content was correctly identified based on paragraph (a)(1) of this Supplement. The report does not require information regarding the end-use or end-users of the reexported foreign technology. You must include in your report the name, title, address, telephone number, E-mail address, and facsimile number of the person BIS may contact concerning your report.
(2)
Submission of report.
You must submit your report to BIS using one of the following methods:
(i) E-mail:
rpd2@bis.doc.gov
;
(ii) Fax: (202) 482-3355; or
(iii) Mail or Hand Delivery/Courier: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Regulatory Policy Division, 14th and Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230.
(3)
Report and wait.
If you have not been contacted by BIS concerning your report within thirty days after filing the report
with BIS, you may rely upon the calculations described in the report unless and until BIS contacts you and instructs you otherwise. BIS may contact you with questions concerning your report or to indicate that BIS does not accept the assumptions or rationale for your calculations. If you receive such a contact or communication from BIS within thirty days after filing the report with BIS, you may not rely upon the calculations described in the report, and may not use the
de minimis
rules for technology that are described in § 734.4 of this part, until BIS has indicated that such calculations were performed correctly.

§ 736.1
Introduction.
In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. A person may undertake transactions subject to the EAR without a license or other authorization, unless the regulations affirmatively state such a requirement. As such, if an export, reexport, or activity is subject to the EAR, the general prohibitions contained in this part and the License Exceptions specified in part 740 of the EAR must be reviewed to determine if a license is necessary. In the case of all exports from the United States, you must document your export as described in part 762 of the EAR regarding recordkeeping and clear your export through the U.S. Customs Service as described in part 758 of the EAR regarding export clearance requirements. Also note that for short supply controls all prohibitions and License Exceptions are in part 754 of the EAR.
(a) In this part we tell you:
(1) The facts that make your proposed export, reexport, or conduct subject to these general prohibitions, and
(2) The ten general prohibitions.
(b) Your obligations under the ten general prohibitions and under the EAR depend in large part upon the five types of information described in § 736.2(a) of this part and upon the general prohibitions described in § 736.2(b) of this part. The ten general prohibitions contain cross-references to other parts of the EAR that further define the breadth of the general prohibitions. For that reason, this part is not freestanding. In part 732, we provide certain steps you may follow in proper order to help you understand the general prohibitions and their relationship to other parts of the EAR.
(c) If you violate any of these ten general prohibitions, or engage in other conduct contrary to the Export Administration Act, the EAR, or any order, license, License Exception, or authorization issued thereunder, as described in part 764 of the EAR regarding enforcement, you will be subject to the sanctions described in that part.
§ 736.2
General prohibitions and determination of applicability.
(a)
Information or facts that determine the applicability of the general prohibitions.
The following five types of facts determine your obligations under the ten general prohibitions and the EAR generally (also see other parts of the EAR where the license requirements and other EAR restrictions are specified in greater detail):
(1)
Classification of the item.
The classification of the item on the Commerce Control List (see part 774 of the EAR) or description of the item in supplements no. 2, 4, or 6 to part 746 of the EAR. For guidance on classifying items, see the Commerce Control List Order of Review in supplement no. 4 to part 774 and for determining licensing requirements using the Commerce Control List in supplement no. 1 to part 774
and the Commerce Country Chart in supplement no. 1 to part 738, see § 738.4;

# Note 1 to paragraph (
a

# )(1):
The description of items in supplements no. 2, 4, or 6 of part 746 are used for determining license requirements for Russia and Belarus under §§ 746.5 and 746.10. Items described in supplements no. 2, 4, or 6 in most cases are designated as EAR99 (subject to the EAR but not specifically listed on the Commerce Control List).
(2)
Destination.
The country of ultimate destination for an export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) (see parts 738 and 774 of the EAR concerning the Country Chart and the Commerce Control List for export and reexport license requirements and part 746 for additional license requirements based on embargoes and other special controls for exports, reexports, or certain transfers (in-country));
(3)
End user or end use.
The ultimate end user (see General Prohibition Four (paragraph (b)(4) of this section) and supplement no. 1 to part 764 of the EAR for references to persons with whom your transaction may not be permitted; see General Prohibition Five (Paragraph (b)(5) of this section) and part 744 for references to end users for whom you may need an export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) license). Certain EAR requirements (
e.g.,
§§ 734.9(e), 744.11(a)), and 744.15(b)) extend to all parties to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f). Many of the end-use controls in part 744 specify destinations or Country Groups as part of the criteria for defining the scope of the end use controls.
(4)
End-use.
The ultimate end-use (see General Prohibition Five (paragraph (b)(5) of this section) and part 744 of the EAR for general end-use restrictions); and
(5)
Conduct.
Conduct such as contracting, financing, and freight forwarding in support of a proliferation project or a 'military-intelligence end use' or a 'military-intelligence end user,' as described in part 744 of the EAR.
(b)
General prohibitions.
The following ten general prohibitions describe certain exports, reexports, transfers (in-country), and other conduct, subject to the scope of the EAR, in which you may not engage unless you either have a license from the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) or qualify under part 740 of the EAR for a License Exception from each applicable general prohibition in this paragraph. The License Exceptions at part 740 of the EAR apply only to General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports in the Form Received), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced “Direct Product” Reexports); however, selected License Exceptions are specifically referenced and authorized in part 746 of the EAR concerning embargo destinations and in § 744.2(c) of the EAR regarding nuclear end-uses and in § 744.11 and in supplement no. 4 to part 744—Entity List.
(1)
General Prohibition One—Export and reexport of controlled items to listed countries (Exports and Reexports).
You may not, without a license or License Exception, export any item subject to the EAR to another country or reexport any item of U.S.-origin if each of the following is true:
(i) The item is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable Export Control Classification Number (ECCN), and
(ii) Export to the country of destination requires a license for the control reason as indicated on the Country Chart at part 738 of the EAR. (The scope of this prohibition is determined by the correct classification of your item and the ultimate destination as that combination is reflected on the Country Chart.)
1
Note that each License Exception described at part 740 of the EAR supersedes General Prohibition One if all terms and conditions of a given License Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.
1
See part 738 of the EAR for selected controls that are not specified on the Country Chart.
(2)
General Prohibition Two—Reexport and export from abroad of foreign-made items incorporating more than a de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content (U.S. Content Reexports).
(i) You may not, without a license or license exception, reexport or export from abroad foreign-made commodities that incorporate controlled U.S.-origin commodities, foreign-made commodities that are “bundled” with controlled U.S.-origin software, foreign-made software that is commingled with controlled
U.S.-origin software, or foreign-made technology that is commingled with controlled U.S.-origin technology if such items require a license according to any of the provisions in the EAR and incorporate or are commingled with more than a
de minimis
amount of controlled U.S. content, as defined in § 734.4 of the EAR concerning the scope of the EAR.
(A) It incorporates more than the
de minimis
amount of controlled U.S. content, as defined in § 734.4 of the EAR concerning the scope of the EAR;
(B) It is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable ECCN; and
(C) Its export to the country of destination requires a license for that control reason as indicated on the Country Chart. (The scope of this prohibition is determined by the correct classification of your foreign-made item and the ultimate destination, as that combination is reflected on the Country Chart.)
(ii) Each License Exception described in part 740 of the EAR supersedes General Prohibition Two if all terms and conditions of a given License Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.
(3)
General Prohibition Three—Foreign-direct product (FDP) rules
. (i) You may not, without a license or license exception, export from abroad, reexport, or transfer (in-country) foreign-“direct products” or other foreign-produced items subject to the EAR pursuant to § 734.9 if such items are subject to a license requirement in part 736, 742, 744, 746, or 764 of the EAR.
(ii) Each license exception described in part 740 of the EAR supersedes General Prohibition Three if all terms and conditions of a given license exception are met and none of the restrictions of § 740.2 or § 744.11(a) apply.
(4)
General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders)—Engaging in actions prohibited by a denial order.
(i) You may not take any action that is prohibited by a denial order issued under part 766 of the EAR, Administrative Enforcement Proceedings. These orders prohibit many actions in addition to direct exports by the person denied export privileges, including some transfers within a single country, either in the United States or abroad, by other persons. You are responsible for ensuring that any of your transactions in which a person who is denied export privileges is involved do not violate the terms of the order. Orders denying export privileges are published in the
Federal Register
when they are issued and are the legally controlling documents in accordance with their terms. BIS also maintains compilations of persons denied export privileges on its Web site at
http://www.bis.doc.gov.
BIS may, on an exceptional basis, authorize activity otherwise prohibited by a denial order. See § 764.3(a)(2) of the EAR.
(ii) There are no License Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR that authorize conduct prohibited by this General Prohibition Four.
(5)
General Prohibition Five—Export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to prohibited end-uses or end-users (End-Use End-User).
You may not, without a license, knowingly export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) any item subject to the EAR to an end user or end use that is prohibited by part 744 of the EAR. Each section in part 744 specifies whether the license requirements extend to exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country).

Pt. 736, Supp. No. 1

# Supplement No. 1 to Part 736—General Orders
Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 73447, Oct. 25, 2023.
(a) General Order No. 1:
General Order No. 1 of September 16, 1998; Establishing a 24-month validity period on reexport authorizations issued without a validity period and revoking those exceeding that period.
(1) Reexport authorizations issued within 24-months of the General Order. All reexport authorizations issued with no validity period within the 24-months preceding September 16, 1998 shall be deemed to have an expiration date which shall be the date 24-months from the date of issuance of the reexport authorization or November 16, 1998, whichever is longer.
(2) Reexport authorizations issued before the 24-month period preceding the General Order. For reexport authorizations issued with no validity period before the 24-month period preceding September 16, 1998:
(i) Effective September 16, 1998, all such outstanding reexport authorizations for terrorist-supporting countries (see parts 742 and 746 of the EAR) are revoked.
(ii) Effective November 16, 1998, all other such outstanding reexport authorizations are revoked.
(3) Extensions. If necessary, you may request extensions of such authorizations according to procedures set forth in § 750.7(g) of the EAR.
(4) Specific Notice from BIS. If you have received, or should you receive, specific notice from BIS with regard to a reexport authorization covered by this General Order, informing you of a revocation, suspension, or revision (including validity period) of any such reexport authorization, then the terms of that specific notice will be controlling.
(5) Definition of “authorization”. The term “authorization” as used in this General Order encompasses the range of reexport authorizations granted by BIS, which includes licenses, individual letters, and other types of notifications.
(b) General Order No. 2:
General Order No. 2; section 5(b) of the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 (SAA) gives the President authority to waive the application of certain prohibitions set forth in the SAA if the President determines that it is in the national security interest of the United States to do so. The President made such a determination in Executive Order 13338, finding that it was “in the national security interest of the United States to waive application of subsection 5(a)(1) and 5(a)(2)(A) of the SAA so as to permit the exportation or reexportation of certain items as specified in the Department of Commerce's General Order No. 2.” The President's reference to General Order No. 2 addresses applications to export and reexport the following items, which are considered on a case-by-case basis as opposed to the general policy of denial set forth in section 746.9 of the Regulations: Items in support of activities, diplomatic or otherwise, of the United States Government (to the extent that regulation of such exportation or reexportation would not fall within the President's constitutional authority to conduct the nation's foreign affairs); medicine (on the CCL) and medical devices (both as defined in part 772 of the EAR); parts and components intended to ensure the safety of civil aviation and the safe operation of commercial passenger aircraft; aircraft chartered by the Syrian Government for the transport of Syrian Government officials on official Syrian Government business; telecommunications equipment and associated computers, software and technology; items in support of United Nations operations in Syria; and items necessary for the support of the Syrian people, including, but not limited to, items related to water supply and sanitation, agricultural production and food processing, power generation, oil and gas production, construction and engineering, transportation, and educational infrastructure. The
total dollar value of each approved license for aircraft parts for flight safety normally will be limited to no more than $2 million over the 24-month standard license term, except in the case of complete overhauls.

# Note to General Order No. 2:
The controls for exports and reexports to Syria are set forth in § 746.9 of the EAR.
(c) General Order No. 3:
General Order No. 3 of July 22, 2015. Certain licenses issued by BIS prior to July 22, 2015 contain conditions that restrict the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to or within Country Group E:1 as specified in supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR. At the time those license were issued, Cuba was in Country Group E:1. Many of those restrictions were intended to apply to Cuba, not only as a State Sponsor of Terrorism but also as a country subject to unilateral embargo. However, BIS did not always list both Country Groups E:1 and E:2 in license conditions because, at the time, doing so would have been redundant. However, with the rescission of Cuba's designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism and resultant removal from Country Group E:1, continuing those conditions with respect to Cuba is consistent with the embargo. Accordingly, all conditions that apply to Country Group E:1 on licenses issued prior to July 22, 2015 that are in effect on that date, are revised to apply to Country Groups E:1 and E:2 as specified in supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR. Licensees who seek authorization for transactions that are affected by this General Order No. 3 may submit license applications that refer to General Order No. 3 and explain the reason for the request in Block 24 of the application. All license applications involving Cuba are reviewed pursuant to the licensing policy in § 746.2(b) of the EAR. The request should provide any available information in support of the argument that the transaction would be consistent with the licensing policy in § 746.2(b) of the EAR.
(d) General Order No. 4. Exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) authorized under the Temporary General Licenses (TGL) specified under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this supplement must also comply with the terms and conditions under paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) of this supplement.

—(A)
For all items under paragraph (d)(2)(i).
Any item identified under the paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this supplement, may be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) to or within a destination specified in Country Groups D:1, D:4, or D:5 (and not specified in Country Groups A:5 or A:6) or for 3A090.c to or within Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5 when either of the following apply:
(
1
) The end user is located in, but is not headquartered in, or whose ultimate parent company is not headquartered in, Macau or Country Group D:5 and the end use is to continue or engage in the following activities: integration, assembly (mounting), inspection, testing, quality assurance, and distribution of items covered by items specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i);

(1)
Continued use of DDTC approvals from the Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) for items that become subject to the EAR.
Items the President has determined no longer warrant control under the USML will become subject to the EAR as published final rules that transfer the items to the CCL become effective. DDTC licenses, agreements, or other approvals that contain items transitioning from the USML to the CCL and that are issued prior to the effective date of the final rule transferring such items to the CCL may continue to be used in accordance with the Department of State's final rule,
Amendments to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations: Initial Implementation of Export Control Reform,
published on April 16, 2013 in the
Federal Register.
(2)
BIS authorization.
(i) Where continued use of DDTC authorization is not or is no longer an available option, or a holder of an existing DDTC authorization returns or terminates that authorization, any required authorization to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) a transitioned item on or after the effective date of the applicable final rule must be obtained under the EAR. Following the publication date and prior to the effective date of a final rule moving an item from the USML to the CCL, applicants may submit license applications to BIS for authorization to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) the transitioning item. BIS will process the license applications in accordance with § 750.4 of the EAR, hold the license application without action (HWA) if necessary, and issue a license, if approved, to the applicant no sooner than the effective date of the final rule transitioning the items to the CCL.
(ii) Following the effective date of a final rule moving items from the USML to the CCL, exporters, reexporters, and transferors of such items may return DDTC licenses in accordance with § 123.22 of the ITAR or terminate Technical Assistance Agreements, Manufacturing License Agreements, or Warehouse and Distribution Agreements in accordance with § 124.6 of the ITAR and thereafter export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) such items under applicable provisions of the EAR, including any applicable license requirements. No transfer (in-country) may be made of an item exported under a DDTC authorization containing provisos or other limitations without a license issued by BIS unless (i) the transfer (in-country) is authorized by an EAR license exception and the terms and conditions of the License Exception have been satisfied, or (ii) no license would otherwise be required under the EAR to export or reexport the item to the new end user.
(3)
Prior commodity jurisdiction determinations.
If the U.S. State Department has previously determined that an item is not subject to the jurisdiction of the ITAR and the item was not listed in a then existing “018” series ECCN (for purposes of the “600 series” ECCNs, or the 0x5zz ECCNs) or in a then existing ECCN 9A004.b or related software or technology ECCN (for purposes of the 9x515 ECCNs), then the item is per se not within the scope of a “600 series” ECCN, a 0x5zz ECCN, or a 9x515 ECCN. If the item was not listed elsewhere on the CCL at the time of such determination (
i.e.,
the item was designated EAR99), the item shall remain designated as EAR99 unless specifically enumerated by BIS or DDTC in an amendment to the CCL or to the USML, respectively.
(4)
Voluntary Self-Disclosure.
Parties to transactions involving transitioning items are cautioned to monitor closely their compliance with the EAR and the ITAR. Should a possible or actual violation of the EAR, or of any license or authorization issued thereunder, be discovered, the person or persons involved are strongly encouraged to submit a Voluntary Self-Disclosure to the Office of Export Enforcement, in accordance with § 764.5 of the EAR. Permission from the Office of Exporter Services, in accordance with § 764.5(f) of the EAR, to engage in further activities in connection with that item may also be necessary. Should a possible or actual violation of the ITAR, or of any license or authorization issued thereunder, be discovered, the person or persons involved are strongly encouraged to submit a Voluntary Disclosure to DDTC, in accordance with § 127.12 of the ITAR. For possible or actual violations of both the EAR and ITAR, the person or persons involved are strongly encouraged to submit disclosures to both BIS and DDTC, indicating to each agency that they also have made a disclosure to the other agency.

§ 738.1
Introduction.
(a)
Commerce Control List scope.
(1) In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL) within the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which includes items (i.e., commodities, software, and technology) subject to the export licensing authority of BIS. The CCL does not include those items exclusively controlled for export or reexport by another department or agency of the U.S. Government. In instances where agencies other than the Department of Commerce administer controls over related items, entries in the CCL contain a reference to these controls.
(2) The CCL is contained in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR. Supplement no. 2 to part 774 of the EAR contains the General Technology and Software Notes relevant to entries contained in the CCL.
(3)
Items that warrant control for export or reexport but currently are not permanently classified on the CCL.
Items subject to temporary CCL controls are classified under the ECCN 0Y521 series (i.e., 0A521, 0B521, 0C521, 0D521, and 0E521) pursuant to § 742.6(a)(8) of the EAR while a determination is made as to whether classification under a revised or new ECCN, or an EAR99 designation, is appropriate.
(b)
Commerce Country Chart scope.
BIS also maintains the Commerce Country Chart. The Commerce Country Chart, located in supplement no. 1 to part 738, contains licensing requirements based on destination and Reason for Control. In combination with the CCL, the Commerce Country Chart allows you to determine whether a license is required for items on the CCL to any country in the world.
[61 FR 12756, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 77 FR 22198, Apr. 13, 2012; 85 FR 23462, Apr. 28, 2020]
§ 738.2
Commerce Control List (CCL) structure.
(a)
Categories.
The CCL is divided into 10 categories, numbered as follows:
0—Nuclear Materials, Facilities and Equipment and Miscellaneous
1—Materials, Chemicals, “Microorganisms,” and Toxins
2—Materials Processing
3—Electronics
4—Computers
5—Telecommunications and Information Security
6—Lasers and Sensors
7—Navigation and Avionics
8—Marine
9—Aerospace and Propulsion
(b)
Groups.
Within each category, items are arranged by group. Each category contains the same five groups. Each Group is identified by the letters A through E, as follows:
A—Equipment, Assemblies and Components
B—Test, Inspection and Production Equipment
C—Materials
D—Software
E—Technology
(c)
Order of review.
The CCL includes a supplement no. 4 to part 774—Commerce Control List Order of Review. This supplement establishes the steps (i.e., the order of review) that should be followed in classifying items that are “subject to the EAR.”
(d)
Entries
—(1)
Composition of an entry.
Within each group, individual items are identified by an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN). Each number consists of a set of digits and a letter. The first digit identifies the general category within which the entry falls (
e.g.,
3A001). The letter immediately following this first digit identifies under which of the five groups the item is listed (
e.g.,
3A001). The second and third digits differentiate individual entries by identifying the type of controls associated with the items contained in the entry (
e.g.,
3A001). Table 1 lists the Reasons for Control associated with this second and third digits.
Table 1 to Paragraph (
d
)(1) Introductory Text
Last 3 digits of an ECCN
Reason for control
000-099
National Security (NS).
100-199
Missile Technology (MT).
200-299
Nuclear Nonproliferation (NP).
300-399
Chemical and Biological (CB).
500-599
Firearms, “Spacecraft,” and related commodities controlled for NS and other reasons.
600-699
Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (WAML) or former U.S. Munitions List (USML) controlled for NS and other reasons.
900-979
Plurilateral NS and Regional Stability (RS) and other reasons.
980-989
Crime Control (CC), Short Supply (SS).
990-999
Anti-terrorism (AT), RS, United Nations Sanctions (UN).
(i) Reasons for Control are not mutually exclusive and numbers are assigned in order of precedence. As an example, if an item is controlled for both National Security and Missile Technology reasons, the entry's third alphanumeric character will be a “0”. If the item is controlled only for Missile Technology the third alphanumeric character will be “1”.
(ii) The numbers in either the second or third digit (
e.g.,
3A001) serve to differentiate between multilateral, plurilateral, and unilateral entries. For example, an entry with the number “99” as the second and third digit, identifies the entire entry as controlled for a unilateral concern (
e.g.,
2B991 for anti-terrorism reasons). If the second digit is a “2” and the third digit is a “9”, the item is controlled for unilateral purposes based on a nuclear proliferation concern (
e.g.,
2A290 is controlled for unilateral purposes based on nuclear nonproliferation concerns).
(iii) The last digit within each entry (
e.g.,
3A001) is used for the sequential numbering of ECCNs to differentiate between entries on the CCL.
(iv) Last two characters in a “600 series” ECCN. The last two characters of each “600 series” ECCN generally track the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (WAML) categories for the types of items at issue. The WAML ML21 (“software”) and ML22 (“technology”) are, however, included in D (“software”) and E (“technology”) CCL product groups to remain consistent with the structure of the CCL.
(2)
Reading an ECCN.
An ECCN is made up of four sections, the “Heading,” “License Requirements,” “License Exceptions,” and “List of Items Controlled” sections. A brief description of each section and its use follows:
(i)
Heading.
A description of the items controlled is provided next to each ECCN. In certain ECCNs, the description is a summary and will direct you to “see List of Items Controlled” for a complete list of items classified under those respective ECCNs. The “Items” paragraph in the List of Items Controlled section will describe all of the items that the ECCN controls for the portions of the heading that precede the “see List of Items Controlled” phrase. Portions of the heading that follow the phrase are complete descriptions of the items controlled by that portion of the heading. If “see List of Items Controlled” appears at the end of the heading, the “Items” paragraph in the List of Items Controlled section is the exclusive, complete list of the items the ECCN controls.
(ii)
License Requirements.
This section contains a separate line identifying all possible Reasons for Control in order of precedence, and two columns entitled “Control(s)” and “Country Chart”.
(A) The “Controls” header identifies all applicable Reasons for Control, in order of restrictiveness, and to what extent each applies (e.g., to the entire entry or only to certain subparagraphs). Those requiring licenses for a larger number of countries and/or items are listed first. As you read down the list the number of countries and/or items requiring a license declines. Since Reasons for Control are not mutually exclusive, items controlled within a particular ECCN may be controlled for more than one reason. The following is a list of all possible Reasons for Control:
AT Anti-Terrorism
CB Chemical
Biological Weapons
CC Crime Control
CW Chemical Weapons Convention
EI Encryption Items
FC Firearms Convention
MT Missile Technology
NS National Security
NP Nuclear Nonproliferation
RS Regional Stability
SS Short Supply
UN United Nations Embargo
SI Significant Items
SL Surreptitious Listening
(B) The “Country Chart” header identifies, for each applicable Reason for Control, a column name and number (e.g., CB Column 1). These column identifiers are used to direct you from the CCL to the appropriate column identifying the countries requiring a license. Consult part 742 of the EAR for an indepth discussion of the licensing requirements and policies applicable to each Country Chart column.
(iii)
License Exceptions.
This section provides a brief eligibility statement for each ECCN-driven License Exception that may be applicable to your transaction, and should be consulted only AFTER you have determined a license is required based on an analysis of the entry and the Country Chart. The brief eligibility statement in this section is provided to assist you in deciding which ECCN-driven License Exception related to your particular item and destination you should explore prior to submitting an application. The term “Yes” (followed in some instances by the scope of Yes) appears next to each available ECCN-driven License Exception. Some ECCNs have License Exception STA exclusion paragraphs. These paragraphs identify items for which the License Exception STA provisions in § 740.20(c)(2) of the EAR may not be used, but do not otherwise affect License Exception STA availability. The term “N/A” will be noted for License Exceptions that are not available within a particular entry. In some “600 series” ECCNs, the STA license exception paragraph or a note to the License Exceptions section contains additional information on the availability of License Exception STA for that ECCN. If one or more License Exceptions appear to apply to your transaction, you must consult part 740 of the EAR to review the conditions and restrictions applicable to each available License Exception. The list of License Exceptions contained within each ECCN is not an all-exclusive list. Other License Exceptions, not based on particular ECCNs, may be available. Consult part 740 of the EAR to determine eligibility for non-ECCN-driven License Exceptions.
(iv)
List of Items Controlled
—(A)
Related definitions.
This header identifies, where appropriate, definitions or parameters that apply to all items controlled by the entry. The information provided in this section is unique to the entry, and hence not listed in the
definitions contained in part 772 of the EAR.
(B)
Related controls.
If another U.S. government agency or department has export licensing authority over items related to those controlled by an entry, a statement is included identifying the agency or department along with the applicable regulatory cite. An additional cross-reference may be included in instances where the scope of controls differs between a CCL entry and its corresponding entry on list maintained by the European Union. This information is provided to assist readers who use both lists.
(C)
Items.
This paragraph describes the relationship between the “items” paragraph and ECCN headings and will assist your understanding as you classify items on the CCL. When the heading contains the phrase “see List of Items Controlled,” the portion of the heading preceding that phrase is only a summary of the items controlled by the ECCN and the “items” paragraph contains an exclusive list of items described in the heading. Paragraphs (d)(2)(iv)(C)(
1
), (
2
) and (
3
) of this section provide examples of the three different uses of the phrase “(see List of Items Controlled)” in ECCN headings. Each heading on the CCL uses one of these three structures. Understanding the relationship between the heading and the “items” paragraph is important when classifying items that are “subject to the EAR” on the CCL.
(
1
) “(See List of Items Controlled)” is at the end of the ECCN heading. An example of an ECCN where all of the heading text precedes the phrase “(see List of Items Controlled)” is ECCN 8A002 Marine systems, equipment, “parts” and “components,” as follows (see List of Items Controlled). ECCNs 1A001, 3A001, 6A001, 7A004 and 9A012 are other examples where all of the heading text precedes the phrase “(see List of Items Controlled).” In these types of headings, the items paragraphs must be reviewed to determine whether your item is contained within the heading and classified under that ECCN.
(
2
) “(See List of Items Controlled)” is in the middle of the ECCN heading. If the phrase “(see List of Items Controlled)” appears in the middle of the ECCN heading, then all portions of the heading that follow the phrase “(see List of Items Controlled)” will list items controlled in addition to the list in the “items” paragraph. An example of such a heading is ECCN 2B992 Non-“numerically controlled” machine tools for generating optical quality surfaces, (see List of Items Controlled) and “specially designed” “parts” and “components” therefor. Under the ECCN 2B992 example, the “items” paragraph must be reviewed to determine whether your item is contained within the first part of the heading (“non-'numerically controlled' machine tools for generating optical quality surfaces”) and classified under 2B992. The second part of the ECCN 2B992 heading (“and 'specially designed' 'parts' and 'components' therefor”) contains the exclusive list described in the heading. ECCNs 1A006, 3B992, 4A001, 6A006 and 7A001 are other examples where the phrase “(see List of Items Controlled)” appears in the middle of the ECCN heading.
(
3
) ECCNs that do not use the phrase “(see List of Items controlled).” When all items classified in the ECCN are listed in the heading, a sentence is generally included in the “items” paragraph to direct you to the heading. An example of such a heading is ECCN 4E980 “Technology” for the “development,” “production” or “use” of commodities controlled by 4A980. ECCNs 0A982, 5D101, 8D001 and 9A002 are other examples where the heading is the exclusive description of the items classified under those respective ECCNs.

§ 738.3
Commerce Country Chart structure.
(a)
Scope.
The Commerce Country Chart allows you to determine the Commerce Control List (CCL) export and reexport license requirements for most items listed on the CCL. Such license requirements are based on the
Reasons for Control listed in the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) that applies to the item. Some ECCNs, however, impose license requirements either without reference to a reason for control code that is listed on the Commerce Country Chart, or in addition to such a reference. Those ECCNs may state their license requirements in full in their “Reasons for Control” sections or they may refer the reader to another provision of the EAR for license requirement information. In addition, some ECCNs do not impose license requirements, but refer the reader to the regulations of another government agency that may impose license requirements on the items described in that ECCN.
(1) ECCNs 0A983, 5A001.f.1, 5A980, 5D001 (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1 or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1))), 5D980, 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1)) and 5E980. A license is required for all destinations for items controlled under these entries. For items controlled by 0A983, 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1)) and 5E980, no license exceptions apply. For items controlled by 5A001.f.1, 5A980, 5D001 (for 5A001.f.1 or for 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1))) and 5D980, License Exception GOV may apply if your item is consigned to and for the official use of an agency of the U.S. Government (see § 740.2(a)(3)). If your item is controlled by 0A983, 5A001.f.1, 5A980, 5D001 (for 5A001.f.1 or for 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1))), 5D980, 5E001.a (for 5A001.f.1, or for 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1)) or 5E980 you should proceed directly to part 748 of the EAR for license application instructions and § 742.11 or § 742.13 of the EAR for information on the licensing policy relevant to these types of applications.
(2) [Reserved]
(b)
Countries.
The first column of the Country Chart lists countries in alphabetical order. There are a number of destinations that are not listed in the Country Chart contained in supplement no. 1 to part 738. If your destination is not listed on the Country Chart and such destination is a territory, possession, dependency or department of a country included on the Country Chart, the EAR accords your destination the same licensing treatment as the country of which it is a territory, possession, dependency or department. For example, if your destination is the Cayman Islands, a dependent territory of the United Kingdom, refer to the United Kingdom on the Country Chart for licensing requirements. In addition, if your destination is Liechtenstein, which serves as one territory with Switzerland for purposes of the EAR, refer to Switzerland on the Country Chart for licensing requirements.
(c)
Columns.
Stretching out to the right are horizontal headers identifying the various Reasons for Control. Under each Reason for Control header are diagonal column identifiers capping individual columns. Each column identifier consists of the two letter Reason for Control and a column number. (e.g., CB Column 1). The column identifiers correspond to those listed in the “Country Chart” header within the “License Requirements” section of each ECCN.
(d)
Cells.
The symbol “X” is used to denote licensing requirements on the Country Chart. If an “X” appears in a particular cell, transactions subject to that particular Reason for Control/Destination combination require a license. There is a direct correlation between the number of “X”s applicable to your transaction and the number of licensing reviews your application will undergo.

§ 738.4
Determining whether a license is required.
(a)
Using the CCL and the Country Chart
—(1)
Overview.
Once you have determined that your item is classified under a specific ECCN, you must use information contained in the “License Requirements” section of that ECCN in combination with the Country Chart to decide whether a license is required. Note that not all license requirements set forth under the “License Requirements” section of an ECCN refer you to the Commerce Country Chart, but in some cases this section will contain
references to a specific section in the EAR for license requirements. In such cases, this section would not apply.
(2)
License decision making process.
The following decision making process must be followed in order to determine whether a license is required to export or reexport a particular item to a specific destination:
(i)
Examine the appropriate ECCN in the CCL.
Is the item you intend to export or reexport controlled for a single Reason for Control?
(A) If yes, identify the single Reason for Control and the relevant Country Chart column identifier (e.g., CB Column 1).
(B) If no, identify the Country Chart column identifier for each applicable Reason for Control (e.g., NS Column 1, NP Column 1, etc.).
(ii)
Review the Country Chart.
With each of the applicable Country Chart Column identifiers noted, turn to the Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738). Locate the correct Country Chart column identifier on the diagonal headings, and determine whether an “X” is marked in the cell next to the country in question for each Country Chart column identified in the applicable ECCN. If your item is subject to more than one reason for control, repeat this step using each unique Country Chart column identifier.
(A) If yes, a license application must be submitted based on the particular reason for control and destination, unless a License Exception applies. If “Yes” is noted next to any of the listed License Exceptions, you should consult part 740 of the EAR to determine whether you can use any of the available ECCN-driven License Exceptions to effect your shipment, rather than applying for a license. Each affirmative license requirement must be overcome by a License Exception. If you are unable to qualify for a License Exception based on each license requirement noted on the Country Chart, you must apply for a license. Note that other License Exceptions, not related to the CCL, may also apply to your transaction (See part 740 of the EAR).
(B) If no, a license is not required based on the particular Reason for Control and destination. Provided that General Prohibitions Four through Ten do not apply to your proposed transaction and the License Requirement section does not refer you to any other part of the EAR to determine license requirements. For example, any applicable encryption classification requirements described in § 740.17(b) of the EAR must be met for certain mass market encryption items to affect your shipment using the symbol “NLR.” Proceed to parts 758 and 762 of the EAR for information on export clearance procedures and recordkeeping requirements. Note that although you may stop after determining a license is required based on the first Reason for Control, it is best to work through each applicable Reason for Control. A full analysis of every possible licensing requirement based on each applicable Reason for Control is required to determine the most advantageous License Exception available for your particular transaction and, if a license is required, ascertain the scope of review conducted by BIS on your license application.
(b)
Sample analysis using the CCL and Country Chart
—(1)
Scope.
The following sample entry and related analysis is provided to illustrate the type of thought process you must complete in order to determine whether a license is required to export or reexport a particular item to a specific destination using the CCL in combination with the Country Chart.

Sample analysis.
After consulting the CCL, I determine my item, valued at $10,000, is classified under ECCN 2A000.a. I read that the entire entry is controlled for national security, and anti-terrorism reasons. Because my item is classified under paragraph .a, and not .b, I understand that though nuclear nonproliferation controls apply to a portion of the entry, they do not apply to my item. I note that the appropriate Country Chart column identifiers are NS Column 2 and AT Column 1. Turning to the Country Chart, I locate my specific destination, Chad, and see that an “X” appears in the NS Column 2 cell for Chad, but not in the AT Column 1 cell. I understand that a license is required, unless my transaction qualifies for a License Exception.

§ 740.1
Introduction.
In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.
(a)
Scope.
A “License Exception” is an authorization contained in this part that allows you to export or reexport under stated conditions, items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) that would otherwise require a license under General Prohibition One, Two, Three, or Eight, as indicated under one or more of the Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) in the Commerce Control List (CCL) in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR and items subject to the EAR that would require a license based on the embargo policies described in part 746 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibition Six for embargoed destinations, refer to part 746 of the EAR to determine the availability of any License Exceptions. Special commodity controls apply to short supply items. License Exceptions for items listed on the CCL as controlled for Short Supply reasons are found in part 754 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibition Five, consult part 744 of the EAR. If your export or reexport is subject to General Prohibitions Four, Seven, Nine, or Ten, then no License Exceptions apply. Any license exception authorizing reexports also authorizes in-country transfers, provided the terms and conditions for reexports under that license exception are met.
(b)
Certification.
By using any of the License Exceptions you are certifying that the terms, provisions, and conditions for the use of the License Exception described in the EAR have been met. Please refer to part 758 of the EAR for clearance of shipments and documenting the use of License Exceptions.
(c)
License Exception symbols.
Each License Exception bears a three letter symbol that will be used for export clearance purposes (see paragraph (d) of this section).
(d)
Electronic Export Information (EEI) filing.
You must enter on any required EEI filing the correct License Code that corresponds to the appropriate license exception symbol (e.g., LVS,
GBS, CIV) and the correct Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) (e.g., 4A003, 5A002) for all exports of items under a license exception. Items temporarily in the United States meeting the provisions of License Exception TMP, under § 740.9(b)(3), are excepted from this requirement. See § 758.1 of the EAR and 15 CFR part 30 of the FTR for EEI requirements.
(e)
Destination Control Statement.
You may be required to enter an appropriate Destination Control Statement on commercial documents in accordance with Destination Control Statement requirements of § 758.6 of the EAR.
(f)
Recordkeeping.
Records of transactions involving exports under any of the License Exceptions must be maintained in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements of part 762 of the EAR.

# Note 1 to paragraph (
a

# )(9)(
ii

# ):
ECCN 3A090.c requires a license for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) to or within Macau or destinations specified in Country Group D:5, but is still included within the scope of this paragraph because it generally shares the same EAR license exception eligibility as other 3A090 commodities, except for NAC/ACA, under the provisions of § 740.8., which ECCN 3A090.c is not eligible. An export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of an ECCN 3A090.c commodity to a destination specified in Country Groups D:1 or D:4 that is not specified in Country Group D:5, may be made under the No License Required (NLR) designation, provided no part 744 or 746 license requirements are applicable.
(10) The commodity being exported or reexported is subject to the license requirements of § 742.11 of the EAR.
(11) The item is a “military commodity” subject to ECCN 0A919, except that such military commodities may be reexported in accordance with § 740.11(b)(2)(ii) (official use by personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government).
(12) The item is described in a 9x515 or “600 series” ECCN and is destined to, shipped from, or was manufactured in a destination listed in Country Group D:5 or Hong Kong (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), except that:
(i) 9x515 or “600 series” items destined to, or in, Country Group D:5 are eligible for License Exception GOV (§ 740.11(b)(2) of the EAR); and
(ii) 1A613.c or .d items destined to, or in, Country Group D:5 are eligible for License Exception TMP (§ 740.9(a)(11) of the EAR) or License Exception BAG (§ 740.14(h)(2) of the EAR).
(13) “600 series” items that are controlled for missile technology (MT) reasons may not be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under License Exception STA (§ 740.20 of the EAR). Items controlled under ECCNs 9D610.b, 9D619.b, 9E610.b, or 9E619.b or .c are not eligible for license exceptions except for License Exception GOV (§ 740.11(b)(2) of the EAR). Only the following license exceptions may be used to export “600 series” items to destinations other than those identified in Country Group D:5 or Hong Kong (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR):
(i) License Exception LVS (§ 740.3 of the EAR);
(ii) License Exception TMP (§ 740.9 of the EAR);
(iii) License Exception RPL (§ 740.10 of the EAR);
(iv) License Exception TSU (§ 740.13(a), (b), (f) and (g) of the EAR);
(v) License Exception GOV (§ 740.11(b) or (c) of the EAR);
(vi) License Exception BAG (§ 740.14); and
(vii) License Exception STA under § 740.20(c)(1) of the EAR, provided all of the applicable terms and conditions, including those specific to the “600 series” are met.
(14) Items classified under ECCNs 0A521, 0B521, 0C521, 0D521 and 0E521 may only be authorized by License Exception GOV (§ 740.11(b)(2)(ii)) or an item-specific license exception identified in supplement no. 5 to part 774 for a particular ECCN 0Y521 item.

# Note to paragraph (
a

# )(14):
Item-specific license exception availability is specific to each ECCN 0Y521 entry in supplement no. 5 to part 774 and may not be used for any other ECCN 0Y521 entries in the supplement. The U.S. Government makes a determination at the time items are classified under ECCNs 0A521, 0B521, 0C521, 0D521 and 0E521 regarding whether any license exceptions will be available, in addition to License Exception GOV (§ 740.11(b)(2)(ii)).
(15) If they are sold under a contract that includes $14,000,000 or more of “600 Series Major Defense Equipment” (as defined in § 772.1), exports of “600 series” items to a country not listed in Country Group A:5 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), are not eligible for any license exception except to U.S. Government end users under License Exception GOV (§ 740.11(b) of the EAR).
(16) If they are sold under a contract that includes $25,000,000 or more of “600 Series Major Defense Equipment” (as
defined in § 772.1), exports of “600 series” items to a country listed in Country Group A:5 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), are not eligible for any license exception except to U.S. Government end users under License Exception GOV (§ 740.11(b) of the EAR).
(17) A party to the transaction, as described in § 748.5 of the EAR, is listed on the Unverified List in supplement no. 6 to part 744, see § 744.15 of the EAR.
(18) 9x515 items that are controlled for missile technology (MT) reasons may not be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under License Exception STA (§ 740.20 of the EAR).
(19) The exporter or reexporter to Hong Kong of any item subject to the EAR and controlled on the CCL for NS, MT, NP Column 1, or CB reasons has not received one of the following with respect to the item:
(i) A copy of an import license issued to the Hong Kong importer by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, pursuant to the Hong Kong Import and Export (Strategic Commodities) Regulations, that covers all items to be exported or reexported pursuant to that license exception for which a Hong Kong import license is required and that is valid on the date of the export or reexport that is subject to the EAR; or
(ii) A copy of a written statement issued by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region that no import license is required to import into Hong Kong the item(s) to be exported or reexported. The statement may have been issued directly to the Hong Kong importer or it may be a written statement available to the general public. The statement may be used for more than one export or reexport to Hong Kong so long as it remains an accurate statement of Hong Kong law.
(20) The reexporter from Hong Kong of any item subject to the EAR controlled on the CCL for NS, MT, NP column 1, or CB reasons has not received one of the following with respect to the item:
(i) An export license issued by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, pursuant to the Hong Kong Import and Export (Strategic Commodities) Regulations, that covers all items to be reexported pursuant to that license exception for which a Hong Kong export license is required and that is valid on the date of the reexport that is subject to the EAR; or
(ii) A copy of a written statement issued by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region that no Hong Kong export license is required for the item(s) to be rexported. The statement may have been issued directly to the Hong Kong reexporter or it may be a written statement available to the general public. The statement may be used for more than one reexport from Hong Kong so long as it remains an accurate statement of Hong Kong law.
(21) The reexport or transfer (in-country) of firearms classified under ECCNs 0A501, 0A502, 0A506, 0A507, or 0A508 with either an ITAR-defined “foreign defense article” (22 CFR 120.39) that is not subject to Department of State jurisdiction that is incorporated into the firearm or “knowledge” that an ITAR-defined “defense article” (22 CFR 120.31) will be subsequently incorporated into the firearm, where the “(foreign) defense article” is described in USML Category I(h)(2). In such instances, no license exceptions are available except for License Exception GOV (§ 740.11(b)(2)(ii)).
(22) The item being exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) is eligible for § 740.24 and the license exception is other than IEC, TMP, RPL, GOV, or TSU, subject to the limitations in this paragraph (a)(22). License Exception IEC is available as specified in § 740.24. License Exception TMP is restricted to eligibility under the provisions of § 740.9(a)(3) and (a)(6); RPL is restricted to eligibility under the provisions of § 740.10; GOV is restricted to eligibility under the provisions of § 740.11(b); and TSU is restricted to eligibility under the provisions of § 740.13(a) and (c).
(23) Exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of semi-automatic firearms or shotguns controlled under ECCNs 0A506, 0A507, or 0A508 sold under a contract or otherwise part of an export that includes $4,000,000 or more of such items are not eligible for any license exceptions except to personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government
under License Exception GOV (§ 740.11(b) of the EAR), for official use by an agency of NATO, or where a license exception would otherwise be available for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of such items to a destination specified in Country Groups A:5 or A:6 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) except Mexico, South Africa, or Turkey.
(24) Exporters of items controlled under ECCNs 0A501, 0A502, 0A504, 0A505, 0A506, 0A507, 0A508, or 0A509 wishing to use an EAR license exception for such items must first have the consignee obtain and provide to the exporter an import certification or equivalent document, if the importing country requires one, prior to using an EAR license exception.
(25) No license exception is available for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to or within Pakistan of items controlled under ECCNs 1B999, 2A992, 2B999 (except 2B999.h.2), 3A992, 3A999, or 6A996 (see § 742.6(a)(12) of the EAR), apart from TMP (limited to 740.9(a)(1), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(10), (b)(2), and (b)(3)), RPL (740.10), or GOV (740.11(a), (b), or (d)).

# Note to paragraph (
a

# ):
Items subject to the exclusive export control jurisdiction of another agency of the U.S. Government may not be authorized by a license exception or any other authorization under the EAR. If your item is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another agency of the U.S. Government, you must determine your export licensing requirements pursuant to the other agency's regulations. See § 734.3(b) and supplement no. 3 to part 730 of the EAR for other U.S. Government departments and agencies with export control responsibilities.
(b) All License Exceptions are subject to revision, suspension, or revocation, in whole or in part, without notice to protect U.S. national security or foreign policy interests. BIS may stop a shipment or an export, reexport, or (in-country) transaction at any stage of its progress,
e.g.,
in order to prevent an unauthorized export, reexport, or transfer (in-country). If a shipment is already en route, BIS may order the return or unloading of the shipment at any port of call.
(c) BIS may by informing the exporter, suspend or revoke any License Exception in order to comply with U.S. Wassenaar obligations. In addition, BIS may inform an exporter, that before using any License Exception, a notice be submitted with BIS concerning the proposed export.
(d) See § 746.3 for restrictions on certain transfers within Iraq of items exported or reexported to Iraq pursuant to a License Exception.

§ 740.3
Shipments of limited value (LVS).
(a)
Scope.
License Exception LVS authorizes the export and reexport in a single shipment of eligible commodities as identified by “LVS - $(value limit)” on the CCL.
(b)
Eligible destinations.
This License Exception is available for all destinations in Country Group B (see supplement no. 1 to this part), provided that the net value of the commodities included in the same order and controlled under the same ECCN entry on the CCL does not exceed the amount specified in the LVS paragraph for that entry. However, License Exception LVS is not available for 0x5zz items (except 0A504.g) when destined for countries in “CARICOM” or countries in Country Group D:5.
(c)
Definitions
—(1)
Order.
The term
order
as used in this § 740.3 means a communication from a person in a foreign country, or that person's representative, expressing an intent to import commodities from the exporter. Although all of the details of the order need not be finally determined at the time of export, terms relating to the kinds and quantities of the commodities to be exported, as well as the selling prices of these commodities, must be finalized before the goods can be exported under License Exception LVS.
(2)
Net value: for LVS shipments.
The actual selling price of the commodities that are included in the same order and are controlled under the same entry on the CCL, less shipping charges, or the current market price of the commodities to the same type of purchaser in the United States, whichever is the
larger. In determining the actual selling price or the current market price of the commodity, the value of containers in which the commodity is being exported may be excluded. The value for LVS purposes is that of the controlled commodity that is being exported, and may not be reduced by subtracting the value of any content that would not, if shipped separately, be subject to licensing. Where the total value of the containers and their contents must be shown on Shipper's Export Declarations under one Schedule B Number, the exporter, in effecting a shipment under this License Exception, must indicate the “net value” of the contained commodity immediately below the description of the commodity.
(3)
Single shipment.
All commodities moving at the same time from one exporter to one consignee or intermediate consignee on the same exporting carrier even though these commodities will be forwarded to one or more ultimate consignees. Commodities being transported in this manner will be treated as a single shipment even if the commodities represent more than one order or are in separate containers.
(d)
Additional eligibility requirements and restrictions
—(1)
Eligible orders.
To be eligible for this License Exception, orders must meet the following criteria:
(i)
Orders must not exceed the applicable “LVS” dollar value limits.
An order is eligible for shipment under LVS when the “net value” of the commodities controlled under the same entry on the CCL does not exceed the amount specified in the “LVS” paragraph for that entry. An LVS shipment may include more than one eligible order.
(ii)
Orders may not be split to meet the applicable LVS dollar limits.
An order that exceeds the applicable LVS dollar value limit may not be misrepresented as two or more orders, or split among two or more shipments, to give the appearance of meeting the applicable LVS dollar value limit. However an order that meets all the LVS eligibility requirements, including the applicable LVS dollar value limit, may be split among two or more shipments.
(iii)
Orders must be legitimate.
Exporters and consignees may not, either collectively or individually, structure or adjust orders to meet the applicable LVS dollar value limits.
(2)
Restriction on annual value of LVS orders.
The total value of exports per calendar year to the same ultimate or intermediate consignee of commodities classified under a single ECCN may not exceed 12 times the LVS value limit for that ECCN; however, there is no restriction on the number of shipments provided that value is not exceeded. This annual value limit applies to shipments to the same ultimate consignee even though the shipments are made through more than one intermediate consignee. There is no restriction on the number of orders that may be included in a shipment, except that the annual value limit per ECCN must not be exceeded.
(3)
Orders where two or more LVS dollar value limits apply.
An order may include commodities that are controlled under more than one entry on the CCL. In this case, the net value of the entire order may exceed the LVS dollar value for any single entry on the CCL. However, the net value of the commodities controlled under each ECCN entry shall not exceed the LVS dollar value limit specified for that entry.

# Example to paragraph (d)(3):
An order includes commodities valued at $8,000. The order consists of commodities controlled under two ECCN entries, each having an LVS value limit of $5000. Commodities in the order controlled under one ECCN are valued at $3,500 while those controlled under the other ECCN are valued at $4,500. Since the net value of the commodities controlled under each entry falls within the LVS dollar value limits applicable to that entry, the order may be shipped under this License Exception.
(4)
Prohibition against evasion of license requirements.
Any activity involving the use of this License Exception to evade license requirements is prohibited. Such devices include, but are not limited to, the splitting or structuring of orders to meet applicable LVS dollar value limits, as prohibited by paragraphs (d)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
(5)
Exports and reexports of encryption components or spare parts.
For components or spare parts controlled for “EI” reasons under ECCN 5A002, exports and reexports under this License Exception must be destined to support
a commodity previously authorized for export or reexport.
(e)
Reexports.
Commodities may be reexported under this License Exception, provided that they could be exported from the United States to the new country of destination under LVS.
(f)
Reporting requirements. See
§ 743.1 of the EAR for reporting requirements for exports of certain commodities under License Exception LVS.

§ 740.6
Technology and software under restriction (TSR).
(a)
Scope.
License Exception TSR permits exports and reexports of technology and software where the Commerce Country Chart (Supplement No. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) indicates a license requirement to the ultimate destination for national security reasons only and identified by “TSR—Yes” in entries on the CCL, provided the software or technology is destined to Country Group B, except Sudan and Ukraine. (See Supplement No. 1 to part 740.) A written assurance is required from the consignee before exporting or reexporting under this License Exception.
(1)
Required assurance for export of technology.
You may not export or reexport technology under this License Exception until you have received from the importer a written assurance that, without a BIS license or License Exception, the importer will not:
(i) Reexport or release the technology to a national of a country in Country Groups D:1, E:1, or E:2; or
(ii) Export to Country Groups D:1, E:1, or E:2 the direct product of the technology, if such foreign produced direct product is subject to national security controls as identified on the CCL (See General Prohibition Three, § 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR); or
(iii) If the direct product of the technology is a complete plant or any major components of a plant, export to Country Groups D:1, E:1, or E:2 of the direct product of the plant or major components thereof, if such foreign produced direct product is subject to national security controls as identified on the CCL or is “subject to the ITAR” (see 22 CFR parts 120 through 130).
(2)
Required assurance for export of software.
You may not export or reexport software under this License Exception until you have received from the importer a written assurance that, without a BIS license or License Exception, the importer will neither:
(i) Reexport or release the software or the source code for the software to a national of a country in Country Groups D:1, E:1, or E:2; nor
(ii) Export to Country Groups D:1, E:1, or E:2 the direct product of the software, if such foreign produced direct product is subject to national security controls as identified on the CCL. (See General Prohibition Three, § 736.2(b)(3) of the EAR).
(3)
Form of written assurance.
The required assurance may be made in the form of a letter or any other written communication from the importer, including communications via facsimile, or the assurance may be incorporated into a licensing agreement that specifically includes the assurances. An assurance included in a licensing agreement is acceptable only if the agreement specifies that the assurance will be honored even after the expiration date of the licensing agreement. If such a written assurance is not received, License Exception TSR is not applicable and a license is required. The license application must include a statement explaining why assurances could not be obtained.
(4)
Other License Exceptions.
The requirements in this License Exception do not apply to the export of technology or software under other License Exceptions, or to the export of technology or software included in an application for the foreign filing of a patent, provided the filing is in accordance with the regulations of the U.S. Patent Office.
(b)
Reporting requirements.
See § 743.1 of the EAR for reporting requirements for exports of certain items under License Exception TSR. Note that reports are not required for release of technology or source code subject to the EAR to foreign nationals in the U.S. under the provisions of License Exception TSR.

§ 740.9
Temporary imports, exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) (TMP).
This License Exception authorizes various temporary exports and reexports; exports and reexports of items temporarily in the United States; and exports and reexports of beta test software.
(a)
Temporary exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country).
License Exception TMP authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items for temporary use abroad (including use in or above international waters) subject to the conditions specified in this paragraph (a). No item may be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a) if an order to acquire the item, such as a purchase order, has been received before shipment; with prior knowledge that the item will stay abroad beyond the terms of this License Exception; or when the item is for subsequent lease or rental abroad. The references to various countries and country groups in these TMP-specific provisions do not limit or amend the prohibitions in
§ 740.2 of the EAR on the use of license exceptions generally, such as for exports of 9x515 or “600 series” items to destinations in Country Group D:5. This paragraph (a) does not authorize any export of a commodity controlled under ECCNs 0A501.a or .b, 0A506 or 0A507, or shotguns with a barrel length less than 18 inches controlled under ECCN 0A502 or 0A508 to, or any export of such an item that was imported into the United States from, a country in Country Group D:5 (supplement no. 1 to this part), or from Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, or Uzbekistan. The only provisions of this paragraph (a) that are eligible for use to export such items are paragraph (a)(5) of this section (“Exhibition and demonstration”) and paragraph (a)(6) of this section (“Inspection, test, calibration, and repair”). In addition, this paragraph (a) may not be used to export more than 75 firearms per shipment. In accordance with the requirements in § 758.1(b)(9) and (g)(4) of the EAR, the exporter or its agent must provide documentation that includes the serial number, make, model, and caliber of each firearm being exported by filing these data elements in an EEI filing in AES. In accordance with the exclusions in License Exception TMP under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the entry clearance requirements in § 758.1(b)(9) do not permit the temporary import of: Firearms controlled in ECCNs 0A501.a or .b, 0A506, or 0A507 that are shipped from or manufactured in a Country Group D:5 country, or that are shipped from or manufactured in Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, or Uzbekistan (except for any firearm model designation (if assigned) controlled by ECCNs 0A501, 0A506, or 0A507 that is specified under annex A in supplement no. 4 to this part); or shotguns with a barrel length less than 18 inches controlled in ECCNs 0A502 or 0A508 that are shipped from or manufactured in a Country Group D:5 country, or from Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, or Uzbekistan, because of the exclusions in License Exception TMP under paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

Tools of trade.
Exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of commodities and software as tools of trade for use by the exporter or employees of the exporter may be made only to destinations other than Country Group E:1 and for MT controlled commodities or software may be made only to destinations other than Country Groups D:4 and D:5. The tools of trade must remain under the “effective control” of the exporter or the exporter's employee. Eligible items are usual and reasonable kinds and quantities of tools of trade for use in a lawful enterprise or undertaking of the exporter. Tools of trade include, but are not limited to, commodities and software as is necessary to commission or service items, provided that the commodity or software is appropriate for this purpose and that all items to be commissioned or serviced are of foreign origin, or if subject to the EAR, have been lawfully exported, reexported, or transferred. Tools of trade may accompany the individual departing from the United States or may be shipped unaccompanied within one month before the individual's departure from the United States, or at any time after departure. Software used as a tool of trade must be protected against unauthorized access. Examples of security precautions to help prevent unauthorized access include the following:
(i) Use of secure connections, such as Virtual Private Network connections, when accessing IT networks for activities that involve the transmission and use of the software authorized under this license exception;
(ii) Use of password systems on electronic devices that store the software authorized under this license exception; and
(iii) Use of personal firewalls on electronic devices that store the software authorized under this license exception.
(2) [Reserved]
(3) “Technology,” regardless of media or format, may be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) by or to a U.S. person, or a foreign person employee of a U.S. person traveling or on temporary assignment abroad, subject to the following restrictions:
(i) Foreign persons may only export, reexport, transfer (in country) or receive such “technology” as they are
authorized to receive through a license, license exception other than TMP or because no license is required.
(ii) “Technology” exported, reexported, or transferred under this authorization may only be possessed or used by a U.S. person or authorized foreign person. Sufficient security precautions must be taken to prevent the unauthorized release of the “technology.” Such security precautions may include encryption of the “technology,” the use of secure network connections, such as Virtual Private Networks, the use of passwords or other access restrictions on the electronic device or media on which the “technology” is stored, and the use of firewalls and other network security measures to prevent unauthorized access.
(iii) The individual is an employee of the U.S. Government or is directly employed by a U.S. person and not,
e.g.,
by a foreign subsidiary.
(iv) “Technology” authorized under this exception may not be used for foreign production purposes or for technical assistance unless authorized through a license or license exception other than TMP.
(4)
Kits consisting of replacement parts or components.
Kits consisting of replacement parts or components may be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) to all destinations except Country Group E:1 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR), provided that:
(i) The parts and components would qualify for shipment under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section if exported as one-for-one replacements;
(ii) The kits remain under effective control of the exporter or an employee of the exporter; and
(iii) All parts and components in the kit are returned, except that one-for-one replacements may be made in accordance with the requirements of License Exception RPL and the defective parts and components returned (see Parts, Components, Accessories and Attachments in § 740.10(a) of this part).
(5)
Exhibition and demonstration.
This paragraph (a)(5) authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of commodities and software for exhibition or demonstration in all destinations except Country Group E:1 (see supplement no. 1 to this part) provided that the exporter maintains ownership of the commodities and software while they are abroad and provided that the exporter, an employee of the exporter, or the exporter's designated sales representative retains “effective control” over the commodities and software while they are abroad. The commodities and software may not be used when abroad for more than the minimum extent required for effective demonstration. The commodities and software may not be exhibited or demonstrated at any one site for longer than 120 days after installation and debugging, unless authorized by BIS. However, before or after an exhibition or demonstration, pending movement to another site, return to the United States or the foreign reexporter, or BIS approval for other disposition, the commodities and software may be placed in a bonded warehouse or a storage facility provided that the exporter retains “effective control” over their disposition. The export documentation for this type of transaction must show the exporter as ultimate consignee, in care of the person who will have control over the commodities and software abroad.
(6)
Inspection, test, calibration, and repair.
Commodities to be inspected, tested, calibrated, or repaired abroad may be exported, reexported, and transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a)(6) to all destinations except Country Group E:1.
(7)
Containers.
Containers for which another license exception is not available and that are necessary for shipment of commodities may be exported, reexported, and transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a)(7). However, this paragraph does not authorize the export of the container's contents, which, if not exempt from licensing, must be separately authorized for export under either a license exception or a license.
(8)
Assembly in Mexico.
Commodities may be exported to Mexico under Customs entries that require return to the United States after processing, assembly, or incorporation into end products by companies, factories, or facilities
participating in Mexico's in-bond industrialization program (IMMEX) under this paragraph (a)(8), provided that all resulting end-products (or the commodities themselves) are returned to the United States as soon as practicable but no later than four years after the date of export or reexport.

§ 740.10
License Exception Servicing and replacement of parts and equipment (RPL).
License Exception RPL authorizes exports and reexports associated with
one-for-one replacement of parts, components, accessories, and attachments. License Exception RPL also authorizes exports and reexports of certain items currently “subject to the EAR” to or for, or to replace, a defense article described in an export or reexport authorization issued under the authority of the Arms Export Control Act. It does not, however, authorize the export or reexport of defense articles subject to the ITAR, i.e., described on the United States Munitions List (22 CFR 121.1).
(a)
Parts, components, accessories, and attachments
—(1)
Scope.
The provisions of this paragraph (a) authorize the export and reexport of one-for-one replacement parts, components, accessories, and attachments for previously exported equipment or other end items.
(2)
One-for-one replacement of parts, components, accessories, or attachments.
(i) The terms
replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments
as used in this section mean parts, components, accessories, or attachments needed for the immediate repair of equipment or other end items, including replacement of defective or worn parts or components. (These terms include ‘subassemblies,’ but do not include test instruments or operating supplies. The term ‘
subassembly’
means a number of parts or components assembled to perform a specific function or functions within a commodity. One example would be printed circuit boards with components mounted thereon. This definition does not include major subsystems such as those composed of a number of ‘subassemblies.’) Items that improve or change the basic design characteristics, e.g., as to accuracy, capability, performance or productivity, of the equipment or other end item upon which they are installed, are not deemed to be replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments. For kits consisting of replacement parts or components, consult § 740.9(a)(4) of this part.
(ii) Parts, components, accessories, and attachments may be exported only to replace, on a one-for-one basis, parts, components, accessories, or attachments, respectively, contained in commodities that were: Lawfully exported from the United States; lawfully reexported; or made in a foreign country incorporating authorized parts, components, accessories, or attachments “subject to the EAR” (see § 734.2(a) of the EAR). “600 series” parts, components, accessories and attachments may be exported only to replace, on a one-for-one basis, parts, components, accessories, or attachments that were: lawfully exported from the United States, or lawfully reexported. The conditions of the original U.S. authorization must not have been violated. Accordingly, the export of replacement parts, components, accessories, and attachments may be made only by the party who originally exported or reexported the commodity to be repaired, or by a party that has confirmed the existence of appropriate authority for the original transaction.
(iii) The parts, components, accessories, or attachments to be replaced must either be destroyed abroad or returned promptly to the person who supplied the replacements, or to a foreign firm that is under the effective control of that person.
(3)
Exclusions to License Exception RPL.
(i) No replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to repair a commodity exported under a license or other authorization if that license or other authorization included a condition that any subsequent replacements may be exported only under a license.
(ii) No parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to be held abroad as spares for future use. Replacements may be exported to replace spares that were authorized to accompany the export of equipment or other end items as those spares are used in the repair of the equipment or other end item. This allows maintenance of the stock of spares at a consistent level as the parts, components, accessories, or attachments are used.
(iii) No parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to any destination, except the countries listed in supplement no. 3 to part 744 of the EAR (Countries Not Subject to Certain Nuclear End Use Restrictions in § 744.2(a)), if the item is to be incorporated into or used in nuclear
weapons, nuclear explosive devices, nuclear testing related to activities described in § 744.2(a) of the EAR, the chemical processing of irradiated special nuclear or source material, the production of heavy water, the separation of isotopes of source and special nuclear materials, or the fabrication of nuclear reactor fuel containing plutonium, as described in § 744.2(a) of the EAR.
(iv) No replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to countries in Country Group E:1 (see supplement no. 1 to this part) (countries designated by the Secretary of State as supporting acts of international terrorism) if the commodity to be repaired is an “aircraft” (as defined in § 772.1 of the EAR) or is controlled for national security (NS) reasons.
(v) No replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to countries in Country Group E:1 (see supplement no. 1 to this part) if the commodity to be repaired is explosives detection equipment classified under ECCN 2A983 or related software classified under ECCN 2D983.
(vi) No replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments may be exported to countries in Country Group E:1 (see supplement no. 1 to this part) if the commodity to be repaired is concealed object detection equipment classified under ECCN 2A984 or related software classified under ECCN 2D984.
(vii) The conditions described in this paragraph (a)(3) relating to replacement of parts, components, accessories, or attachments do not apply to reexports to a foreign country of parts, components accessories, or attachments as replacements in foreign-origin products, if at the time the replacements are furnished, the foreign-origin product is eligible for export to such country under any of the license exceptions in this part or the exceptions in § 734.4 of the EAR (
De minimis
U.S. content).
(viii) “Parts,” “components,” “accessories,” and “attachments” classified in 9x515 or “600 series” ECCNs may not be exported or reexported to a destination listed in Country Group D:5 (see supplement no. 1 to this part).
(4)
Reexports.
(i) Parts, components, accessories, and attachments exported from the United States may be reexported to a new country of destination, provided that the conditions established in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section are met. A party reexporting one-for-one replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments “subject to the EAR” shall ensure that the commodities being repaired were shipped to their present location in accordance with U.S. law and continue to be lawfully used, and that either before or promptly after reexport of the replacement parts, components, accessories, or attachments, the replaced commodities and software are either destroyed or returned to the United States, or to the foreign firm in Country Group B (see supplement no. 1 to this part) that shipped the replacement parts.
(ii) The conditions described in paragraph (a)(3) relating to replacement of “parts,” “components,” “accessories,” or “attachments” (excluding 9x515 and “600 series” ECCNs) do not apply to reexports to a foreign country of “parts,” “components,” “accessories,” or “attachments” as replacements in foreign-origin products, if at the time the replacements are furnished, the foreign-origin product is eligible for export to such country under any of the License Exceptions in this part or the foreign-origin product is not subject to the EAR pursuant to § 734.4.
(b)

§ 740.11
Governments, international organizations, international inspections under the Chemical Weapons Convention, and the International Space Station (GOV).
This License Exception authorizes exports and reexports for international nuclear safeguards; U.S. government agencies or personnel; agencies of cooperating governments; international inspections under the Chemical Weapons Convention; and the International Space Station. Commodities listed in ECCNs 0A501, 0A506, 0A507, 0A508, and 0A509 are eligible only for transactions described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. Any item listed in a 0x5zz ECCN for export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to an E:1 country is eligible only for transactions described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) solely for U.S. Government official use of this section.
(a)
International safeguards
—(1)
Scope.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an international organization that establishes and administers safeguards, including Additional Protocols, designed to ensure that special nuclear materials and other related nuclear facilities, equipment, and material are not diverted from peaceful purposes to non-peaceful purposes. European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) is an international organization of European countries with headquarters in Luxembourg. Euratom establishes and administers safeguards designed to ensure that special nuclear materials and other related nuclear facilities, equipment, and material are not diverted from peaceful purposes to non-peaceful purposes. This paragraph (a) authorizes exports and reexports of commodities or software to the IAEA and Euratom, and reexports by IAEA and Euratom for official international safeguard use, as follows:
(i) Commodities or software consigned to the IAEA at its headquarters in Vienna, Austria or its field offices in Toronto, Ontario, Canada or in Tokyo, Japan for official international safeguards use.
(ii) Commodities or software consigned to the Euratom Safeguards Directorate in Luxembourg, Luxembourg for official international safeguards use.
(iii) Commodities or software consigned to IAEA or Euratom may be reexported to any country for IAEA or Euratom international safeguards use provided that IAEA or Euratom maintains control of or otherwise safeguards the commodities or software and returns the commodities or software to the locations described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) of this section when they become obsolete, are no longer required, or are replaced.
(iv) Commodity or software shipments may be made by persons under direct contract with IAEA or Euratom, or by Department of Energy National Laboratories as directed by the Department of State or the Department of Energy.
(v) The monitoring functions of IAEA and Euratom are not subject to the restrictions on prohibited safeguarded nuclear activities described in § 744.2(a)(3) of the EAR.
(vi) When commodities or software originally consigned to IAEA or Euratom are no longer in IAEA or Euratom official safeguards use, such
commodities may be disposed of by destruction or by reexport or transfer in accordance with the EAR.
(2)
Restrictions.
(i) Items on the Sensitive List (see supplement no. 6 to part 774 of the EAR) may not be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a),
except
to the countries listed in Country Group A:5 (See supplement no.1 to part 740 of the EAR).
(ii) Items on the Very Sensitive List (see supplement no. 7 to part 774 of the EAR) may not be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a).
(iii) Encryption items controlled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002, 5A004, 5D002, or 5E002 may not be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under this paragraph (a). See § 740.17 of the EAR (License Exception ENC) for possible alternative license exception authorization.
(iv) Without prior authorization from the Bureau of Industry and Security, nationals of countries in Country Group E:1(see supplement no. 1 to this part) may not physically or computationally access computers that have been enhanced by “electronic assemblies,” which have been exported or reexported under License Exception GOV and have been used to enhance such computers by aggregation of processors so that the APP of the aggregation exceeds the APP parameter set forth in ECCN 4A003.b.
(v) “600 series” items may not be exported or reexported under this paragraph (a),
except
to the countries listed in Country Group A:5 (see supplement no.1 to this part).
(b)
United States Government
—(1)
Scope.
The provisions of this paragraph (b) authorize exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) to personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government and certain exports by, for or at the direction of the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy. “Agency of the U.S. Government” includes all civilian and military departments, branches, missions, government-owned corporations, and other agencies of the U.S. Government but does not include such national agencies as the American Red Cross or international organizations in which the United States participates such as the Organization of American States. Therefore, shipments may not be made to these non-governmental national or international agencies, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section for U.S. representatives to these organizations. For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section, BIS has determined that a Space Act Agreement (SAA) to which the National Aeronautics Space Agency (NASA) is a party meets the criteria of these paragraphs for being authorized by law and subject to control by the President by other means.
(2)
Eligibility
—(i)
Items for personal use by personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government.
This provision is available for items in quantities sufficient only for the personal use of members of the U.S. Armed Forces or civilian personnel of the U.S. Government (including U.S. representatives to public international organizations), and their immediate families and household employees. Items for personal use include household effects, food, beverages, and other daily necessities.
(ii)
Exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) made by or consigned to a department or agency of the U.S. Government.
This paragraph authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers of items when made by or consigned to a department or agency of the U.S. Government solely for its official use or for carrying out any U.S. Government program with foreign governments or international organizations that is authorized by law and subject to control by the President by other means. This paragraph does not authorize a department or agency of the U.S. Government to make any export, reexport, or transfer that is otherwise prohibited by other administrative provisions or by statute. Contractor support personnel of a department or agency of the U.S. Government are eligible for this authorization when in the performance of their duties pursuant to the applicable contract or other official duties. 'Contractor support personnel' for the purpose of this provision means those persons who provide administrative, managerial, scientific or technical support under contract to a U.S. Government department or agency (
e.g.,
contractor
employees of Federally Funded Research Facilities or Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance contractors). The term 'contractor support personnel' for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) is limited to those individuals who are providing such support within a U.S. Government owned or operated facility or under the direct supervision of a U.S. government employee (
i.e.,
an individual directly employed by the U.S. Government). Private security contractors are not 'contractor support personnel' for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) because although they may work within a U.S. Government owned or operated facility, such contractors do not provide administrative, managerial, scientific or technical support under contract to the U.S. Government. This authorization is not available when a department or agency of the U.S. Government acts as a transmittal agent on behalf of a non-U.S. Government person, either as a convenience or in satisfaction of security requirements.
(iii)
Exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) made for or on behalf of a department or agency of the U.S. Government.

(C) This paragraph authorizes the 'temporary' export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of an item in support of any foreign assistance or sales program authorized by law and subject to the control of the President by other means, when:
(
1
) The item is provided pursuant to a contract between the exporter, reexporter, or transferor and a department or agency of the U.S. Government; and
(
2
) The exporter, reexporter, or transferor obtains a written authorization from the Secretary or agency head of the U.S. Government department or agency responsible for the program, or his or her designee, authorizing the exporter, reexporter, or transferor to use this license exception. The written authorization must include the scope of items to be shipped under this license exception; the end users and consignees of the items; and any restrictions on the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) (including any restrictions on the foreign release of technology);

iii

# )(C):
'Temporary,' for purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C) of this section, means that four years from the date of an item's initial export, reexport, or transfer (in-country), it must be returned to the exporter, reexporter,
or transferor or its disposition otherwise authorized (e.g., pursuant to a license or another license exception) in accordance with the EAR.

# Note 2 to paragraph (
b

# )(2):
Items controlled for NS, MT, CB, NP, FC, or AT reasons may not be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) to, or for the use of military, police, intelligence entities, or other sensitive end users (e.g., contractors or other governmental parties performing functions on behalf of military, police, or intelligence entities) of a government in a Country Group E:1 or E:2 country.
(D) This paragraph authorizes the export, reexport, or transfer of commodities or software at the direction of the U.S. Department of Defense for an end use in support of an Acquisition and Cross Servicing Agreement (ACSA), when:

) The export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) is pursuant to a contract with a department or agency of the U.S. Government; and
(
3
) Shipment documents must include the following statement: “Property of [insert U.S. Government department, agency, or service]. Property may not enter the trade of the country to which it is shipped. Authorized under License Exception GOV. U.S. Government point of contact: [Insert name and telephone number].”
(F)
Electronic Export Information.
Electronic Export Information (EEI) must be filed in the Automated Export System (AES) for any export made pursuant to paragraph (b)(iii) of this section. The EEI must identify License Exception GOV as the authority for the export and indicate that the applicant has received the relevant documentation from the contracting U.S. Government department, agency, or service. The Internal Transaction Number assigned by AES must be properly annotated on shipping documents (bill of lading, airway bill, other transportation documents, or commercial invoice).
(G) The exporter, reexporter, or transferor must obtain an authorization, if required, before any item previously exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under this paragraph is resold, transferred, reexported, transshipped, or disposed of to an end user for any end use, or to any destination other than as authorized by this paragraph (e.g., property disposal of surplus items outside of the United States), unless:

military aircraft or naval vessel of that government or organization or via the Defense Transportation Service.
(vi) This paragraph authorizes transfer of technology in furtherance of a contract between the exporter and an agency of the U.S. Government, if the contract provides for such technology and the technology is not “development” or “production” technology for “600 series” items.
(vii) This paragraph authorizes the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of microelectronics items in furtherance of a contract between the exporter, reexporter, or transferor and a department or agency of the U.S. Government, if the contract provides for such export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of the microelectronics item by the exporter, reexporter, or transferor.
(c)
Cooperating Governments and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
—(1)
Scope.
The provisions of this paragraph (c) authorize exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of the items listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section to agencies of cooperating governments or agencies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

If the membership of the civil intergovernmental organization includes any national governments or other organizations that are not 'cooperating governments,' such civil intergovernmental organizations are not considered 'cooperating governments' for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For example, civil intergovernmental organizations such as the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the United Nations, and the World Bank do not fall within paragraph (c)(1) of this section because their membership includes governments that are not 'cooperating governments.'
(2)
Eligibility
—(i)

International Space Station (ISS)
—(1)
Scope.
The ISS is a research facility in a low-Earth orbit approximately 190 miles (350 km) above the surface of the Earth. The ISS is a joint project among the space agencies of the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada, Europe and Italy. This paragraph (e) authorizes exports and reexports required on short notice of certain commodities subject to the EAR that are classified under ECCN 9A004 to launch sites for supply missions to the ISS.
(2)
Eligible commodities.
Any commodity subject to the EAR that is classified under ECCN 9A004 and that is required for use on the ISS on short notice.

# Note 4 to paragraph (
e

# )(2):
This license exception is not available for the export or reexport of “parts,” “components,” “accessories,” and “attachments” to overseas manufacturers for the purpose of incorporation into other items destined for the ISS.

# Note 5 to paragraph (
e

# )(2):
For purposes of this paragraph (e), ‘short notice’ means the exporter is required to have a commodity manifested and at the scheduled launch site for hatch-closure (final stowage) no more than forty-five (45) days from the time the exporter or reexporter received complete
documentation. ‘Complete documentation’ means the exporter or reexporter received the technical description of the commodity and purpose for use of the commodity on the ISS. ‘Hatch-closure (final stowage)’ means the final date specified by a launch provider by which items must be at a specified location in a launch country in order to be included on a mission to the ISS. The exporter or reexporter must receive the notification to supply the commodity for use on the ISS in writing. That notification must be kept in accordance with paragraph (e)(8) of this section and the Recordkeeping requirements in part 762 of the EAR.
(3)
Eligible destinations.
Eligible destinations are France, Japan, Kazakhstan, and Russia. To be eligible, a destination needs to have a launch for a supply mission to the ISS scheduled by a country participating in the ISS.
(4)
Requirement for commodities to be launched on an eligible space launch vehicle (SLV).
Only commodities that will be delivered to the ISS using United States, Russian, ESA (French), or Japanese space launch vehicles (SLVs) are eligible under this authorization. Commodities to be delivered to the ISS using SLVs from any other countries are excluded from this authorization.
(5)
Authorizations
—(i)
Authorization to retain commodity at or near launch site for up to six months.
If there are unexpected delays in a launch schedule for reasons such as mechanical failures in a launch vehicle or weather, commodities exported or reexported under this paragraph (e) may be retained at or near the launch site for a period of six (6) months from the time of initial export or reexport before the commodities must be destroyed, returned to the exporter or reexporter, or be the subject of an individually validated license request submitted to BIS to authorize further disposition of the commodities.
(ii)
Authorization to retain commodity abroad at launch country beyond six months.
If, after the commodity is exported or reexported under this authorization, a delay occurs in the launch schedule that would exceed the 6-month deadline in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section, the exporter or reexporter or the person in control of the commodities in the launch country may request a one-time 6-month extension by submitting written notification to BIS requesting a 6-month extension and noting the reason for the delay. If the requestor is not contacted by BIS within 30 days from the date of the postmark of the written notification and if the notification meets the requirements of this subparagraph, the request is deemed granted. The request must be sent to BIS at the address listed in part 748 of the EAR and should include the name and address of the exporter or reexporter, the name and address of the person who has control of the commodity, the date the commodities were exported or reexported, a brief product description, and the justification for the extension. To retain a commodity abroad beyond the 6-month extension period, the exporter, reexporter or person in control of the commodity must request authorization by submitting a license application in accordance with §§ 748.1, 748.4 and 748.6 of the EAR to BIS 90 days prior to the expiration of the 6-month extension period.
(iii)
Items not delivered to the ISS because of a failed launch.
If the commodities exported or reexported under this paragraph (e) of this section are not delivered to the ISS because a failed launch causes the destruction of the commodity prior to its being delivered, exporters and reexporters must make note of the destruction of the commodities in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements under paragraph (e)(8)(ii) of this section and part 762 of the EAR.
(6)
Reexports to an alternate launch country.
If a mechanical or weather related issue causes a change from the scheduled launch country to another foreign country after a commodity was exported or reexported, then that commodity may be subsequently reexported to the new scheduled launch country, provided all of the terms and conditions of paragraph (e) of this section are met, along with any other applicable EAR provisions. In such instances, the 6-month time limitation described in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section would start over again at the
time of the subsequent reexport transaction. Note that if the subsequent reexport may be made under the designation No License Required (NLR) or pursuant to an authorization under the EAR, a reexporter does not need to rely on the provisions contained in this paragraph (e).
(7)
Eligible recipients.
Only persons involved in the launch of commodities to the ISS may receive and have access to commodities exported or reexported pursuant to this paragraph (e), except that:
(i) No commodities may be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under paragraph (e) to any national of an E:1 country (see supplement no. 1 to this part), and
(ii) No person may receive commodities authorized under paragraph (e) of this section who is subject to an end-user or end-use control described in part 744 of the EAR, including the entity list in supplement no. 4 to part 744.
(8)
Recordkeeping requirements.
Exporters and reexporters must maintain records regarding exports or reexports made using this paragraph (e) of this section as well as any other applicable recordkeeping requirements under part 762 of the EAR.
(i) Exporters and reexporters must retain a record of the initial written notification they received requesting these commodities be supplied on short notice for a supply mission to the ISS, including the date the exporter or reexporter received complete documentation (i.e., the day on which the 45-day clock begins).
(ii) Exporters and reexporters must maintain records of the date of any exports or reexports made using this paragraph (e) and the date on which the commodities were launched into space for delivery to the ISS. If the commodities are not delivered to the ISS because of a failed launch whereby the item is destroyed prior to being delivered to the ISS, this must be noted for recordkeeping purposes.
(iii) The return or destruction of defective or worn out parts or components is not required. However, if defective or worn out parts or components originally exported or reexported pursuant to this paragraph (e) are returned from the ISS, then those parts and components may be either: returned to the original country of export or reexport; destroyed; or reexported or transferred (in-country) to a destination that has been designated by NASA for conducting a review and analysis of the defective or worn part or component. Documentation for this activity must be kept for recordkeeping purposes. No commodities that are subject to the EAR may be returned, under the provisions of this paragraph, to a country listed in Country Group E:1 (see supplement no. 1 to this part) or to any person if that person is subject to an end-user or end-use control described in part 744 of the EAR. For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, a ‘defective or worn out’ part or component is a part or component that no longer performs its intended function.

§ 740.12
Gift parcels and humanitarian donations (GFT).
(a)
Gift parcels
—(1)
Scope.
The provisions of paragraph (a) authorize exports and reexports of gift parcels by an individual (donor) addressed to an individual, or a religious, charitable or educational organization (donee) located in any destination for the use of the donee or the donee's immediate family (and not for resale). The gift parcel must be provided free of charge to the donee. However, payment by the donee of any handling charges or of any fees levied by the importing country (e.g., import duties, taxes, etc.) is not considered to be a cost to the donee for purposes of this definition of “gift parcel.”
1
1
Many foreign countries permit the entry, duty-free, of gift parcels that conform to regulations regarding contents and marking. To secure this advantage, the sender should show the words “U.S.A. Gift Parcel” on the addressee side of the package and on any required customs declarations. Information regarding the foreign postal regulations is
available at local post offices. Senders of gift parcels who wish information regarding import duties of a foreign country should contact the nearest Commercial Office, Consulate or Embassy of the country concerned.
(2)
Commodity, value and other limitations
—(i)
Item limitations
—(A)
Prohibited items.
(
1
) For Cuba no items listed on the Commerce Control List other than items listed in § 740.19(b) of the EAR may be included in a gift parcel.
(
2
) For all destinations, no items controlled for chemical and biological weapons (CB), missile technology (MT), national security (NS), nuclear proliferation (NP) or encryption items (EI) reasons on the Commerce Control List (supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) may be included in a gift parcel.
(
3
)
Items prohibited for destinations in Country Group D:1 or E:2.
For destinations in Country Group D:1 or E:2, military wearing apparel may not be included in a gift parcel regardless of whether all distinctive U.S. military insignia, buttons, and other markings are removed.
(
4
) Gold bullion, gold taels, and gold bars are prohibited as are items intended for resale or reexport.
(B)
Eligible items.
For all destinations, eligible items are food (including vitamins); medicines, medical supplies and devices (including hospital supplies and equipment and equipment for the handicapped); receive-only radio equipment for reception of commercial/civil AM/FM and short wave publicly available frequency bands, and batteries for such equipment; clothing; personal hygiene items; seeds; veterinary medicines and supplies; fishing equipment and supplies; soap-making equipment; as well as all other items of a type normally sent as gifts between individuals (including items listed in § 740.19(b) of the EAR) except for those items prohibited in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section. Items in gift parcels must be in quantities normally given as gifts between individuals.

# Example to paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
A watch or piece of jewelry is normally sent as a gift. However, multiple watches, either in one package or in subsequent shipments, would not qualify for such gift parcels because the quantity would exceed that normally given between individuals. Similarly, a sewing machine or bicycle within the value limit of this License Exception may be an appropriate gift. However, subsequent shipments of the same item to the same donee would not be a gift normally given between individuals.
(ii)
Import requirements.
The commodities must be acceptable in type and quantity by the recipient country for import as gifts. Commodities exceeding the import limits may not be included in gift parcels.
(iii)
Frequency.
(A) Except for gift parcels of food to Cuba, not more than one gift parcel may be sent from the same donor to the same donee in any one calendar month.

§ 740.13
Technology and software—unrestricted (TSU).
This license exception authorizes exports and reexports of operation technology and software; sales technology and software; software updates (bug fixes); “mass market” software subject to the General Software Note; and release of technology and source code in the United States by U.S. universities to their bona fide and full time regular employees. Note that encryption software subject to the EAR is not subject to the General Software Note (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section).
(a)
Operation technology and software
—(1)
Scope.
The provisions of paragraph (a) permit exports and reexports of operation technology and software. “Operation technology” is the minimum technology necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance (checking), or repair of those commodities or software that are lawfully exported or reexported under a license, a License Exception, or NLR. The “minimum necessary” operation technology does not include technology for development or production and includes use technology only to the extent required to ensure safe and efficient use of the commodity or software. Individual entries in the software and technology subcategories of the CCL may further restrict the export or reexport of operation technology. This paragraph (a) authorizes training, provided the training is limited to the operation, maintenance and repair technology identified in this paragraph.
(2)
Provisions and destinations
—(i)
Provisions.
Operation software may be exported or reexported provided that both of the following conditions are met:
(A) The operation software is the minimum necessary to operate equipment authorized for export or reexport; and
(B) The operation software is in object code.
(ii)
Destinations.
Operation software and technology may be exported or reexported to any destination to which the equipment for which it is required has been or is being legally exported or reexported.
(b)
Sales technology
—(1)
Scope.
The provisions of paragraph (b) authorize exports and reexports of sales technology. “Sales technology” is data supporting a prospective or actual quotation, bid, or offer to sell, lease, or otherwise supply any item.
(2)
Provisions and destinations
—(i)
Provisions.
Sales technology may be exported or reexported provided that:
(A) The technology is a type customarily transmitted with a prospective or actual quotation, bid, or offer in accordance with established business practice; and
(B) Neither the export nor the reexport will disclose the detailed design, production, or manufacture technology, or the means of reconstruction, of either the quoted item or its product. The purpose of this limitation is to prevent disclosure of technology so detailed that the consignee could reduce the technology to production.
(ii)
Destinations.
Sales technology may be exported or reexported to any destination.

# Note:
Neither this section nor its use means that the U.S. Government intends, or is committed, to approve a license application for any commodity, plant, software, or technology that may be the subject of the transaction to which such quotation, bid, or offer relates. Exporters are advised to include in any quotations, bids, or offers, and in any contracts entered into pursuant to such quotations, bids, or offers, a provision relieving themselves of liability in the event that a license (when required) is not approved by the Bureau of Industry and Security.
(c)
Software updates.
The provisions of paragraph (c) authorize exports and reexports of software updates that are intended for and are limited to correction of errors (“fixes” to “bugs”) in
software lawfully exported or reexported (original software). Such software updates may be exported or reexported only to the same consignee to whom the original software was exported or reexported, and such software updates may not enhance the functional capacities of the original software. Such software updates may be exported or reexported to any destination to which the software for which they are required has been legally exported or reexported.
(d)
General Software Note: mass market software
—(1)
Scope.
The provisions of paragraph (d) authorize exports and reexports of mass market software subject to the General Software Note (see supplement no. 2 to part 774 of the EAR; also referenced in this section).
2
2
Pursuant to 15 CFR § 30.37(f) of the Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR), Electronic Export Information (EEI) via the Automated Export System (AES) is required for mass-market software.
(2)
Exclusions.
The provisions of this paragraph (d) are not available for encryption software controlled for “EI” reasons under ECCN 5D002 or for encryption software with symmetric key length exceeding 64-bits that qualifies as mass market encryption software under the criteria in the Cryptography Note (Note 3) of Category 5, Part 2, of the CCL (supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR). (Once such mass market encryption software has been released from “EI” and “NS” controls pursuant to § 740.17(b) of the EAR, it is controlled under ECCN 5D992.c and is thus outside the scope of License Exception TSU.) See § 740.17(b) of the EAR for exports and reexports of mass market encryption products controlled under ECCN 5D992.c. The provisions of this paragraph (d) are also not available for any software that is controlled for missile technology (MT) reasons.

Procedures.
You must provide prior notification of exports and reexports under License Exception AGR by submitting a completed application in accordance with § 748.1 of the EAR. The following blocks must be completed, as appropriate: Blocks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (by marking box 5 “Other”), 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22 (a), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), 23, and 25 according to the instructions described in supplement no. 1 to part 748 of the EAR. If your commodity is fertilizer, western red cedar or live horses, you must confirm that BIS has previously classified your commodity as EAR99 by placing the Commodity Classification Automatic Tracking System (CCATS) number in Block 22(d). BIS will not initiate the registration of an AGR notification unless the application is complete.
(3)
Action by BIS.
Within two business days of the registration of the AGR notification, BIS will refer the notification for interagency review, or if necessary return the notification without action (e.g., if the information provided is incomplete). Registration is defined as the point at which the notification is entered into BIS's electronic system.
(4)
Review by other departments or agencies.
The Departments of Defense, State, and other agencies, as appropriate, may review the AGR notification. BIS must receive department or agency objections within nine business days of the referral. Unlike the provisions described in § 750.4(b) of the EAR, there are no provisions for stopping the processing time of the AGR notification. If, within 11 business days after the date of registration, any reviewing agency provides a written objection that the recipient may promote international terrorism or the transaction raises nonproliferation concerns, you may not use License Exception AGR. In such cases, BIS will notify you that a license is required for the export or reexport. BIS will then process the AGR notification as a license application in accordance with the provisions described in § 750.4 of the EAR, and the licensing policies set forth in the EAR. At this time, BIS may request additional information. When BIS confirms that no agency has raised an objection within eleven business days (as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section), you may proceed with the transaction provided that you satisfy all other requirements of License Exception AGR, including the requirement to have a written contract prior to any shipment (unless a donation or commercial sample). (Note that the fact that you have been advised that no agency has objected to the transaction does not exempt you from other licensing requirements under the EAR, such as those based on knowledge of a prohibited end-use or end-user as referenced in general prohibition five
(part 736 of the EAR) and set forth in part 744 of the EAR.)
(5)
Status of pending AGR notification requests.
You must contact BIS's System for Tracking Export License Applications (STELA) (
https://snapr.bis.doc.gov/stela
) for status of your pending AGR notification or verify the status in BIS's Simplified Network Applications Processing Redesign (SNAP-R) System. STELA will provide the date of registration of the AGR notification. If no department or agency objection is raised within 11 business days, STELA will, on the twelfth business day following the date of registration, provide you with confirmation of that fact. You may not proceed with your shipment unless you confirm with either STELA or SNAP-R that no objection has been raised. If an objection is raised, STELA and SNAP-R will indicate that a license is required. The AGR notification will then be processed as a license application. In addition, BIS may provide notice of an objection by telephone, fax, courier service, or other means.
(d)
Donations.
(1) Donations of agricultural commodities are eligible for export and reexport to Cuba under License Exception AGR, provided the transaction meets the requirements and procedures of this license exception (except the written contract requirement).
(2) Donations of food items to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and individuals in Cuba may also be eligible for License Exception GFT. See § 740.12 for eligibility requirements of gift parcels and humanitarian donations under License Exception GFT.

§ 740.20
License Exception Strategic Trade Authorization (STA).
(a)
Introduction.
This section authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country), including releases within a single country of software source code and technology to foreign nationals, in lieu of a license that would otherwise be required pursuant to part 742 of the EAR.

# Note 1 to paragraph (
a

# ):
License Exception STA authorizes transfers (in-country) but is only needed to authorize a transfer (in-country) when an EAR authorization is required. If a transfer (in-country) is not being made under STA, the requirements specified in this section do not apply (see Note 1 to paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section for requirements specific to staying within the scope of the original License Exception STA authorization and the concept of 'completing the chain' for purposes of “600 series” items originally authorized under License Exception STA).
(b)

(3)
Limitations on the Use of STA that are Specific to “600 series” Items.
(i) License Exception STA may not be used for any “600 series” items identified in the relevant ECCN as not being eligible for STA.
(ii) License Exception STA may be used to export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) “600 series” items to persons, whether non-governmental or governmental, if they are in and, for natural persons, nationals of a country listed in Country Group A:5 (See supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) or the United States and if:
(A) The
ultimate
end user for such items is the armed forces, police, paramilitary, law enforcement, customs, correctional, fire, or a search and rescue agency of a government of one of the countries listed in Country Group A:5, or the United States Government;
(B) For the “development,” “production,” operation, installation, maintenance, repair, overhaul, or refurbishing of an item in one of the countries listed in Country Group A:5 or the United States that will be for one, or more, of the following purposes:
(
1
) Ultimately to be used by any such government agencies in one of the countries listed in Country Group A:5 or the United States Government; or
(
2
) Sent to a person in the United States and not for subsequent export under § 740.9(b)(1) (License Exception TMP for items moving in transit through the United States); or
(C) The United States Government has otherwise authorized the ultimate end use, the license or other authorization is in effect, and the consignee verifies in writing that such authorization exists and has provided the license or other approval identifier to the exporter, reexporter or transferor (as applicable).
(iii) License Exception STA may not be used to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) end items described in ECCN 0A606.a, ECCN 8A609.a, ECCN 8A620.a or .b, or ECCN 9A610.a until after BIS has approved their export under STA under the procedures set out in § 740.20(g).
(iv) License Exception STA may not be used to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) “600 series” items if they are “600 Series Major Defense Equipment” and the value of such items in the contract requiring their export exceeds $25,000,000.

# Note 1 to paragraphs (
b

# )(2) and (
b

# )(3):
Any export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) originally authorized under License Exception STA must stay within the scope of the original authorization. For example, for “600 series” items authorized under License Exception STA, such items must be provided to an eligible ultimate end user, such as a Country Group A:5 military, to stay in compliance with the original authorization. This requirement for the “600 series” is referred to as 'completing the chain,' meaning regardless of how many times the “600 series” item is transferred (in-country) or whether the “600 series” item is incorporated into higher level assemblies or other items, the “600 series” item must ultimately be provided to an eligible ultimate end user, or be otherwise authorized under the EAR. This applies regardless of whether the “600 series” item has been incorporated into a foreign-made item that may no longer be “subject to the EAR.” Because the other items eligible for authorization under License Exception STA (9x515 and other non-600 series ECCNs) do not include the “600 series” requirements specific to ultimate end user, this 'completing the chain' concept does not apply to 9x515 and other non-600 series ECCNs authorized under License Exception STA. However, the original export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) made under License Exception STA for 9x515 and other non-600 series ECCNs still must comply with the original authorization—meaning the terms and conditions of License Exception STA.
(c)
Authorizing paragraphs
—(1)
Multiple reasons for control.
Exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) in which the only applicable reason(s) for control is (are) national security (NS); chemical or biological weapons (CB); nuclear nonproliferation (NP); regional stability (RS); crime control (CC), and/or significant items (SI) are authorized for destinations in or nationals of Country Group A:5 (See supplement no.1 to part 740 of the EAR).

# Note to paragraph (
c

# )(1).
License Exception STA under § 740.20(c)(1) may be used to authorize the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of “600 series” items only if the purchaser, intermediate consignee, ultimate consignee, and end user have previously been approved on a license or other approval, i.e., Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) Manufacturing License Agreement (MLA), Technical Assistance Agreement (TAA), Warehouse Distribution Agreement (WDA), or General Correspondence approval (GC) issued by BIS or DDTC at the U.S. Department of State.
(2)
Controls of lesser sensitivity.
Exports, reexports and transfers (in-country) in which the only applicable reason for control is national security (NS) and the item being exported, reexported or transferred (in-country) is not designated in the STA paragraph in the License Exception section of the ECCN that lists the item are authorized for destinations in or nationals of Country Group A:6 (See supplement no. 1 to this part).
(d)
Conditions
—(1)
Requirement to furnish Export Control Classification Number.
(i) The exporter must furnish to the consignee the ECCN of each item to be exported pursuant to this section. Once furnished to a particular consignee, the ECCN that applies to any item need not be refurnished to that consignee at the time the same exporter makes an additional export of the same item, if the information remains accurate at the time of the additional export.
(ii) A reexporter or transferor must furnish to subsequent consignees the ECCN, provided by the exporter or a prior reexporter or transferor, of each item to be reexported or transferred (in-country) pursuant to this section. Once furnished to a particular consignee, the ECCN that applies to any item need not be refurnished to that consignee at the time the same reexporter or transferor makes an additional reexport or transfer (in-country) of the same item, if the information remains accurate at the time of the additional reexport or transfer (in-country).
(iii) For purposes of determining reexport or transfer eligibility under this section, the consignee may rely on the
ECCN provided to it by the party required to furnish the ECCN under paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section unless the consignee knows that the ECCN is incorrect or has changed. The word “knows” has the same meaning as the term “knowledge” in § 772.1 of the EAR.
(2)
Prior Consignee Statement.
The requirements in this paragraph (d)(2) apply to each party using License Exception STA to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country), including reexporters and transferors of items previously received under License Exception STA. The exporter, reexporter, or transferor must obtain the following statement in writing from its consignee(s) prior to exporting, reexporting, or transferring (in-country) the item and must retain the statement in accordance with part 762 of the EAR. One statement may be used for multiple exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of the same items between the same parties so long as the party names, the description(s) of the item(s) and the ECCNs are correct. The exporter, reexporter, or transferor must maintain a log or other record (such as documents created in the ordinary course of business) that identifies each shipment made pursuant to this section and the specific consignee statement that is associated with each shipment. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), a log or other record is not required for intangible (
i.e.,
electronic or in an otherwise intangible form) exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) made under License Exception STA, but an exporter, reexporter, or transferor is required, prior to making any export, reexport, or transfer (in-country), to ensure that a prior consignee statement has been obtained pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph (d)(2). (
See
Note 1 to paragraph (d)(3) of this section for additional guidance on intangible exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country), including best practices). Paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section are required for all transactions. In addition, paragraph (d)(2)(vii) is required for all transactions in “600 series” items and paragraph (viii) of this section is required for transactions in “600 series” items if the consignee is not the government of a country listed in Country Group A:5 (See supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). Paragraph (d)(2)(viii) is also required for transactions including 9x515 items.

While the exporter, reexporter, and transferor must furnish the applicable ECCN and obtain a consignee statement prior to export, reexport or transfer (in-country) made under License Exception STA in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, intangible (i.e., electronic or in an otherwise intangible form) exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) made under License Exception STA are not subject to the notification requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section. However, any export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) made under STA must stay within the scope of the original authorization.
(4)
Requirements for releases of software source code or technology within a single country.
Instead of the requirement of paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section, the party releasing software source code or technology to a national of a country listed in Country Group A:5 or A:6 (See supplement no. 1 to this part) must notify the recipient of the software source code or technology of the restrictions upon further release of the software source code or technology. The notification must either expressly inform the recipient that the EAR impose limits on further disclosure or must be in the form of an agreement in which the recipient agrees to limits on further disclosure. Any such agreement must impose limits that are equivalent to or more restrictive than all limits on further disclosure that are imposed by the EAR. The notification must be in writing and a copy of it must be retained by the party making the release and the recipient of the release. The notification may be in a separate document or included in a document such as a contract or a nondisclosure agreement. If the document has an expiration date, it must provide that the restrictions on disclosure do not expire.
(e)
Limitation on subsequent exports, reexports or in country transfers.
If a commodity has been exported, reexported or transferred in-country pursuant to this section, it may not be subsequently exported, reexported or transferred in-country pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of License Exception APR (§ 740.16(a) or (b) of the EAR). Paragraphs (a) and (b) of License Exception APR do not authorize exports of software or technology.
(f)
Applicability of Wassenaar Arrangement reporting requirements.
See § 743.1 of the EAR for special reporting requirements that apply to some exports made pursuant to this section.

License Exception STA eligibility requests for 9x515 and “600 series” items
—(1)
Applicability.
Any person may request License Exception STA eligibility for end items described in ECCN 0A606.a, ECCN 8A609.a, ECCNs 8A620.a or .b, “spacecraft” in ECCNs 9A515.a.1, .a.2, .a.3, or .a.4, “sub-orbital craft,” or
items in 9A515.g, 9A610.a, or technology ECCNs 9E515.b, .d, .e, or .f.
(2)
Required information and manner of requests.
Requests for License Exception STA eligibility must be made via the BIS Simplified Network Application Process-Redesign(SNAP-R) system unless BIS authorizes submission via the paper BIS-748-P Multipurpose Application form. For situations in which BIS 748-P submissions may be authorized, see § 748.1(d)(1). For required information specific to License Exception STA eligibility requests, see supplement no. 1 to part 748, Blocks 5 and 6 and supplement no. 2 to part 748, paragraph (w). In SNAP-R the work type for these applications is “Export.”
(3)
Timeline for USG review.
The Departments of Commerce, Defense and State will review License Exception STA eligibility requests in accordance with the timelines set forth in Executive Order 12981 and § 750.4. If the License Exception STA request is approved, the process outlined in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section is followed.
(4)
Review criteria.
The Departments of Commerce, Defense and State will determine whether the “end item” is eligible for this license exception based on an assessment of whether it provides a critical military or intelligence advantage to the United States or is otherwise available in countries that are not regime partners or close allies. If the “end item” does not provide a critical military or intelligence advantage to the United States or is otherwise available in countries that are not regime partners or close allies, the Departments will determine that License Exception STA is available unless an overarching foreign policy rationale for restricting STA availability can be articulated. Consensus among the Departments is required in order for an “end item” to be eligible for License Exception STA. Such determinations are made by the departments' representatives to the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP), or their designees.
(5)
Disposition of License Exception STA eligibility requests
—(i)
Approvals.
If the request for STA eligibility is approved, the applicant will receive notification from BIS authorizing the use of the additional License Exception STA for the specific end items requested. This will be in the form of a notice generated by SNAP-R to the applicant. Applicants who receive an approval notification may share it with companies affiliated with them, such as a branch or distributor, and may also take steps to make it public (e.g., on their Web site) if the applicants so wish. In addition, BIS will add a description of the approved end item in the relevant ECCN and in an online table posted on the BIS Web site, which removes the restriction on the use of License Exception STA for the end item identified in the approved request. BIS will publish, as needed, a final rule adding this license exception eligibility to the EAR for that ECCN entry or end item.
(ii)
Denials.
If the STA eligibility request is not approved, the applicant will receive written notification from BIS. This will be in the form of a notice generated by SNAP-R to the applicant. Applicants may re-submit STA eligibility requests at any time.

For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), a 'U.S. person' is: an individual who is a citizen of the United States, an individual who is “lawfully admitted for permanent residence” in the United States as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20) or an individual who is a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3). 'U.S. person' also means any juridical person organized under the laws of the United States, or any jurisdiction within the United States (
e.g.,
corporation, business association, partnership, society, trust, or any other entity, organization or group that is authorized to do business in the United States). If the employee who will use the technology is not a 'U.S. person,' the release of that technology to that employee must either not require a license or be authorized by a license or a license exception other than this section before it may be exported or reexported to that employee under this paragraph. The exporter or reexporter and the recipient of the technology must take security precautions to protect against unauthorized release of the technology while the technology is being shipped or transmitted and used overseas. Examples of security precautions to help prevent unauthorized access include the following:
(i) Use of secure connections, such as Virtual Private Network connections, when accessing IT networks for email
and other business activities that involve the transmission and use of the technology authorized under this license exception;
(ii) Use of password systems on electronic devices that will store the technology authorized under this license exception; and
(iii) Use of personal firewalls on electronic devices that will store the technology authorized under this license exception.
(3)
Kits of replacement “parts” or “components.”
Kits consisting of replacement “parts” or “components” for items that have been exported or reexported to Cuba under a license or license exception, or foreign-origin items that are not subject to the EAR that are owned and used exclusively by private sector entities in Cuba, may be exported or reexported under this paragraph (f)(3) provided:
(i) The kits remain under “effective control” of the exporter or reexporter or its employees; and
(ii) All parts and components in the kit are returned, except that one-for-one replacements may be made in accordance with the requirements of License Exception Servicing and Replacement of Parts and Equipment (RPL) and the defective parts and components returned (see Parts, Components, Accessories and Attachments in § 740.10(a)).
(4)
Exhibition and demonstration.
Commodities or software for exhibition or demonstration at trade shows, or to any entity that would be eligible to receive the commodities or software under paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, may be exported or reexported under this paragraph (f). The commodities or software must remain under the “effective control” of the exporter or reexporter or its private sector agent, may not be exhibited or demonstrated at any one location for more than 30 days and may not be used for more than the minimum extent required for effective exhibition or demonstration.
(5)
Containers.
Containers that would require a license for export or reexport to Cuba but that are necessary for shipment of commodities being exported to Cuba under a license or license exception may be exported or reexported to Cuba. However, this paragraph (f) does not authorize the export of the container's contents, which, if not exempt from licensing, must be separately authorized for export or reexport under either a license or a license exception.

§ 742.1
Introduction.
In this part, references to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C.
(a)
Scope.
This part describes all the reasons for control reflected in the Country Chart in supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR. In addition, it includes licensing requirements and licensing policies for the following items that are not reflected on the Country Chart: specially designed implements of torture, high performance computers, and communications intercepting devices. In addition to describing the reasons for control and licensing requirements and policies, this part describes any applicable contract sanctity provisions that may apply to specific controls and includes a description of any multilateral regime under which specific controls are maintained.
(b)
Reasons for control listed on the CCL not covered by this part.
This part describes the license requirements and the licensing policies for all the “Reasons for Control” that are listed on the Commerce Control List (CCL) except “Short Supply” and “U.N. Sanctions,” which do not appear on the Country Chart.
(1)
Short supply.
ECCNs containing items subject to short supply controls (“SS”) refer the exporter to part 754 of the EAR. These ECCNs are: 0A980 (Horses for export by sea); 1C980 (certain inorganic chemicals); 1C982 (certain other petroleum products); 1C983 (certain natural gas liquids and other
natural gas derivatives); 1C984 (certain manufactured gas and synthetic natural gas (except when commingled with natural gas and thus subject to export authorization from the Department of Energy); and 1C988 (Unprocessed western red cedar (thuja plicata) logs and timber, and rough, dressed and worked lumber containing wane).
(2)
U.N. Sanctions.
The United Nations imposes sanctions, short of complete embargoes, against certain countries which may result in controls that supplement those otherwise maintained under the EAR for that particular country. This part does not address license requirements and licensing policies for controls implementing U.N. sanctions. CCL entries containing items subject to U.N. sanctions will refer the exporter to part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls, for any supplemental controls that may apply to exports and reexports involving these countries.
(c)
Exports and reexports involving Cuba and Iran.
This part does not cover license requirements and licensing policies that apply to exports and reexports to embargoed destinations (Cuba and Iran). These comprehensive embargoes cover a broader range of items than those reflected in the CCL. If you are exporting or reexporting to any of these destinations, you should first review part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls.
(d)
Anti-terrorism Controls on Iran, North Korea, and Syria.
Commerce maintains anti-terrorism controls on Iran, North Korea, and Syria under section 6(a) of the Export Administration Act. Items controlled under section 6(a) to Iran, Syria, and North Korea are described in §§ 742.8, 742.9, 742.10, and 742.19, respectively, and in Supplement No. 2 to part 742. Commerce also maintains controls under section 6(j) of the EAA to Iran, North Korea, and Syria. Items controlled to these countries under EAA section 6(j) are also described in Supplement 2 to part 742. The Secretaries of Commerce and State are required to notify appropriate Committees of the Congress 30 days before issuing a license for an item controlled under section 6(j) to North Korea, Iran, or Syria. If you are exporting or reexporting to Iran, North Korea, or Syria, you should review part 746 of the EAR, Embargoes and Other Special Controls.
(e)
End-user and end-use based controls.
This part does not cover prohibitions and licensing requirements for exports of items not included on the CCL that are subject to end-use and end-user controls: certain nuclear end-uses; certain missile end-uses; certain chemical and biological weapons end-uses; certain naval nuclear propulsion end-uses; certain activities of U.S. persons; and certain exports to and for the use of certain foreign vessels and aircraft. Licensing requirements and policies for these exports are contained in part 744 of the EAR.
(f)
Overlapping license policies.
Many items on the CCL are subject to more than one type of control (e.g., national security (NS), missile technology (MT), nuclear nonproliferation (NP), regional stability (RS)). In addition, applications for all items on the CCL, other than those controlled for short supply reasons, may be reviewed for missile technology (see § 742.5(b)(3) of this part), nuclear nonproliferation (see § 742.3(b)(2) of this part), or chemical and biological weapons (see § 742.2(b)(3) of this part), if the end-use or end-user may be involved in certain proliferation activities. Finally, many multilaterally controlled items are reviewed for anti-terrorism reasons if they are destined for a terrorism-supporting country (see paragraph (d) of this section). Your application for a license will be reviewed under all applicable licensing policies. A license will be issued only if an application can be approved under all applicable licensing policies.

(b)
Licensing policy.
(1) License applications for the items described in paragraph (a) of this section will be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport would make a material contribution to the design, development, production, stockpiling or use of chemical or biological weapons. When an export or reexport is deemed to make such a material contribution, the license will be denied. When an export or reexport is intended to be used in a chemical weapons or biological weapons program, or for chemical or biological weapons terrorism purposes, it is deemed to make a material contribution. The factors listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are among those that will be considered to determine what action should be taken on license applications for these items.
(2) The following factors are among those that will be considered to determine what action should be taken on license applications for the items described in paragraph (a) of this section:
(i) The specific nature of the end-use, including the appropriateness of the stated end-use;
(ii) The significance of the export and reexport in terms of its potential contribution to the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons;
(iii) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country, including the importing country's chemical and biological capabilities and objectives;
(iv) The extent and effectiveness of the export control system in the importing country and in any intermediary country through which the items being exported or reexported will transit or be transshipped en route to the importing country;
(v) The risk that the items will be diverted for use in a chemical weapons or biological weapons program, or for chemical weapons or biological weapons terrorism purposes;
(vi) The reliability of the parties to the transaction, including whether:
(A) An export or reexport license application involving any such parties has previously been denied;
(B) Any such parties have been engaged in clandestine or illegal procurement activities;
(C) The end-user is capable of securely handling and storing the items to be exported or reexported;
(vii) Relevant information about proliferation and terrorism activities, including activities involving the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons by any parties to the transaction;
(viii) The types of assurances or guarantees against the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons that are given in a particular case, including any relevant assurances provided by the importing country or the end-user;
(ix) The applicability of other multilateral export control or nonproliferation agreements (e.g., the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention) to the transaction; and
(x) The existence of a pre-existing contract.
(3) BIS will review license applications in accordance with the licensing policy described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for items not described in paragraph (a) of this section that:
(i) Require a license for reasons other than short supply;
and
(ii) Could be destined for the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons, or for a facility engaged in such activities.
(4) License applications for items described in paragraph (a) of this section, when destined for the People's Republic of China will be reviewed in accordance with the licensing policies in both paragraph (b) of this section and § 742.4(b)(7). When such items are destined to Russia or Belarus, license applications will be reviewed under a policy of denial. However, exports and reexports of items to Russia or Belarus in support of U.S.-Russia or U.S.-Belarus civil space cooperation activities-will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, as well as certain other certain specified activities specified in § 746.8 of the EAR. See § 746.8(b).
(c)
Contract sanctity.
Contract sanctity dates are set forth in supplement no. 1 to part 742. Applicants who wish that a preexisting contract be considered in reviewing their license applications must submit documentation sufficient to establish the existence of such a contract.
(d)
Australia Group.
The Australia Group, a multilateral body that works to halt the spread of chemical and biological weapons, has developed common control lists of items specifically related to chemical and biological weapons. Australia Group members are listed in Country Group A:3 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). Controls on items listed in paragraph (a) of this section are consistent with lists agreed to in the Australia Group.
(e)
License application requirements and instructions.
Unique application and submission requirements for chemicals, medicinals, and pharmaceuticals are described in paragraph (a) of supplement no. 2 to part 748 of the EAR.

§ 742.3
Nuclear nonproliferation.
(a)
License requirements.
Section 309(c) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 requires BIS to identify items subject to the EAR that could be of significance for nuclear explosive purposes if used for activities other than those authorized at the time of export or reexport. ECCNs on the CCL that include the symbol “NP 1” or “NP 2” in the “Country Chart” column of the “License Requirements” section identify items that could be of significance for nuclear explosive purposes and are therefore subject to licensing requirements under this part and under section 309(c) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. These items are referred to as “The Nuclear Referral List” and are subject to the following licensing requirements:
(1) If NP Column 1 of the Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is required to all destinations, except those Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) member countries that are listed under Country Group A:4 in supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR.
(2) If NP Column 2 of the Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in the applicable
ECCN, a license is required when the item is destined to a Country Group D:2 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) country, China (the People's Republic of), or Macau.
(3) Other nuclear-related license requirements are described in §§ 744.2 and 744.5 of the EAR.
(b)
Licensing policy.
(1) To implement the controls in paragraph (a) of this section, the following factors are among those used to determine what action should be taken on individual applications:
(i) Whether the items to be transferred are appropriate for the stated end-use and whether that stated end-use is appropriate for the end-user;
(ii) The significance for nuclear purposes of the particular item;
(iii) Whether the items to be exported or reexported are to be used in research on, or for the development, design, manufacture, construction, operation, or maintenance of, any reprocessing or enrichment facility;
(iv) The types of assurances or guarantees given against use for nuclear explosive purposes or proliferation in the particular case;
(v) Whether any party to the transaction has been engaged in clandestine or illegal procurement activities;
(vi) Whether an application for a license to export or reexport to the end-user has previously been denied, or whether the end-user has previously diverted items received under a general license, a License Exception, or a validated license to unauthorized activities;
(vii) Whether the export or reexport would present an unacceptable risk of diversion to a nuclear explosive activity or unsafeguarded nuclear fuel-cycle activity described in § 744.2(a) of the EAR;
(viii) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country, based on consideration of the following factors:
(A) Whether the importing country is a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Treaty of Tlatelolco) or to a similar international legally-binding nuclear nonproliferation agreement;
(B) Whether the importing country has all of its nuclear activities, facilities, or installations that are operational, being designed, or under construction under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards or equivalent full scope safeguards;
(C) Whether there is an agreement for cooperation in the civil uses of atomic energy between the U.S. and the importing country;
(D) Whether the actions, statements, and policies of the government of the importing country are in support of nuclear nonproliferation and whether that government is in compliance with its international obligations in the field of non-proliferation;
(E) The degree to which the government of the importing country cooperates in non-proliferation policy generally (e.g., willingness to consult on international nonproliferation issues); and
(F) Information on the importing country's nuclear intentions and activities; and
(ix) Whether the recipient state has sufficient national export controls (as described in paragraph 3 of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004)) to prevent an unacceptable risk of retransfer or diversion to a nuclear explosive activity or unsafeguarded nuclear fuel-cycle activity described in § 744.2(a) of the EAR.
(2) In addition, BIS will review license applications in accordance with the licensing policy described in paragraph (b) of this section for items
not
on the Nuclear Referral List that:
(i) Require a license on the CCL for reasons other than “short supply;” and
(ii) Are intended for a nuclear related end-use or end-user.
(3) For the People's Republic of China, the general licensing policy for applications for those items that would make a direct and significant contribution to nuclear weapons and their delivery systems is extended review or denial.
(4) License applications for items described in paragraph (a) of this section, when destined for the People's Republic of China will be reviewed in accordance with the licensing policies in both paragraph (b) of this section and
§ 742.4(b)(7). When such items are destined to Russia or Belarus, license applications will be reviewed under a policy of denial. However, exports and reexports of items to Russia or Belarus in support of U.S.-Russia or U.S.-Belarus civil space cooperation activities or in support of Russian manufactured nuclear power plants in Russia or other destinations will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. See § 746.8(b) of the EAR.
(c)
Contract sanctity.
Contract sanctity provisions are not available for license applications reviewed under this section.
(d)
Nuclear Suppliers Group.
Most items on the Nuclear Referral List that require a license under NP Column No. 1 on the Country Chart (see supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) are contained in the Annex to the “Guidelines for Transfers of Nuclear-Related Dual-Use Equipment, Material, and Related Technology” (the Annex), as published by the International Atomic Energy Agency in INFCIRC/254/Revision 1/Part 2. The adherents to INFCIRC/254/Revision 1/Part 2, which includes the Nuclear Suppliers Guidelines, have agreed to establish export licensing procedures for the transfer of items identified in the Annex. Items that are listed as requiring a license under NP Column No. 2 on the Country Chart (see supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) are not included in the Annex and are controlled only by the United States.
[61 FR 12786, Mar. 25, 1996, as amended at 70 FR 51252, Aug. 30, 2005; 72 FR 33656, June 19, 2007; 76 FR 4231, Jan. 25, 2011; 79 FR 46324, Aug. 7, 2014; 81 FR 94967, Dec. 27, 2016; 85 FR 10277, Feb. 24, 2020; 87 FR 12238, Mar. 3, 2022; 87 FR 13058, Mar. 8, 2022; 88 FR 54877, Aug. 14, 2023]
§ 742.4
National security.
(a)
License requirements.
It is the policy of the United States to restrict the export and reexport of items that would make a significant contribution to the military potential of any other destination or combination of destinations that would prove detrimental to the national security (NS) of the United States. Generally, items on the Commerce Control List in supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR that have a reason for control of NS are those that are also listed on the Wassenaar Arrangement's “List of Dual-use Goods and Technologies,” as well as some items listed on the Wassenaar Arrangement's “Munitions List.” “600 series” items and 9x515 items are also controlled for NS reasons.

(b)
Licensing policy.
Each application is reviewed in light of prevailing policies with full consideration of all aspects of the proposed transaction. When the license application meets the criteria of more than one licensing policy, then the most restrictive licensing policy will be applied. The review generally includes: an analysis of the kinds and quantities of items to be shipped; their military or civilian uses; the unrestricted availability abroad of the same or comparable items; the country of destination; the ultimate end users in the country of destination; and the intended end use.
(1)(i)
Country Group D:1.
The policy for national security-controlled items exported or reexported to any destination except a destination specified in Country Group D:1 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) is to approve applications unless there is a significant risk that the items will be diverted to a destination specified in Country Group D:1. Except for those countries described in paragraphs (b)(5) through (7) and (9) of this section, the general policy for exports and reexports of items to Country Group D:1 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) is to approve applications when BIS determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the items are for civilian use or would otherwise not make a significant contribution to the military potential of the country of destination that would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States.
(ii)
9x515 and “600 series” items.
When destined to a country listed in Country Group D:5 in supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR, however, items classified under 9x515 or “600 series” ECCNs will be reviewed consistent with United States arms embargo policies in 22 CFR 126.1 (International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)). When destined to the People's Republic of China or a country listed in Country Group E:1 in supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR, items classified under any 9x515 ECCN will be subject to a policy of denial.
(2) License applications for items specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section will be reviewed consistent with license review policies in § 744.23(d) of the EAR. However, if § 744.23 does not apply, applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis if no license would be required under part 744 of the EAR. applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis if no license would be required under part 744 of the EAR.
(3) [Reserved]
(4) Although each proposed transaction is considered individually, items described in Advisory Notes on the Commerce Control List are more likely to be approved than others.
(5) In recognition of efforts made to adopt safeguard measures for exports and reexports, Kazakhstan and Mongolia are accorded enhanced favorable consideration licensing treatment.
(6) The general policy for Laos is to approve license applications when BIS determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the items are for an authorized use in Laos and are not likely to be diverted to another country or use contrary to the national security or foreign policy controls of the United States.
(7)(i) For Burma, Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (PRC), Nicaragua, and Venezuela, all applications will be reviewed to determine the risk of diversion to a military end user or military enduse. There is a general policy of approval for license applications to export, reexport, or transfer items determined to be for civil end users for civil end uses. There is a presumption of denial for license applications to export reexport, or transfer items that would make a material contribution to the “development,” “production,” maintenance, repair, or operation of weapons systems, subsystems, and assemblies, such as, but not limited to, those described in supplement no. 7 to this part, of Burma, Cambodia, China, or Venezuela.
(ii) The following factors are among those that will be considered in reviewing license applications described in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section:
(A) The appropriateness of the export, reexport, or transfer for the stated end use;
(B) The significance of the item for the weapon systems capabilities of the importing country;
(C) Whether any party is a 'military end user' as defined in § 744.21(g) of the EAR;
(D) The reliability of the parties to the transaction, including whether:
(
1
) An export or reexport license application has previously been denied;
(
2
) Any parties are or have been engaged in unlawful procurement or diversion activities;
(
3
) The parties are capable of securely handling and storing the items; and
(
4
) End-use checks have been and may be conducted by BIS or another U.S. Government agency on parties to the transaction;
(E) The involvement of any party to the transaction in military activities, including activities involving the “development,” “production,” maintenance, repair, or operation of weapons systems, subsystems, and assemblies;
(F) Government strategies and policies that support the diversion of exports from their stated civil end use and redirection towards military end use; and
(G) The scope and effectiveness of the export control system in the importing country.
(iii) The review will also include an assessment of the impact of a proposed export of an item on the United States defense industrial base and the denial of an application for a license that would have a significant negative impact, as defined in section 1756(d)(3) of the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. 4815(d)(3)), on such defense industrial base.
(8) For India, there is a general policy of approval for license applications to export, reexport, or transfer items, including “600 series” items, for civil or military end uses in India, for ultimate end use by the Government of India, for reexport to countries in Country Group A:5, or for return to the United States, so long as such items are not for use in nuclear, “missile,” or chemical or biological weapons activities.
(9) For the Russian Federation and Belarus, all applications will be reviewed in accordance with the licensing policy set forth in § 746.8(b) of the EAR.
(10)
License review policy for items specified in paragraph (a)(5).
License applications to export or reexport items described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section to destinations specified in Country Group A:1, A:5, and A:6, see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR, will be reviewed with a presumption of approval. License applications to export or reexport items described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section to destinations specified in Country Groups D:1 or D:5 of supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR will be reviewed under a presumption of denial. License applications to export or reexport items described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section to any other destination will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, unless subject to a more restrictive NS policy in this section.
(c)
Contract sanctity.
Contract sanctity provisions are not available for license applications reviewed under this section, except for applications for items in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. For paragraph (a)(4), contract sanctity provisions are available for contracts signed before October 18, 2023.
(d)
License exceptions.
Certain license exceptions are available only for national security items, such as License Exceptions GBS (see § 740.4 of the EAR) and TSR (see § 740.6 of the EAR), but other license exceptions may also be available for national security items, such as License Exception STA (see § 740.20 of the EAR) or license exceptions based on the facts of the transaction, such as License Exceptions TMP (see § 740.9 of the EAR) or GOV (see § 740.11 of the EAR).

§ 742.5
Missile technology.
(a)
License requirements.
(1) In support of U.S. foreign policy to limit the proliferation of missiles, a license is required to export and reexport items related to the design, development, production, or use of missiles. These items are identified in ECCNs on the CCL as MT Column No. 1 in the Country Chart
column of the “License Requirements” section. Licenses for these items are required to all destinations, except Australia, Canada, or the United Kingdom, as indicated by MT Column 1 of the Country Chart (see supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).
(2) The term “missiles” is defined as rocket systems (including ballistic missiles, space launch vehicles, and sounding rockets) and unmanned aerial vehicle systems (including cruise missiles, target drones, and reconnaissance drones) capable of delivering at least 500 kilograms (kg) payload to a range of at least 300 kilometers (km). See § 746.3 of the EAR for definition of a “ballistic missile” to be exported or reexported to Iraq.
(b)
Licensing policy.
(1) Applications to export and reexport items identified in ECCNs on the CCL as MT Column No. 1 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section will be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport would make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles. Applications for exports and reexports of such items contained in Category 7A or described by ECCN 9A101 on the CCL will be considered favorably if such exports or reexports are destined to a manned aircraft, satellite, land vehicle, or marine vessel, in quantities appropriate for replacement “parts” and “components” for such applications. When an export or reexport is deemed to make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles, the license will be denied.

# Note 1 to paragraph (
b

# )(1):
Applications to export and reexport an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that has a range and payload capability equal to or greater than 300 km/500 kg but a maximum true airspeed of less than 800 km/hr, and items controlled for Missile Technology reasons for the design, development, production, or use of UAV systems that meet these parameters, will not be subject to a policy of denial but will instead be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport will be used in support of WMD activities or military activities contrary to U.S. national security, or whether there is a risk of diversion to support such activities.
(2) The following factors are among those that will be considered in reviewing individual applications.
(i) The specific nature of the end-use;
(ii) The significance of the export and reexport in terms of its contribution to the design, development, production, or use of missiles;
(iii) The capabilities and objectives of the missile and space programs of the recipient country;
(iv) The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country;
(v) The types of assurances or guarantees against design, development, production, or use of missiles that are given in a particular case; and
(vi) The existence of a preexisting contract.
(3)(i) Consistent with the MTCR Annex
General Minimum Software Note,
MTCR Annex
General Technology Note
and § 750.7(c)(1)(x) of the EAR, the approval of any item controlled for MT reasons on a BIS license also authorizes the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to the same ultimate consignee(s) and end user(s) specified on the license of the minimum “software,” excluding source code, controlled for MT reasons that is required for the installation, operation, maintenance or repair of the item and the “technology” required for the installation, operation, maintenance, or repair of the item in order to ensure the item's safe operation as originally intended. The approval of any item controlled for MT reasons on a BIS license also authorizes the later export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of “software” controlled for MT reasons intended to correct defects (bug fixes) in a previously legally exported item under a BIS license to the same ultimate consignee(s) and end user(s) specified on the license, provided that the capability and/or performance of the item are not otherwise enhanced. This MT licensing policy is implemented concurrent with § 750.7(c)(1)(x) because it applies to all MT licenses, except when a condition is placed on the license which excludes the use of § 750.7(c)(1)(x), as described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
(ii) Applicants are not required to identify or provide any support documentation for such minimum “software” or “technology” on a license application for MT controlled items because such minimum “software” or
“technology” is authorized within the scope of the license, consistent with § 750.7(c)(1)(x). Applicants will be informed when such minimum “software” and/or “technology” in § 750.7(c)(1)(x) is excluded from the license by a BIS condition on the license, which will state the following: “
This license does not authorize the export, reexport or transfer (in-country) of the minimum “software” and/or “technology” specified in paragraph (c)(1)(x) of § 750.7 (See paragraph (b)(3) of § 742.5).”

# Note to paragraph (
b

# )(3):
License Exception TSU under § 740.13 of the EAR is available for the ECCNs controlled for MT reasons specified in paragraph (a)(5) in § 740.2, provided the software or technology is for an end use specified in that paragraph and meets the requirements of License Exception TSU. (See §§ 740.2(a)(5) and 740.13). The licensing policy in paragraph (b)(3) is only available for licensed exports (or reexports, or transfers (in-country)).
(4)
Controls on other items.
BIS will review license applications, in accordance with the licensing policy described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for items not described in paragraph (a) of this section that:
(i) Require a validated license for reasons other than short supply; and
(ii) Could be destined for the design, development, production, or use of missiles, or for a facility engaged in such activities.
(5) License applications for items described in paragraph (a) of this section, when destined for the People's Republic of China, will be reviewed in accordance with the licensing policies in both paragraph (b) of this section and § 742.4(b)(7). When such items are destined to Russia or Belarus, license applications will be reviewed under a policy of denial. However, exports and reexports of items to Russia or Belarus in support of U.S.-Russia or U.S.-Belarus civil space cooperation activities-will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. See § 746.8(b) of the EAR.
(c)
Contract sanctity.
The following contract sanctity dates have been established:
(1) License applications for batch mixers specified in ECCN 1B117 involving contracts that were entered into prior to January 19, 1990, will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
(2) License applications subject to ECCN 1B115.b or .c that involve a contract entered into prior to March 7, 1991, will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
(3) Applicants who wish that a pre-existing contract be considered in reviewing their license applications must submit documentation sufficient to establish the existence of a contract.

This paragraph alerts exporters, reexporters and transferors to the procedures that apply to items classified under the 0Y521 ECCNs.
(ii)
0Y521 Items.
Items subject to the EAR that are not listed elsewhere in the CCL, but which the Department of Commerce, with the concurrence of the Departments of Defense and State, has determined should be controlled for export because the items provide at least a significant military or intelligence advantage to the United States or for foreign policy reasons are classified under ECCNs 0A521, 0B521, 0C521, 0D521 and 0E521. These items are typically emerging technologies (including emerging commodities, software and technology) that are not yet included in the CCL, so such items are listed on the CCL in 0Y521 ECCNs while the U.S. Government determines whether classification under a revised or new ECCN, or an EAR 99 designation, is appropriate. The list of items classified under a 0Y521 ECCN is limited to those listed in supplement no. 5 to part 774.
(iii)
Requirement to be classified under another ECCN within one calendar year of classification under ECCN 0Y521.
Items classified under an ECCN 0Y521 entry must be re-classified under another ECCN within one calendar year from the date they are listed in supplement no. 5 to part 774 of the EAR. If such re-classification does not occur within that period, classification under an ECCN 0Y521 entry expires, and such items are designated as EAR99 items unless either the CCL is amended to impose a control on such items under another ECCN or the ECCN 0Y521 classification is extended. BIS may extend an item's ECCN 0Y521 classification for two one-year periods, provided that the U.S. Government has submitted a proposal to the relevant multilateral regime(s) to obtain multilateral controls over the item. Further extension beyond three years may occur only if the Under Secretary for Industry and Security makes a determination that such extension is in the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. Any extension or re-extension of control of an ECCN 0Y521 item, including the determination by the Under Secretary, shall be published in the
Federal Register.

(b)
Licensing policy.
(1) Applications for items controlled under paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section will generally be considered favorably on a case-by-case basis, unless there is civil disorder in the country or region or unless there is a risk that the items will be used to violate or abuse human rights. The judicious use of export controls is intended to deter human rights violations and abuses, distance the United States from such violations and abuses, and avoid contributing to civil disorder in a country or region.
(2) BIS will review license applications in accordance with the licensing policy in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for items that are not controlled under this section but that require a license pursuant to another section for any reason other than short supply and could be used by the recipient Government or other end user specifically to violate or abuse human rights.
(3) Applications for items controlled under paragraph (a)(5) of this section will be reviewed under the following license review policies:
(i) Applications destined for government end users will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether there is a risk of diversion or misuse of the items in a manner that would adversely impact U.S. national security or foreign policy.
(ii) Those applications destined for non-government end users will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, unless one of the following apply, in which case they will be reviewed under a presumption of denial:
(A) The destination is identified in supplement no. 3 to this part; or
(B) There is a substantial risk that the items will be diverted or misused in a manner that would adversely impact U.S. national security or foreign policy.

# Note 1 to paragraph (
b

# )(3):
In reviewing applications under this paragraph, BIS will consider the following risks in the destination country or region: firearms trafficking or diversion, terrorism, corruption, human rights concerns and political violence, state fragility, organized crime or gang-related activity, and drug trafficking. BIS will also consider prior instances of diversion or misuse; the capabilities, potential uses, and lethality of the item; the nature of the end user; and other factors as appropriate.
(c)
Contract sanctity.
Contract sanctity date: August 22, 2000. Contract sanctity applies only to items controlled under ECCNs 0A982, 0A503, and 0E982 destined for countries not listed
in CC Column 1 of the Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).
(d)
U.S. controls.
In maintaining its controls on crime control and detection items, the United States considers international norms regarding human rights and the practices of other countries that control exports to promote the observance of human rights. However, these controls are not based on the decisions of any multinational export control regime and may differ from controls imposed by other countries.
[89 FR 34705, Apr. 30, 2024]
§ 742.8
Anti-terrorism: Iran.
(a)
License requirements.
(1) A license is required for anti-terrorism purposes to export or reexport to Iran any item for which AT column 1 or AT column 2 is indicated in the Country Chart column of the applicable ECCN or any item described in ECCNs 1C350, 1C355, 1C395, 2A994, 2D994 and 2E994. See paragraph (a)(5) of this section for controls maintained by the Department of the Treasury. See § 746.7 of the EAR for additional EAR license requirements that apply to Iran.
(2) [Reserved]
(3) The Secretary of State has designated Iran as a country whose Government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.
(4) In support of U.S. foreign policy applicable to terrorism-supporting countries, the EAR imposes anti-terrorism license requirements on exports and reexports to Iran pursuant to sections 6(j) and 6(a) of the Export Administration Act.
(i)
Section 6(j) anti-terrorism controls.
Section 6(j) requirements apply to all exports and reexports destined to the police, military or other sensitive end-users of items listed on the Commerce Control List (supp. no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) for which any listed reason for control in the applicable ECCN is NS (national security), CB (chemical or biological weapons proliferation), MT (missile proliferation), NP (nuclear weapons proliferation) or an Export Control Classification Number ending in “18” (military related items). BIS may not issue a license for a transaction subject to section 6(j) controls until 30 days after the notification described in Section 6(j)(2) of the Export Administration Act is delivered to the committees of Congress specified in that section. License applications for all other items controlled under section 6(a) are also reviewed to determine whether section 6(j) applies.
(ii)
Section 6(a) anti-terrorism controls.
Section 6(a) requirements apply to all exports and reexports regardless of the end user of items described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(5) Exports and certain reexports to Iran are subject to a comprehensive embargo administered by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). If you wish to export or reexport to Iran, the Government of Iran or any entity owned or controlled by that Government, you should review part 746 of the EAR and consult with OFAC. Please note that authorization from OFAC constitutes authorization under the EAR and no separate license or authorization from BIS is required.
(b)
Licensing policy.
(1) The Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of October 23, 1992, requires BIS to deny licenses for items controlled to Iran for national security (section 5 of the 1979 EAA) or foreign policy reasons (section 6 of the 1979 EAA), absent contract sanctity or a Presidential waiver. License applications for which contract sanctity is established may be considered under policies in effect prior to the enactment of that Act. Otherwise, licenses for such items to Iran are subject to a general policy of denial.
(2) License applications for items controlled under section 6(a) of the EAA will also be reviewed to determine whether requirements of section 6(j) apply. Whenever the Secretary of State determines that an export or reexport could make a significant contribution to the military potential of Iran, including its military logistics capability, or could enhance Iran's ability to support acts of international terrorism, the Secretaries of State and Commerce will notify the Congress 30 days prior to the issuance of a license.
(c)
Contract Sanctity.
Section 6(f) of the Export Administration Act requires that a report be delivered to
Congress before foreign policy based export controls are imposed, expanded or extended. Consistent with section 6(p) of the Export Administration Act, certain exports or reexports in fulfillment of contracts entered into before such delivery of the report applicable to a particular license requirement or licensing policy may be subject to the license requirements and licensing policy that were in force before the report was delivered. License applicants who wish to have their application considered under such pre-existing requirements or policy must include evidence of the pre-existing contract with their license applications.
(d)
U.S. controls.
Although the United States seeks cooperation from like-minded countries in maintaining anti-terrorism controls, at this time these controls are maintained only by the United States.

§ 742.9
Anti-terrorism: Syria.
(a)
License requirements.
(1) If AT Column 1 of the Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is required for export and reexport to Syria for anti-terrorism purposes.
(2) The Secretary of State has designated Syria as a country whose government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.
(3) In support of U.S. foreign policy against terrorism, BIS maintains two types of anti-terrorism controls on the export and reexport to Syria of items described in supplement no. 2 to part 742.
(i) Items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of supplement no. 2 to part 742, if destined to military, police, intelligence or other end-users in Syria, are controlled under section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act, as amended (EAA).
(ii) Items listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of supplement no. 2 to part 742 destined to other end-users in Syria, as well as items to all end-users listed in (c)(6) through (c)(8), (c)(10) through (c)(14), (c)(16) through (c)(19), and (c)(22) through (c)(44) of supplement no. 2 to part 742, are controlled to Syria under section 6(a) of the EAA.
(b)
Licensing policy.
(1) Applications for export and reexport to all end-users in Syria of the following items will generally be denied:
(i) Items that are controlled for chemical and biological weapons proliferation reasons to any destination. These are items that contain CB Column 1, CB Column 2, or CB Column 3 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section of an ECCN on the CCL.
(ii) Military-related items controlled for national security reasons to any destination. These are items that contain NS Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section in an ECCN on the CCL and are controlled by equipment or material entries ending in the number “18.”
(iii) Items that are controlled for missile proliferation reasons to any destination. These are items that have an MT Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section of an ECCN on the CCL.
(iv) All aircraft (powered and unpowered), helicopters, engines, and related spare parts and components, except that parts and components intended to ensure the safety of civil aviation and the safe operation of commercial passenger aircraft will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, with a presumption of approval. These are items controlled to any destination for national security and missile technology reasons and items controlled to Syria for anti-terrorism purposes. Such items contain an NS Column 1, NS Column 2, MT Column 1, or AT Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section of an ECCN on the CCL. Note that, consistent with the general rule that applies to computing U.S. parts and components content incorporated into foreign made products, all aircraft-related items that require a license to Syria will be included as controlled U.S. content, except for ECCNs 6A998, 7A994, and 9A991.d, for purposes of such licensing requirements.
(v) Cryptographic, cryptoanalytic, and cryptologic items controlled to any destination for national security reasons. Such items contain an AT Column 1 and an NS Column 1 or NS Column 2 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section of an ECCN on the CCL.
(vi) Explosives detection equipment controlled under ECCN 2A983.
(vii) “Software” (ECCN 2D983) specially designed or modified for the “development”, “production” or “use” of explosives detection equipment controlled by 2A983.
(viii) “Technology” (ECCN 2E983) specially designed or modified for the “development”, “production” or “use” of explosives detection equipment controlled by 2A983.
(ix) Commercial charges and devices controlled under ECCN 1C992.
(x) Ammonium nitrate, including certain fertilizers containing ammonium nitrate, controlled under ECCN 1C997.
(xi) Technology for the production of Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) Schedule 2 and 3 chemicals controlled under ECCN 1E355.
(xii) Concealed object detection equipment controlled under ECCN 2A984.
(xiii) “Software” (ECCN 2D984) “required” for the “development”, “production” or “use” of concealed object detection equipment controlled by 2A984.
(xiv) “Technology” (ECCN 2E984) “required” for the “development”, “production” or “use” of concealed object detection equipment controlled by 2A984, or the “development” of “software” controlled by 2D984.
(2) Applications for export and reexport to Syria of all other items described in paragraph (a) of this section, and not described by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, will generally be denied if the export or reexport is destined to a military end-user or for military end-use. Applications for non-military end-users or for non-military end-uses will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), of this section, applications for Syria will be considered on a case-by-case basis if:
(i) The transaction involves the reexport to Syria of items where Syria was not the intended ultimate destination at the time of original export from the United States, provided that the exports from the U.S. occurred prior to the applicable contract sanctity date (or, where the contract sanctity date is December 16, 1986, prior to June 18, 1987).
(ii) The U.S. content of foreign-produced commodities is 20% or less by value; or
(iii) The commodities are medical items.

# Note to paragraph (
b

# ) of this section:
Applicants who wish any of the factors described in paragraph (b) of this section to be considered in reviewing their license applications must submit adequate documentation demonstrating the value of the U.S. content, the specifications and medical use of the equipment, or the date of export from the United States.
(4) License applications for items reviewed under 6(a) controls will also be reviewed to determine the applicability of 6(j) controls to the transaction. When it is determined that an export or reexport could make a significant contribution to the military potential of Syria, including its military logistics capability, or could enhance Syria's ability to support acts of international terrorism, the Secretaries of State and Commerce will notify the Congress 30 days prior to issuance of a license.
(c)
Contract sanctity.
Contract sanctity dates and related licensing policies for Syria are set forth in supplement no. 2 to part 742. Applicants who wish a pre-existing contract to be considered must submit sufficient documentation to establish the existence of a contract.
(d)
U.S. controls.
Although the United States seeks cooperation from like-minded countries in maintaining anti-terrorism controls, at this time these controls are maintained only by the United States.
(e) Section 746.9 (Syria) of the EAR sets forth the export and reexport controls for Syria. Section 746.9 supersedes
the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.

Specially designed implements of torture, including thumbscrews, thumbcuffs, fingercuffs, spiked batons, and parts and accessories, n.e.s.
(a)
License Requirements.
In support of U.S. foreign policy to promote the observance of human rights throughout the world, a license is required to export any commodity controlled by ECCN 0A983 to all destinations including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
(b)
Licensing policy.
Applications for such licenses will generally be denied to all destinations.
(c)
Contract sanctity.
The contract sanctity date is November 9, 1995. Contract sanctity will be a factor in considering only applications for export to the NATO countries, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.
(d)
U.S. controls.
In maintaining its controls on specially designed instruments of torture the United States considers international norms regarding human rights and the practices of other countries that control exports to promote the observance of human rights. However, these controls are not based on the decisions of any multinational export control regime and may differ from controls imposed by other countries.

§ 742.12
[Reserved]
§ 742.13
Communications intercepting devices; software and technology for communications intercepting devices.
(a)
License requirement.
(1) In support of U.S. foreign policy to prohibit the export of items that may be used for the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications, a license is required for all destinations, including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, for ECCNs having an “SL” under the “Reason for Control” paragraph. These items include any electronic, mechanical, or other device primarily useful for the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications (ECCNs 5A001.f.1 and 5A980); and for related “software” primarily useful for the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications (ECCN 5D001.c and 5D980.a); and “software” primarily useful for the “development”, “production”, or “use” of devices controlled under ECCNs 5A001.f.1 and 5A980 (ECCNs 5D001.a and 5D980.b); and for “technology” primarily useful for the “development”, “production”, or “use” of items controlled by ECCNs 5A001.f.1, 5D001.a (for 5A001.f.1), 5A980 and 5D980 (ECCNs 5E001.a and 5E980); and for “software” primarily useful to support such ECCN 5E001.a “development”, “production”, or “use” “technology” for 5A001.f.1 equipment and certain 5D001.a “software” (ECCN 5D001.b). These licensing requirements do not supersede the requirements contained in the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended (18 U.S.C. 2512). This license requirement is not reflected on the Commerce Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR).
(2) “Communications intercepting devices” are electronic, mechanical, or other devices that can be used for interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications if their design renders them primarily useful for surreptitious listening even though they may also have innocent uses. A device is not restricted merely because it is small or may be adapted to wiretapping or eavesdropping. Some examples of devices to which these restrictions apply are: the martini olive transmitter; the infinity transmitter; the spike mike; and the disguised microphone appearing as a wristwatch, cufflink, or cigarette pack; etc. The restrictions do not apply to devices such as the parabolic microphone or other directional microphones ordinarily used by broadcasters at sports events, since these devices
are not primarily useful for surreptitious listening.
(b)
Licensing policy.
(1) License applications, except for those applications for which a license is required for both SL and AT reasons, will generally be approved for exports or reexports requiring a license for SL reasons when the exporter or reexporter is:
(i) A provider of wire or electronic communication services or an officer, agent, or employee of, or person under contract with such a provider, in the normal course of the business of providing that wire or electronic communication service; or
(ii) An officer, agent, or employee of, or a person under contract with, the United States, one of the 50 States, or a political subdivision thereof, when engaged in the normal course of government activities.

# Note to paragraph (
b

# )(1):
For SL reasons, license applications will generally be denied to countries that are subject to controls for AT reasons.

# Note to paragraph (
b

# )(1)(
i

# ):
The normal course of the business of providing a wire or electronic communications service includes any activity which is a necessary incident to the rendition of the service or to the protection of the rights and property of the provider of that service.
(2) Other license applications will generally be denied for exports or reexports requiring a license for SL reasons.
(c)
Contract sanctity.
Contract sanctity provisions are not available for license applications involving exports and reexports of communications interception devices.
(d)
U.S. controls.
Controls on items classified under ECCNs 5A980, 5D980, and 5E980 are maintained by the United States government for foreign policy purposes.

§ 742.14
Significant items: hot section technology for the development, production or overhaul of commercial aircraft engines, components, and systems.
(a)
License requirement.
Licenses are required for all destinations, except Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, for ECCNs having an “SI” under the “Reason for Control” paragraph. These items include hot section technology for the development, production or overhaul of commercial aircraft engines controlled under ECCN 9E003.a.1 through a.6, a.8, .h, .i, and .l, and related controls.
(b)
Licensing policy.
Pursuant to section 6 of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, foreign policy controls apply to technology required for the development, production or overhaul of commercial aircraft engines controlled by ECCN 9E003a.1 through a.6, a.8, .h, .i, and .l, and related controls. These controls supplement the national security controls that apply to these items. Applications for export and reexport to all destinations will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport is consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The following factors are among those that will be considered to determine what action will be taken on license applications:
(1) The country of destination;
(2) The ultimate end-user(s);
(3) The technology involved;
(4) The specific nature of the end-use(s); and
(5) The types of assurance against unauthorized use or diversion that are given in a particular case.

§ 742.15
Encryption items.
Encryption items can be used to maintain the secrecy of information, and thereby may be used by persons abroad to harm U.S. national security, foreign policy and law enforcement interests. The United States has a critical interest in ensuring that important and sensitive information of the public and private sector is protected. Consistent with our international obligations as a member of the Wassenaar
Arrangement, the United States has a responsibility to maintain control over the export and reexport of encryption items. As the President indicated in Executive Order 13026 and in his Memorandum of November 15, 1996, exports and reexports of encryption software, like exports and reexports of encryption hardware, are controlled because of this functional capacity to encrypt information, and not because of any informational or theoretical value that such software may reflect, contain, or represent, or that its export or reexport may convey to others abroad. For this reason, export controls on encryption software are distinguished from controls on other software regulated under the EAR.
(a)
Licensing requirements and policy
—(1)
Licensing requirements.
A license is required to export or reexport encryption items (“EI”) classified under ECCN 5A002, 5A004, 5D002.a, .c.1 or .d (for equipment and “software” in ECCNs 5A002 or 5A004, 5D002.c.1); or 5E002 for “technology” for the “development,” “production,” or “use” of commodities or “software” controlled for EI reasons in ECCNs 5A002, 5A004 or 5D002, and “technology” classified under 5E002.b to all destinations, except Canada. Refer to part 740 of the EAR, for license exceptions that apply to certain encryption items, and to § 772.1 of the EAR for definitions of encryption items and terms. Most encryption items may be exported under the provisions of License Exception ENC set forth in § 740.17 of the EAR. Following classification or self-classification, items that meet the criteria of Note 3 to Category 5—Part 2 of the Commerce Control List (the “mass market” note), are classified under ECCN 5A992 or 5D992 and are no longer subject to this Section (see § 740.17 of the EAR). Before submitting a license application, please review License Exception ENC to determine whether this license exception is available for your item or transaction. For exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of encryption items that are not eligible for a license exception, you must submit an application to obtain authorization under a license or an Encryption Licensing Arrangement.
(2)
Licensing policy.
Applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by BIS, in conjunction with other agencies, to determine whether the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) is consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. Encryption Licensing Arrangements (ELAs) may be authorized for exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of unlimited quantities of encryption commodities and software described in § 740.17 (b)(2)(i)(A) that have been classified by BIS to “more sensitive government end users,” in all destinations, except countries listed in Country Groups E:1 or E:2 of supplement no. 1 to part 740. ELAs for “more sensitive government end users” may be authorized for encryption commodities and software described in § 740.17(b)(2)(ii) through (iv) under certain circumstances. ELAs are valid for four years and may require pre-shipment notification. Applicants seeking authorization for Encryption Licensing Arrangements must specify the sales territory on their license applications.
(b)
Publicly available encryption source code
—(1)
Scope and eligibility.
Subject to the notification requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, publicly available (see § 734.3(b)(3) of the EAR) encryption source code classified under ECCN 5D002 is not subject to the EAR. Such source code is publicly available even if it is subject to an express agreement for the payment of a licensing fee or royalty for commercial production or sale of any product developed using the source code.
(2)
Notification requirement for “non-standard cryptography.”
For publicly available encryption source code classified under ECCN 5D002 that provides or performs “non-standard cryptography” as defined in part 772 of the EAR, you must notify BIS and the ENC Encryption Request Coordinator via email of the internet location (
e.g.,
URL or internet address) of the source code or provide each of them a copy of the publicly available encryption source code. If you update or modify the source code, you must also provide additional copies to each of them each time the cryptographic functionality of the source code is updated or modified. In addition, if you posted the
source code on the internet, you must notify BIS and the ENC Encryption Request Coordinator each time the internet location is changed, but you are not required to notify them of updates or modifications made to the encryption source code at the previously notified location. In all instances, submit the notification or copy to
crypt@bis.doc.gov
and to
enc@nsa.gov.

§ 742.17
Exports of firearms to OAS member countries.
(a)
License requirements.
BIS maintains a licensing system for the export of firearms and related items to all OAS member countries. This action is based on the Organization of American States (OAS) Model Regulations for the Control of the International Movement of Firearms, their Parts and Components and Munitions (OAS Model Regulations) which were developed to assist OAS member countries to implement the Inter-American Convention Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and Other Related Materials (Firearms Convention).
2
Items subject to these controls are identified by “FC Column 1” in the “License Requirements” section of their Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) on the Commerce Control List (CCL). If “FC Column 1” of the Commerce Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated for a particular country, a license is required for export to that destination. Licenses will generally be issued on a Firearms Convention (FC) Import Certificate or equivalent official document, satisfactory to BIS, issued by the government of the importing OAS member country.
2
Status of Convention as of April 13, 1999 had not entered into force.
(b)
Licensing policy.
Applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis when supported by an FC Import Certificate or equivalent official document issued by the government of the importing country. However, there is a policy of denial for applications to export items linked to such activities as drug trafficking, terrorism, and transnational organized crime.
(c)
Contract sanctity.
Contract sanctity provisions are not available for license applications under this § 742.17.
(d)
OAS Model Regulations.
The OAS Model Regulations on which regulations are based are designed by OAS member countries to combat illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, ammunition, explosives, and other related materials in North and South America because of their links to such activities as drug trafficking, terrorism, and transnational organized crime.
(e)
OAS member countries to which firearms controls under this section apply.
The OAS member countries include: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela.
(f)
Items/Commodities.
Items requiring a license under this section are ECCNs 0A501 (except 0A501.y), 0A502, 0A504 (except 0A504.f), 0A505 (except 0A505.d), 0A506, 0A507, 0A508, and 0A509. (See supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR).
(g)
Validity period for licenses.
Although licenses generally will be valid for a period of four years, your ability to ship items that require an FC Import Certificate or equivalent official document under this section may be affected by the validity of the FC Import Certificate or equivalent official document (see § 748.12(d)(3) of the EAR).

§ 742.18
Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC or Convention).
States that are parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, also known as the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC or Convention), undertake never to develop, produce, acquire, stockpile, transfer, or use chemical weapons. As a State Party to the Convention, the United States is subjecting certain toxic chemicals and their precursors listed in Schedules within the Convention to trade restrictions. Trade restrictions include: a prohibition on the export of Schedule 1 chemicals to States not Party to the CWC; a prohibition on the reexport of Schedule 1 chemicals to all destinations (both States Parties to the CWC and States not Party to the CWC); license requirements for the export of Schedule 1 chemicals to all States Parties; a prohibition on the export of Schedule 2 chemicals to States not Party to the CWC; and an End-Use Certificate requirement for exports of Schedule 3 chemicals to States not Party to the CWC. Exports of CWC chemicals that do not require a license for CW reasons (e.g., exports and reexports of Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 chemicals to States Parties to the CWC) may require a license for other reasons set forth in the EAR. (
See,
in particular, the license requirements in § 742.2 of the EAR that apply to exports and reexports of precursor chemicals controlled by ECCN 1C350, for CB reasons. Also note the end-use and end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR.)

# Supplement No. 2 to Part 742—Anti-Terrorism Controls: North Korea, Syria Contract Sanctity Dates and Related Policies

# Note:
Exports and reexports of items in performance of contracts entered into before the applicable contract sanctity date(s) will be eligible for review on a case-by-case basis or other applicable licensing policies that were in effect prior to the contract sanctity date. The contract sanctity dates set forth in this Supplement are for the guidance of exporters. Contract sanctity dates are established in the course of the imposition of foreign policy controls on specific items and are the relevant dates for the purpose of licensing determinations involving such items. If you believe that a specific contract sanctity
date is applicable to your transaction, you should include all relevant information with your license application. BIS will determine any applicable contract sanctity date at the time an application with relevant supporting documents is submitted.
(a)
Terrorist-supporting countries.
The Secretary of State has designated North Korea, and Syria as countries whose governments have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism under section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act (EAA).
(b)
Items controlled under EAA sections 6(j) and 6(a).
Whenever the Secretary of State determines that an export or reexport to any of these countries could make a significant contribution to the military potential of such country, including its military logistics capability, or could enhance the ability of such country to support acts of international terrorism, the item is subject to mandatory control under EAA section 6(j) and the Secretaries of Commerce and State are required to notify appropriate Committees of the Congress 30 days before a license for such an item may be issued.
(1) On December 28, 1993, the Secretary of State determined that the export to North Korea, or Syria of items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of this Supplement, if destined to military, police, intelligence or other sensitive end-users, are controlled under EAA section 6(j). Therefore, the 30-day advance Congressional notification requirement applies to the export or reexport of these items to sensitive end-users in any of these countries.
(2) License applications for items controlled to designated terrorist-supporting countries under EAA section 6(a) will also be reviewed to determine whether the Congressional notification requirements of EAA section 6(j) apply.
(3) Items controlled for anti-terrorism reasons under section 6(a) to North Korea, and Syria are:
(i) Items described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) to non-sensitive end-users, and

(b)
File format requirements.
(1) The information described in paragraph (a) of this supplement must be provided in tabular or spreadsheet form, as an electronic file in comma separated values format (.csv), only. No file formats other than .csv will be accepted, as your encryption self-classification report must be directly convertible to tabular or spreadsheet format, where each row (and all entries within a row) properly correspond to the appropriate encryption item.

# Note to paragraph (
b

# )(1):
An encryption self-classification report data table created and stored in spreadsheet format (e.g., file extension .xls, .numbers, .qpw, .wb*, .wrk, and .wks) can be converted and saved into a comma delimited file format directly from the spreadsheet program. This .csv file is then ready for submission.
(2) Each line of your encryption self-classification report (.csv file) must consist of twelve entries as further described in this supplement.
(3) The first line of the .csv file must consist of the following twelve entries (
i.e.,
match the following) without alteration or variation: PRODUCT NAME, MODEL NUMBER, MANUFACTURER, ECCN, AUTHORIZATION TYPE, ITEM TYPE, SUBMITTER NAME, TELEPHONE NUMBER, E-MAIL ADDRESS, MAILING ADDRESS, NON-U.S. COMPONENTS, NON-U.S. MANUFACTURING LOCATIONS.

# Note to paragraph (
b

# )(3):
These first twelve entries (
i.e.,
first row) of an encryption self-classification report in .csv format correspond to the twelve column headers of a spreadsheet data file. The responses provided under column headers 7 through 12 (SUBMITTER NAME through NON-U.S. MANUFACTURING LOCATIONS) relate to the company as a whole, and thus should be entered the same for each product (
i.e.,
only one point of contact, one 'YES' or 'NO' answer to whether any of the reported products incorporate non-U.S. sourced encryption components, and one list of non-U.S. manufacturing locations, is required for the report). However, even though the information is the same for each product, please duplicate this information into each row of the spreadsheet, leaving no entry blank, so each product has the same identifying company information.
(4) Each subsequent line of the .csv file must correspond to a single encryption item (or a distinguished series of products) as described in paragraph (c) of this supplement.
(5) Each line must consist of six entries as described in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this supplement. No entries may be left blank. Each entry must be separated by a comma (,). Certain additional instructions are as follows:
(i) Line entries (a)(1) (‘PRODUCT NAME’) and (a)(4) (‘ECCN’) must be completed with relevant information.
(ii) For entries (a)(2) (‘MODEL NUMBER’) and (a)(3) (‘MANUFACTURER’), if these entries do not apply to your item or situation you may enter ‘NONE’ or ‘N/A’.
(iii) For entries (a)(5) (‘AUTHORIZATION TYPE’), if none of the provided choices apply to your situation, you may enter ‘OTHER’.
(6) Because of .csv file format requirements, the only permitted use of a comma is as the necessary separator between line entries. You may not use a comma for any other reason in your encryption self-classification report.
(c)
Other instructions.
(1) The information provided in accordance with this supplement and §§ 740.17(b)(1) and 740.17(e)(3) of the EAR must identify product offerings as they are typically distinguished in inventory, catalogs, marketing brochures and other promotional materials.
(2) For families of products where all the information described in paragraph (a) of this supplement is identical except for the model/series/part number (entry (a)(2)), you may list and describe these products with a single line in your .csv file using an appropriate model/series/part number identifier (
e.g.,
‘300’ or ‘3xx’) for entry (a)(2), provided each line in your .csv file corresponds to a single product series (or product type) within an overall product family.
(3) For example, if Company A produces, markets and sells both a ‘100’ (‘1xx’) and a ‘300’ (‘3xx’) series of product, in its encryption self-classification report (.csv
file) Company A must list the ‘100’ product series in one line (with entry (a)(2) completed as ‘100’ or ‘1xx’) and the ‘300’ product series in another line (with entry (a)(2) completed as ‘300’ or ‘3xx’), even if the other required information is common to all products in the ‘100’ and ‘300’ series.
(4) Only products self-classified by the exporter or reexporter must be reported. Products submitted for classification by the Bureau of Industry and Security for which a CCATS is issued do not need to be reported.

§ 743.4
Conventional arms reporting.
(a)
Scope.
This section outlines special reporting requirements for exports of certain items included in the UN Register of Conventional Arms (UNRoCA) and Wassenaar Arrangement (WA) Munitions List. These reports cover substantially similar arms. States participating in the UNRoCA report annually on all transfers of arms (see
www.disarmament.unoda.org/convarms/register/
); Participating States of the Wassenaar Arrangement exchange information every six months on deliveries and transfers to non-WA governments of conventional arms set forth in the
Wassenaar Arrangement's Basic Documents
under Part II “Guideline and Procedures, including the Initial Elements”, Appendix 3: “Specific Information Exchange on Arms Content by Category”. Public Documents, Vol. 1—Founding Documents at
https://www.wassenaar.org/app/uploads/2021/12/Public-Docs-Vol-I-Founding-Documents.pdf
). BIS obtains the information
needed for such conventional arms reporting from the information exporters are required to submit in the EEI submission in AES, pursuant to § 758.1(b)(9) and (g)(4)(ii) of the EAR. No additional reporting to BIS is required for purposes of this section. BIS does not submit reports for reexports or transfers (in-country) under this section. BIS does not include exports to Wassenaar member countries, identified in supplement no. 1 to part 743 in the Wassenaar reports. required under this section.

§ 743.6
Prior notifications to Congress of exports of certain semiautomatic firearms.
(a)
General requirement.
Applications to export semi-automatic firearms controlled by ECCNs 0A506 or 0A507 will be notified to Congress as provided in this section before licenses for such items are issued, except as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) Exports of semi-automatic firearms controlled by ECCNs 0A506 or 0A507 to personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government under License Exception GOV (§ 740.11(b) of the EAR) do not require such notification.
(2) Exports of semi-automatic firearms controlled by ECCNs 0A506 or 0A507 for official use by an agency of NATO do not require such notification.
(b)
Notification criteria.
Unless excluded in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, BIS will notify Congress prior to issuing a license authorizing the export of items to Mexico, South Africa, or Turkey or any other country not listed in Country Group A:5 or A:6 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR) if the items are sold under a contract or are otherwise part of an export transaction that includes $4,000,000 or more of semi-automatic firearms controlled by ECCNs 0A506 or 0A507.
(c)
License application information.
In addition to information required on the application, the exporter must include a copy of the signed contract or, if there is no contract, a written explanation from the applicant (including a statement of the value of the firearms controlled by ECCNs 0A506 or 0A507 to be exported) for any proposed export described in paragraph (b) of this section. License applications for semi-automatic firearms controlled by ECCNs 0A506 or 0A507 may include other nonautomatic firearms, shotguns, other 0x5zz items, or other items subject to the EAR, but the applicant must clearly identify the semi-automatic firearms controlled by ECCNs 0A506 or 0A507. The applicant clearly distinguishing the semi-automatic firearms controlled by ECCNs 0A506 or 0A507 from any other items on the license application will assist BIS in assessing whether the license application requires congressional notification under this section and identifying the information that will need to be reported to Congress. Any activity intended to circumvent notification requirements is prohibited. Such devices include, but are not limited to, the splitting or structuring of contracts to avoid exceeding applicable notification dollar value limits described in paragraph (a) of this section.

§ 744.1
General provisions.
(a)(1)
Introduction.
In this part, references to the EAR are references to 15 CFR chapter VII, subchapter C. This part contains prohibitions against exports, reexports, and selected transfers to certain end users and end uses as introduced under General Prohibitions Five (End use/End users) and Nine (Orders, Terms, and Conditions), unless authorized by BIS. Sections 744.2, 744.3, and 744.4 prohibit exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items subject to the EAR to defined nuclear, missile, and chemical and biological weapons proliferation activities. Section 744.5 prohibits exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items subject to the EAR to defined nuclear maritime end-uses. Consistent with General Prohibition Seven (Support of Proliferation Activities and certain Military-Intelligence End Uses and End Users (“U.S. person” activities)), § 744.6
prohibits specific activities by U.S. persons in support of certain nuclear, missile, chemical and biological weapons end uses, and whole plants for chemical weapons precursors, as well as certain military-intelligence end uses and military-intelligence end users. Section 744.7 prohibits exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of certain items for certain aircraft and vessels. Section 744.8 prohibits exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) without authorization when a person designated on the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) pursuant to certain specified sanctions programs is a party to the transaction. Section 744.9 sets forth restrictions on exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of certain cameras, systems, or related components. Section 744.11 imposes license requirements, to the extent specified in supplement no. 4 to this part, on entities listed in supplement no. 4 to this part for activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States. Section 744.15 sets forth the conditions for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) to persons listed on the Unverified List (UVL) in supplement no. 6 to this part, the criteria for revising the UVL, as well as procedures for requesting removal or modification of a listing on the UVL. Section 744.16 sets forth the license requirements, policies and procedures for the Entity List. Section 744.17 sets forth restrictions on exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of microprocessors and associated “software” and “technology” for military end uses and to military end users. Section 744.19 sets forth BIS's licensing policy for applications for export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) when a party to the transaction is an entity that has been sanctioned pursuant to any of three specified statutes that require certain license applications to be denied. In addition, these sections include license review standards for export, reexport, and in-country transfer license applications submitted as required by these sections. It should also be noted that part 764 of the EAR prohibits exports, reexports, and certain transfers of items subject to the EAR to denied parties. Section 744.21 imposes restrictions for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of item subject to the EAR listed in supplement no. 2 to this part for a military end use or military end user in Burma, Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (PRC or China), Nicaragua, or Venezuela and for a Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Nicaraguan, or Venezuelan military end user if identified in supplement no. 7 to this part. Section 744.21 also imposes restrictions for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) for all items subject to the EAR for a military end use or military end user in Belarus or Russia and for a Belarusian or Russian military end user wherever located if identified on supplement no. 4 to this part. Section 744.22 imposes restrictions on exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) for a military-intelligence end use or military-intelligence end user in Burma, China, Russia, or Venezuela; or for a country listed in Country Groups E:1 or E:2 (see supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). Section 744.23 sets forth restrictions on exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) for certain “supercomputer” and semiconductor manufacturing end use.
(2) If controls set forth under more than one section of part 744 apply to a person, the license requirements for such a person will be determined based on the requirements of all applicable sections of part 744, and license applications will be reviewed under all applicable licensing policies.
(b)
Steps.
The following are steps you should follow in using the provisions of this part:
(1)
Review end-use and end-user prohibitions.
First, review each end-use and end-user prohibition described in this part to learn the scope of these prohibitions.
(2)
Determine applicability.
Second, determine whether any of the end-use and end-user prohibitions described in this part are applicable to your planned export, reexport, shipment, transmission, transfer (in-country) or other activity. See supplement no. 1 to part 732 for guidance. For exports, reexports, shipments, transmissions, or transfers (in-country) that are in transit at the time you are informed by BIS that a license is required in accordance
with §§ 744.2(b), 744.3(b), 744.4(b), 744.6(c), 744.9(b), 744.11(c), 744.17(b), 744.21(b), or 744.22(b) of the EAR, you may not proceed any further with the transaction unless you first obtain a license from BIS (see part 748 of the EAR for instructions on how to apply for a license). The provisions of § 748.4(d)(2) of the EAR shall not apply to license applications submitted pursuant to a notification from BIS that occurs while an export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) is in transit.

§ 744.2
Restrictions on certain nuclear end-uses.
(a)
General prohibition.
In addition to the license requirements for items specified on the CCL, you may not export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to any destination, other than countries in supplement no. 3 to this part, an item subject to the EAR without a license if, at the time of export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) you know
1
that the item will be used directly or indirectly in any one or more of the following activities described in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section:
1
Part 772 of the EAR defines “knowledge” for all of the EAR except part 760, Restrictive Trade Practices and Boycotts. The definition, which includes variants such as “know” and “reason to know”, encompasses more than positive knowledge. Thus, the use of “know” in this section in place of the former wording “know or have reason to know” does not lessen or otherwise change the responsibilities of persons subject to the EAR.
(1)
Nuclear explosive activities.
Nuclear explosive activities, including research on or development, design, manufacture, construction, testing or maintenance of any nuclear explosive device, or components or subsystems of such a device.
2 3
2
Nuclear explosive devices and any article, material, equipment, or device specifically designed or specially modified for use in the design, development, or fabrication of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices are subject to export licensing or other requirements of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, U.S. Department of State, or the licensing or other restrictions specified in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Similarly, items specifically designed or specifically modified for use in devising, carrying out, or evaluating nuclear weapons tests or nuclear explosions (except such items as are in normal commercial use for other purposes) are subject to the same requirements.
3
Also see §§ 744.5 and 748.4 of the EAR for special provisions relating to technical data for maritime nuclear propulsion plants and other commodities.
(2)
Unsafeguarded nuclear activities.
Activities including research on, or development, design, manufacture, construction, operation, or maintenance of any nuclear reactor, critical facility, facility for the fabrication of nuclear fuel, facility for the conversion of nuclear material from one chemical form to another, or separate storage installation, where there is no obligation to accept International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards at the relevant facility or installation when it contains any source or special fissionable material (regardless of whether or not it contains such material at the time of export), or where any such obligation is not met.
(3)
Safeguarded and unsafeguarded nuclear activities.
Safeguarded and unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle activities, including research on or development, design, manufacture, construction, operation or maintenance of any of the following facilities, or components for such facilities:
4
4
Such activities may also require a specific authorization from the Secretary of Energy pursuant to § 57.b.(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, as implemented by the Department of Energy's regulations published in 10 CFR 810.
(i) Facilities for the chemical processing of irradiated special nuclear or source material;
(ii) Facilities for the production of heavy water;
(iii) Facilities for the separation of isotopes of source and special nuclear material; or
(iv) Facilities for the fabrication of nuclear reactor fuel containing plutonium.
(b)
Additional prohibition on persons informed by BIS.
BIS may inform persons, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for a specific export, reexport, or transfer (in-country), or for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of specified items to a certain end-user, because there is an unacceptable risk of use in, or diversion to, the activities specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. However, the absence of any such notification does not excuse persons from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
Exceptions.
Despite the prohibitions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, you may export technology subject to the EAR under the
operation technology and software
or
sales technology and software provisions
of License Exception TSU (see § 740.13(a) and (b)), but only to and for use in countries listed in supplement no. 3 to part 744 of the EAR (Countries Not Subject to Certain Nuclear End-Use Restrictions in § 744.2(a)). Notwithstanding the provisions of part 740 of the EAR, the provisions of § 740.13(a) and (b) will only overcome General Prohibition Five for countries listed in supplement no. 3 to part 744 of the EAR.
(d)
License review standards.
The following factors are among those used by the United States to determine whether to grant or deny license applications required under this section:
(1) Whether the commodities, software, or technology to be transferred are appropriate for the stated end-use and whether that stated end-use is appropriate for the end-user;
(2) The significance for nuclear purposes of the particular commodity, software, or technology;
(3) Whether the commodities, software, or technology to be exported are to be used in research on or for the development, design, manufacture, construction, operation, or maintenance of any reprocessing or enrichment facility;
(4) The types of assurances or guarantees given against use for nuclear explosive purposes or proliferation in the particular case;

§ 744.6
Restrictions on specific activities of “U.S. persons.”
(a)
Scope.
The general prohibitions in this section apply only to the extent that the underlying activities are not subject to a license requirement or general prohibition administered by another federal department or agency, see, for example, Assistance to Foreign Atomic Energy Activities regulations (10 CFR part 810), administered by the Department of Energy; International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR parts 120 through 130), administered by the Department of State; and certain sanctions regulations (to include, but not limited to, 31 CFR parts 500 through 599), administered by the Department of the Treasury. Accordingly, “U.S. persons” are required to seek a license from BIS only for the activities described in this section that are not subject to a license requirement or general prohibition administered by the Department of Energy, Department of State, Department of the Treasury, or other federal department or agency. The issuance of a license by BIS, or any other federal department or agency, does not authorize “U.S. persons” to engage in any activity that is otherwise prohibited by law, including criminal statutes.
(b)
General prohibitions.
No “U.S. person” may, without a license from BIS, 'support':
(1) The design, “development,” “production,” operation, installation (including on-site installation), maintenance (checking), repair, overhaul, or refurbishing of nuclear explosive devices in or by any country not listed in supplement no. 3 to this part;
(2) The design, “development,” “production,” operation, installation (including on-site installation), maintenance (checking), repair, overhaul, or refurbishing of “missiles” in or by a country listed in Country Groups D:4 or E:2;
(3) The design, “development,” “production,” operation, installation (including on-site installation), maintenance (checking), repair, overhaul, or refurbishing of chemical or biological weapons in or by any country or destination worldwide;
(4) The design, “development,” “production,” operation, installation (including on-site installation), maintenance (checking), repair, overhaul, refurbishing, shipment, or transfer (in-country) of a whole plant to make chemical weapons precursors identified in ECCN 1C350, in or by countries other than those listed in Country Group A:3 (Australia Group); or

(6) 'Support' means:
(i) Shipping or transmitting from one foreign country to another foreign country any item not subject to the EAR you know will be used in or by any of the end uses or end users described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section, including the sending or taking of such item to or from foreign countries in any manner;
(ii) Transferring (in-country) any item not subject to the EAR you know will be used in or by any of the end uses or end users described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section;
(iii) Facilitating such shipment, transmission, or transfer (in-country); or
(iv) Performing any contract, service, or employment you know may assist or benefit any of the end uses or end users described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section, including, but not limited to: Ordering, buying, removing, concealing, storing, using, selling, loaning, disposing, servicing, financing, transporting, freight forwarding, or conducting negotiations in furtherance of.
(c)
Additional prohibitions on “U.S. persons” informed by BIS.
(1) BIS may inform “U.S. persons,” either individually by specific notice, through amendment to the EAR published in the
Federal Register,
or through a separate notice published in the
Federal Register,
that a license is required because an activity could involve the types of 'support' (as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section) to the end uses or end users described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. However, the absence of any such notification does not excuse the “U.S. person” from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) Consistent with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, BIS is hereby informing “U.S. persons” that a license is required for the following activities, which could involve 'support' for the weapons of mass destruction-related end uses set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Specifically, if you know your export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) meets any of the specified activities described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section, then a license is required for shipping, transmitting, or transferring (in-country); facilitating the shipment, transmission, or transfer (in-country); or servicing (including installation) activities associated with any item, end use, or end user described in any of the following paragraphs:
(i)
“Development” or “production” of “advanced-node ICs.”
To or within Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5, any item not subject to the EAR that you know will be used in the “development” or “production” of integrated circuits at a “facility” of an entity headquartered in, or whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in, either Macau or a destination specified in Country Group
D:5 where “production” of “advanced-node integrated circuits” occurs;
(ii)
Category 3 items for “development” or “production” of “advanced-node ICs.”
To or within Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5, any item not subject to the EAR and meeting the parameters of any ECCN in Product Groups B, C, D, or E in Category 3 of the CCL that you know will be used in the “development” or “production” of integrated circuits at a “facility” of an entity headquartered in, or whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in, either Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5 where “production” of integrated circuits occurs, but you do not know whether “production” of “advanced-node integrated circuits” occurs at such “facility”;
(iii)
Semiconductor manufacturing equipment.
To or within either Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5, any item not subject to the EAR and meeting the parameters of ECCNs 3B001.a.4, c, d, f.1, f.5, k to n, p.2, p.4, r, 3B002.c, 3D992, or 3E992 regardless of end use or end user.
(3)
Scope of activities of “U.S. persons” that require a license under paragraph (c)(2) of this section
—(i)
Controlled activities.
The U.S. persons controls in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section apply to persons who:
(A) Authorize the shipment, transmittal, or transfer (in-country) of items not subject to the EAR and described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section;
(B) Conduct the delivery, by shipment, transmittal, or transfer (in-country), of items not subject to the EAR described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section; or
(C) Service, including maintaining, repairing, overhauling, or refurbishing items not subject to the EAR described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(ii)
Due diligence.
Appropriate due diligence includes but is not limited to review of publicly available information, capability of items to be provided, proprietary market data, and end-use statements. “U.S. persons” should conduct due diligence to assess whether the item is for the “development” or “production” of “advanced-node integrated circuits” at a “facility” of an entity headquartered in, or whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in, either Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5, consistent with paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section. As set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii), for items specified in Category 3B, 3C, 3D, or 3E ECCNs, license requirements may apply even when the “U.S. person” does not know whether the activity is for the “development” or “production” of “advanced-node integrated circuits.” In addition, some of the exclusions may require due diligence, such as those in paragraphs (d)(3) and (5) of this section. “U.S. persons” should follow the “Know Your Customer” guidance in supplement no. 3 to part 732 of the EAR. “U.S. persons” can also submit Advisory Opinion requests to BIS pursuant to § 748.3(c) of the EAR for guidance on specific fabrication facilities. To submit an Advisory Opinion request, email
RPD2@bis.doc.gov.
(d)
Exceptions and exclusions.
No license exceptions apply to the prohibitions described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) or paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(1)
Exclusion of certain administrative and clerical activities and information otherwise excluded
—(i)
Exclusion of certain administrative and clerical activities.
Given the policy objective of these controls, the “U.S. persons” criteria in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section do not extend to “U.S. persons” conducting administrative or clerical activities (
e.g.,
arranging for shipment or preparing financial documents) or otherwise implementing a decision to approve a restricted shipment, transmittal, or in-country transfer, or to activities of “U.S. persons” that are not directly related to the provision or servicing of specific items to the “development” or “production” of “advanced-node integrated circuits.”
(ii)
Exclusion of information otherwise excluded under the EAR under part 734.
The exclusion of certain activities specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section only applies to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and does not, for example, limit the scope of paragraph (b) of this section or apply to other uses of the term facilitate or facilitation found
elsewhere in the EAR. The scope of paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not include information or software that would otherwise be excluded from the EAR based on the exclusion criteria under part 734,
e.g.,
under § 734.7 (entitled “Published”) and § 734.8 “Technology” or “software” that arises during, or results from, fundamental research.
(iii)
Exclusion of law enforcement and intelligence operations of the U.S. Government.
Given the policy objective of these controls, the “U.S. persons” criteria in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section do not extend to “U.S. persons” conducting law enforcement and intelligence operations of the U.S. Government.
(2)
Exclusion to paragraphs (b)(5) and (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
Notwithstanding the prohibitions in paragraphs (b)(5) and (c)(2)(iii), “U.S. persons” who are employees of a department or agency of the U.S. Government may 'support' a 'military-intelligence end use' or a 'military-intelligence end user,' as described in paragraphs (b)(5) and (c)(2)(iii), if the 'support' is provided in the performance of official duties in furtherance of a U.S. Government program that is authorized by law and subject to control by the President by other means. This paragraph (d)(2) does not authorize a department or agency of the U.S. Government to provide 'support' that is otherwise prohibited by other administrative provisions or by statute. 'Contractor support personnel' of a department or agency of the U.S. Government are eligible for this authorization when in the performance of their duties pursuant to the applicable contract or other official duties. 'Contractor support personnel' for the purposes of this paragraph (d)(2) has the same meaning given to that term in § 740.11(b)(2)(ii) of the EAR. This authorization is not available when a department or agency of the U.S. Government acts as an agent on behalf of a non-U.S. Government person.
(3)
Exclusion to paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
The term “production” in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) does not apply to back-end steps such as assembly, test, or packaging that do not alter the integrated circuit technology level. If there is a question at the time of export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) about whether a manufacturing stage is back-end or whether a manufacturing stage is back-end or a back-end activity alters the technology level, you may submit an advisory opinion request to BIS pursuant to § 748.3(c) of the EAR for clarification.
(4)
Exclusion to paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) Paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) do not apply to a natural “U.S. person,” as defined in paragraphs (a)(1) and (3) of the definition in § 772.1 of the EAR, employed or working on behalf of a company headquartered in the United States or a destination specified in Country Group A:5 or A:6 and not majority-owned by an entity that is headquartered in either Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5.
(ii) Any activities a natural “U.S. person,” as defined in paragraphs (a)(1) and (3) of that term's definition in § 772.1 of the EAR, undertakes when employed or acting on behalf of a company not headquartered in the United States or a destination specified in Country Group A:5 or A:6 must comply with the requirements in this paragraph (d)(4) as applicable. For example, if a natural “U.S. person” is a freelancer who works or acts on behalf of a company headquartered in the United States or a destination specified in Country Group A:5 or A:6, those activities would not be prohibited under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section. However, if that same natural “U.S. person” was also working or acting on behalf of a company headquartered somewhere other than the United States or a destination specified in Country Group A:5 or A:6, the activities performed on behalf of such a company would not be excluded under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) and a license would be required.
(5)
Exclusion to paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.
Paragraph (c)(2)(iii) does not apply to servicing (including installation) activities unless at a “facility” where “production” of “advanced-node integrated circuits” occurs, which would require a license
under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(e)
License review standards.
(1) Applications for a “U.S. person” to 'support' (as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section) any of the end uses or end users described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section will be denied if such support would make a material contribution to the end uses and end users described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
(2) Applications for a “U.S. person” to 'support' (as defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section) a 'military-intelligence end use' or a 'military-intelligence end user' as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section will be reviewed with a presumption of denial.
(3) Applications for licenses submitted pursuant to the notice of a license requirement set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section will be reviewed in accordance with the policies described in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section. License review will take into account factors including technology level, customers, compliance plans, and contract sanctity.
(i)
Presumption of denial.
Applications will be reviewed with a presumption of denial for Macau and destinations specified in Country Group D:5 and entities headquartered or whose ultimate parent is headquartered in Macau or destinations specified in Country Group D:5, unless paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section applies.
(ii)
Case-by-case.
Applications will be reviewed with a case-by-case policy for license applications that meet either of the following conditions:
(A) For items specified in ECCN 3A090, 4A090, 3A001.z, 4A003.z, 4A004.z, 4A005.z, 5A002.z, 5A004.z, 5A992.z, 5D002.z, or 5D992.z, except for items designed or marketed for use in a datacenter and meeting the parameters of 3A090.a;
(B) For activities involving an item subject to the license requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section where there is an item not subject to the license requirements of paragraph (c)(2) that performs the same function as an item meeting the license requirements of paragraph (c)(2); or
(C) For all other applications not specified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) or (e)(3)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section.

§ 744.8
Restrictions on exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) when certain persons designated on the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) are a party to the transaction.
(a)
Scope.
(1) In addition to any other EAR license requirements that may be applicable, this section imposes EAR license requirements, license review policies, and restrictions on the use of license exceptions for exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) when a person who is designated on the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control's (OFAC) List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) with any of the following identifiers is a party to the transaction, as described in § 748.5(c) through (f):
(i) Related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
(A) [BELARUS-EO14038];
(B) [BELARUS];
(C) [RUSSIA-EO14024];

# Note 1 to paragraph (
a

# )(1):
The names of such designations are published in the
Federal Register
and incorporated into the SDN List, as set forth in appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V and on OFAC's website at
https://www.treas.gov/sdn.
See Program Tag Definitions for OFAC Sanctions Lists for additional information:
https://ofac.treasury.gov/specially-designated-nationals-list-sdn-list/program-tag-definitions-for-ofac-sanctions-lists.
(2) These EAR controls supplement and strengthen the sanctions that are imposed by OFAC on these SDNs to better ensure that U.S. national security and foreign policy interests are protected. Specifically, this section imposes controls on exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of items subject to the EAR where the OFAC regulations are not applicable, such as in certain situations involving deemed exports and deemed reexports, and reexports and transfers (in-country) not involving the U.S. financial system or otherwise involving U.S. persons. To avoid imposing a duplicative license requirement, the transactions specified in this section do not require separate EAR authorization if the transactions are authorized under an OFAC specific or general license or are exempted under OFAC's regulations.

# Note 2 to paragraph (
a

# ):
The Entity List in supplement no. 4 to part 744 includes certain persons that have also been designated with certain identifiers on the SDN List. See § 744.11 and supplement no. 4 to part 744 for requirements, including license review policies, for these entities, which take precedence over the requirements in this § 744.8. BIS requires an EAR authorization as specified in the license requirement column on the Entity List for export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) transactions involving items subject to the EAR in which these persons are parties to the transaction regardless of whether such transaction is authorized under an OFAC specific or general license or exempted under OFAC's regulations.
(b)
License requirements.
Unless the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) is authorized under an OFAC specific or general license or exempted under OFAC's regulations, a license is required under the EAR for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item “subject to the EAR” when a person who is designated on OFAC's SDN List with any of the identifiers set forth in paragraph (a)(1) is a party to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f). A Department of Commerce license is not required for transactions described in this paragraph (b) that would have otherwise met all of the terms and conditions of an OFAC general license if the transactions had been subject to OFAC jurisdiction.
(c)
License exceptions.
No license exceptions may overcome the license requirements in this section, except for entities that are also listed on the Entity List in supplement no. 4 to part 744 that have certain license exception eligibility, which is available to overcome the license requirements of this section and supplement no. 4 to part 744 for that specific entity.
(d)
License review policy.
Applications for licenses required by this section will be subject to a presumption of denial license review policy, except when note 1 to paragraph (a)(1) of this section is applicable and the license review policy specified on the Entity List in supplement no. 4 to part 744 is different, in which case the license review policy under the applicable Entity List entry for that person would govern. You should consult OFAC regarding transactions subject to licensing requirements under regulations maintained by OFAC.
(e)
Violations.
(1) Any export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) by a U.S. person of any item subject to both the EAR and regulations maintained by OFAC in situations in which a person identified in paragraph (a)(1) is a party to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f) that is not authorized by OFAC constitutes a violation of the EAR. This paragraph does not apply to entities identified under both
this section and the Entity List in supplement no. 4 to part 744. EAR violations involving entities identified under both this section and the Entity List will be addressed pursuant to §§ 744.11 and 744.16.
(2) Any export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item subject to the EAR in which a person identified in paragraph (a)(1) is a party to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f) and such transaction is not subject to regulations maintained by OFAC and not authorized by BIS constitutes a violation of the EAR.

# Note 3 to § 744.8:
This section does not implement, construe, or limit the scope of any criminal statute, including but not limited to 18 U.S.C. 2339B(a)(1) and 2339A, and does not excuse any person from complying with any criminal statute, including but not limited to 18 U.S.C. 2339B(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. 2339A.

§ 744.9
Restrictions on exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of certain cameras, systems, or related components.
(a)
General prohibitions.
(1) In addition to the applicable license requirements for nuclear nonproliferation, national security, regional stability, anti-terrorism, and United Nations embargo reasons in §§ 742.3, 742.4, 742.6, 742.8, 746.1(b), and 746.3 of the EAR, a license is required pursuant to this section for specific exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) if at the time of export, reexport, or transfer, the exporter, reexporter, or transferor knows or is informed that:
(i) Commodities controlled by ECCN 6A003.a.3, 6A003.a.4, or 6A003.a.6 will be or are intended to be used by a 'military end-user,' as defined in paragraph (d) of this section in all destinations except Australia, Canada, or the United Kingdom.
(ii) Commodities described in ECCNs 0A504 (incorporating commodities controlled by ECCNs 6A002 or 6A003, or commodities controlled by 6A993.a that meet the criterion of Note 3.a to 6A003.b.4), 6A002, 6A003 (other than 6A003.a.3, 6A003.a.4, and 6A003.a.6), or 6A993.a (having a maximum frame rate equal to or less than 9 Hz and thus meeting the criteria of Note 3.a to 6A003.b.4), or 8A002.d will be or are intended to be used by a 'military end-user,' as defined in paragraph (d) of this section in all destinations except those specified in Country Group A:1.
(iii) Commodities described in ECCNs 0A504 (incorporating commodities controlled by ECCNs 6A002 or 6A003, or commodities controlled by 6A993.a that meet the criterion of Note 3.a to 6A003.b.4), 6A002, 6A003, or 6A993.a (having a maximum frame rate equal to or less than 9 Hz and thus meeting the criteria of Note 3.a to 6A003.b.4), or 8A002.d will be or are intended to be incorporated into a “military commodity” controlled by ECCN 0A919 in all destinations except Australia, Canada, or the United Kingdom.
(2) The license requirement described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of items described in that paragraph when such items are being reexported or transferred as part of a military deployment by a unit of the government of a country in Country Group A:1 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740).
(b)
Additional prohibition on exporters, reexporters, or transferors informed by BIS.
BIS may inform an exporter, reexporter, or transferor, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for the export, reexport, or transfer of commodities described in ECCNs 0A504 (incorporating commodities controlled by ECCNs 6A002 or 6A003, or commodities controlled by 6A993.a that meet the criterion of Note 3.a to 6A003.b.4), 6A002, 6A003, or 6A993.a (having a maximum frame rate equal to or less than 9 Hz and thus meeting the criteria of Note 3.a to 6A003.b.4), or 8A002.d to specified end users, because BIS has determined that there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to the users or unauthorized incorporation into the “military commodities” described in paragraph (a) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration.
(c)
License review standard.
Applications for licenses required by this section will be reviewed by applying the policies that would be applied under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR Parts 120-130).
(d)
Military end-user.
In this section, the term “military end-user” means the national armed services (army, navy, marine, air force, or coast guard), as well as the national guard and national police, government intelligence or reconnaissance organizations, or any person or entity whose actions or functions are intended to support “military end-uses” as defined in § 744.17(d).
(e)
Exception.
Shipments subject to the prohibitions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section that are consigned to and for the official use of the U.S. Government authorized pursuant to § 740.11(b)(2)(ii) of the EAR may be made under License Exception GOV. No other license exceptions apply to the prohibitions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

§ 744.10
[Reserved]
§ 744.11
License requirements that apply to entities acting or at significant risk of acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.
BIS may impose foreign policy export, re-export, and transfer (in-country) license requirements, limitations on availability of license exceptions, and set license application review policy based on the criteria in this section. Such requirements, limitations and policy are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in the EAR. License requirements, limitations on use of license exceptions, and license application review policies will be imposed under this section by adding an entity or an address that presents a high diversion risk (
see
§ 744.16(f) of this part) to the Entity List (supplement no. 4 to this part) with a reference to this section and by stating on the Entity List the license requirements and license application review policies that apply to that entity or address, or by informing an exporter, re-exporter, or transferor pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section that a specific entity or address is subject to a license requirement, limitations on use of license exceptions and license application review policies as specified in a specific notice provided to an exporter, re-exporter, or transferor. BIS may remove an entity from the Entity List if it is no longer engaged in the activities described in paragraph (b) of this section and is unlikely to engage in such activities in the future, or if it is no longer at significant risk of acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States as described therein. BIS may remove an address that presents a high diversion risk from the Entity List if the address is determined to no longer be a high diversion risk, for example if measures are undertaken to educate companies operating at those addresses on export compliance, or to effectively screen clients for diversion risk. BIS may modify the license exception limitations and license application review policies that apply to a particular entity or address that presents a high diversion risk to implement the policies of this section. BIS will implement the provisions of this section in accordance with the decisions of the End-User Review Committee or, if appropriate in a particular case, in accordance with the decisions of the body to which the End-User Review Committee decision is escalated. The End-User Review Committee will follow the procedures set forth in supplement no. 5 to this part.
(a)
License requirement, availability of license exceptions, and license application review policy.
A license is required, to the extent specified on the Entity List, to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) any item subject to the EAR when an entity that is listed on the Entity List, or any entity using an address identified on the Entity List as presenting a high risk of diversion to activities of concern, is a party to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f) of the EAR unless otherwise authorized or excluded in this section. License exceptions may not be used unless authorized in the Entity List entry for the entity that is party
to the transaction or for an address that presents a high diversion risk that is used by a party to the transaction. Applications for licenses required by this section will be evaluated as stated in the relevant Entity List entry, in addition to any other applicable review policy stated elsewhere in the EAR.

Footnote 1 entities.
You may not, without a license or license exception, reexport, export from abroad, or transfer (in-country) to or within any destination or to any end user or party any foreign-produced item subject to the EAR pursuant to § 734.9(e)(1) of the EAR. All license exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR are available for foreign-produced items that are subject to this license requirement if all terms and conditions of the applicable license exception are met and the restrictions in § 740.2 of this EAR do not apply. The sophistication and capabilities of technology in items is a factor in license application review; license applications for foreign-produced items subject to a license requirement by this paragraph (a)(2) that are capable of supporting the “development” or “production” of telecom systems, equipment, and devices below the 5G level (
e.g.,
4G, 3G) will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

Exports from abroad or reexports from countries in Country Group A:5 that are not in supplement no. 4 to part 742.
A license is required for the export from abroad or reexport from countries specified in Country Group A:5 that are not in supplement no. 4 to part 742 of commodities specified in ECCN 3B993 if the commodity is not subject to equivalent controls by the relevant country.
(

)
Exports from abroad or reexports from all countries not listed in Country Group A:5.
Exports from abroad or reexports from all countries not listed in Country Group A:5, as follows:
(
i
) A license is required for commodities specified in ECCNs 3B001 (except 3B001.a.4, c, d, f.1, f.5, g, h, k to n, p.2, p.4, r), 3B002 (except 3B002.c), 3B611, 3B903, 3B991 (except 3B991.b.2.a through 3B991.b.2.b), 3B992, 3B993, or 3B994 by an entity that is headquartered or whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in a country not specified in supplement no. 4 to part 742.
(
ii
) A license is required for commodities specified in ECCN 3B993 by an entity headquartered or whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in a country specified in supplement no. 4 to part 742 of this section.
(

Transfers (in-country).
The commodity is to be transferred within the country of the entity specified by § 734.9(e)(3)(ii):
(

) By an entity whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in a country not described in supplement no. 4 to part 742 and the entity is transferring a commodity specified in ECCNs 3B001 (except 3B001.a.4, c, d, f.1,
f.5, g, h, k to n, p.2, p.4, or r), 3B002 (except 3B002.c), 3B611, 3B903, 3B991 (except 3B991.b.2.a through 3B991.b.2.b), 3B992, 3B993, or 3B994; or
(
ii
) By an entity whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in a country described in supplement no. 4 to part 742 destination and the entity is transferring a commodity specified in ECCN 3B993.
(B)
License review policy.
The license review policy is set forth in the entry of the Entity List in supplement no. 4 to this part for each entity with a Footnote 5 designation. Unless otherwise stated in the license review policy column of the specific entity, there is a case-by-case license review policy for items subject to the license requirements of this section where there is a foreign-made item that is not subject to the license requirements of this section and performs the same function as an item subject to the EAR license requirements of this section.
(b)
Criteria for revising the Entity List.
Entities for which there is reasonable cause to believe, based on specific and articulable facts, that the entity or party to the transaction that is operating at an address that presents a high diversion risk has been involved, is involved, or poses a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States and those acting on behalf of such entities or conducting operations at an address that presents a high diversion risk may be added to the Entity List pursuant to this section. An entity or address that presents a high diversion risk may pose a significant risk through certain circumstances that may be outside of its own control or in the case of addresses with high diversion risk, outside the control of certain parties to the transaction operating at such address that presents a high diversion risk. Such circumstances that may place an entity or address that presents a high diversion risk include situations involving a sustained lack of cooperation by a host government authority, for example, by preventing an end-use check from being conducted, that effectively prevents BIS from determining compliance with the EAR. This section may not be used to place any U.S. person, as defined in § 772.1 of the EAR, on the Entity List. Paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section provide an illustrative list of activities that could be or represent a significant risk of being contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States, including the foreign policy interest of the protection of human rights throughout the world.
(1) Supporting persons engaged in acts of terror.
(2) Actions that could enhance the military capability of, or the ability to support terrorism of governments that have been designated by the Secretary of State as having repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.
(3) Transferring, developing, servicing, repairing or producing conventional weapons in a manner that is contrary to United States national security or foreign policy interests or enabling such transfer, service, repair, development, or production by supplying parts, components, technology, or financing for such activity.
(4) Prevention of the accomplishment of an end use check conducted by or on behalf of BIS or the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls of the Department of State by:
(i) The entity or persons that own or control an address that presents a high diversion risk precluding access to; refusing to provide information about; or providing false or misleading information about parties to the transaction or the item to be checked. The conduct in this example includes: expressly refusing to permit a check; providing false or misleading information; or engaging in dilatory or evasive conduct that effectively prevents the check from occurring or makes the check inaccurate or useless. A nexus between the conduct of the party or address that presents a high diversion risk to be listed and the failure to produce a complete, accurate and useful check is required, even though an express refusal by the party to be listed is not required; or
(ii) A sustained lack of cooperation by the host government to schedule and facilitate the completion of an end-use check of entities identified on the Unverified List pursuant to § 744.15,
resulting in sufficient concern such that the End-User Review Committee believes that prior review of exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) involving the entity and the possible imposition of license conditions or license denial enhance BIS's ability to prevent violations of the EAR.
(5) Engaging in conduct that poses a risk of violating the EAR when such conduct raises sufficient concern that the End-User Review Committee believes that prior review of exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) involving the party and the possible imposition of license conditions or license denial enhances BIS's ability to prevent violations of the EAR.
(c)
Additional prohibition on persons informed by BIS.
BIS may inform persons, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for:
(1) A specific export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) because there is an unacceptable risk that the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) is intended to circumvent the license requirement imposed on an entity or address that presents a high diversion risk listed in supplement no. 4 to this part; or
(2) The export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of specified items to a certain party because there is an unacceptable risk that the party is acting as an agent, front, or shell company for an entity listed in supplement no. 4 to this part, or is otherwise assisting that listed entity in circumventing the license requirement set forth in that entity's entry in supplement no. 4 to this part; or
(3) The export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of specified items to a certain party or address that presents a high diversion risk because there is reasonable cause to believe, based on specific and articulable facts, that the entity has been involved, is involved, or poses a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States, including the foreign policy interest of the protection of human rights throughout the world, and those acting on behalf of such entity or that an address that presents a high diversion risk of being used to divert items subject to the EAR to end-uses or end-users inconsistent with U.S. foreign policy or national security interests. Specific notice will be given only by, or at the direction of, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic Trade and Technology Security or the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic Trade. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by written notice within two working days signed by the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic Trade and Technology Security or the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary's or Deputy Assistant Secretary's designee. The specific notice will include the license requirement, limitations on use of license exceptions, and license application review policy with which that exporter, re-exporter, or transferor must comply pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3). The ERC may add such entities or addresses that present a high diversion risk to the Entity List in supplement no. 4 to this part.

General requirement.
In addition to the requirements set forth elsewhere in the EAR, exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) subject to the EAR involving parties to the transaction who are listed on the Unverified List (UVL) must be made in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The names and addresses of foreign persons subject to end-user controls based on the criteria described in paragraph (c) of this section are identified in the Unverified List found in supplement no. 6 to this part. Requirements found elsewhere in the EAR also apply, including but not limited to any license requirements, the record filing requirements pursuant to § 758.1(b)(8), and the
restrictions on license exceptions described in § 740.2(a)(17) of the EAR.
(b)
UVL statement.
Before proceeding with any export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) subject to the EAR that is not subject to a license requirement, involving a person listed on the Unverified List as a party described in § 748.5 of the EAR, an exporter, reexporter, or transferor (in-country) must obtain a UVL statement from such person, according to the provisions set forth in this section. The statement must be retained in accordance with part 762 of the EAR.
(1) One UVL statement may be used for multiple exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of the same items between the same parties, so long as the party names, the description(s) of the items and the ECCNs are correct. If one UVL statement is used for multiple exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country), the exporter, reexporter, and transferor must maintain a log or other record that identifies each export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) made pursuant to this section and the specific UVL statement that is associated with each. The log or record must be retained in accordance with Part 762 of the EAR.
(2) The UVL statement must be in writing, signed and dated by an individual of sufficient authority to legally bind the UVL party, and state the following:
(i) Name of UVL party; complete physical address, to include shipping, corporate, and end user addresses, if different (simply listing a post office box is insufficient); telephone number; fax number; email address; Web site (if available); and name and title of individual signing the UVL statement.
(ii) Agrees not to use the item(s) for any use prohibited by the United States Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-772, and agrees not to reexport or transfer (in-country) the item(s) to any destination, use or user prohibited by the EAR.
(iii) Declares that the end use, end user, and country of ultimate destination of the item(s) subject to the EAR are as follows: [INSERT END USE, END USER, AND COUNTRY OF ULTIMATE DESTINATION].
(iv) Agrees to cooperate with end-use checks, including a Post-Shipment Verification, conducted by or on behalf of the Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, for any item subject to the EAR in transactions to which they were a party in the last five years. This cooperation includes facilitating the timely conduct of the check and providing full and accurate information concerning the disposition of items subject to the EAR.
(v) Agrees to provide copies of this document and all other export, reexport or transfer (in-country) records required to be retained in part 762 of the EAR.
(vi) Certifies that the individual signing the UVL statement has sufficient authority to legally bind the party.
(c)
Criteria for revising the Unverified List.
(1) Foreign persons who are parties to an export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) subject to the EAR may be added to the Unverified List if BIS or federal officials acting on BIS's behalf cannot verify the
bona fides
(
i.e.
, legitimacy and reliability relating to the end use and end user of items subject to the EAR) of such persons because an end-use check, such as a pre-license check (PLC) or a post-shipment verification (PSV), cannot be completed satisfactorily for reasons outside of the U.S. Government's control. Examples in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section provide an illustrative list of those circumstances.
(i) During the conduct of an end-use check, the subject of the check is unable to demonstrate the disposition of items subject to the EAR.
(ii) The existence or authenticity of the subject of an end-use check cannot be verified (e.g., the subject of the check cannot be located or contacted).
(iii) Lack of cooperation by the host government authority prevents an end-use check from being conducted.
(2) BIS will remove a person from the Unverified List when BIS is able to verify the
bona fides
of the listed person as an end user, consignee, or other party to exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) involving items subject to the EAR by completing a PLC or PSV. In the limited circumstance involving a PLC or PSV that cannot be
completed due to lack of host government cooperation, an alternative
bona fides
verification process may be determined by BIS to be sufficient. A determination to remove a person from the Unverified List based on the criteria in this paragraph is separate from any determination made by BIS pursuant to § 744.11(b) of the EAR, and must be requested through paragraph (d) of this section.
(d)
Procedure for requesting removal of a person on the Unverified List.
Any person listed on the Unverified List may request that its listing be amended or removed.
(1) All such requests, including reasons therefor and information that verifies the
bona fides,
i.e., legitimacy and reliability of the person listed on the Unverified List as an end user, consignee or other party to exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items subject to the EAR, must be in writing and sent to: Director, Office of Enforcement Analysis, Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Room 4065, Washington, DC 20230, via fax to (202) 482-0971, or by email to
UVLRequest@bis.doc.gov.
(2) The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement will review such requests and will convey the decision on the request to the requester in writing based on an assessment of the listed person's
bona fides
as a party to exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) subject to the EAR. That decision will be the final agency action on the request.

(2)
BIS action.
The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration will convey the decision on the request to the requester in writing. That decision will be the final agency action on the request.
(f)
Addresses that present a high diversion risk.
In limited circumstances, such as when multiple entities on the Entity List use the same address, or the name of an entity at a particular address is unknown to BIS, BIS may determine that such an address presents a high risk of diversion and publish the address on the Entity List without an associated entity name. These entries will apply license requirements, license review policies, and restrictions on the use of license exceptions for all entities using that address. When submitting a license application, the applicant should name the specific entity on the application. In the license application field for additional information, the applicant should state that the address is on the Entity List.

§ 744.17
Restrictions on certain exports, reexports and transfers (in-country) of microprocessors and associated “software” and “technology” for “military end uses” and to “military end users.”
(a)
General prohibition.
In addition to the license requirements set forth elsewhere in the EAR, you may not export, reexport or transfer (in-country) microprocessors (“microprocessor microcircuits,” “microcomputer microcircuits,” and microcontroller microcircuits having a processing speed of 5 GFLOPS or more and an arithmetic logic unit with an access width of 32 bit or more, including those incorporating “information security” functionality), or associated “software” and “technology” for the “production” or “development” of such microprocessors without a license if, at the time of the export, reexport or transfer (in-country), you know, have reason to know, or are informed by BIS that the item will be or is intended to be used for a 'military end use,' as defined in paragraph (d) of this section, in a destination listed in Country Group D:1 (see supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR); or by a 'military end user,' as defined in paragraph (e) of this section, in a destination listed in Country Group D:1.
(b)
Additional prohibition on exporters or reexporters informed by BIS.
BIS may inform an exporter, reexporter or transferor, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for export, reexport or transfer (in-country) of items described in paragraph (a) of this section to specified end users, because BIS has determined that there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to the end uses or end users described in paragraph (a) of this section. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. The absence of any such notification does not excuse the exporter, reexporter or transferor from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
License review standards.
There is a presumption of denial for applications to export, reexport or transfer (in-country) items subject to this section.
(d)
Military end-use.
In this section, the phrase `military end use' means incorporation into: a military item described on the U.S. Munitions List (USML) (22 CFR part 121, International Traffic in Arms Regulations) or the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (as set out on the Wassenaar Arrangement Web site at
http://www.wassenaar.org
); commodities classified under ECCNs ending in “A018” or under “600 series” ECCNs; or any commodity that is designed for the “use,” “development,” “production,” or deployment of military items described on the USML, the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List or classified

(f)
Exceptions.
The prohibitions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section supersede any license exception or No License Required (NLR) designation that would otherwise apply to a transaction subject to the EAR, except that this license requirement does not apply to exports, reexports or transfers (in-country) of items for or on behalf of the official use by personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government or to agencies of a cooperating government authorized by License Exception GOV pursuant to § 740.11 of the EAR. See § 740.11(b)(1) of the EAR for the definition of 'agency of the U.S. Government' and § 740.11(c)(1) for the definition of 'agency of a cooperating government.'

Licensing policy regarding persons sanctioned pursuant to specified statutes.
Notwithstanding any other licensing policy elsewhere in the EAR, BIS will deny any export or reexport license application if any person who is a party to the transaction (
i.e.,
the applicant, other party authorized to receive a license, purchaser, intermediate consignee, ultimate consignee, or end-user) is subject to one or more of the sanctions described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (e) of this section and will deny any export or reexport license application for an item listed on the Commerce Control List with a reason for control of MT if a person who is a party to the transaction is subject to a sanction described in paragraph (d) of this section.

§ 744.21
Restrictions on certain 'military end uses' or 'military end users'.
(a)
General prohibition.
In addition to the license requirements for items specified on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR), you may not export, reexport, or transfer (in-country):
(1) Any item subject to the EAR listed in supplement no. 2 to this part without a license if, at the time of the
export, reexport, or transfer (in-country), you have “knowledge,” as defined in § 772.1 of the EAR, that the item is intended, entirely or in part, for a 'military end use,' as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, in Burma, Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (China), Nicaragua, or Venezuela, or a Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Nicaraguan, or Venezuelan 'military end user,' as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, wherever located. 'Military end users' located outside of Burma, Cambodia, China, Nicaragua, or Venezuela are limited to entities identified on the 'Military End-User' (MEU) List under supplement no. 7 to this part.
(2) Any item subject to the EAR without a license if, at the time of the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country), you have “knowledge,” as defined in § 772.1 of the EAR that the item is intended, entirely or in part, for a 'military end use,' as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, in Belarus or Russia, or a Belarusian or Russian 'military end user,' as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, wherever located. Belarusian or Russian 'military end users' located outside of Belarus or Russia are limited to entities identified on the Entity List under supplement no. 4 to this part with a footnote 3 designation and a reference to this section.

# Note 1 to paragraphs (
a

# )(1) and (2):
An entity anywhere in the world, including in Burma, Cambodia, China, Nicaragua, or Venezuela, may be listed on the Entity List as a Belarusian or Russian 'military end user' with a footnote 3 designation. If the entity is not a Belarusian or Russian 'military end user,' but has otherwise been identified by the End User Review Committee (ERC) as a 'military end user,' that entity may be identified under the 'Military End-User' (MEU) List under supplement no. 7 to this part. As noted in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, exporters, reexporters, and transferors, even in the absence of any such notification, are not excused from compliance with the license requirements of this paragraph (a) for all entities in Burma, Cambodia, China, Nicaragua, or Venezuela to determine whether the entity is a 'military end user' for purposes of paragraph (g) of this section because supplement no. 7 is not an exhaustive listing of 'military end users' in those countries. As noted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, exporters, reexporters, and transferors, even in the absence of any such notification, are not excused from compliance with the license requirements of this paragraph (a) for all entities in Belarus or Russia to determine whether the entity is a 'military end user' for purposes of paragraph (g) of this section because supplement no. 4 under this part is not an exhaustive listing of 'military end users' in those countries.
(b)
Additional prohibition on those informed by BIS.
BIS may inform you either individually by specific notice, through amendment to the EAR published in the
Federal Register,
or through a separate notification published in the
Federal Register,
that a license is required for specific exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of any item because there is an unacceptable risk of use in or diversion to a 'military end use' in Belarus, Burma, Cambodia, China, Nicaragua, the Russian Federation, or Venezuela, or for a Belarusian, Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Nicaraguan, Russian, or Venezuelan 'military end user,' wherever located. Specific notice will be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration or the Deputy Assistant Secretary's designee. The absence of BIS notification does not excuse the exporter from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
(1)
'Military End-User' (MEU) List.
BIS may inform and provide notice to the public that certain entities are subject to the additional prohibition described under this paragraph (b) following a determination by the End-User Review Committee (ERC) that a specific entity is a 'military end user' pursuant to this section and therefore any exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) to that entity represent an unacceptable risk of use in or diversion to a 'military end use' in Belarus, Burma, Cambodia, China, Nicaragua, the Russian Federation, or Venezuela, or for a Belarusian, Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Nicaraguan, Russian, or Venezuelan 'military end user,' wherever located. Such Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Nicaraguan, or Venezuelan 'military end users' may be added to supplement no. 7 to this part (MEU
List). Such Belarusian or Russian 'military end users' may also be added to supplement no. 4 to this part (Entity List) and will be listed with a footnote 3 designation and a reference to this section. License requirements for listed MEU are described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. The listing of entities under supplement no. 7 or 4 to this part is not an exhaustive listing of 'military end users' for purposes of this section, except for 'military end users' of a country identified in this section (Belarus, Burma, Cambodia, China, Nicaragua, the Russian Federation, or Venezuela) not located in that same country. As specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, 'military end users' of a country identified in this section not located in that same country are exhaustively listed on either the Entity List with a footnote 3 designation and a reference to this section, or on the MEU List under supplement no. 7 this part. Exporters, reexporters, and transferors are responsible for determining whether transactions with entities not listed on supplement no. 7 or 4 to this part are subject to a license requirement under paragraph (a) of this section. The process in this paragraph (b)(1) for placing entities on the MEU List and Entity List is only one method BIS may use to inform exporters, reexporters, and transferors of license requirements under this section.
(i)
End-User Review Committee (ERC).
The End-User Review Committee (ERC), composed of representatives of the Departments of Commerce (Chair), State, Defense, Energy and, where appropriate, the Treasury, makes all decisions regarding additions to, removals from, or other modifications to the MEU List and Entity List. Decisions by the ERC for purposes of the MEU List and Entity List will be made following the procedures identified in this section and in supplement no. 5 to this part (Procedures for End-User Review Committee Entity List and 'Military End User' (MEU) List Decisions).
(ii)
License requirement for parties to the transaction.
Consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, a license is required for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item subject to the EAR listed in supplement no. 2 to this part when an entity that is listed on the MEU List as a Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Nicaraguan, or Venezuelan 'military end user' is a party to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f) of the EAR. Consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, a license is required for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item subject to the EAR when a Belarusian or Russian 'military end user' that is listed on the Entity List pursuant to this section is a party to the transaction as described in § 748.5(c) through (f) of the EAR.
(2)
Requests for removal from or modification of 'Military End User' (MEU) List and Entity List.
Any entity listed on the MEU List or Entity List pursuant to this section may request that its listing be removed or modified. All such requests, including reasons therefor, must be in writing and sent to: Chair, End-User Review Committee, Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Room 3886, Washington, DC 20230; or by email at
ERC@bis.doc.gov.
In order for an entity listed on the MEU List or the Entity List pursuant to this section to petition BIS for their removal or modification, as applicable, the entity must address why the entity is not a 'military end user' for purposes of this section.
(i)
Review.
The ERC will review such requests for removal or modification in accordance with the procedures set forth in supplement no. 5 to this part.
(ii)
BIS action.
The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration will convey the decision on the request to the requester in writing. That decision will be the final agency action on the request.
(c)
License exception.
Despite the prohibitions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, you may export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) items subject to the EAR under the provisions of License Exception GOV set forth in § 740.11(b)(2)(i) and (ii) of the EAR.
(d)
License application procedure.
When submitting a license application pursuant to this section, you must state in the “additional information”
block of the application that “this application is submitted because of the license requirement in this section (Restrictions on certain 'military end uses' or 'military end users').” In addition, either in the additional information block of the application or in an attachment to the application, you must include all known information concerning the 'military end use' and 'military end user(s)' of the item(s). If you submit an attachment with your license application, you must reference the attachment in the “additional information” block of the application.

Applications to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) items described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be reviewed with a policy of denial except for food and medicine designated as EAR99, which will be reviewed under a case-by-case review policy, unless otherwise stated in the license review policy column on the Entity List (supplement no. 4 to this part).
(2) Applications may be reviewed under chemical and biological weapons, nuclear nonproliferation, or missile technology review policies, as set forth in §§ 742.2(b)(4), 742.3(b)(4), and 742.5(b)(4) of the EAR, if the end use may involve certain proliferation activities.
(3) Applications for items requiring a license for any reason that are destined for a 'military end use' in Belarus, Burma, Cambodia, China, Nicaragua, the Russian Federation, or Venezuela or for a Belarusian, Burmese, Cambodian, Chinese, Nicaraguan, Russian, or Venezuelan 'military end user,' wherever located, also will be subject to the review policy stated in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(f)
Military end use.
In this section, 'military end use' means: Incorporation into a military item described on the U.S. Munitions List (USML) (22 CFR part 121, International Traffic in Arms Regulations); incorporation into items classified under Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) ending in “A018” or under “600 series” ECCNs; or any item that supports or contributes to the operation, installation, maintenance, repair, overhaul, refurbishing, “development,” or “production,” of military items described on the USML, or items classified under ECCNs ending in “A018” or under “600 series” ECCNs.
(g)
Military end user.
In this section, the term 'military end user' means the national armed services (army, navy, marine, air force, or coast guard), as well as the national guard and national police, government intelligence or reconnaissance organizations (excluding those described in § 744.22(f)(2)), or any person or entity whose actions or functions are intended to support 'military end uses' as defined in paragraph (f) of this section.
(h)
Effects on contracts.
Transactions involving the export, reexport, or transfer (in country) of items to or within Venezuela are not subject to the provisions of this section if the contracts for such transactions were signed prior to November 7, 2014.
