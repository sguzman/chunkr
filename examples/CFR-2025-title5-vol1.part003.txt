(1) Essential to the new position and were acquired through performance in a position in the uniformed services having duties that directly relate to the duties of the position to which he or she is being appointed; and
(2) Necessary to achieve an important agency mission or performance goal.
(c) When the head of an agency or his or her designee makes a determination to provide service credit for prior work experience or active duty in the uniformed services under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, he or she must determine the amount of service that will be credited. The amount of service credited may not exceed the actual amount of service during which the employee performed duties directly related to the position to which the employee is being appointed.
(d) An employee must provide written documentation, acceptable to the agency, of his or her prior work experience. An employee must provide written documentation from the military, acceptable to the agency, of his or her uniformed service. The head of an agency or his or her designee must make the determination to approve an employee's qualifying prior work experience before the employee enters on duty.
(e) The agency must establish documentation and recordkeeping procedures sufficient to allow reconstruction of each action.
(f)(1) Credit for prior work experience or experience in a uniformed service under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is granted to the employee upon the effective date of his or her initial appointment to the agency or reappointment after a 90-day break in service and remains creditable for annual leave accrual purposes thereafter unless the employee fails to complete 1 full year of continuous service with the appointing agency.
(2) If an employee is placed in a leave without pay status during the 1-year period of continuous service required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the 1-year period of continuous service must be extended by the amount of time in a leave without pay unless—
(i) The employee separates or is placed in a leave without pay status to perform service in the uniformed services (as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4303 and 5 CFR 353.102) and later returns to civilian service through the exercise of a reemployment right provided by law, Executive order, or regulation; or
(ii) The employee separates or is placed in a leave without pay status because of an on-the-job injury with entitlement to injury compensation under 5 U.S.C. chapter 81 and later recovers sufficiently to return to work.
(g) If an employee separates from Federal service or transfers to another agency before completing 1 full year of
continuous service with the appointing agency—
(1) Any credit under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section must be subtracted from the employee's total creditable service before the employee transfers or separates, and the agency must establish a new service computation date for leave accrual purposes under 5 U.S.C. 6303(a);
(2) Any annual leave accrued or accumulated by an employee as a result of receiving credit for service under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section remains to the credit of the employee; and
(3) The agency must—
(i) Transfer the annual leave balance to the new employing agency under 5 CFR 630.501 if the employee is transferring to a position to which annual leave may be transferred; or
(ii) Make a lump-sum payment under 5 CFR 550.1205 for any unused annual leave if the employee is separating from Federal service or moving to a position to which annual leave cannot be transferred.

§ 630.206
Minimum charge.
Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 102290, Dec. 17, 2024.
(a) Unless an agency establishes a minimum charge of less than one hour, or establishes a different minimum charge through negotiations, the minimum charge for leave is one hour, and additional charges are in multiples thereof. If an employee is unavoidably or necessarily absent for less than one hour, or tardy, the agency, for adequate reason, may excuse him without charge to leave.
(b) When an employee is charged with leave for an unauthorized absence or tardiness, the agency may not require him to perform work for any part of the leave period charged against his account.
[33 FR 12475, Sept. 4, 1968, as amended at 38 FR 18446, July 11, 1973; 38 FR 26601, Sept. 24, 1973]

# Effective Date Note:
At 89 FR 102290, Dec. 17, 2024, § 630.206 was amended by removing the second sentence in paragraph (a), effective Jan. 16, 2025.
§ 630.207
Travel time.
The travel time granted an employee under section 6303(d) of title 5, United States Code, is inclusive of the time necessarily occupied in traveling to and from his post of duty and (a) the United States, or (b) his place of residence, which is outside the area of employment, in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the territories or possessions of the United States. The employee shall designate his place of residence in his request for leave under section 6303(d) of title 5, United States Code.
§ 630.208
Reduction in leave credits.
(a) When the number of hours in a nonpay status in a full-time employee's leave year equals the number of basepay hours in a pay period, the agency shall reduce his credits for leave by an amount equal to the amount of leave the employee earns during the pay period. When the employee's number of hours of nonpay status does not require a reduction of leave credits, the agency shall drop those hours at the end of the employee's leave year. For the purpose of determining the reduction of leave credits under this paragraph when an employee has one or more breaks in service during a leave year, the agency shall include all hours in a nonpay status (other than nonpay status during a fractional pay period when no leave accrues) for each period of service during the leave year in which annual leave accrued.
(b) An employee who is in a nonpay status for his entire leave year does not earn leave.
(c) When a reduction in leave credits results in a debit to an employee's annual leave account at the end of a leave year, the agency shall:
(1) Carry the debit forward as a charge against the annual leave to be earned by the employee in the next leave year; or
(2) Require the employee to refund the amount paid him for the period covering the excess leave that resulted in the debit.
(d) A period covered by an employee's refund for unearned advanced leave is deemed not a nonpay status under this section.
§ 630.209
Refund for unearned leave.
(a) When an employee who is indebted for unearned leave is separated, the agency shall:
(1) Require him to refund the amount paid him for the period covering the leave for which he is indebted; or
(2) Deduct that amount from any pay due him.
An employee who enters active military service with a right of restoration is deemed not separated for the purpose of this paragraph.
(b) This section does not apply when an employee:
(1) Dies;
(2) Retires for disability; or
(3) Resigns or is separated because of disability which prevents him from returning to duty or continuing in the service, and which is the basis of the separation as determined by his agency on medical evidence acceptable to it.
§ 630.210
Uncommon tours of duty.
(a) An agency may require that an employee with an uncommon tour of duty accrue and use leave on the basis of that uncommon tour of duty. The leave accrual rates for such employees shall be directly proportional (based on the number of hours in the biweekly tour of duty and the accrual rate of the corresponding leave category) to the standard leave accrual rates for employees who accrue and use leave on the basis of an 80-hour biweekly tour of duty. One hour (or appropriate fraction thereof) of leave shall be charged for each hour (or appropriate fraction thereof) of absence from the uncommon tour of duty.
(b) When an employee is converted to a different tour of duty for leave purposes, his or her leave balances shall be converted to the proper number of hours based on the proportion of hours in the new tour of duty compared to the former tour of duty.
(c) An agency shall establish an uncommon tour of duty for each firefighter compensated under part 550, subpart M, of this chapter. The uncommon tour of duty shall correspond directly to the firefighter's regular tour of duty, as defined in § 550.1302 of this chapter, so that each firefighter accrues and uses leave on the basis of that tour.
(d) In applying § 550.805(g) of this chapter, and §§ 630.306(b), and 630.310(d), the referenced number of hours for full-time employees (416 hours and 208 hours) shall be proportionally adjusted based on the percentage amount by which the number of hours in the uncommon tour of duty exceeds the number of hours in a regular full-time tour of duty. For example, if the uncommon tour of duty consists of 120 hours in a biweekly pay period instead of the 80 hours for a regular full-time employee, the percentage adjustment would be 50 percent [(120/80) − 1]; accordingly, 416 hours would be converted to 624 hours and 208 hours would be converted to 312 hours.
[59 FR 66635, Dec. 28, 1994, as amended at 63 FR 64595, Nov. 23, 1998; 67 FR 15467, Apr. 2, 2002; 85 FR 48101, Aug. 10, 2020]

Exclusion of Presidential appointees.
(a)
Authority.
(1) Section 6301(2)(xi) of title 5, United States Code, authorizes the President to exclude certain Presidential appointees in the executive branch or the government of the District of Columbia from the annual and sick leave provisions of subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, and from the related provisions of this part.
(2) The President, by Executive Order 10540, as amended, has delegated to the Office of Personnel Management the responsibility for making exclusions under section 6301(2)(xi), and the Office of Personnel Management has delegated responsibility to the head of each agency consistent with the provisions of this section.
(3) Presidential appointees in positions where the rate of basic pay is equal to or exceeds the rate for level V of the Executive Schedule are already excluded from the annual and sick leave provisions by 5 U.S.C. 6301(2)(x). Therefore, no further action by an agency is necessary to exclude these appointees.
(b)
Criteria for exclusions.
The head of an agency may exclude an officer in the agency from the annual and sick leave provisions only if the officer meets all of the following criteria:
(1) The officer is a Presidential appointee;
(2) The officer is not a United States attorney or United States marshal; and
(3) The officer's responsibilities for carrying out the duties of the position continue outside normal duty hours and while away from the normal duty post.
(c)
Revocation of exclusion.
The head of an agency may revoke an exclusion from the annual and sick leave provisions which was made under this section.
(d)
Reports.
The head of an agency must report any exclusion, or revocation of an exclusion, authorized under this section to the Office of Personnel Management.
(e)
Continuation of previous authorizations.
Any officer in an agency who was excluded by action of the President or the Civil Service Commission prior to February 15, 1979, from the annual and sick leave provisions under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 6301(2)(xi) shall continue to be excluded from annual and sick leave unless the exclusion is revoked by the agency under the provisions of this section.

§ 630.212
Use of annual leave to establish initial eligibility for retirement or continuation of health benefits.
(a) An employee may elect to use annual leave and remain on the agency's rolls in order to establish initial eligibility for immediate retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8336, 8412, or 8414, and/or to establish initial eligibility under 5 U.S.C. 8905 to continue health benefits coverage into retirement, as provided in:
(1) Section 351.606(b)(1) for an employee who would otherwise have been separated by reduction in force procedures under part 351 of this chapter; or
(2) Section 351.606(b)(2) of this chapter for an employee who would otherwise have been separated by adverse action procedures under authority of part 752 of this chapter because of the employee's decision to decline relocation (including transfer of function).
(b)(1) Annual leave that may be used for the purposes described in paragraph (a) of this section includes all accumulated, accrued, and restored annual leave to the employee's credit prior to the effective date of the reduction in force or relocation (including transfer of function) and annual leave earned by an employee while in a paid leave status after the effective date of the reduction in force or relocation (including transfer of function).
(2) Annual leave that is advanced to an employee under 5 U.S.C. 6302(d), including any advance annual leave that may be credited to an employee's leave account after the effective date of the reduction in force or relocation (including transfer of function), may not be used for purpose of this section.
(3) For purposes of this section, the employing agency may approve the use of any or all annual leave donated to an employee under part 630, subpart I, of this chapter (Voluntary Leave Transfer Program), or made available to the employee under part 630, subpart J, of this chapter (Voluntary Leave Bank Program), as of the effective date of the reduction in force or relocation.

# Subpart C—Annual Leave
§ 630.301
Annual leave accrual and accumulation—Senior Executive Service, Senior-Level, and Scientific and Professional Employees.
(a) Annual leave accrues at the rate of 1 day (8 hours) for each full biweekly pay period for an employee who is covered by 5 U.S.C. 6301, who is employed for the full pay period, and who—
(1) Holds a position in the Senior Executive Service (SES) which is subject to 5 U.S.C. 5383; or
(2) Holds a senior-level (SL) or scientific or professional (ST) position which is subject to 5 U.S.C. 5376.
(b) The head of an agency may request that OPM authorize an annual leave accrual rate of 1 full day (8 hours) for each biweekly pay period for additional categories of employees who are covered by 5 U.S.C. 6301 and who hold positions that are determined by OPM to be equivalent to positions subject to the pay systems under 5 U.S.C. 5383 or 5376. Such a request must include documentation that the affected pay system is equivalent to the SES or SL/ST pay system because it meets all three of the following conditions:
(1) Pay rates are established under an administratively determined (AD) pay system that was created under a separate statutory authority. If an AD position has a single rate of pay established under an authority outside of 5 U.S.C. chapters 51 and 53, that single rate (excluding locality pay) must be higher than the rate for GS-15, step 10 (excluding locality pay). If an AD position is paid within a rate range established under an authority outside of 5 U.S.C. chapters 51 and 53, the minimum rate of the rate range (excluding locality pay) must be at least equal to the minimum rate for the SES and SL/ST pay systems (120 percent of the rate for GS-15, step 1, excluding locality pay), and the maximum rate of the rate range (excluding locality pay) must be at least equal to the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule;
(2) Covered positions are equivalent to a “Senior Executive Service position” as defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(2), a senior-level position (
i.e.
, a non-executive position that is classified above GS-15, such as a high-level special assistant or a senior attorney in a highly-specialized field who is not a manager, supervisor, or policy advisor), or a scientific or professional position as described in 5 U.S.C. 3104; and
(3) Covered positions are subject to a performance appraisal system established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 and 5 CFR part 430, subparts B and C, or other applicable legal authority, for planning, monitoring, developing, evaluating, and rewarding employee performance.
(c) If OPM approves an agency's request to cover additional categories of employees, the higher annual leave accrual rate will become effective for the pay period during which OPM approves the agency's request. Agencies must credit annual leave at the 8-hour accrual rate for affected employees who are employed for the full pay period.
(d) An employee who moves to a position not covered by this section will no longer be entitled to the higher annual leave accrual rate established under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, except as provided in 5 U.S.C. 6303(a). Upon movement to a noncovered position, an employee's annual leave accrual rate must be determined based on his or her years of creditable service, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 6303(a).
(e) Unused annual leave accrued by an employee while serving in a position subject to one of the pay systems under 5 U.S.C. 5383 (Senior Executive Service) or 5 U.S.C. 5376 (Senior-Level and Scientific or Professional) or 10 U.S.C. 1607(a) (Intelligence Senior Level), shall accumulate for use in succeeding years until it totals not more than 90 days (720 hours) at the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period (or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods) occurring in a calendar year.
(f) When an employee in a position outside of those listed in paragraph (e) of this section moves to a position covered by paragraph (e) of this section, any annual leave accumulated prior to movement shall remain to the employee's credit.
(1) Annual leave accumulated prior to movement to a position covered by paragraph (e) of this section that is in excess of the amount allowed for the former position by 5 U.S.C. 6304(a), (b), or (c) and that is not used by the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period in the next leave year shall be subject to forfeiture.
(2) If an employee serves less than a full pay period in a position listed in paragraph (e) of this section, only that portion of accrued annual leave that is attributable to service in such a position shall be subject to the 90-day (720-hour) limitation on accumulation of annual leave. Annual leave accrued during the remainder of the pay period shall be subject to the limitations in 5 U.S.C. 6304(a), (b), and (c), as appropriate.
(g) When an employee covered by paragraph (e) of this section moves to a position not covered by paragraph (e) of this section, any annual leave accumulated while serving in the former position that is in excess of the amount allowed for the position by 5 U.S.C. 6304(a), (b), or (c) shall remain to the employee's credit and shall be subject to reduction under procedures identical to those described in 5 U.S.C. 6304(c).
(h) An employee in the Senior Executive Service who, as of the first day of the first pay period beginning after October 13, 1994, has accumulated annual
leave in excess of 90 days (720 hours) is entitled to retain that leave as a personal leave ceiling. The leave shall be credited to the employee and shall be subject to reduction in the following manner:
(1) Annual leave credited to an employee shall be based on the amount of annual leave accumulated by the employee as of the end of the pay period preceding the first pay period beginning after October 13, 1994. The credited leave shall exclude—
(i) Any annual leave restored to the employee under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d); and
(ii) Any annual leave advanced to the employee under 5 U.S.C. 6302(d) that had not yet been earned.
(2) Annual leave credited to an employee that is in excess of 90 days (720 hours) shall be subject to reduction in the same manner as provided in 5 U.S.C. 6304(c) until the employee's accumulated annual leave is equal to or less than 90 days (720 hours). For the 1994 leave year, 5 U.S.C. 6304(c) shall be applied only for leave earned and used between the start of the first pay period beginning after October 13, 1994, and the end of the 1994 leave year.
(i) Agencies shall notify affected employees and maintain records on the accumulated annual leave credited to each employee under paragraph (h) of this section and on any reductions in the credited annual leave made under 5 U.S.C. 6304(c). If the employee transfers to another agency, such records shall be provided to the gaining agency.

§ 630.302
Maximum annual leave accumulation—forty-five day limitation.
(a) The effective date on which an employee (otherwise eligible thereunder) becomes subject to section 6304(b) of title 5, United States Code, is the:
(1) Date of his entry on duty when he is employed locally;
(2) Date of his arrival at a post of regular assignment for duty; or
(3) Date on which he begins to perform duty in an area outside the United States and the area of recruitment or from which transferred, when the employee is required to perform duty en route to his post of regular assignment for duty.
(b) Subject to section 6304(c) of title 5, United States Code, the maximum amount of annual leave that may be carried forward into the next leave year by an employee who is transferred or reassigned to a position in which he is no longer subject to section 6304(b) of that title is determined as follows:
(1) When, on the date prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section, the amount of an employee's accumulated and accrued annual leave is 30 days or less, he may carry forward the amount prescribed by section 6304(a) of title 5, United States Code;
(2) When, on the date prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section, the amount of an employee's accumulated and accrued annual leave is more than 30 days but not more than 45 days, he may carry forward the full amount thereof that is unused at the end of the current leave year;
(3) When, on the date prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section, the amount of an employee's accumulated and accrued annual leave is more than 45 days, he may carry forward the amount of unused annual leave to his credit at the end of the current leave year that does not exceed:
(i) 45 days, if he is not entitled to a greater accumulation under section 6304(c) of title 5, United States Code; or
(ii) The amount he is entitled to accumulate under section 6304(c) of that title, if that amount is greater than 45 days.
(c) For the purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, an agency shall determine the amount of an employee's accumulated and accrued annual leave at the end of the pay period which includes:
(1) The date on which the employee departs from his post of regular assignment for transfer or reassignment, except that when the employee is required to perform duty en route in an area in which he would be subject to section 6304(b) of title 5, United States Code, if assigned there, it is the date on which he ceases to perform the duty; or
(2) The date on which final administrative approval is given to effect a change in the employee's duty station
when he is on detail or leave in the United States, or in an area (the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or a territory or possession of the United States) from which he was recruited or transferred.
§ 630.303
Part-time employees; earnings.
A part-time employee for whom there has been established in advance a regular tour of duty on 1 or more days during each administrative workweek, and a part-time employee on a flexible work schedule for whom there has been established only a biweekly work requirement, earn annual leave as follows:
(a) An employee with less than 3 years of service earns 1 hour of annual leave for each 20 hours in a pay status.
(b) An employee with 3 but less than 15 years of service earns 1 hour of annual leave for each 13 hours in a pay status.
(c) An employee with 15 years or more of service earns 1 hour of annual leave for each 10 hours in a pay status.

§ 630.305
Designating agency official to approve exigencies.
Before annual leave may be restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304, the determination that an exigency is of major importance and that therefore annual leave may not be used by employees to avoid forfeiture must be made by the head of the agency or someone designated to act for him or her on this matter. Except where made by the head of the agency, the determination may not be made by any official whose leave would be affected by the decision.
[53 FR 42933, Oct. 25, 1988]
§ 630.306
Time limit for use of restored annual leave.
(a) Except as otherwise authorized under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, § 630.310(d), or other regulation, annual leave restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d) must be scheduled and used not later than the end of the leave year ending 2 years after:
(1) The date of restoration of the annual leave forfeited because of administrative error; or
(2) The date fixed by the agency head, or his or her designee, as the termination date of the exigency of the public business that resulted in forfeiture of the annual leave; or
(3) The date the employee is determined to be recovered and able to return to duty if the leave was forfeited because of sickness.
(b) Annual leave restored to an employee under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) must be scheduled and used within the time limits prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section:
(1) A full-time employee shall schedule and use excess annual leave of 416 hours or less by the end of the leave year in progress 2 years after the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). The agency shall extend this period by 1 leave year for each additional 208 hours of excess annual leave or any portion thereof.
(2) A part-time employee shall schedule and use excess annual leave in an amount equal to or less than 20 percent of the number of hours in the employee's scheduled annual tour of duty by the end of the leave year in progress 2 years after the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). The agency shall extend this period by 1 leave year for each additional number of hours of excess annual leave, or any portion thereof, equal to 10 percent of the number of hours in the employee's scheduled annual tour of duty.
(c) The time limits established under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for using restored annual leave accounts shall not apply for the entire period during which an employee is subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). When coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) ends, a new time limit shall be established under paragraph (b) of this section for
all annual leave restored to an employee under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d).

Scheduling of annual leave.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section and § 630.310, before annual leave forfeited under 5 U.S.C. 6304 may be considered for restoration under that section, use of the annual leave must have been scheduled in writing before the start of the third biweekly pay period prior to the end of the leave year.
(b) The requirement for advance scheduling of annual leave in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to an employee who is covered by 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). When coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) terminates during a leave year, the employee shall make a reasonable effort to comply with the scheduling requirement in paragraph (a) of this section. The head of the agency or his or her designee may exempt employees from the advance scheduling requirement in paragraph (a) of this section if coverage under 6304(d)(3) terminated during the leave year and the employee was unable to comply with the advance scheduling requirement due to circumstances beyond his or her control.

(a)(1) The Director of OPM may deem a specific national emergency declared by the President under the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601,
et seq.
) to be an exigency of the public business for the purpose of restoring forfeited annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(1)(B) and will notify agencies in writing when this decision is made.
(2) The head of each agency is responsible for the proper administration of this authority. All heads of agencies are required to establish and periodically update (as necessary) procedures to administer this authority so that these policies are in place and immediately available for use any time the Director of OPM notifies agencies of a determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(b)(1) Once the Director of OPM has issued a notification to agencies under paragraph (a)(1), the head of each agency (or designee) must, in his or her sole and exclusive discretion, do the following:
(i) Make determinations identifying the specific employees or groups of employees who are performing services that are essential in responding to the national emergency designated as an exigency of the public business and who are thus qualified for coverage under this section; and
(ii) Inform covered employees in writing of any such determination and its application to them.
(2) A determination under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section may not be made by any official whose leave would be affected by the determination.
(c) For any employee determined under paragraph (b) of this section to be covered under this section who forfeits annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(1)(B) at the beginning of a leave year, the forfeited annual leave is deemed to have been scheduled in advance for the purpose of 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(1)(B) and § 630.308.
(d) With respect to annual leave forfeited under paragraph (c) of this section, the annual leave must be restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(1)(B) subject to the following time limits:
(1) A full-time employee must schedule and use excess annual leave of 416 hours or less by the end of the leave year in progress 2 years after the date fixed by the agency head (or designee) under paragraph (f)(2) of this section as the termination date of the exigency of the public business. The agency must extend this period by 1 leave year for each additional 208 hours of excess annual leave or any portion thereof.

# Note 1 to paragraph (
d

# )(1):
For an employee on an uncommon tour of duty, the conversion rules in § 630.210(d) regarding the referenced number of hours for full-time employees (416 hours and 208 hours) must be applied.
(2) A part-time employee must schedule and use excess annual leave in an amount equal to or less than 20 percent of the number of hours in the employee's scheduled annual tour of duty by the end of the leave year in progress 2 years after the date fixed by the agency head (or designee) under paragraph (f)(2) of this section as the termination date of the exigency of the public business. The agency must extend this period by 1 leave year for each additional number of hours of excess annual leave, or any portion thereof, equal to 10 percent of the number of hours in the employee's scheduled annual tour of duty.
(e) The time limits established under paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section for using restored annual leave accounts shall not apply for the entire period during which an employee's services are determined by the agency to be essential for the response to the national emergency. When coverage under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section ends due to the termination date of the exigency of the public business fixed by the agency under paragraph (f)(2), a new time limit will be established under paragraph (d) of this section for all annual leave restored to an employee under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d).
(f)(1) The agency head (or designee) must continually monitor the agency response to the national emergency and determine whether the services of individual employees or groups of employees continue to be essential for the response to the emergency such that annual leave may not be scheduled according to the normal procedures described in § 630.308(a).
(2) The agency head (or designee) must fix a date as the termination date of the exigency of the public business for each employee or group of employees as provided in this paragraph. The exigency of the public business as it affects an individual employee or group of employees must be terminated on the date one of the following events occurs, whichever is earliest:
(i) When the President declares an end to the national emergency;
(ii) When the Director of OPM deems the national emergency to no longer be an exigency of the public business for purposes of this authority;
(iii) When the agency head (or designee), in his or her sole and exclusive discretion, determines that the services of an employee or group of employees are no longer essential to the response to the national emergency or that such employees are able to follow the normal leave scheduling procedures in § 630.308(a);
(iv) On the day that is 12 months after the national emergency has been declared, an agency head (or designee), in his or her sole and exclusive discretion, may extend this deadline annually by an additional 12 months; under no circumstances may an agency grant more than two 12-month extensions under this paragraph in connection with any national emergency (however, § 630.309 may apply in the case of an extended exigency); or
(v) When an employee whose services were determined to be essential during the national emergency moves to a position not involving services determined by the agency to be essential to the response to the national emergency.
(3) The agency head (or designee) must inform both the affected employees and the agency payroll provider in writing of the termination date as determined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
(g) When the agency head (or designee) fixes a termination date of the exigency of the public business under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, each affected employee must make a reasonable effort to comply with the scheduling requirement in § 630.308(a). The head of the agency (or designee), in his or her sole and exclusive discretion, may exempt such an employee or group of employees from the advanced scheduling requirement in § 630.308(a) for the remainder of the leave year if coverage under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section terminates during that leave year and if the agency head (or designee) determines such exemption is warranted. The agency head (or designee) must notify any employee exempted from the scheduling requirement in writing.
(h)(1) Upon termination of an exigency established under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section based on the ending of the exigency under paragraphs (f)(2)(i), (ii), or (iv) of this section, an agency head (or designee) may determine that certain agency employees continue to be subject to an ongoing exigency of the public business. An ongoing exigency of the public business is an exigency that commences immediately after the termination of a national emergency exigency and is directly related to the matter that was previously determined to be a national emergency exigency. In order for an employee to be covered under an ongoing exigency, the employee must first be covered by a national emergency exigency and then be covered by the ongoing exigency without a break in time.
(2) For the entire period during which an employee is covered by such an ongoing exigency, the employee will not be subject to time limits on usage of any restored leave to the employee's credit under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d), including a time limit established under paragraph (d) of this section that is determined based on the termination of the national emergency exigency. When the ongoing exigency ends, all restored annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d) to the employee's credit must be consolidated at that time and made subject to a single time limit that is determined under the rules in paragraph (d) of this section, using the termination date of the ongoing exigency in place of the termination date of the national emergency exigency.
(3) For the entire period during which an employee is covered by such an ongoing exigency, the employee will not be subject to the advance scheduling requirements in § 630.308(a). An agency head (or designee), in his or her sole and exclusive discretion, may exempt an employee or group of employees from the advanced scheduling requirement in § 630.308(a) for the remainder of the leave year if coverage under the ongoing exigency terminates during that leave year and if the agency head (or designee) determines such exemption is warranted. The agency head (or designee) must notify any employee exempted from the scheduling requirement in writing.
(4) Employee coverage under such an ongoing exigency may not be continued for more than 12 months unless the agency head (or designee) requests, and the Director of OPM approves, one or more time-limited waivers based on a critical agency need for the services of the employee or group of employees.
(5) Notwithstanding paragraph (h)(2) of this section, if an ongoing exigency (which excludes time covered by the preceding national emergency exigency) also qualifies as an extended exigency under § 630.309, the time limit for use of the restored leave under paragraph (a) of that section must be applied to the consolidated restored leave.
(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(2)(iv), an agency extension granted through March 13, 2023, under that paragraph for an exigency established under this section based on the COVID-19 national emergency declared on
March 13, 2020, must be deemed to continue through the date that the President ends that national emergency.

(5) Would, as determined by the health authorities having jurisdiction or by a health care provider, jeopardize the health of others by his or her presence on the job because of exposure to a communicable disease; or

(c) The amount of sick leave granted to an employee during any leave year for the purposes described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section may not exceed a total of 480 hours (or, for a part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, an amount of sick leave equal to 12 times the average number of hours in his or her scheduled tour of duty each week), subject to the limitation found in paragraph (d) of this section.

§ 630.405
Supporting evidence for the use of sick leave.

(b) An employee must provide administratively acceptable evidence or medical certification for a request for sick leave no later than 15 calendar days after the date the agency requests such
medical certification. If it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to provide the requested evidence or medical certification within 15 calendar days after the date requested by the agency despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts, the employee must provide the evidence or medical certification within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances involved, but no later than 30 calendar days after the date the agency requests such documentation. An employee who does not provide the required evidence or medical certification within the specified time period is not entitled to sick leave.
(c) An agency may require an employee requesting sick leave to care for a family member under § 630.401(a)(3)(ii) to provide an additional written statement from the health care provider concerning the family member's need for psychological comfort and/or physical care.

(1) The family member requires psychological comfort and/or physical care;
(2) The family member would benefit from the employee's care or presence; and
(3) The employee is needed to care for the family member for a specified period of time.

(b) When an employee moves between different home leave-earning rates during a month of service abroad, or when a change in the differential during a month of service abroad results in a different home leave-earning rate, the agency shall credit the employee with the amount of home leave for the month at the rate to which he was entitled before the change in his home leave-earning rate.
§ 630.606
Grant of home leave.
(a)
Entitlement.
Except as otherwise authorized by statute, an employee is entitled to home leave only when he has completed a basic service period of 24 months of continuous service abroad. This basic service period is terminated by (1) a break in service of 1 or more workdays, or (2) an assignment (other than a detail) to a position in which an employee is no longer subject to section 6305(a) of title 5, United States Code.
(b)
Agency authority.
A grant of home leave is at the discretion of an agency. An agency may grant home leave in combination with other leaves of absence in accordance with established agency policy.
(c)
Limitations.
An agency may grant home leave only:
(1) For use in the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory or possession of the United States; and
(2) During an employee's period of service abroad, or within a reasonable period after his return from service abroad when it is contemplated that he will return to service abroad immediately or on completion of an assignment in the United States.

(1) The name, position title, and grade or pay level of the potential emergency leave recipient;
(2) A statement describing his or her need for leave from the emergency leave transfer program; and
(3) Any additional information that may be required by the potential leave recipient's employing agency.
(e) An agency may determine a time period by which an employee must apply to become an emergency leave recipient after the occurrence of a disaster or emergency, as defined in § 630.1102.
§ 630.1106
Agency review of an application to become an emergency leave recipient.
An agency must review an application to become an emergency leave recipient under procedures the agency has established for the purpose of determining that a potential leave recipient is or has been affected by a disaster or emergency, as defined in § 630.1102.
§ 630.1107
Notification of approval or disapproval of an application to become an emergency leave recipient.
Once the employee's application to become an emergency leave recipient is either approved or disapproved, the agency must notify the employee (or his or her personal representative who made application on the employee's behalf) within 10 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the date the application was received (or the date established by the agency, if that date is later). If disapproved, the agency must give the reason for its disapproval.
§ 630.1108
Use of available paid leave.
An approved emergency leave recipient is not required to exhaust his or her accrued annual and sick leave before receiving donated leave under the emergency leave transfer program and the recipient is eligible to be placed in a paid leave status using transferred annual leave.
§ 630.1109
Donating annual leave.
An employee may voluntarily submit a written request to his or her agency that a specified number of hours of his or her accrued annual leave, consistent with the limitations in § 630.1110, be transferred from his or her annual leave account to an emergency leave transfer program established under § 630.1103. An emergency leave donor may not donate annual leave for transfer to a specific emergency leave recipient under this subpart. Donated annual leave not used by an emergency leave recipient must be returned to the emergency leave donor(s) and/or leave banks as provided in § 630.1117.
§ 630.1110
Limitation on the amount of annual leave donated by an emergency leave donor.
(a) An emergency leave donor may not contribute less than 1 hour or more than 104 hours of annual leave in a leave year to an emergency leave
transfer program. Each agency may establish written criteria for waiving the 104-hour limitation on donating annual leave in a leave year.
(b) Annual leave donated to an emergency leave transfer program may not be applied against the limitations on the donation of annual leave under the voluntary leave transfer or leave bank programs established under 5 U.S.C. 6332 and 6362, respectively.
§ 630.1111
Limitation on the amount of donated annual leave received by an emergency leave recipient.
An emergency leave recipient may receive a maximum of 240 hours of donated annual leave at any one time from an emergency leave transfer program for each disaster or emergency. After taking into consideration the amount of donated annual leave available to all approved emergency leave recipients and the needs of individual emergency leave recipients, an employing agency may allow an employee to receive additional disbursements of donated annual leave based on the employee's continuing need. Each disbursement of transferred annual leave may not exceed 240 hours.
§ 630.1112
Transferring donated annual leave between agencies.
(a) If an agency does not receive sufficient amounts of donated annual leave to meet the needs of approved emergency leave recipients within the agency, the agency may contact OPM to obtain assistance in receiving donated annual leave from other agencies. The agency must notify OPM of the total amount of donated annual leave needed for transfer to the agency's approved emergency leave recipients. OPM will solicit and coordinate the transfer of donated annual leave from other Federal agencies to affected agencies who may have a shortfall of donated annual leave. OPM will determine the period of time for which donations of accrued annual leave may be accepted for transfer to affected agencies.
(b) Each Federal agency OPM contacts for the purpose of providing donated annual leave to an agency in need must—
(1) Approve emergency leave donors under the conditions specified in §§ 630.1109 and 630.1110 and determine how much donated annual leave is available for transfer to an affected agency;
(2) Maintain records on the amount of annual leave donated by each emergency leave donor to the emergency leave transfer program (for the purpose of restoring unused transferred annual leave under § 630.1117(b)).
(3) Report the total amount of annual leave donated to the emergency leave transfer program to OPM; and
(4) When OPM has accepted the donated annual leave, debit the amount of annual leave donated to the emergency leave transfer program from each emergency leave donor's annual leave account.
(c) OPM will notify each affected agency of the aggregate amount of donated annual leave that will be credited to it for transfer to its approved emergency leave recipient(s). The affected agency will determine the amount of donated annual leave to be transferred to each emergency leave recipient (an amount that may vary according to individual needs).
(d) The affected agency must credit the annual leave account of each approved emergency leave recipient as soon as possible after the date OPM notifies the agency of the amount of donated annual leave that will be credited to the agency under paragraph (c) of this section.
§ 630.1113
Using donated annual leave.
(a) Any donated annual leave an emergency leave recipient receives from an emergency leave transfer program may be used only for purposes related to the disaster or emergency for which the emergency leave recipient was approved. Each agency is responsible for ensuring that annual leave donated under the emergency leave transfer program is used appropriately.
(b) Annual leave transferred under this subpart may be—
(1) Substituted retroactively for any period of leave without pay used because of the adverse effects of the disaster or emergency; or
(2) Used to liquidate an indebtedness incurred by the emergency leave recipient for advanced annual or sick leave used because of the adverse effects of the disaster or emergency. The agency may advance annual or sick leave, as appropriate (even if the employee has available annual and sick leave), so that the emergency leave recipient is not forced to use his or her accrued leave before donated annual leave becomes available.
§ 630.1114
Accrual of leave while using donated annual leave.
While an emergency leave recipient is using donated annual leave from an emergency leave transfer program, annual and sick leave continue to accrue to the credit of the employee at the same rate as if he or she were in a paid leave status under 5 U.S.C. chapter 63, subchapter I, and will be subject to the limitations imposed by 5 U.S.C. 6304(a), (b), (c), and (f) at the end of the leave year in which the transferred annual leave is received.
§ 630.1115
Limitations on the use of donated annual leave.
Donated annual leave transferred to a leave recipient under this subpart may not be—
(a) Included in a lump-sum payment under 5 U.S.C. 5551 or 5552;
(b) Recredited to a former employee who is reemployed by a Federal agency; or
(c) Used to establish initial eligibility for immediate retirement or acquire eligibility to continue health benefits into retirement under 5 U.S.C. 6302(g).
§ 630.1116
Termination of a disaster or emergency.
The disaster or emergency affecting the employee as an emergency leave recipient terminates at the earliest occurrence of the following conditions.
(a) When the employing agency determines that the disaster or emergency has terminated;
(b) When the employee's Federal service terminates;
(c) At the end of the biweekly pay period in which the employee, or his or her personal representative, notifies the emergency leave recipient's agency that he or she is no longer affected by such disaster or emergency;
(d) At the end of the biweekly pay period in which the employee's agency determines, after giving the employee or his or her personal representative written notice and an opportunity to answer orally or in writing, that the employee is no longer affected by such disaster or emergency; or
(e) At the end of the biweekly pay period in which the employee's agency receives notice that OPM has approved an application for disability retirement for the emergency leave recipient under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees' Retirement System, as appropriate.
§ 630.1117
Procedures for returning unused donated annual leave to emergency leave donors and leave banks.
(a) When a disaster or emergency is terminated, any unused annual leave donated to the emergency leave transfer program must be returned by the employing agency to the emergency leave donors, and if annual leave was donated by any leave bank(s) it must be returned to the leave bank(s).
(b) Each agency must determine the amount of annual leave to be restored to any leave bank and/or to each of the emergency leave donors who, on the date leave restoration is made, is employed in the Federal service. The amount of unused annual leave to be returned to each emergency leave donor and/or leave bank must be proportional to the amount of annual leave donated by the employee or the leave bank to the emergency leave transfer program for such disaster or emergency, and must be returned according to the procedures outlined in § 630.911(b). Any unused annual leave remaining after the distribution will be subject to forfeiture.
(c) Annual leave donated to an emergency leave transfer program for a specific disaster or emergency may not be transferred to another emergency leave transfer program established for a different disaster or emergency.
(d) At the election of the emergency leave donor, the employee may choose
to have the agency restore unused donated annual leave by crediting the restored annual leave to the emergency leave donor's annual leave account in either the current leave year or the first pay period of the following leave year.
§ 630.1118
Protection against coercion.
(a) An employee may not directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten, or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, any emergency leave donor or emergency leave recipient for the purpose of interfering with any right such employee may have with respect to donating, receiving, or using annual leave under this subpart.
(b) For the purpose of paragraph (a) of this section, the term “intimidate, threaten, or coerce” includes promising to confer or conferring any benefit (such as appointment or promotion or compensation) or effecting or threatening to effect any reprisal (such as deprivation of appointment, promotion, or compensation).

The condition is covered even if the affected individual does not receive active treatment from a health care provider during the period of incapacity or the period of incapacity does not last more than 3 consecutive calendar days.
(D) A period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective.

Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common cold, the flu, earaches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches (other than migraines), routine dental or orthodontia problems, and periodontal disease are not serious health conditions. Allergies, restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury, removal of cancerous growth, or mental illness resulting from stress may be serious health conditions only if such conditions require inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care provider.)

§ 630.1203
Leave entitlement.
(a) An employee shall be entitled to a total of 12 administrative workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for one or more of the following reasons:
(1) The birth of a son or daughter of the employee and the care of such son or daughter;
(2) The placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care and the care of such son or daughter.

(5) Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on covered active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty) in the Armed Forces.
(b) An employee must invoke his or her entitlement to family and medical leave under paragraph (a) of this section, subject to the notification and medical certification requirements in §§ 630.1207 and 630.1208. An employee may not retroactively invoke his or her entitlement to family and medical leave. However, if an employee and his or her personal representative are physically or mentally incapable of invoking the employee's entitlement to FMLA leave
during the entire period
in which the employee is absent from work for an FMLA-qualifying purpose under paragraph (a) of this section, the employee may retroactively invoke his or her entitlement to FMLA leave within 5 workdays after returning to work. In such cases, the incapacity of the employee must be documented by a written medical certification from a health care provider. In addition, the employee must provide documentation acceptable to the agency explaining the inability of his or her personal representative to contact the agency and invoke the employee's entitlement to FMLA leave during the entire period in which the employee was absent from work for an FMLA-qualifying purpose. An employee may take only the amount of family and medical leave that is necessary to manage the circumstances that prompted the need for leave under paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) The 12-month period referred to in paragraph (a) of this section begins on the date an employee first takes leave for a family or medical need specified in paragraph (a) of this section and continues for 12 months. An employee is not entitled to 12 additional workweeks of leave until the previous 12-month period ends and an event or situation occurs that entitles the employee to another period of family or medical leave. (This may include a continuation of a previous situation or circumstance.)
(d)(1) The entitlement to leave under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section shall expire at the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date of birth or placement. Leave for a birth or placement must be concluded within this 12-month period.
(2)(i) Leave taken under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, may begin prior to the actual date of birth or placement for adoption or foster care.
(ii) Use of leave under paragraph (a)(1) of this section before the date of birth is limited to situations in which an employee is using the leave—
(A) Because of the employee's serious health condition related to the anticipated event of the employee giving birth to a son or daughter; or
(B) In order to care for the birth mother of the employee's expected son or daughter in connection with the birth mother's serious health condition related to pregnancy.
(iii) Use of leave under paragraph (a)(2) before the date of placement is limited to situations in which the employee must be absent to engage in activities necessary to allow an anticipated adoption or a foster care arrangement to proceed.
(e)(1) Family and medical leave under this subpart is available to full-time and part-time employees. The entitlement to a total of 12 administrative workweeks of leave in connection with leave granted under paragraph (a) of this section must be converted to hours or days, as provided in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section. Leave under paragraph (a) allows an employee to be absent during the employee's scheduled tour of duty established
for leave charging purposes. Such leave is not applied to days designated as holidays and other nonworkdays when the employee would be excused from duty.
(2) For employees who are charged leave on an hourly basis (including fractions of an hour), the 12 administrative workweeks referenced in paragraph (a) of this section must be converted to hours based on the number of hours in the employee's scheduled tour of duty (at the time the 12-month period of leave eligibility commences) subject to the following rules:
(i) For a regular full-time employee with 80 hours in the scheduled tour of duty over a biweekly pay period, the hours equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks is 480 hours.
(ii) For a full-time employee with an uncommon tour of duty (as defined in § 630.201 and described in § 630.210), the hours equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks is derived by multiplying 6 times the number of hours in the employee's biweekly scheduled tour of duty (or 6 times the average hours if the biweekly tour hours vary over an established cycle). For example, if an employee has an uncommon tour consisting of six 24-hour shifts (144 hours) per biweekly pay period, the amount would be 864 hours.
(iii) For a part-time employee, the hours equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks is derived by multiplying 6 times the number of hours in the employee's scheduled tour of duty over a biweekly pay period. For example, if an employee has a part-time scheduled tour of duty that consists of 40 hours in a biweekly pay period, the amount would be 240 hours.
(3) For employees who are charged leave on a daily basis, the days equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks must be derived based on the average number of workdays in the employee's established tour of duty over a biweekly pay period. For example, if an employee had 8 workdays each biweekly pay period, the days equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks would be 48 days.
(f) If there is a change in an employee's scheduled tour of duty during any 12-month period that commenced due to use of family and medical leave, and the employee has not used the full allotment of family and medical leave during such 12-month period, the remaining balance of family and medical leave must be recalculated based on the change in the number of average hours in the employee's scheduled tour of duty. For example, if a regular full-time employee has a balance of 120 hours of unused family and medical leave for a 12-month period that is in progress and then converts to a part-time schedule of 20 hours per week, the balance would be recalculated to be 60 hours. (Since the old schedule was 80 hours biweekly or an average of 40 hours weekly, the new part-time tour is half of the former full-time tour. 40/80 times 120 equals 60.)
(g) Leave taken because of the birth of a son or daughter of the employee, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, includes leave necessary for an employee who is the birth mother to recover from giving birth, or for an employee who is the other parent to care for the birth mother during her recovery period, even if the employee is not involved in caring for the son or daughter during portions of that recovery period.
(h) An agency may not put an employee on family and medical leave and may not subtract leave from an employee's entitlement to leave under paragraph (a) of this section unless the agency has obtained confirmation from the employee of his or her intent to invoke entitlement to leave under paragraph (b) of this section. An employee's notice of his or her intent to take leave under § 630.1207 may suffice as the employee's confirmation.
(i) Leave taken in order to care for a newly born or placed son or daughter, as described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, generally refers to leave covering periods when the parent-employee is in the home with the child or is otherwise involved in spending time with the child (bonding). It may include short periods away from the child's physical presence to purchase supplies needed to care for the child (e.g., buying baby food, diapers, or other supplies). Leave based on the “care” language in paragraph (a)(1) of this section would not be appropriate if
an employee is not engaged in activities directly connected to care of the child—for example, if the employee is physically located outside the local geographic area where the child is located.
(j)(1) For family and medical leave granted in connection with care of a covered servicemember under 5 U.S.C. 6382(a)(3) and (4), the leave entitlement is 26 administrative workweeks in a single 12-month period. This leave applies to an employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered servicemember and who provides care for the covered servicemember. In applying this leave, the definitions in 5 U.S.C. 6381(8) through (12) must be applied.
(2) The entitlement of 26 administrative workweeks of leave described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section must be converted to hours or days, consistent with the methodologies set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. Any recalculation of the unused leave entitlement due to a change in the employee's scheduled tour of duty must be made in a manner consistent with the methodology described in paragraph (f) of this section.
(3) If an employee receives leave under this paragraph (j) and leave under paragraph (a) of this section during the single 12-month period, the combined amount of leave in that period may not exceed 26 administrative workweeks. With respect to the single 12-month period, an employee who uses more than 14 weeks of leave under this paragraph (j) will not be able to use the full allotment of 12 administrative workweeks in connection with leave granted under paragraph (a) of this section. The leave granted under this paragraph (j) will not count against the employee's 12-week FMLA entitlement in any other 12-month period, as established under paragraph (a) of this section. For example, consider an employee who invokes family and medical leave to care for a covered servicemember and uses 16 weeks of such leave starting on August 15, 2022. If the same employee gave birth to a child on October 7, 2022, the employee would be able to use only 10 weeks of family and medical leave under § 630.1203(a)(1) during the single 12-month period from August 15, 2022, to August 14, 2023, since there is a 26-week limit for that single 12-month period. That would also limit the employee to no more than 10 weeks of paid parental leave during that single 12-month period. However, the employee would be able to use family and medical leave under § 630.1203(a)(1) after August 14, 2023, and before the expiration of the 12-month period following the birth on October 6, 2023, and could substitute (to the extent possible) any remaining amount of the employee's 12 weeks of paid parental leave, or substitute annual leave or sick leave, if applicable.
(4) In addressing requests to use intermittent leave, or leave on a reduced leave schedule, in connection with leave under this paragraph (j), an agency is subject to the same rules that govern such requests for leave under paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section. (See 5 U.S.C. 6382(b) and § 630.1205.)
(5) Employees who seek to use leave under this paragraph (j) are subject to the same notification and scheduling requirements that apply to employees receiving leave under paragraph (a)(1) through (4) of this section in parallel circumstances. (See 5 U.S.C. 6382(e)(1) and (2) and § 630.1207.)
(6) An agency may require that a request for leave under this paragraph (j) be supported by a medical certification, as provided by 5 U.S.C. 6383(f).

To attend counseling provided by someone other than a health care provider for oneself, for the covered military member, or for a child as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section, provided that the need for counseling arises from the covered active duty or call to covered active duty status of a covered military member.
(6)

(8)
Additional activities.
To address other events that arise out of the covered military member's covered active duty or call to covered active duty status, provided that the agency and employee agree that such leave qualifies as an exigency, and that they agree to both the timing and duration of such leave.
(b) An employee is eligible to take FMLA leave because of a qualifying exigency when the covered military member is on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status as a member of a regular component of the Armed Forces, or when the covered military member is on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status in support of a contingency operation pursuant to one of the provisions of law identified in the definition of
covered active duty or call to covered active duty status

(c) For those called to covered active duty status in support of a contingency operation—
(1) A call to active duty for purposes of leave taken because of a qualifying exigency refers to a Federal call to active duty. State calls to active duty are not covered unless under order of the President of the United States pursuant to one of the provisions of law identified in paragraph (b) of this section in support of a contingency operation.
(2) For such members, the active duty orders of a covered military member will generally specify whether the servicemember is serving in support of a contingency operation by citation to the relevant section of title 10 of the United States Code or by reference to the specific name of the contingency operation, or both. A military operation qualifies as a contingency operation if it:
(i) Is designated by the Secretary of Defense as an operation in which members of the Armed Forces are or may become involved in military actions, operations, or hostilities against an enemy of the United States or against an opposing military force; or
(ii) Results in the call or order to, or retention on, active duty of members of the uniformed services under section 688, 12301(a), 12302, 12304, 12305, or 12406, or chapter 15 of title 10 of the United States Code, or any other provision of law during a war or during a national emergency declared by the President or Congress. (See 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13).)

§ 630.1205
Intermittent leave or reduced leave schedule.
(a) Leave under § 630.1203(a) (1) or (2) of this part shall not be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule unless the employee and the agency agree to do so.
(b) Leave under § 630.1203(a)(3) or (4) may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically necessary, subject to §§ 630.1207 and 630.1208 (b)(6). Leave under § 630.1203(a)(5) may be taken on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis, subject to §§ 630.1207 and 630.1209.
(c) If an employee takes leave under § 630.1203(a) (3) or (4) of this part intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule that is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment or recovery from a serious health condition, the agency may place the employee temporarily in an available alternative position for which the employee is qualified and that can better accommodate recurring periods of leave. Upon returning from leave, the employee is entitled to be returned to his or her permanent position or an equivalent position, as provided in § 630.1210(a) of this part.
(d) For the purpose of applying paragraph (c) of this section, an alternative position need not consist of equivalent duties, but must be in the same commuting area and must provide—
(1) An equivalent grade or pay level, including any applicable locality payment under 5 CFR part 531, subpart F; special rate supplement under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C; or similar payment or supplement under other legal authority;
(2) The same type of appointment, work schedule, status, and tenure; and
(3) The same employment benefits made available to the employee in his or her previous position (e.g., life insurance, health benefits, retirement coverage, and leave accrual).
(e) The agency shall determine the available alternative position that has equivalent pay and benefits consistent with Federal laws, including the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701) and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 2000e).
(f) Only the amount of leave taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule, as these terms are defined in § 630.1202, shall be subtracted from the total amount of leave available to the employee under § 630.1203 (e) and (f).

[85 FR 48091, Aug. 10, 2020]
§ 630.1207
Notice of leave.
(a) If leave taken under § 630.1203(a) of this part is foreseeable based on an expected birth, placement for adoption or foster care, or planned medical treatment, the employee shall provide notice to the agency of his or her intention to take leave not less than 30 calendar days before the date the leave is to begin. If the date of birth or placement or planned medical treatment requires leave to begin within 30 calendar days, the employee shall provide such notice as is practicable.
(b) If leave taken under § 630.1203(a) (3) or (4) of this part is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the employee shall consult with the agency and make a reasonable effort to schedule medical treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the agency, subject to the approval of the health care provider. The agency may, for justifiable cause, request that an employee reschedule medical treatment, subject to the approval of the health care provider.
(c) If the need for leave taken under § 630.1203(a)(5) is foreseeable, the employee must provide notice as soon as practicable, regardless of how far in advance the leave is being requested.
(d) If the need for leave is not foreseeable—e.g., a medical emergency or the unexpected availability of a child for adoption or foster care, and the employee cannot provide 30 calendar days' notice of his or her need for leave, the employee shall provide notice within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances involved. If necessary, notice may be given by an employee's personal representative (e.g., a family member or other responsible party). If the need for leave is not foreseeable and the employee is unable, due to circumstances beyond his or her control, to provide notice of his or her need for leave, the leave may not be delayed or denied.
(e) If the need for leave is foreseeable, and the employee fails to give 30 calendar days' notice with no reasonable excuse for the delay of notification, the agency may delay the taking of leave under § 630.1203(a) of this part until at least 30 calendar days after the date the employee provides notice of his or her need for family and medical leave.
(f) An agency may waive the notice requirements under paragraph (a) of this section and instead impose the agency's usual and customary policies
or procedures for providing notification of leave. The agency's policies or procedures for providing notification of leave must not be more stringent than the requirements in this section. However, an agency may not deny an employee's entitlement to leave under § 630.1203(a) of this part if the employee fails to follow such agency policies or procedures.
(g) An agency may require that a request for leave under § 630.1203(a) (1) and (2) be supported by evidence that is administratively acceptable to the agency.
[58 FR 39602, July 23, 1993, as amended at 59 FR 62274, Dec. 2, 1994; 61 FR 64453, Dec. 5, 1996; 65 FR 26487, May 8, 2000. Redesignated and amended at 76 FR 60704, 60705, Sept. 30, 2011]
§ 630.1208
Medical certification.
(a) An agency may require that a request for leave under § 630.1203(a) (3) or (4) be supported by written medical certification issued by the health care provider of the employee or the health care provider of the spouse, son, daughter, or parent of the employee, as appropriate. An agency may waive the requirement for an initial medical certificate in a subsequent 12-month period if the leave under § 630.1203(a) (3) or (4) is for the same chronic or continuing condition.
(b) The written medical certification shall include—
(1) The date the serious health condition commenced;
(2) The probable duration of the serious health condition or specify that the serious health condition is a chronic or continuing condition with an unknown duration and whether the patient is presently incapacitated and the likely duration and frequency of episodes of incapacity;
(3) The appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider regarding the serious health condition, including a general statement as to the incapacitation, examination, or treatment that may be required by a health care provider;
(4) For the purpose of leave taken under § 630.1203(a)(3) of this part—
(i) A statement from the health care provider that the spouse, son, daughter, or parent of the employee requires psychological comfort and/or physical care; needs assistance for basic medical, hygienic, nutritional, safety, or transportation needs or in making arrangements to meet such needs; and would benefit from the employee's care or presence; and
(ii) A statement from the employee on the care he or she will provide and an estimate of the amount of time needed to care for his or her spouse, son, daughter, or parent;
(5) For the purpose of leave taken under § 630.1203(a)(4), a statement that the employee is unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of his or her position or requires medical treatment for a serious health condition, based on written information provided by the agency on the essential functions of the employee's position or, if not provided, discussion with the employee about the essential functions of his or her position; and
(6) In the case of certification for intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule under § 630.1203(a) (3) or (4) for planned medical treatment, the dates (actual or estimates) on which such treatment is expected to be given, the duration of such treatment, and the period of recovery, if any, or specify that the serious health condition is a chronic or continuing condition with an unknown duration and whether the patient is presently incapacitated and the likely duration and frequency of episodes of incapacity.
(c) The information on the medical certification shall relate only to the serious health condition for which the current need for family and medical leave exists. The agency may not require any personal or confidential information in the written medical certification other than that required by paragraph (b) of this section. If an employee submits a completed medical certification signed by the health care provider, the agency may not request new information from the health care provider. However, a health care provider representing the agency, including a health care provider employed by the agency or under administrative oversight of the agency, may contact the health care provider who completed
the medical certification, with the employee's permission, for purposes of clarifying the medical certification.
(d) If the agency doubts the validity of the original certification provided under paragraph (a) of this section, the agency may require, at the agency's expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a second health care provider designated or approved by the agency concerning the information certified under paragraph (b) of this section. Any health care provider designated or approved by the agency shall not be employed by the agency or be under the administrative oversight of the agency on a regular basis unless the agency is located in an area where access to health care is extremely limited—e.g., a rural area or an overseas location where no more than one or two health care providers practice in the relevant specialty, or the only health care providers available are employed by the agency.
(e) If the opinion of the second health care provider differs from the original certification provided under paragraph (a) of this section, the agency may require, at the agency's expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a third health care provider designated or approved jointly by the agency and the employee concerning the information certified under paragraph (b) of this section. The opinion of the third health care provider shall be binding on the agency and the employee.
(f) To remain entitled to family and medical leave under § 630.1203(a) (3) or (4) of this part, an employee or the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent must comply with any requirement from an agency that he or she submit to examination (though not treatment) to obtain a second or third medical certification from a health care provider other than the individual's health care provider.
(g) If the employee is unable to provide the requested medical certification before leave begins, or if the agency questions the validity of the original certification provided by the employee and the medical treatment requires the leave to begin, the agency shall grant provisional leave pending final written medical certification.
(h) An employee must provide the written medical certification required by paragraphs (a), (d), (e), and (g) of this section, signed by the health care provider, no later than 15 calendar days after the date the agency requests such medical certification. If it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to provide the requested medical certification no later than 15 calendar days after the date requested by the agency despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts, the employee must provide the medical certification within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances involved, but no later than 30 calendar days after the date the agency requests such medical certification.
(i) If, after the leave has commenced, the employee fails to provide the requested medical certification, the agency may—
(1) Charge the employee as absent without leave (AWOL); or
(2) Allow the employee to request that the provisional leave be charged as leave without pay or charged to the employee's annual and/or sick leave account, as appropriate.
(j) At its own expense, an agency may require subsequent medical recertification on a periodic basis, but not more than once every 30 calendar days, for leave taken for purposes relating to pregnancy, chronic conditions, or long-term conditions, as these terms are used in the definition of
serious health condition
in § 630.1202. For leave taken for all other serious health conditions and including leave taken on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule, if the health care provider has specified on the medical certification a minimum duration of the period of incapacity, the agency may not request recertification until that period has passed. An agency may require subsequent medical recertification more frequently than every 30 calendar days, or more frequently than the minimum duration of the period of incapacity specified on the medical certification, if the employee requests that the original leave period be extended, the circumstances described in the original medical certification have changed significantly, or the agency receives information that casts doubt upon the
continuing validity of the medical certification.
(k) To ensure the security and confidentiality of any written medical certification under § 630.1208 or 630.1210(h) of this part, the medical certification is subject to the provisions for safeguarding information about individuals under subpart A of part 293 of this chapter.

§ 630.1209
Certification for leave taken because of a qualifying exigency.
(a)
Active duty orders.
The first time an employee requests leave because of a qualifying exigency arising out of the covered active duty or call to covered active duty status of a covered military member, an agency may require the employee to provide a copy of the covered military member's active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military that indicates the covered military member is on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status, and the dates of the covered military member's active duty service. This information need only be provided to the agency once. A copy of new active duty orders or other documentation issued by the military must be provided to the agency if the need for leave because of a qualifying exigency arises out of a different covered active duty or call to covered active duty status of the same or a different covered military member.
(b)
Required information.
An agency may require that leave for any qualifying exigency specified in § 630.1204 be supported by a certification from the employee that sets forth the following information:
(1) A statement or description, signed by the employee, of appropriate facts regarding the qualifying exigency for which FMLA leave is requested. The facts must be sufficient to support the need for leave. Such facts include the type of qualifying exigency for which leave is requested and any available written documentation that supports the request for leave, such as a copy of a meeting announcement for informational briefings sponsored by the military, a document confirming an appointment with a counselor or school official, or a copy of a bill for services for the handling of legal or financial affairs;
(2) The approximate date on which the qualifying exigency commenced or will commence;
(3) If an employee requests leave because of a qualifying exigency for a single, continuous period of time, the beginning and end dates for such absence;
(4) If an employee requests leave because of a qualifying exigency on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis, an estimate of the frequency and duration of the qualifying exigency; and
(5) If the qualifying exigency involves meeting with a third party, appropriate contact information for the individual or entity with whom the employee is meeting (such as the name, title, organization, address, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address) and a brief description of the purpose of the meeting.
(c)
Verification.
If an employee submits a complete and sufficient certification to support his or her request for leave because of a qualifying exigency, the agency may not request additional information from the employee. However, the agency may verify the information described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section and does not need the employee's permission to do so.
(1) If the qualifying exigency involves meeting with a third party, the agency may contact the individual or entity with whom the employee is meeting for purposes of verifying a meeting or appointment schedule and verifying the information provided in the employee's statement under paragraph (b)(1) of this section regarding the meeting between the employee and the specified individual or entity. No additional information may be requested by the agency.
(2) An agency may contact an appropriate unit of the Department of Defense to request verification that a covered military member is on covered active duty or call to covered active duty
status. No additional information may be requested by the agency.
[76 FR 60705, Sept. 30, 2011]
§ 630.1210
Protection of employment and benefits.
(a) Any employee who takes leave under § 630.1203(a) of this part shall be entitled, upon return to the agency, to be returned to—
(1) The same position held by the employee when the leave commenced; or
(2) An equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, status, and other terms and conditions of employment.
(b) For the purpose of applying paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an equivalent position must be in the same commuting area and must carry or provide at a minimum—
(1) The same or substantially similar duties and responsibilities, which must entail substantially equivalent skill, effort, responsibility, and authority;
(2) An equivalent grade or pay level, including any applicable locality payment under 5 CFR part 531, subpart F; special rate supplement under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C; or similar payment or supplement under other legal authority;
(3) The same type of appointment, work schedule, status, and tenure;
(4) The same employment benefits made available to the employee in his or her previous position (e.g., life insurance, health benefits, retirement coverage, and leave accrual);
(5) The same or equivalent opportunity for a within-grade increase, performance award, incentive award, or other similar discretionary and non-discretionary payments, consistent with applicable laws and regulations; however, the entitlement to be returned to an equivalent position does not extend to intangible or unmeasurable aspects of the job;
(6) The same or equivalent opportunity for premium pay consistent with applicable law and regulations under 5 CFR part 550, subpart A, or 5 CFR part 551, subpart E; and
(7) The same or equivalent opportunity for training or education benefits consistent with applicable laws and regulations, including any training that an employee may be required to complete to qualify for his or her previous position.
(c) As a result of taking leave under § 630.1203(a) of this part, an employee shall not suffer the loss of any employment benefit accrued prior to the date on which the leave commenced.
(d) Except as otherwise provided by or under law, a restored employee shall not be entitled to—
(1) The accrual of any employment benefits during any period of leave; or
(2) Any right, benefit, or position of employment other than any right, benefit, or position to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee not taken the leave.
(e) For the purpose of applying paragraph (d) of this section, the same entitlements and limitations in law and regulations that apply to the position, pay, benefits, status, and other terms and conditions of employment of an employee in a leave without pay status shall apply to any employee taking leave without pay under this part, except where different entitlements and limitations are specifically provided in this subpart.
(f) An employee is not entitled to be returned to the same or equivalent position under paragraph (a) of this section if the employee would not otherwise have been employed in that position at the time the employee returns from leave.
(g) An agency may not return an employee to an equivalent position where written notification has been provided that the equivalent position will be affected by a reduction in force if the employee's previous position is not affected by a reduction in force.
(h) As a condition to returning an employee who takes leave under § 630.1203(a)(4), an agency may establish a uniformly applied practice or policy that requires all similarly-situated employees (
i.e.,
same occupation, same serious health condition) to obtain written medical certification from the health care provider of the employee that the employee is able to perform the essential functions of his or her position. An agency may delay the return of an employee until the medical certification is provided. The same conditions for verifying the adequacy of a medical certification in § 630.1208(c)
apply to the medical certification to return to work. No second or third opinion on the medical certification to return to work may be required. An agency may not require a medical certification to return to work during the period the employee takes leave intermittently or under a reduced leave schedule under § 630.1205.
(i) If an agency requires an employee to obtain written medical certification under paragraph (h) of this section before he or she returns to work, the agency shall notify the employee of this requirement before leave commences, or to the extent practicable in emergency medical situations, and pay the expenses for obtaining the written medical certification. An employee's refusal or failure to provide written medical certification under paragraph (h) of this section may be grounds for appropriate disciplinary or adverse action, as provided in part 752 of this chapter.
(j) An agency may require an employee to report periodically to the agency on his or her status and intention to return to work. An agency's policy requiring such reports must take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances of the employee's situation.
(k) An employee's decision to invoke FMLA leave under § 630.1203(a) does not prohibit an agency from proceeding with appropriate actions under part 432 or part 752 of this chapter.
(l) An employee who does not comply with the notification requirements in § 630.1207 and does not provide medical certification signed by the health care provider that includes all of the information required in § 630.1208(b) is not entitled to family and medical leave.

§ 630.1211
Health benefits.
An employee enrolled in a health benefits plan under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (established under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code) who is placed in a leave without pay status as a result of entitlement to leave under § 630.1203(a) of this part may continue his or her health benefits enrollment while in the leave without pay status and arrange to pay the appropriate employee contributions into the Employees Health Benefits Fund (established under section 8909 of title 5, United States Code). The employee shall make such contributions consistent with 5 CFR 890.502.

§ 630.1212
Greater leave entitlements.
(a) An agency shall comply with any collective bargaining agreement or any agency employment benefit program or plan that provides greater family or medical leave entitlements to employees than those provided under this subpart. Nothing in this subpart prevents an agency from amending such policies, provided the policies comply with the requirements of this subpart.
(b) The entitlements established for employees under this subpart may not be diminished by any collective bargaining agreement or any employment benefit program or plan.
(c) An agency may adopt leave policies more generous than those provided in this subpart, except that such policies may not provide entitlement to paid time off in an amount greater than that otherwise authorized by law or provide sick leaved in any situation in which sick leave would not normally be allowed by law or regulation.
(d) The entitlements under sections 6381 through 6387 of title 5, United States Code, and this subpart do not modify or affect any Federal law prohibiting discrimination. If the entitlements under sections 6381 through 6387 of title 5, United States Code, and this subpart conflict with any Federal law prohibiting discrimination, an agency must comply with whichever statute provides greater entitlements to employees.

§ 630.1213
Records and reports.
(a) So that OPM can evaluate the use of family and medical leave by Federal employees and provide the Congress and others with information about the use of this entitlement, each agency shall maintain records on employees who take leave under this subpart and submit to OPM such records and reports as OPM may require.
(b) At a minimum, each agency shall maintain the following information concerning each employee who takes leave under this subpart:
(1) The employee's rate of basic pay, as defined in 5 CFR 550.103;

(c) When an employee transfers to a different agency, the losing agency shall provide the gaining agency with information on leave taken under § 630.1203(a) of this part by the employee during the 12 months prior to the date of transfer. The losing agency shall provide the following information:
(1) The beginning and ending dates of the employee's 12-month period, as determined under § 630.1203(c) of this part; and
(2) The number of hours of leave taken under § 630.1203(a) of the part during the employee's 12-month period, as determined under § 630.1203(c) of this part.

# Subpart M—Disabled Veteran Leave

# Source:
81 FR 51779, Aug. 5, 2016, unless otherwise noted.
§ 630.1301
Purpose and authority.
This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 6329, which establishes a leave category, to be known as “disabled veteran leave,” for an eligible employee who is a veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more. Such an employee is entitled to this leave for purposes of undergoing medical treatment for such disability. Disabled veteran leave must be used during the 12-month period beginning on the first day of employment. OPM's authority to regulate section 6329 is found in section 2(d) of Public Law 114-75.
§ 630.1302
Applicability.
This subpart applies to an employee who is a veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more, subject to the conditions specified in this subpart. This subpart does not apply to employees of the United States Postal Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission who are subject to regulations issued by the Postmaster General under section 2(d)(2) of Public Law 114-75. This subpart applies only to an employee who is hired on or after November 5, 2016.
§ 630.1303
Definitions.
In this subpart:
12-month eligibility period
means the continuous 12-month period that begins on the first day of employment. For an employee who was eligible (or later determined to have been eligible) for disabled veteran leave as an employee of the United States Postal Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission and who subsequently commences employment covered by this subpart, the 12-month eligibility period is the period that began on the first day of employment with the United States Postal Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission (as determined under regulations issued by the Postmaster General to implement 5 U.S.C. 6329).
Agency
means an agency of the Federal Government. In the case of an agency in the Executive branch, it means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. When the term “agency” is used in the context of an agency making determinations or taking actions, it means management officials
of the agency who are authorized by the agency head to make the given determination or take the given action.
Employee
has the meaning given that term in 5 U.S.C. 2105.
Employment
means service as an employee during which the employee is covered by a leave system under which leave is charged for periods of absence. This excludes service in a position in which the employee is not covered by 5 U.S.C. 6329 due to application of another statutory authority.
First day of employment
means the first day of service that qualifies as employment that occurs on the later of—
(1) The earliest date an employee is hired after the effective date of the employee's qualifying service-connected disability, as determined by the Veterans Benefits Administration; or
(2) The effective date of the employee's qualifying service-connected disability, as determined by the Veterans Benefits Administration.
Health care provider
has the meaning given that term in § 630.1202.
Hired
means the action of—
(1) Receiving an initial appointment to a civilian position in the Federal Government in which the service qualifies as employment under this subpart;
(2) Receiving a qualifying reappointment to a civilian position in the Federal Government in which the service qualifies as employment under this subpart; or
(3) Returning to duty status in a civilian position in the Federal Government in which the service qualifies as employment under this subpart, when such return immediately followed a break in civilian duty (with the employee in continuous civilian leave status) to perform military service.
Medical certificate
means a written statement signed by a health care provider certifying to the treatment of a veteran's qualifying service-connected disability.
Medical treatment
means any activity carried out or prescribed by a health care provider to treat a veteran's qualifying service-connected disability.
Military service
means “active military, naval, or air service” as that term is defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(24).
Qualifying reappointment
means an appointment of a former employee of the Federal Government following a break in employment of at least 90 calendar days.
Qualifying service-connected disability
means a veteran's service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more by the Veteran Benefits Administration, including a combined degree of disability of 30 percent or more that reflects the combined effect of multiple individual disabilities, which resulted in the award of disability compensation under title 38, United States Code. A temporary disability rating under 38 U.S.C. 1156 is considered a valid rating in applying this definition for as long as it is in effect.
Service-connected
has the meaning given such term in 38 U.S.C. 101(16).
Veteran
has the meaning given such term in 38 U.S.C. 101(2).
Veterans Benefits Administration
means the Veterans Benefits Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
§ 630.1304
Eligibility.
(a) An employee who is a veteran with a qualifying service-connected disability is entitled to disabled veteran leave under this subpart, which will be available for use during the 12-month eligibility period beginning on the first day of employment. For each employee, there is a single first day of employment.
(b) In order to be eligible for disabled veteran leave, an employee must provide to the agency documentation from the Veterans Benefits Administration certifying that the employee has a qualifying service-connected disability. The documentation should be provided to the agency—
(1) Upon the first day of employment, if the employee has already received such certifying documentation; or
(2) For an employee who has not yet received such certifying documentation from the Veterans Benefit Administration, as soon as practicable after the employee receives the certifying documentation.
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, an employee may submit certifying documentation at a later
time, including after a period of absence for medical treatment, as described in § 630.1306(c). The 12-month eligibility period is fixed based on the first day of employment and is not affected by the timing of when certifying documentation is provided.
(d) If an employee's service-connected disability rating is decreased or discontinued during the 12-month eligibility period such that the employee no longer has a qualifying service-connected disability—
(1) The employee must notify the agency of the effective date of the change in the disability rating; and
(2) The employee is no longer eligible for disabled veteran leave as of the effective date of the rating change.
§ 630.1305
Crediting disabled veteran leave.
(a) Upon receipt of the certifying documentation under § 630.1304, an agency must credit 104 hours of disabled veteran leave to a full-time, nonseasonal employee or a proportionally equivalent amount for employees with part-time, seasonal, or uncommon tours of duty, except as otherwise provided in this section.
(b) The proportional equivalent of 104 hours for a full-time employee is determined for employees with other schedules as follows:
(1) For an employee with a part-time work schedule, the 104 hours is prorated based on the number of hours in the part-time schedule (as established for leave charging purposes) relative to a full-time schedule (e.g., 52 hours for a half-time schedule);
(2) For an employee with a seasonal work schedule, the 104 hours is prorated based on the total projected hours to be worked in an annual period of 52 weeks (based on the seasonal employee's seasonal work periods and full-time or part-time schedule during those periods) relative to a full-time work year of 2,080 hours (e.g., 52 hours for a seasonal employee who works full-time for half a year); and
(3) For an employee with an uncommon tour of duty (as defined in § 630.201 and described in § 630.210), 104 hours is proportionally increased based on the number of hours in the uncommon tour relative to the hours in a regular full-time tour (e.g., 187 hours for an employee with a 72-hour weekly uncommon tour of duty.)
(c) When an employee is converted to a different tour of duty for leave purposes, the employee's balance of unused disabled veteran leave must be converted to the proper number of hours based on the proportion of hours in the new tour of duty compared to the former tour of duty. For seasonal employees, hours must be annualized in determining the proportion.
(d) The amount of disabled veteran leave initially credited to an employee under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section must be offset by the number of hours of sick leave an employee has credited to his or her account as of the first day of employment. For example, if an employee is being reappointed and having sick leave recredited upon such reappointment, the amount of disabled veteran leave must be reduced by the amount of such recredited sick leave. Similarly, if an employee is returning to civilian duty status after a period of leave for military service, that employee may have a balance of sick leave, which must be used to offset the disabled veteran leave.
(e)(1) An employee who was previously employed by an agency whose employees were not subject to 5 U.S.C. 6329 must certify, at the time the employee is hired in a position subject to 5 U.S.C. 6329, whether or not that former agency provided entitlement to an equivalent disabled veteran leave benefit to be used in connection with the medical treatment of a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more. The employee must certify the date he or she commenced the period of eligibility to use disabled veteran leave in the former agency.
(2) If 12 months have elapsed since the commencing date referenced in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the employee will be considered to have received the full amount of an equivalent benefit and no benefit may be provided under this subpart.
(3) If the employee is still within the 12-month period that began on the commencing date referenced in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the employee must certify the number of hours of disabled veteran leave used at
the former agency. The gaining agency must offset the number of hours of disabled veteran leave to be credited to the employee by the number of such hours used by the employee at such agency, while making no offset under paragraph (d) of this section. If the employee had a different type of work schedule at the former agency, the hours used at the former agency must be converted before applying the offset, consistent with § 630.1305(c).
§ 630.1306
Requesting and using disabled veteran leave.
(a) An employee may use disabled veteran leave only for the medical treatment of a qualifying service-connected disability. The medical treatment may include a period of rest, but only if such period of rest is specifically ordered by the health care provider as part of a prescribed course of treatment for the qualifying service-connected disability.
(b)(1) An employee must file an application—written, oral, or electronic, as required by the agency—to use disabled veteran leave. The application must include a personal self-certification by the employee that the requested leave will be (or was) used for purposes of being furnished medical treatment for a qualifying service-connected disability. The application must also include the specific days and hours of absence required for the treatment. The application must be submitted within such time limits as the agency may require.
(2) An employee must request approval to use disabled veteran leave in advance unless the need for leave is critical and not foreseeable—e.g., due to a medical emergency or the unexpected availability of an appointment for surgery or other critical treatment. The employee must provide notice within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances involved. If the agency determines that the need for leave is critical and not foreseeable and that the employee is unable to provide advance notice of his or her need for leave, the leave may not be delayed or denied.
(c)(1) When an employee did not provide the agency with certification of a qualifying service-connected disability before having a period of absence for treatment of such disability, the employee is entitled to substitute approved disabled veteran leave retroactively for such period of absence (excluding periods of suspension or absence without leave (AWOL), but including leave without pay, sick leave, annual leave, compensatory time off, or other paid time off) in the 12-month eligibility period. Such retroactive substitution cancels the use of the original leave or paid time off and requires appropriate adjustments. In the case of retroactive substitution for a period when an employee used advanced annual leave or advanced sick leave, the adjustment is a liquidation of the leave indebtedness covered by the substitution.
(2) An agency may require an employee to submit the medical certification described in § 630.1307(a) before approving such retroactive substitution.
§ 630.1307
Medical certification.
(a) In addition to the employee's self-certification required under § 630.1306(b)(1), an agency may additionally require that the use of disabled veteran leave be supported by a signed written medical certification issued by a health care provider.
(b) When an agency requires a signed written medical certification by a health care provider, the agency may specify that the certification include—
(1) A statement by the health care provider that the medical treatment is for one or more service-connected disabilities of the employee that resulted in 30 percent or more disability rating;
(2) The date or dates of treatment or, if the treatment extends over several days, the beginning and ending dates of the treatment;
(3) If the leave was not requested in advance, a statement that the treatment required was of an urgent nature or there were other circumstances that made advanced scheduling not possible; and
(4) Any additional information that is essential to verify the employee's eligibility.
(c)(1) An employee must provide any required written medical certification no later than 15 calendar days after the
date the agency requests such medical certification, except as otherwise allowed under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2) If the agency determines it is not practicable under the particular circumstances for the employee to provide the requested medical certification within 15 calendar days after the date requested by the agency despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts, the employee must provide the medical certification within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances involved, but no later than 30 calendar days after the date the agency requests such documentation.
(3) An employee who does not provide the required evidence or medical certification within the specified time period is not entitled to use disabled veteran leave, and the agency may, as appropriate and consistent with applicable laws and regulations—
(i) Charge the employee as absent without leave (AWOL); or
(ii) Allow the employee to request that the absence be charged to leave without pay, sick leave, annual leave, or other forms of paid time off.
§ 630.1308
Disabled veteran leave forfeiture, transfer, reinstatement.
(a) Disabled veteran leave not used during the 12-month eligibility period may not be carried over to subsequent years and must be forfeited.
(b) If a change in the employee's disability rating during the 12-month eligibility period causes the employee to no longer have a qualifying service-connected disability (as described in § 630.1304(d)), any unused disabled veteran leave to the employee's credit as of the effective date of the rating change must be forfeited.
(c) When an employee with a positive disabled veteran leave balance transfers between positions in different agencies, or transfers from the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission to a position in another agency, during the 12-month eligibility period, the agency from which the employee transfers must certify the number of unused disabled veteran leave hours available for credit by the gaining agency. The losing agency must also certify the expiration date of the employee's 12-month eligibility period to the gaining agency. Any unused disabled veteran leave will be forfeited at the end of that eligibility period. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “transfers” means movement from a position in one agency (or the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission) to a position in another agency without a break in employment of 1 workday or more in circumstances where service in both positions qualifies as employment under this subpart.
(d)(1) An employee covered by this subpart, or an employee of the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission, with a balance of unused disabled veteran leave who has a break in employment of at least 1 workday during the employee's 12-month eligibility period, and later recommences employment covered by 5 U.S.C. 6329 within that same eligibility period, is entitled to a recredit of the unused balance.
(2) When an employee has a break in employment as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the losing agency must certify the number of unused disabled veteran leave hours available for recredit by the gaining agency. The losing agency must also certify the expiration date of the employee's 12-month eligibility period. Any unused disabled veteran leave must be forfeited at the end of that eligibility period.
(3) In the absence of the certification described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the recredit of disabled veteran leave may also be supported by written documentation available to the employing agency in its official personnel records concerning the employee, the official records of the employee's former employing agency, copies of contemporaneous earnings and leave statement(s) provided by the employee, or copies of other contemporaneous written documentation acceptable to the agency.
(e) An employee may not receive a lump-sum payment for any unused disabled veteran leave under any circumstance.

# Subpart N—Administrative Leave

# Effective Date Note:
At 89 FR 102290, Dec. 17, 2024, subpart N of part 630 was added, effective Jan. 16, 2025.
§ 630.1401
Purpose and applicability.
(a) This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 6329a, which allows an agency to provide a separate type of paid leave, on a limited basis, for general purposes not covered by other types of leave authorized by other provisions of law. Section 6329a(c) authorizes OPM to prescribe regulations to carry out the statutory provisions on administrative leave, including regulations on the appropriate uses and the proper recording of this leave.
(b) This subpart applies to an employee as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105 who is employed in an agency, but does not apply to an intermittent employee who, by definition, does not have an established regular tour of duty during the administrative workweek.
(c) As provided in 5 U.S.C. 6329a(d), this subpart applies to employees described in subsection (b) of 38 U.S.C. 7421, notwithstanding subsection (a) of that section.
§ 630.1402
Definitions.
In this subpart:
Administrative leave
means paid leave authorized at the discretion of an agency under 5 U.S.C. 6329a (and not authorized under any other provision of statute or Presidential directive) to cover periods within an employee's tour of duty established for leave purposes when the employee is not engaged in activities that qualify as official hours of work, which is provided without loss of or reduction in—
(1) Pay;
(2) Leave to which an employee is otherwise entitled under law; or
(3) Credit for time or service.
Agency
means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, excluding the Government Accountability Office. When the term “agency” is used in the context of an agency making determinations or taking actions, it means the agency head or management officials who are authorized (including by delegation, where applicable) to make the given determination or take the given action.
Employee
means an individual who is covered by this subpart, as described in § 630.1401(b) and (c).
Head of the agency
means the head of an agency or a designated representative of such agency head who is an agency headquarters-level official reporting directly to the agency head or a deputy agency head and who is the sole such representative for the entire agency.
OPM
means the Office of Personnel Management.
Presidential directive
means an Executive order, Presidential memorandum, or official written statement by the President in which the President specifically directs agency heads to provide employees with a paid excused absence under a specified set of conditions. This excludes a Presidential action that merely encourages agency heads to use an agency head authority (
e.g.,
section 6329a) to grant a paid excused absence under specified conditions or that leaves the amount of excused absence to be granted in specified conditions subject to agency head discretion.
§ 630.1403
Principles and prohibitions.
(a)
General principles.
In granting administrative leave, an agency must adhere to the following general principles:
(1) Administrative leave may be granted (subject to the requirements of this section) only when—
(i) The absence is directly related to the agency's mission;
(ii) The absence is officially sponsored or sanctioned by the agency;
(iii) The absence will clearly enhance the professional development or skills of the employee in the employee's current position; or
(iv) The absence is in the interest of the agency or of the Government as a whole.
(2) Administrative leave is not an entitlement, but is an authority, entrusted to the discretion of the agency, that should be used sparingly, consistent with the sense of Congress expressed in section 1138(b)(2) of Public Law 114-328.
(3) Administrative leave is appropriately used for brief or short periods of time—usually for not more than 1 workday. An incidence of administrative leave lasting more than 1 workday may be approved when determined to be appropriate by an agency.
(4) An agency must retain the discretion to grant or not grant administrative leave in any circumstance based on agency judgments regarding mission needs. Generally, administrative leave should be granted on an ad hoc, event-specific, or time-limited basis. If an agency determines that it will generally grant administrative leave under a specific set of circumstances that may recur (
e.g.,
blood donations, voting-related activities), that determination must allow the agency to not grant administrative leave due to mission needs.
(5) A determination that an absence satisfies one of the conditions in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be—
(i) Permitted under written agency policies (established by the head of the agency or by other agency officials under a specific delegation of authority); or
(ii) Reviewed and approved by an official of the agency who is (or is acting) at a higher level than the official making the determination, if the specific type of use and amount of leave for that use has not been authorized under established written policy as described in paragraph (i) of this paragraph (a)(5).
(6) In developing agency policies regarding the appropriate uses and corresponding amounts of administrative leave and in approving specific incidents of administrative leave where the particular use was not specifically authorized in agency policies, authorized agency officials must consider the following factors:
(i) The regulations in this subpart;
(ii) The effect on productivity and the agency's ability to meet mission needs;
(iii) Current Administration policies that identify Governmentwide interests;
(iv) The strength of the justification for using appropriated funds for the administrative leave in question;
(v) Equitable treatment of similarly situated employees; and
(vi) The degree of delegation that is appropriate for various uses of administrative leave.
(b)
Specific prohibited uses.
An agency may not grant administrative leave—
(1) To mark the memory of a deceased former Federal official (see also 5 U.S.C. 6105); or
(2) As a reward to recognize the performance or contributions of an employee or group of employees (
i.e.,
in lieu of a cash award or a time-off award).
§ 630.1404
Calendar year limitation.
(a)
General.
Under 5 U.S.C. 6329a(b), during any calendar year, an agency may place an employee on administrative leave for no more than 10 workdays. In this context, the term “place” refers to a management-initiated action to put an employee in administrative leave status, with or without the employee's consent, for the purpose of conducting an investigation (as defined in § 630.1502). The 10-workday annual limit does not apply to administrative leave for other purposes. After an employee has been placed on administrative leave in connection with such an investigation for 10 workdays, the agency may place the employee on investigative leave under subpart O of this part, if necessary (see 5 U.S.C. 6329b(b)(3)(A) and § 630.1504(a)(1)). This calendar year limitation applies separately to each agency that may employ an employee during the year. Use by different agencies is not aggregated.
(b)
Conversion to a limitation on hours.
This 10-workday calendar year limitation is converted to an aggregate limit on hours, taking into account the different workdays that can apply to employees under different work schedules, as follows:
(1) For a full-time employee (including an employee on a regular 40-hour basic workweek or a flexible or compressed work schedule under 5 U.S.C. chapter 61, subchapter II, but excluding an employee on an uncommon tour of duty), the calendar year limitation is 80 hours;
(2) For a full-time employee with an uncommon tour of duty under § 630.210, the calendar year limitation is equal to
the number of hours in the biweekly uncommon tour of duty (or the average biweekly hours for uncommon tours for which the biweekly hours vary over an established cycle);
(3) For a part-time employee, the calendar year limit is prorated based on the number of hours in the officially scheduled part-time tour of duty established for purposes of charging leave when absent (
e.g.,
for a part-time employee who has an officially scheduled half-time tour of 40 hours in a biweekly pay period, the calendar year limitation is 40 hours, which is half of the 80-hour limitation for full-time employees);
(4) For an employee who has more than one type of work schedule in effect during different parts of a calendar year, the calendar year limit on hours of administrative leave must be applied by—
(i) Converting hours of administrative leave used under a part-time schedule by multiplying such hours by the ratio of 80 divided by the number of hours in the officially scheduled biweekly part-time tour of duty established for purposes of charging leave when absent;
(ii) Converting hours of administrative leave used under a biweekly uncommon tour of duty under § 630.210 (or the average biweekly hours for uncommon tours for which the biweekly hours vary over an established cycle) by multiplying such hours by the ratio of 80 divided by the number of hours in the uncommon tour of duty;
(iii) Summing the hours of administrative leave used for each period of time under a different type of work schedule, using actual hours for full-time tours and converted hours for part-time and uncommon tours, as determined under paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section; and
(iv) Applying the sum derived under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section against an 80-hour standard for purposes of the 10-workday limit.
§ 630.1405
Administration of administrative leave.
(a) An agency must use the same minimum charge increments for administrative leave as it does for annual and sick leave under § 630.206.
(b) Employees may be granted administrative leave only for hours within the tour of duty established for purposes of charging annual and sick leave when absent. For full-time employees, that tour is the 40-hour basic workweek as defined in 5 CFR 610.102, the basic work requirement established for employees on a flexible or compressed work schedule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 6121(3), or an uncommon tour of duty under § 630.210.
(c) Agencies authorize, and may require, the use of administrative leave by an employee or a category of employees. Employees do not have an entitlement to receive administrative leave, nor do they have a right to refuse administrative leave when the agency requires its use.
§ 630.1406
Records and reporting.
(a)
Record of usage of administrative leave.
An agency must maintain an accurate record of an employee's usage of administrative leave by recording leave in one of the following subcategories, as applicable in the case at hand:
(1) Administrative leave used for the purposes of an investigation (as described in § 630.1404(a)); or
(2) Administrative leave used for all other purposes.
(b)
Minimum retention period.
An agency must retain the records described in paragraph (a) of this section for a minimum of 6 years from the date the leave was used.
(c)
Reporting.
(1) In agency data systems (including timekeeping systems) and in data reports submitted to OPM, an agency must record administrative leave under section 6329a and this subpart as categories of leave separate from other types of leave. Leave under section 6329a and this subpart must be recorded as either administrative leave used for the purposes of an investigation (as described in § 630.1404(a)) or administrative leave used for all other purposes, as applicable.
(2) Agencies must provide information to the Government Accountability Office as that office is required to submit reports to specified Congressional committees under section 1138(d)(2) of Public Law 114-328 on a 5-year cycle.

§ 630.1503
Authority and requirements for investigative leave and notice leave.
(a)
Authority.
An agency may, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, and in its discretion, place an employee on—
(1) Investigative leave, if the employee is the subject of an investigation; or
(2) Notice leave—
(i) If the employee is in a notice period; or

(A) The agency proposes or initiates an adverse action against the employee; and
(B) The agency determines that the employee continues to meet one or more of the criteria described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(b)
Required determinations.
An agency may place an employee on investigative leave or notice leave only if the agency has made a written determination documenting that the agency has—
(1) Determined, after consideration of the baseline factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section, that the continued presence of the employee in the workplace during an investigation of the employee or while the employee is in a notice period, as applicable, may—
(i) Pose a threat to the employee or others;
(ii) Result in the destruction of evidence relevant to an investigation;
(iii) Result in loss of or damage to Government property; or
(iv) Otherwise jeopardize legitimate Government interests; and
(2) Considered the following options (or a combination thereof):

(ii) Allowing the employee to voluntarily take leave (paid or unpaid) or paid time off, as appropriate under the rules governing each category of leave or paid time off;
(iii) Carrying the employee in absent without leave status, if the employee is absent from duty without approval; and
(iv) For an employee subject to a notice period, curtailing the notice period if there is reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, consistent with 5 CFR 752.404(d)(1); and
(3) Determined that none of the options under paragraph (b)(2) of this section is appropriate.
(c)
Telework alternative for investigative leave.
(1) If an agency would otherwise place an employee on investigative leave, the agency may require the employee to perform, at a telework site, duties similar to the duties that the employee normally performs if—
(i) The agency determines that such a requirement, at a telework site, would not pose a threat, as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section;
(ii) The employee is eligible to telework; as set forth in paragraph (c)(2);
(iii) The employee has been participating in a telework program under the agency telework policy during some portion of the 30-day period immediately preceding the commencement of investigative leave (or the commencement of required telework in lieu of such leave under paragraph (c) of this section, if earlier); and
(iv) The agency determines that teleworking would be appropriate.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an employee is considered to be eligible to telework if the agency determines the employee is eligible to telework under agency telework policies described in 5 U.S.C. 6502(a) and is not barred from teleworking under the eligibility conditions described in 5 U.S.C. 6502(b)(4). Any telework agreement established under 5 U.S.C. 6502(b)(2) must be superseded as necessary to comply with an agency's action to require telework under 5 U.S.C. 6502(c) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(3) If an employee who is required to telework under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is absent from telework duty without the required approval, an agency may place the employee in absent without leave status, consistent with agency policies.
(4) The agency decision to require telework under this paragraph (c), as well as the supporting agency determinations and any conditions or requirements governing the required telework (
e.g.,
the telework assignment's duration or location), are to be put into effect at the agency's discretion, subject to the requirements of this paragraph (c).
(5) If an agency requires telework in lieu of placement on investigative leave, the agency must provide the employee with a written explanation regarding the required telework in lieu of placement on investigative leave. The written explanation must include the following:
(i) The agency's determination under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and,
(ii) A description of the limitations of the required telework, including the expected duration of telework.
(d)
Reassessment and return to duty.
(1) An employee may be returned to duty at any time if the agency reassesses its determination to place the employee on investigative leave or notice leave. An employee on investigative leave or notice leave must be prepared to report promptly to work as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. These decisions are at the discretion of the agency.
(2) For an employee on investigative leave, an agency may reassess its determination that the employee must be removed from the workplace based on the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and may reassess its determination that the options in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are not appropriate. An agency may reassess its previous determination to require or not require telework under paragraph (c) of this section. These decisions are at the discretion of the agency.
(3) For an employee on notice leave, an agency may reassess its determination that the employee must be removed from the regular worksite based on the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and may reassess its determination that the options in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are not appropriate. These decisions are at the discretion of the agency.
(4) When an employee is placed on investigative leave or notice leave, the employee must be available to report promptly at a time during the employee's regularly scheduled tour of duty and to an approved duty location, if directed by the employee's agency. Any failure to so report may result in the employee being recorded as absent without leave, which can be the basis for disciplinary action. An employee who anticipates being unavailable to report promptly must request leave or paid time off in advance, as provided under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, to avoid being recorded as absent without leave.
(e)
Baseline factors.
In making a determination regarding the criteria listed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an agency must consider the following baseline factors:
(1) The nature and severity of the employee's exhibited or alleged behavior;
(2) The nature of the agency's or employee's work and the ability of the agency to accomplish its mission; and
(3) Other impacts of the employee's continued presence in the workplace detrimental to legitimate Government interests, including whether the employee poses an unacceptable risk to—
(i) The life, safety, or health of employees, contractors, vendors or visitors to a Federal facility;
(ii) The Government's physical assets or information systems;
(iii) Personal property;
(iv) Records, including classified, privileged, proprietary, financial or medical records; or
(v) The privacy of the individuals whose data the Government holds in its systems.
(f)
Minimum charge.
An agency must use the same minimum charge increments for investigative leave and notice leave as it does for annual and sick leave under § 630.206.
(g)
Tour of duty.
Employees may be granted investigative leave or notice leave only for hours within the tour of duty established for purposes of charging annual and sick leave when absent. For full-time employees, that tour is the 40-hour basic workweek as defined in 5 CFR 610.102, the basic work requirement established for employees on a flexible or compressed work schedule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 6121(3), or an uncommon tour of duty under § 630.210.
§ 630.1504
Administration of investigative leave.
(a)
Commencement.
An initial period of investigative leave may not be commenced until—
(1) The employee's use of administrative leave for investigative purposes under subpart N of this part has reached the 10-workday calendar year limitation described in 5 U.S.C. 6329a(b)(1) and § 630.1404, as converted to hours under § 630.1404(b); and
(2) The agency determines that further investigation of the employee is necessary.
(b)
Duration.
The agency may place the employee on investigative leave for an initial period of not more than 30 workdays per investigation. An employee may be placed on investigative leave intermittently—that is, a period of investigative leave may be interrupted by—
(1) On-duty service performed under § 630.1503(b)(2)(i) or (c);
(2) Leave or paid time off in lieu of such service under § 630.1503(b)(2)(ii); or
(3) Absence without leave under § 630.1503(b)(2)(iii).
(c)
Written explanation of leave.
If an agency places an employee on investigative leave, the agency must provide the employee with a written explanation regarding the placement of the employee on investigative leave. The written explanation must include—
(1) A description of the limitations of the leave placement, including the duration of leave;
(2) Notice that, at the conclusion of the period of investigative leave, the agency must take an action under paragraph (d) of this section; and
(3) Notice that placement on investigative leave for 70 workdays or more is considered a “personnel action” for purposes of the Office of Special Counsel's authority to act, in applying the prohibited personnel practices provisions at 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8)-(9) (see paragraph (i) of this section).
(d)
Agency action.
Not later than the day after the last day of an initial or extended period of investigative leave, an agency must—
(1) Return the employee to regular duty status;
(2) Take one or more of the actions under § 630.1503(b)(2);
(3) Propose or initiate an adverse action against the employee as provided under law; or
(4) Extend the period of investigative leave if permitted under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section.
(e)
Continued investigation.
Investigation of an employee may continue after the expiration of the initial period of investigative leave under paragraph (b)
of this section. Investigation of an employee may continue even if the employee is returned to regular duty status and is no longer on investigative leave.
(f)
Extension of investigative leave
—(1)
Increments.
If an investigation is not concluded at the time the expiration of the initial period under paragraph (b) of this section has elapsed, an agency may extend the period of investigative leave using increments of up to 30 workdays for each extension when approved as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. The amount of investigative leave used under the final extension may be less than 30 workdays, as appropriate.
(2)
Maximum number of extensions.
Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the total period of extended investigative leave (
i.e.,
in addition to the initial period of investigative leave) may not exceed 90 workdays (
e.g.,
3 incremental extensions of 30 workdays). This 90-day limit applies to extensions of investigative leave associated with a single initial period of investigative leave.
(3)
Approval of extensions.
(i) An incremental extension under paragraph (f)(1) of this section is permitted only if the agency makes a written determination reaffirming that the employee must be removed from the workplace based on the criteria in § 630.1503(b)(1) and that the options in § 630.1503(b)(2) are not appropriate.
(ii) Except as provided by paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, an incremental extension under paragraph (f)(1) of this section is permitted only if approved by the CHCO of an agency, or the designee of the CHCO, after consulting with the investigator responsible for conducting the investigation of the employee.
(iii) In the case of an employee of an Office of Inspector General, an incremental extension under paragraph (f)(1) of this section is permitted only if approved (after consulting with the investigator responsible for conducting the investigation of the employee) by—
(A) The Inspector General or the designee of the Inspector General, rather than the CHCO or the designee of the CHCO; or
(B) An official of the agency designated by the head of the agency within which the Office of Inspector General is located, if the Inspector General requests the agency head make such a designation.
(4)
Designation guidance.
In delegating authority to a designated official to approve an incremental extension as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, a CHCO must consider the designation guidance issued by the CHCO Council under 5 U.S.C. 6329b(c)(3), except that, in the case of approvals for an employee of an Office of Inspector General, an Inspector General must consider the designation guidance issued by the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency under 5 U.S.C. 6329b(c)(4)(B).
(g)
Further extension of investigative leave.
An official authorized under paragraph (f)(3) of this section to approve an incremental extension under paragraph (f)(1) of this section may approve further incremental extensions of 30 workdays (
i.e.,
each extension is individually approved for up to 30 workdays) under this paragraph after an employee has reached the maximum number of extensions of investigative leave under paragraph (f)(2) of this section. However, an agency may further extend a period of investigative leave only if the agency makes a written determination reaffirming that the employee must be removed from the workplace based on the criteria in § 630.1503(b)(1) and that the options in § 630.1503(b)(2) are not appropriate. Not later than 5 business days after granting each further extension, the agency must submit (subject to § 630.1506(b)) to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Oversight and Accountability of the House of Representatives, along with any other committees of jurisdiction, a report containing—
(1) The title, position, office or agency subcomponent, job series, pay grade, and salary of the employee;
(2) A description of the duties of the employee;
(3) The reason the employee was placed on investigative leave;
(4) An explanation as to why the employee meets the criteria described in
§ 630.1503(b)(1)(i) through (iv) and why the agency is not able to temporarily reassign the duties of the employee or detail the employee to another position within the agency;
(5) In the case of an employee who was required to telework under 5 U.S.C. 6502(c) at any time during the period of investigation prior to the further extension of investigative leave, the reasons that the agency required the employee to telework under that subsection and the duration of the teleworking requirement;
(6) The status of the investigation of the employee;
(7) A certification to the agency by an investigative entity stating that additional time is needed to complete the investigation of the employee and providing an estimate of the amount of time that is necessary to complete the investigation of the employee; and
(8) In the case of a completed investigation of the employee, the results of the investigation and the reason that the employee remains on investigative leave.
(h)
Completed investigation.
An agency may not further extend a period of investigative leave under paragraph (g) of this section on or after the date that is 30 calendar days after the completion of the investigation of the employee by an investigative entity.
(i)
Possible prohibited personnel action.
For purposes of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, subchapter II, and section 1221, placement on investigative leave under this subpart for a period of 70 workdays or more shall be considered a personnel action for purposes of the Office of Special Counsel in applying the prohibited personnel practices provisions at 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8) or (9).
(j)
Conversion of workdays to hours.
In applying this section, the limitations based on workdays (
i.e.,
the 30-workday increments in paragraphs (b), (f), and (g) of this section and the 70-workday limit in paragraph (i) of this section) must be converted to hours, taking into account the different workdays that can apply to employees under different work schedules, as follows:
(1) For a full-time employee (including an employee on a regular 40-hour basic workweek or a flexible or compressed work schedule under 5 U.S.C. chapter 61, subchapter II, but excluding an employee on an uncommon tour of duty), the 30-workday increment is converted to 240 hours and the 70-workday limit is converted to 560 hours.
(2) For a full-time employee with an uncommon tour of duty under § 630.210, the 30-workday increment is converted to three times the number of hours in the biweekly uncommon tour of duty (or the average biweekly hours for uncommon tours for which the biweekly hours vary over an established cycle), and the 70-workday limit is converted to a number of hours derived by multiplying the hours equivalent of 30 workdays (for a given uncommon tour) times the ratio of 70 divided by 30.
(3) For a part-time employee, the calendar year limit is prorated based on the number of hours in the officially scheduled part-time tour of duty established for purposes of charging leave when absent (
e.g.,
for a part-time employee who has an officially scheduled half-time tour of 40 hours in a biweekly pay period, the 30-workday increment is converted to 120 hours, which is half of 240 hours (the 30-workday increment for full-time employees)).
(4) For an employee who has more than one type of work schedule while on investigative leave, the 30-workday and 70-workday limits must be applied by—
(i) Converting hours of investigative leave used under a part-time schedule by multiplying such hours by the ratio of 80 divided by the number of hours in the officially scheduled biweekly part-time tour of duty established for purposes of charging leave when absent;
(ii) Converting hours of investigative leave used under a biweekly uncommon tour of duty under § 630.210 (or the average biweekly hours for uncommon tours for which the biweekly hours vary over an established cycle) by multiplying such hours by the ratio of 80 divided by the number of hours in the uncommon tour of duty;
(iii) Summing the hours of investigative leave used for each period of time under a different type of work schedule, using actual hours for full-time tours and converted hours for part-time and uncommon tours, as determined under paragraphs (j)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section; and
(iv) Applying the sum derived under paragraph (j)(4)(iii) of this section against a 240-hour standard for purposes of the 30-workday limit and against a 560-hour standard for the purposes of the 70-workday limit.
§ 630.1505
Administration of notice leave.
(a)
Commencement.
Notice leave may commence only after an employee has received written notice of a proposed adverse action. There is no requirement that the employee exhaust 10 workdays of administrative leave under 5 U.S.C. 6329a(b) and § 630.1404 before the employee may be placed on notice leave.
(b)
Duration.
Placement of an employee on notice leave shall be for a period not longer than the duration of the notice period.
(c)
Written explanation of leave.
If an agency places an employee on notice leave, the agency must provide the employee with a written explanation regarding the placement of the employee on notice leave. The written explanation must provide information on the employee's notice period and include a statement that the notice leave will be provided only during the notice period.
§ 630.1506
Records and reporting.
(a)
Record of placement on leave.
An agency must maintain an accurate record of the placement of an employee on investigative leave or notice leave by the agency, including—
(1) The reasons for initial authorization of the investigative leave or notice leave, including the alleged action(s) of the employee that required investigation or issuance of a notice of a proposed adverse action;
(2) The basis for the determination made under § 630.1503(b)(1);
(3) An explanation of why an action under § 630.1503(b)(2) was not appropriate;
(4) The length of the period of investigative leave or notice leave;
(5) The amount of salary paid to the employee during the period of leave;
(6) The reasons for authorizing the leave, and if an extension of investigative leave was granted, the recommendation made by an investigator as part of the consultation required under § 630.1504(f)(3);
(7) Whether the employee was required to telework under § 630.1503(c) during the period of the investigation, including the reasons for requiring or not requiring the employee to telework;
(8) The action taken by the agency at the end of the period of leave, including, if applicable, the granting of any extension of a period of investigative leave under § 630.1504(f) or (g); and
(9) Any additional information OPM may require.
(b)
Availability of records.
(1) An agency must make a record kept under paragraph (a) of this section available upon request—
(i) To any committee of jurisdiction;
(ii) To OPM;
(iii) To the Government Accountability Office; and
(iv) As otherwise required by law.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section and § 630.1504(g), the requirement that an agency make records and information on use of investigative leave or notice leave available to various entities is subject to applicable laws, Executive orders, and regulations governing the dissemination of sensitive information related to national security, foreign relations, or law enforcement matters (
e.g.,
50 U.S.C. 3024(i), (j), and (m) and Executive Orders 12968 and 13526).
(3) An agency must retain the records described in paragraph (a) of this section for a minimum of 6 years from the date the leave was used.
(c)
Reporting.
(1) In agency data systems and in data reports submitted to OPM, an agency must record investigative leave and notice leave under 5 U.S.C. 6329b and this subpart as categories of leave separate from other types of leave. Leave under 5 U.S.C. 6329b and this subpart must be recorded as either investigative leave or notice leave, as applicable.
(2) Agencies must provide information to the Government Accountability Office as that office is required to submit reports to specified Congressional committees under section 1138(d)(2) of Public Law 114-328 on a 5-year cycle.

# Subpart P—Weather and Safety Leave

# Source:
83 FR 15297, Apr. 10, 2018, unless otherwise noted.
§ 630.1601
Purpose and applicability.
(a) This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 6329c, which allows an agency to provide a separate type of paid leave when weather or other safety-related conditions prevent employees from safely traveling to or safely performing work at an approved location due to an act of God, terrorist attack, or other applicable condition. Section 6329c(d) directs OPM to prescribe regulations to carry out the statutory provisions on weather and safety leave, including regulations on the appropriate uses and the proper recording of this leave.
(b) This subpart applies to an employee as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105 who is employed in an agency, but does not apply to an intermittent employee who, by definition, does not have an established regular tour of duty during the administrative workweek.
(c) As provided in 5 U.S.C. 6329c(e), this subpart applies to employees described in subsection (b) of 38 U.S.C. 7421, notwithstanding subsection (a) of that section.
§ 630.1602
Definitions.
In this subpart:
Act of God
means an act of nature, including hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires, earthquakes, landslides, snowstorms, and avalanches.
Agency
means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, excluding the Government Accountability Office. When the term “agency” is used in the context of an agency making determinations or taking actions, it means the agency heads or management officials who are authorized (including by delegation) to make the given determination or take the given action.
Employee
means an individual who is covered by this subpart, as described in § 630.1601(b) and (c).
OPM
means the Office of Personnel Management.
Participating in a telework program
means an employee is eligible to telework and has an established arrangement with his or her agency under which the employee is approved to participate in the agency telework program, including on a routine or situational basis. Such an employee who teleworks on a situational basis is considered to be continuously participating in a telework program even if there are extended periods during which the employee does not perform telework.
Telework site
means a location where an employee is authorized to perform telework, as described in 5 U.S.C. chapter 65, such as an employee's home.
Weather and safety leave
means paid leave provided under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 6329c.
§ 630.1603
Authorization.
Subject to other provisions of this subpart, an agency may grant weather and safety leave to employees only if they are prevented from safely traveling to or safely performing work at a location approved by the agency due to—
(a) An act of God;
(b) A terrorist attack; or
(c) Another condition that prevents an employee or group of employees from safely traveling to or safely performing work at an approved location.
§ 630.1604
OPM and agency responsibilities.
(a) OPM is responsible for prescribing regulations and guidance related to the appropriate use of leave under this subpart and the proper recording of such leave, including OPM guidance on Governmentwide dismissal and closure policies and procedures that provides for use of consistent terminology in describing various operating status scenarios. In issuing any operating status announcements for the Washington, DC, area, OPM must make the specific policies and procedures related to those announcements consistent with the regulations in this subpart and with OPM's Governmentwide guidance.
(b) Employing agencies are responsible for—
(1) Establishing and applying policies and procedures related to use of leave under this subpart that are consistent with OPM regulations and guidance described in paragraph (a) of this section; and
(2) Using terminology required by OPM-issued Governmentwide guidance in any agency-specific operating status announcements they issue (for a specific geographic location or area).
§ 630.1605
Telework and emergency employees.
(a)
Telework employees.
(1) Except as provided under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, employees who are participating in a telework program and are able to safely travel to and work at an approved telework site may not be granted leave under § 630.1603. Employees who are eligible to telework and participating in a telework program under applicable agency policies are typically able to safely perform work at their approved telework site (e.g., home), since they are not required to work at their regular worksite.
(2)(i) If, in the agency's judgment, the conditions in § 630.1603 could not reasonably be anticipated, an agency may provide leave under this subpart to the extent an employee was not able to prepare for telework as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and is otherwise unable to perform productive work at the telework site.
(ii) If an employee is prevented from safely working at the approved telework site due to circumstances, arising from one or more of the conditions in § 630.1603, applicable to the telework site, an agency may, at its discretion, provide leave under this subpart to the employee.
(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, an agency may decide not to provide leave under this subpart when the conditions in § 630.1603 do not prevent the employee from safely traveling to or safely performing work at a regular worksite, even if the affected day is a scheduled telework day.
(3) In making a determination under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, an agency must evaluate whether any of the conditions in § 630.1603 could be reasonably anticipated and whether the employee took reasonable steps (within the employee's control) to prepare to perform telework at the approved telework site. For example, if a significant snowstorm is predicted, the employee may need to prepare by taking home any equipment (e.g., laptop computer) and work needed for teleworking. To the extent that an employee is unable to perform work at a telework site because of failure to make necessary preparations for reasonably anticipated conditions, an agency may not provide weather and safety leave, and the employee would need to use other appropriate paid leave, paid time off, or leave without pay.
(b)
Emergency employees.
An agency may designate emergency employees who are critical to agency operations and for whom weather and safety leave may not be applicable. To the extent practicable, an agency should inform employees of their designation as emergency employees well in advance in anticipation of the possible occurrence of the conditions set forth in § 630.1603. If the agency wishes to provide for the possibility that an emergency employee could work from an approved telework site in lieu of traveling to the regular worksite in appropriate circumstances, an agency should encourage the employee to enter into a telework agreement providing for that contingency. An agency may designate different emergency employees for the different circumstances expected to arise from these conditions. Emergency employees must report to work at their regular worksite or another approved location as directed by the agency, unless—
(1) The agency determines that travel to or performing work at the worksite is unsafe for emergency employees, in which case the agency may require the employees to work at another location, including a telework site as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, as appropriate; or
(2) The agency determines that circumstances justify granting leave under this subpart to emergency employees.
§ 630.1606
Administration of weather and safety leave.
(a) An agency must use the same minimum charge increments for weather and safety leave as it does for annual and sick leave under § 630.206.
(b) Employees may be granted weather and safety leave only for hours within the tour of duty established for purposes of charging annual and sick leave when absent. For full-time employees, that tour is the 40-hour basic workweek as defined in 5 CFR 610.102, the basic work requirement established for employees on a flexible or compressed work schedule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 6121(3), or an uncommon tour of duty under § 630.210.
(c) Employees may not receive weather and safety leave for hours during which they are on other preapproved leave (paid or unpaid) or paid time off. Agencies should not provide weather and safety leave to an employee who, in the agency's judgment, is cancelling preapproved leave or paid time off, or changing a regular day off in a flexible or compressed work schedule, for the primary purpose of obtaining weather and safety leave.
§ 630.1607
Records and reporting.
(a)
Record of placement on leave.
An agency must maintain an accurate record of the placement of an employee on weather and safety leave.
(b)
Reporting.
In agency data systems (including timekeeping systems) and in data reports submitted to OPM, an agency must record weather and safety leave under section 6329c and this subpart as a category of leave separate from other types of leave.

# Subpart Q—Paid Parental Leave
§ 630.1701
Purpose, applicability, and agency responsibilities.
(a)
Purpose.
This subpart provides regulations to govern the granting of paid parental leave to covered employees. Since paid parental leave may only be substituted for unpaid leave granted following a birth or placement under specific provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act in title 5, United States Code—specifically, section 6382(a)(1)(A) and (B) in 5 U.S.C. chapter 63, subchapter V—this subpart links to subpart L (Family and Medical Leave) of this part.
(b)
Applicability.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), this subpart applies to employees to whom subpart L of this part applies, as provided in § 630.1201(b).
(2) An agency head authorized to issue regulations on family and medical leave under 5 U.S.C. chapter 63, subchapter V, as provided in § 630.1201(b)(3), is authorized to issue any necessary supplemental regulations on paid parental leave, providing those supplemental regulations are consistent with the regulations in this subpart.
(3) This subpart applies to a birth or placement occurring on or after October 1, 2020. Paid parental leave may not be provided under this subpart for any period of time before October 1, 2020.
(c)
Agency responsibilities.
The head of an agency having employees covered by this subpart is responsible for the proper administration of this subpart, including the responsibility of informing employees of their entitlements and obligations.
§ 630.1702
Definitions.
(a)
Applicability of subpart L definitions.
The definitions of terms in § 630.1202 are applicable in this subpart to the extent the terms are used, except that, to the extent any definitions of terms have been further revised in § 630.1702(b), the provisions of that section shall apply for purposes of this subpart.
(b)
Other definitions.
In this subpart—
Agency
means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, excluding the Government Accountability Office. When the term “agency” is used in the context of an agency making determinations or taking actions, it means the agency head or management officials who are authorized (including by delegation) to make the given determination or take the given action.
Birth or placement
means the birth of a son or daughter of a covered employee, or a new placement of a son or daughter with a covered employee for adoption or foster care, that is the basis for unpaid leave granted under § 630.1203(a)(1) or (2) (which correspond to 5 U.S.C. 6382(a)(1)(A) or (B), respectively). For the purpose of interpreting this definition, the terms
birth
and
placement
have the meanings given those terms in § 630.1202, except that paid parental leave may not be granted
based on an anticipated birth or placement.
Child
means a son or daughter as defined in § 630.1202 whose birth or placement is the basis for entitlement to paid parental leave.
FMLA unpaid leave
means leave without pay granted under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) regulations in subpart L of this part.
Paid parental leave
means paid time off from an employee's scheduled tour of duty that is authorized under 5 U.S.C. 6382(d)(2)(B)(i) and this subpart and that is granted to cover periods of time within the 12-month period commencing on the date of birth or placement to an employee who has a current parental role in connection with the child whose birth or placement was the basis for granting FMLA unpaid leave under § 630.1203(a)(1) or (2). This leave is not available to an employee who does not have a current parental role.
§ 630.1703
Leave entitlement.
(a)
Election.
An employee may elect to substitute available paid parental leave for any FMLA unpaid leave granted under § 630.1203(a)(1) or (2) (which correspond to 5 U.S.C. 6382(a)(1)(A) or (B), respectively) in connection with the occurrence of a birth or placement. (See § 630.1206(b).)
(b)
Available paid parental leave.
(1) The paid parental leave that is available for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section is 12 administrative workweeks in connection with the birth or placement involved. The entitlement to paid parental leave is triggered by the occurrence of a birth or placement. The paid parental leave is considered to be available only if the employee has a continuing parental role with respect to the child whose birth or placement triggered the leave entitlement. The 12 administrative workweeks of paid parental leave may be used only during the 12-month period beginning on the date of the birth or placement involved.
(2) Since an employee may use only 12 weeks of FMLA unpaid leave in any 12-month period under § 630.1203(a), use of FMLA unpaid leave not associated with paid parental leave may affect an employee's ability to use the full 12 weeks of paid parental leave. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an employee will be able to use the full amount of paid parental leave only to the extent that there are 12 weeks of available FMLA unpaid leave granted under the birth or placement provisions in § 630.1203(a)(1) or (2) during the 12-month period commencing on the date of birth or placement. The availability of paid parental leave will depend on when the employee uses various types of FMLA unpaid leave relative to any 12-month period established under § 630.1203(c).
(c)
Conversion of weeks to hours.
For employees who are charged leave on an hourly basis (including fractions of an hour), the 12 administrative workweeks referenced in paragraph (b) of this section must be converted to hours based on the number of hours in the employee's scheduled tour of duty (as in effect on the date the employee begins a period of using paid parental leave) as follows:
(1) For a regular full-time employee with 80 hours in the scheduled tour of duty over a biweekly pay period, the hours equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks is 480 hours.
(2) For a full-time employee with an uncommon tour of duty (as defined in § 630.201 and described in § 630.210), the hours equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks is derived by multiplying 6 times the number of hours in the employee's biweekly scheduled tour of duty (or 6 times the average hours if the biweekly tour hours vary over an established cycle). For example, if an employee has an uncommon tour consisting of six 24-hours shifts (144 hours) per biweekly pay period, the amount would be 864 hours.
(3) For a part-time employee, the hours equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks is derived by multiplying 6 times the number of hours in the employee's scheduled tour of duty over a biweekly pay period. For example, if an employee has a part-time scheduled tour of duty that consists of 40 hours in a biweekly pay period, the amount would be 240 hours.
(d)
Conversion of weeks to days.
For employees who are charged leave on a daily basis, the days equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks must be derived based on the average number of
workdays in the employee's established tour of duty over a biweekly pay period. For example, if an employee had 8 workdays each biweekly pay period, the days equivalent of 12 administrative workweeks would be 48 days.
(e)
Change in tour.
If there is a change in an employee's scheduled tour of duty during the 12-month period commencing on the date of a given birth or placement, and the employee has not used the full allotment of paid parental leave during such 12-month period, the remaining balance of paid parental leave must be recalculated based on the change in the number of average hours in the employee's scheduled tour of duty. For example, if a regular full-time employee has a balance of 120 hours of unused paid parental leave for a 12-month period that is in progress and then converts to a part-time schedule of 20 hours per week, the balance would be recalculated to be 60 hours. (Since the old schedule was 80 hours biweekly or an average of 40 hours weekly, the new part-time tour is half of the former full-time tour. 40/80 times 120 equals 60.)
(f)
Leave usage.
(1) An agency may not require an employee to use annual leave or sick leave to the employee's credit as a condition to be met before the employee uses paid parental leave. An employee may request to use annual leave or sick leave without invoking FMLA unpaid leave under subpart L of this part, and, in that case, the agency exercises its normal authority with respect to approving or disapproving the timing of when the leave may be used.
(2) Paid parental leave may be used in connection with the occurrence of a birth or placement only during the 12-month period following birth or placement. (See § 630.1703(b).) Paid parental leave may not be used prior to the birth or placement involved even if the employee was granted FMLA unpaid leave under § 630.1203(a)(1) or (2) for periods prior to the birth or placement event, as allowed under § 630.1203(d).
(3) An employee with a seasonal work schedule may not use paid parental leave during the off-season period designated by the agency—the period during which the employee is scheduled to be released from work and placed in nonpay status.
(g)
Treatment of unused leave.
If an employee has any unused balance of paid parental leave that remains at the end of the 12-month period following the birth or placement involved, the entitlement to the unused leave elapses at that time. No payment may be made for unused paid parental leave that has expired. Paid parental leave may not be considered annual leave for purposes of making a lump-sum payment for annual leave or for any other purpose.
(h)
Documentation of entitlement and employee certification.
(1) At the request of the employee's agency, an employee must provide the agency with appropriate documentation that shows that the employee's use of paid parental leave is directly connected to a birth or placement that has occurred. Appropriate documentation may include, but is not limited to, a birth certificate or a document from an adoption or foster care agency regarding the placement. An agency is responsible for determining what documentation is sufficient proof of entitlement.
(2) An agency may require that an employee sign a certification attesting that the paid parental leave is being taken in connection with a birth or placement. This employee certification may contain a statement in which the employee acknowledges an understanding of the consequences of providing a false certification (e.g., the possibility that the employing agency could pursue appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including removal from Federal Service, or make a referral to a Federal entity that investigates whether conduct constitutes a criminal violation).
(3) An employee must provide any documentation or certification required by the agency no later than 15 calendar days after the date the agency requests such documentation or certification. If it is not practicable under the particular circumstances for an employee to respond within the 15-day time frame, despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts, the employee must provide the documentation or certification within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances involved, but no later than
30 calendar days after the date of the agency's original request.
(4) An agency may grant paid parental leave prior to receiving any requested documentation or certification under this paragraph (h) based on an employee's communications with a supervisor or management. Under these circumstances, the granting of paid parental leave is considered to be provisional, pending receipt of the requested documentation or certification.
(5) If the employee fails to provide the agency with the required documentation or certification within the specified time period, the agency may determine that the employee is not entitled to paid parental leave and may—
(i) Allow the employee to request that the absence be charged to leave without pay, sick leave, annual leave, or other forms of paid time off, as appropriate; or
(ii) If the employee acted fraudulently, charge the employee as absent without leave (AWOL) and pursue any other appropriate action.
§ 630.1704
Pay during leave.
(a) The pay an employee receives when using paid parental leave shall be the same pay the employee would receive if the employee were using annual leave.
(b) Paid parental leave is a type of leave that is counted in applying the 8-hour rule in 5 CFR 550.122(b) that determines whether night pay is payable during periods of leave.
(c) The pay received during paid parental leave may not include Sunday premium pay. (See section 624 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999, Pub. L. 105-277, div. A, § 101(h), 112 Stat. 2681-518 (Oct. 21, 1998).)
§ 630.1705
Work obligation.
(a)
Advance agreement.
An employee may not use paid parental leave in connection with a birth or placement unless the employee agrees (in writing), before the commencement of such leave, to work for the applicable employing agency for not less than 12 weeks beginning on the employee's first scheduled workday after such leave concludes. (See special rules governing cases of incapacitation in § 630.1706.)
(b)
Interpretation.
For the purpose of applying paragraph (a) of this section—
(1) The term “in writing” means an agreement with the employee's handwritten signature or an acceptable electronic signature, consistent with the requirements in 5 CFR 850.106, and also is deemed to include an agreement documented in an email or text message from the employee, as long as the employee, within 24 hours, supplies the required signature;
(2) The term “work” means a period during which the employee is in duty status, excluding any periods (paid or unpaid) of leave, time off (including holiday time off), or other nonduty status (including furlough or AWOL status). Such excluded periods will not count toward completion of the 12-week work obligation.
(3) The term “applicable employing agency” means the agency employing the employee at the time use of paid parental leave concludes; and
(4) The date paid parental leave concludes is—
(i) The workday on which an employee finishes using 12 administrative workweeks of paid parental leave during the 12-month period that began on the date of birth or placement; or
(ii) If the employee does not use 12 administrative workweeks of paid parental leave during the 12-month period that began on the date of birth or placement, the day that is the last workday on which an employee used paid parental leave.
(c)
Conversion of weeks to hours.
For employees who are charged leave on an hourly basis (including fractions of an hour), the 12-week work obligation must be converted to hours based on the number of hours in the employee's scheduled tour of duty, consistent with the rules in § 630.1703(c). If an employee's scheduled tour of duty changes before the employee completes the 12-week obligation, the agency must recalculate the balance of work hours owed, consistent with the rules in § 630.1703(e). An acceptable alternative approach is to express each period of work as a fraction or percentage of the average weekly scheduled tour of duty
hours in the affected biweekly pay period and to sum those fractions or percentages until the 12-week obligation is completed.
(d)
Conversion of weeks to days.
For employees who are charged leave on a daily basis, the days equivalent of 12 weeks must be derived based on the average number of workdays in the employee's established tour of duty over a biweekly pay period, consistent with the rules in § 630.1703(d).
(e)
Agreement to make reimbursement when applicable.
In the written agreement described in paragraph (a) of this section, the employee must attest that, in the event the employee does not complete the 12-week work obligation, he or she agrees, pursuant to paragraph (f), to make reimbursement unless the affected employing agency (or agencies) determines (determine) that the reimbursement provision will not be applied.
(f)
Application of reimbursement requirement.
(1) If an employee fails to return for the required 12 weeks of work with the applicable employing agency after paid parental leave concludes (as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section), an agency may require that the employee make a reimbursement equal to the total amount of any Government contributions paid by the agency on behalf of the employee to maintain the employee's health insurance coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program established under 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 during the period(s) when paid parental leave was used. An employee who separates from the applicable employing agency before completing the required 12 weeks of work is considered to have failed to return to duty under this paragraph. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, an intra-agency reassignment without a break in service will not be considered a separation.
(2) The determination to impose the reimbursement requirement is at the agency's sole and exclusive discretion, except that an agency may not impose the requirement if, in the agency's judgment, the employee is unable to return to work for the required 12 weeks because of—
(i) The continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition (including mental health) of the employee or the child whose birth or placement was the basis for the paid parental leave, but, in the case of the employee's serious health condition, only if the condition is related to the applicable birth or placement; or
(ii) Any other circumstance beyond the employee's control, subject to paragraph (h) of this section.
(g)
Medical certification.
An agency's determination not to apply the reimbursement requirement may be conditioned upon the employee's supplying of a health care provider certification supporting the employee's claim that a serious health condition described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) is causing the employee to be unable return to work for the required 12 weeks. In cases where an agency's determination regarding whether to apply the reimbursement requirement relies on a health condition that is not related to the applicable birth or placement or that applies to a person not covered by paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the agency may also require a medical certification. An agency may require additional examinations and certification from other health care providers if it deems it necessary, but any such additional examinations must be at the agency's expense.
(h)
Circumstances beyond employee's control.
The circumstances beyond the employee's control referenced in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section must be ones that truly preclude an employee from returning to work with the employing agency. Examples of situations beyond the employee's control include such situations as where a parent chooses to stay home because a child has a serious health condition or an employee moves because the employee's spouse is unexpectedly transferred to a job location more than 75 miles from the employee's worksite. Matters of employee preference or convenience will not suffice. For example, a situation where an employee chooses not to return to work to stay home with a well, newborn child would not constitute a circumstance beyond the employee's control for purposes of this exception.
(i)
Multiple agencies involved.
If an employee does not complete the 12-
week work obligation and if more than one agency provided Government contributions on behalf of an employee for that employee's health insurance coverage during a period of paid parental leave, each agency is responsible for making a determination regarding whether to apply the reimbursement requirement described in paragraph (f) of this section with respect to periods of paid parental leave during employment with the agency. The employing agency that employed the employee at the time use of paid parental leave concluded is responsible for informing any other affected agency of the employee's failure to complete the required 12 weeks of work and of its determination regarding application of the reimbursement requirement. Any other affected agency will make its own determination regarding application of the reimbursement requirement associated with agency employment.
(j)
Agency policies on applying the reimbursement requirement.
Each agency is responsible for adopting its own set of policies governing when it will or will not apply the reimbursement requirement described in paragraph (f) of this section. A single agency-wide set of policies should be in place so that employees within an agency are treated consistently.
(k)
Collection of reimbursement.
The reimbursement requirement described in paragraph (f) of this section, if imposed, is subject to collection as a debt owed to the affected agency. (See the Federal Claims Collection Standards in 31 CFR parts 900 through 904.)
§ 630.1706
Cases of employee incapacitation.
(a) If an agency determines that an otherwise eligible employee who could have made an election during a past period to substitute paid parental leave (as provided in § 630.1703) and enter a work obligation agreement (as described in § 630.1705) was physically or mentally incapable of doing so during that past period, the employee may, within 5 workdays of the employee's return to duty status, make an election to substitute paid parental leave for applicable FMLA unpaid leave under § 630.1703(a) on a retroactive basis. Such a retroactive election shall be effective on the date that such an election would have been effective if the employee had not been incapacitated at the time. Consistent with § 630.1206(f)(4), this retroactive election must be made in conjunction with a retroactive election under § 630.1203(b), if the FMLA unpaid leave was not already approved. As part of such election, the employee must agree (in writing, as described in § 630.1705(b)(1)) to meet the work obligation or pay the required reimbursement (if applicable) unless—
(1) Applying the work obligation and the associated reimbursement requirement is barred under § 630.1705(f)(2); or
(2) The agency later concludes under its policies established under § 630.1705(f)(1) that the circumstances support a determination to not apply the reimbursement requirement.
(b)(1) If an agency determines that an otherwise eligible employee is physically or mentally incapable of making an election to substitute paid parental leave (as provided in § 630.1703) and entering into a work obligation agreement (as described in § 630.1705), the agency must, upon the request of a personal representative of the employee whom the agency finds acceptable, provide conditional approval of substitution of paid parental leave for applicable FMLA unpaid leave under § 630.1703(a) on a prospective basis. The conditional approval is based on the presumption that the employee would have elected to substitute paid parental leave for the applicable FMLA unpaid leave and would have entered into the work obligation agreement if the employee had not been incapacitated. Within 5 workdays after returning to work, the employee must enter into a written agreement to meet the work obligation described in § 630.1705 or pay the required reimbursement (if applicable) unless—
(i) Applying the work obligation and the associated reimbursement requirement is barred under § 630.1705(f)(2); or
(ii) The agency later concludes under its policies established under § 630.1705(f)(1) that the circumstances support a determination to not apply the reimbursement requirement.
(2) If an employee covered by paragraph (b)(1) of this section declines to
enter into the written agreement after being determined by the agency to no longer be incapacitated, the agency must cancel any portion of the 12 weeks of paid parental leave that has not been exhausted, and designate as invalid any paid parental leave that was used based on the conditional approval. The time covered by the invalidated paid parental leave must be converted to leave without pay unless the employee requests that other paid leave or paid time off to the employee's credit be applied (as appropriate) in place of the invalidated paid parental leave. To the extent the employee has invalidated paid parental leave hours not replaced by other paid leave or paid time off, pay received for those hours is a debt to the employing agency and is subject to collection under the Federal Claims Collection Standards in 31 CFR parts 900 through 904.
§ 630.1707
Cases of multiple children born or placed in the same time period.
(a) If an employee has multiple children born or placed on the same day, the multiple-child birth/placement event is considered to be a single event that triggers a single entitlement of up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave under § 630.1703(b).
(b) If an employee has one or more children born or placed during the 12-month period following the date of an earlier birth or placement of a child of the employee, the provisions of this subpart shall be independently administered for each birth or placement event. Any paid parental leave substituted for FMLA unpaid leave during the 12-month period beginning on the date of a child's birth or placement shall count towards the 12-week limit on paid parental leave described in § 630.1703(b) applicable in connection with the birth or placement involved. The substitution of paid parental leave may count toward multiple 12-week limits to the extent that there are multiple ongoing 12-month periods beginning on the date of an applicable birth or placement, each of which encompasses the day on which the leave is used. Therefore, whenever paid parental leave is substituted during periods of time when separate 12-month periods (each beginning on a date of birth or placement) overlap, the paid parental leave will count toward each affected period's 12-week limit. For example, if an employee has a child born on June 1 and another child placed for adoption on October 1 of the same year, each event would generate entitlement to substitute up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave during the separate 12-month periods beginning on the date of the birth and on the date of the placement, respectively. Those two 12-month periods would be June 1-May 31 and October 1-September 30. The overlap period for these two 12-month periods would be October 1-May 31. If the employee substitutes paid parental leave during that overlap period, that amount of paid parental leave would count towards both the 12-week limit associated with the birth event and the 12-week limit associated with the placement event.
§ 630.1708
Records and reports.
(a)
Record of usage of paid parental leave.
An agency must maintain an accurate record of an employee's usage of paid parental leave.
(b)
Reporting.
In agency data systems (including timekeeping systems) and in data reports submitted to OPM, an agency must record usage of paid parental leave in the manner prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management.
