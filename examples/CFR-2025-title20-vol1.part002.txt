An employee has an initial period of continuing unemployment from June 14 through July 25 and is unemployed on all days in that period. The employee's first registration period covers June 14 to June 27, and his subsequent registration periods cover June 28 to July 11 and July 12 to July 25. Under paragraph (c) of this section, a one-week waiting period applies to his first registration period and the employee is therefore paid benefits for days of unemployment in excess of seven in that period. The employee is then paid benefits for days of unemployment in excess of four in each of the two ensuing registration periods. [Note: if this employee's period of continuing unemployment had been the result of a strike in the establishment, premises, or enterprise at which the employee was last employed, then under paragraph (d) of this section, no benefits would be payable for the period June 14 to June 27, and benefits would then be payable for days of unemployment in excess of four in each of the ensuing registration periods.]
(2)
Example 2.
Same facts as in example 1, but the employee is unemployed again beginning August 18. Since August 18 is more than 15 days after July
25, the end of his last registration period, the employee begins a new period of continuing unemployment. The employee's first registration period in the new period of continuing unemployment covers August 18 to August 31. The employee is paid benefits for days of unemployment in excess of seven in that registration period because that period is the employee's first registration period in a new period of continuing unemployment commencing in the benefit year beginning July 1, and he or she did not previously have a waiting period in any registration period earlier in that benefit year. The employee's next registration period covers September 1 to September 14, and the employee returned to work on September 12. In that registration period, the employee has 11 days of unemployment and is therefore paid benefits for days of unemployment in excess of four.
(3)
Example 3.
Same facts as in examples 1 and 2, but the employee then has a new period of continuing unemployment beginning November 1 in the same benefit year. November 1 to November 14 is the employee's first registration period in that period of continuing unemployment. The employee is paid benefits for days of unemployment in excess of four in that registration period and for days of unemployment in excess of four in any subsequent registration period in the same benefit year because earlier in the benefit year the employee had a registration period, August 18 to August 31, in which he or she satisfied the waiting period.
(g)
Remuneration exceeds base year compensation.
(1) No benefits are payable to any otherwise eligible employee for any day of unemployment in a registration period where the total amount of remuneration, as defined in part 322 of this chapter, payable to the employee during a registration period exceeds the amount of the base year monthly compensation base. For this purpose an employee is considered to have received the amount he would have earned except for the fact that he declined suitable work available to him or her during the registration period.
(2) Days of unemployment which are not compensable by virtue of paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall nevertheless be counted as days of unemployment for purposes of determining whether the general waiting period, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, has been satisfied, and for purposes of determining a period of continuing unemployment.
(h)
Pay for time lost.
An employee may claim unemployment benefits in accordance with this part even though he or she is also pursuing a claim for pay for time lost or other remuneration. If such pay is awarded to the employee with respect to any day for which the Board has paid him or her unemployment benefits, the Board will recover the amount of unemployment benefits that was paid for any day or days for which he or she was awarded pay for time lost. See part 322 of this chapter. It is the employee's responsibility to tell the Board that he or she has filed or intends to file a claim for time lost.

§ 325.2
Procedure for registering for unemployment benefits.
(a)
Registering as unemployed.
To claim unemployment benefits for any day, an employee must register as unemployed by doing the following:
(1) Apply for unemployment benefits and employment service in accordance with § 325.3;
(2) File a claim in accordance with § 325.4; and
(3) Provide any other information that the Board needs to properly adjudicate his or her right to unemployment benefits.
(b)
No benefits payable without registration.
No unemployment benefits shall be paid to any otherwise qualified employee with respect to any day claimed as a day of unemployment, and no waiting period credit shall be allowed, until such time as the employee has complied with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
(c)
When a registration period may begin.
When registering for unemployment benefits, an employee may claim benefits for any calendar day on which he or she is unemployed and believes himself or herself to be eligible for benefits. A registration period may begin
as early as the first calendar day on which an employee is unemployed following his or her last day of work even though such first calendar day would have been a rest day if the employee had not become unemployed. However, a registration period may not begin with any calendar day with respect to which an employee has received or will receive remuneration.

# Example 1.
An employee whose rest days are Saturday and Sunday is laid off on Friday, September 2, after working his regular shift on that day. His first 14-day registration period could start as early as Saturday, September 3. A registration period starting on September 3 would end on September 16. If he continues to be unemployed, his next registration period could begin September 17 and end September 30, and so forth.

# Example 2.
An employee whose rest days are Saturday and Sunday is laid off on Friday, September 2, but he decides to take two weeks' vacation pay covering days through Friday, September 16. Because he will have received remuneration for days through September 16, his claim for unemployment benefits could begin on Saturday, September 17, if he continues to be unemployed after his vacation ends.

# Example 3.
An employee whose rest days are Saturday and Sunday is laid off on Monday, September 5, after working his regular shift on that day. His first 14-day registration period could begin on Tuesday, September 6, the first day on which he was unemployed following his last day of work.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3220-0166)
§ 325.3
Application for unemployment benefits and employment service.
(a)
Requirement.
An unemployed employee who wishes to claim unemployment benefits shall apply for such benefits by completing the form prescribed by the Board for that purpose. Such form shall also constitute an application for employment service. An application will be required at the beginning of each period of unemployment in a benefit year unless:
(1) The employee filed an application for an initial period of unemployment in a benefit year and has a subsequent period of unemployment within the same benefit year; or
(2) The employee had filed an application for benefits for a period of unemployment that began in the preceding benefit year and the period of unemployment continued into the next ensuing benefit year.
In either of these circumstances, the initial application will be treated as an application for days in the subsequent period of unemployment or as an application for days in the next ensuing benefit year, as the case may be.
(b)
Purpose of application.
An application for unemployment benefits and employment service is a document that serves three purposes. First, it identifies an employee who has become unemployed and wishes to begin receiving unemployment benefits. Second, it assists the Board in determining whether the applicant is a qualified employee and if so, whether any of the information reported on the application affects his or her eligibility for payment of benefits. Third, it assists the Board in placing the employee in any suitable employment that may be available.
(c)
Time for filing application.
An employee may deliver or mail his or her application to any Board office, but such application must be received at a Board office within 30 calendar days of the first day that the employee intends to claim as a day of unemployment. For example, if an employee becomes unemployed on October 31 and intends to claim unemployment benefits for days starting November 1, the application must reach a Board office no later than November 30. If the application is received December 1, the employee may not be paid unemployment benefits for November 1 as such day would not be considered as a “day of unemployment”. If an employee returns to work and then becomes unemployed again within the same benefit year, he or she is not required to file a new application for benefits and employment service but need only contact the nearest Board office to obtain a claim form and file such form as described in § 325.4.
(d)
Extension of time for filing.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this section, the Board will consider an application for unemployment benefits as timely filed if:
(1) The employee can show that he or she made a reasonable effort to file the form on time but was prevented from doing so by circumstances beyond his or her control; provided, however, that
lack of diligence, forgetfulness or lack of knowledge of the time limit for applying shall not be considered to be a circumstance beyond the employee's control; and
(2) The employee files an application within one year of the day or days that he or she claims as a day or days of unemployment.
§ 325.4
Claim for unemployment benefits.
(a)
Requirement.
After an unemployed employee has applied for unemployment benefits in accordance with § 325.3, he or she shall claim a day as a day of unemployment by registering with respect to such day. Registration shall be made on the claim form provided by the Board to the employee.
(b)
Claim.
A claim for unemployment benefits shall cover a period of 14 consecutive calendar days. Each such 14-day period shall be a registration period. An employee shall provide the information called for by the claim form and shall file his or her claim in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Time for filing.
A claim for unemployment benefits shall be filed at any Board office no later than 15 calendar days after the last day of the claim period, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, or 15 calendar days after the date on which the claim form was mailed to the employee, whichever is later. In determining whether the time for filing the claim may be extended, the standards set forth in § 325.3(d) shall be applied. None of the days included in a claim that is not timely filed shall be considered a day of unemployment.
(d)
Claim for new period of unemployment.
An employee who has complied with the application requirement under § 325.3 with respect to a period of unemployment in a benefit year, and who again becomes unemployed in the same benefit year, need not file a new application but may initiate a claim for benefits for days in such subsequent period by calling or visiting the nearest district office of the Board to request a claim form. Such request shall be made no later than 30 calendar days after the first day for which the employee wishes to claim benefits. Upon receipt of a request under this paragraph, the district office shall provide the employee with a claim form which shall show the beginning and ending dates of the registration period covered by the claim form, with the first day shown on the claim form being no earlier than the 30th day before the date on which the employee requested the claim form, unless the delay may be excused by applying the standards set forth in § 325.3(d).
(e)
Delayed claims.
If an employee makes an initial application and claim for benefits in accordance with this part but does not continue to file ongoing claims because he or she receives an initial determination denying his or her application or claim for benefits and if, upon review, the denial is reversed by an appeals referee or other authorized reviewing official, the employee shall have 30 days from the date of the notice of the reversal in which to file a claim or claims for benefits for the days that he or she would have claimed as days of unemployment but for the initial determination denying benefits. The appeals referee or other reviewing official, as appropriate, shall notify the employee of the 30-day time limit imposed by this paragraph. An employee whose claim for benefits has been denied may continue to claim any additional day or days for which he or she believes that he or she is eligible for benefits.
(f)
Claim required for waiting period.
The requirement to file a claim for unemployment benefits includes a requirement to file a claim for the non-compensable waiting period described in § 325.1(d), except that the Director of Unemployment and Sickness Insurance may waive such requirement in connection with unemployment resulting from a work stoppage or other labor dispute.
(g)
Withdrawal of claim.
An employee may withdraw his or her claim for unemployment benefits by submitting a written statement to that effect and by repaying any benefits paid on the claim, unless the employee's claim was intentionally false or fraudulent.
[54 FR 24551, June 8, 1989, as amended at 58 FR 45841, Aug. 31, 1993]
§ 325.5
Death of employee.
If an employee dies before filing one or more of the required forms, the form or forms may be filed by or in behalf of the person or persons to whom benefits would be payable pursuant to section 2(g) of the Act. Such form or forms shall be filed within the time prescribed in § 325.3. Under these circumstances, the word “employee”, as used in this part, shall include the individual or individuals by or in behalf of whom the form is filed.
§ 325.6
Verification procedures.
The Board's procedures for adjudicating and processing applications and claims for unemployment benefits filed pursuant to this part will include both pre-payment and post-payment procedures for verifying the validity of such applications and claims. Such procedures shall be designed with a view to obtaining substantial evidence as to the days of unemployment of the employees who register in accordance with this part. The verification procedures shall include, but are not limited to:
(a) Pre-payment contacts with railroad employers, utilizing data processing techniques to the extent feasible so as not to delay unduly the payment of valid claims; and
(b) Computer matching programs with state agencies or other entities that may have relevant data concerning non-railroad employment and benefit payments under state unemployment compensation laws.

Reasonable efforts to obtain work.

# Authority:
45 U.S.C. 362(i), 362(l).
§ 327.1
Introduction.
The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act provides for the payment of unemployment benefits to qualified railroad employees for days of unemployment. Under section 1(k) of the Act, an unemployed employee must be “available for work” as a condition of eligibility for unemployment benefits for any day claimed as a day of unemployment. This part defines the phrase “available for work” and explains how the Board will apply that phrase to claims for unemployment benefits.
[55 FR 1811, Jan. 19, 1990]
§ 327.5
Meaning of “available for work”.
(a)
General definition.
A claimant for unemployment benefits is available for work if he is willing and ready to work.
(b)
Willing to work.
A claimant is willing to work if he is willing to accept and perform for hire such work as is reasonably appropriate to his circumstances in view of factors such as:
(1) The current practices recognized by management and labor with respect to such work;
(2) The degree of risk involved to the claimant's health, safety, and morals;
(3) His physical fitness and prior training;
(4) His experience and prior earnings;
(5) His length of unemployment and prospects for obtaining work; and
(6) The distance of the work from his residence and from his most recent work.
(c)
Ready to work.
A claimant is ready to work if he:
(1) Is in a position to receive notice of work which he is willing to accept and perform, and
(2) Is prepared to be present with the customary equipment at the location of such work within the time usually allotted.
(d)
Deemed available for work.
During the period extending from March 1, 2020 until December 31, 2020, a claimant will be deemed to be available for work during any period for which he or she is subject to a state or local order related to the public health emergency declared effective March 1, 2020 preventing him or her from reporting to work.
[Board Order 53-296, 18 FR 8157, Dec. 12, 1953, as amended at 85 FR 19386, Apr. 7, 2020]
§ 327.10
Consideration of availability.
(a)
Initial proof.
A claimant who registers for unemployment benefits in accordance with the provisions of part 325
of this chapter shall, absent any evidence to the contrary, initially be considered available for work. Evidence that a claimant may not be available for work shall include any evidence provided by the claimant's base year employer(s) pursuant to section 5(b) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act.
(b)
Information indicating unavailability.
If the office of the Board which is adjudicating a claimant's claims for benefits receives information indicating that the claimant may not be available for work, he shall be required to submit evidence of his availability for work, and no benefits shall thereafter be paid with respect to any day in the period of the claimant's unemployment unless sufficient evidence of the claimant's availability for work on such day is presented.
(c)
Employee who has retired voluntarily.
An employee who has retired voluntarily shall be presumed not to be eligible for unemployment benefits. An employee shall be regarded as having retired voluntarily if his not being in the active service of his employer is due to an agreement between his labor organization and his employer requiring retirement upon attaining a certain age.
(d)
Equivalent of full-time work.
(1) A claimant who is continuously employed from week to week under a work schedule that provides the equivalent of full-time employment shall not be considered available for work with respect to any rest day or other non-work day within a 14-day registration period.
(2) The application of paragraph (d) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1):
A claimant's regular work schedule requires him or her to work five nine-hour days one week followed by three nine-hour days and one eight-hour day in the next week. The claimant has five non-work days within this two-week period. The claimant is not considered available for work on those non-work days.

# Example (2):
On Monday an employee who has been working a shift which has Saturdays and Sundays off changes to a shift which normally has Wednesdays and Thursdays off. As a consequence, the employee has six non-work days within a 14-day period. The employee is not considered available for work with respect to any of the six non-work days.

# Example (3):
An employee regularly receives remuneration for 40 hours per week by working 10 hours on each of four days per week, thus giving him or her six rest days in a 14-day period. The employee will not be considered available for work on the rest days.
(e)
Attendance in school or training course.
(1) A claimant who has voluntarily left work to enroll as a student in an educational institution shall be presumed not to be available for work. For the purpose of this provision, leaving work is considered voluntary when the claimant on his or her own initiative left work that he or she could have continued to perform but for the claimant's decision to attend school. In all other cases, this presumption shall not apply, but eligibility shall instead be determined on the basis of the facts of each case. In each such case, the claimant shall be given an opportunity to establish that he or she remains ready and willing to engage in full-time employment for hire, notwithstanding his or her school attendance. If a claimant is enrolled in a vocational training program at a trade or technical school, he or she shall be considered available for work if his or her current prospects for work are poor and the vocational training can reasonably be expected to increase his or her prospects for obtaining new employment.
(2)
Examples.
The application of paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example (1):
An individual is laid off by his or her railroad employer. Instead of looking for other employment, the individual decides to enter college in order to become a teacher. He or she is enrolled as a full-time day student. The individual is not available for work.

# Example (2):
An employee is furloughed by his or her railroad employer and will not likely be able to return to railroad work. After making a reasonable effort to obtain work and finding none, the individual enrolls in a six-month course of training, which upon completion would permit him or her to obtain an entry level job in the data processing industry. The individual is considered available for work while training for the data processing job.
(f)
Failure to work in anticipation of maximum mileage.
(1) An employee in
train and engine service who voluntarily lays off work in anticipation of reaching the maximum mileage or earnings permitted under an agreement with his or her employer shall not be considered available for work.
(2)
Example.
Halfway through the month an engineer has worked in train service covering 2,000 miles. By agreement with his or her employer he or she may not operate a train in excess of 3,000 miles per month. In order to allow engineers with less seniority to perform service, the engineer lays off work for five days. The engineer is not considered available for work on those days.
(g)
Confinement.
A claimant who is confined in a penal institution or is in the custody of a Federal, State or local governmental unit or official thereof shall not be considered available for work. An individual shall not be considered in the custody of a governmental unit or official thereof if he or she has been released on bail and is awaiting trial or he or she has been placed on probation or parole. However, an individual who has been released from custody by a governmental unit or official thereof under a program that permits leave from custody of a short duration, after which he or she must return to custody, shall not be considered available for work on those days on which he or she is on furlough from confinement.
(h)
Missed turns in pool service.
A train and engine service employee assigned to pool service shall not be considered as ready to work, within the meaning of § 327.5(c) of this part, with respect to any day on which such employee would have worked if he or she had not missed his or her turn in pool service employment.
[Board Order 53-296, 18 FR 8157, Dec. 12, 1953, as amended by Board Order 55-30, 20 FR 1015, Feb. 17, 1955; 55 FR 1811, Jan. 19, 1990]
§ 327.15
Reasonable efforts to obtain work.
(a)
Requirement.
A claimant may be required at any time to show, as evidence of willingness to work, that he is making reasonable efforts to obtain work which he professes to be willing to accept and perform, unless he has good prospects of obtaining such work or his circumstances are such that any efforts to obtain work other than by making application for employment service pursuant to § 325.3 of this chapter would be fruitless to the claimant.
(b)
Failure to comply with requirement.
When the office of the Board which is adjudicating claims for benefits has information that the claimant has failed to comply with the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, no benefits shall be paid with respect to any days in the period of the claimant's unemployment unless sufficient evidence of the claimant's availability for work on such days is presented.
(c)
What constitutes reasonable efforts.
A claimant shall be considered as making reasonable efforts to obtain work when he takes such steps toward obtaining work as are appropriate to his circumstances. In determining what steps are appropriate to a claimant's circumstances, consideration shall be given to actions such as:
(1) Registering with a union hiring or placement facility;
(2) Applying for employment with former employers;
(3) Making application with employers including individuals and companies not covered by the act, who may reasonably be expected to have openings in work suitable for him;
(4) Responding to appropriate “want ads” for work which appears suitable for him;
(5) Actively prosecuting his claim for reinstatement in his former work;
(6) Any other action reasonably directed toward obtaining work.

Daily rate of compensation.

§ 330.1
Introduction.
The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act provides for the payment of benefits, at a specified daily benefit rate, to any qualified employee for his or her days of unemployment or days of sickness, subject to a maximum amount per day. The “daily benefit rate” for an employee is the amount of benefits that he or she may receive for each compensable day of unemployment or sickness in any registration period in a period of continuing unemployment or sickness.
[65 FR 19648, Apr. 12, 2000]
§ 330.2
Computation of daily benefit rate.
(a)
Basic formula.
A qualified employee's daily benefit rate for a given benefit year, as defined in part 302 of this chapter, is an amount equal to 60 percent of the employee's daily rate of compensation for his or her last railroad employment in the applicable base year, but such rate will not exceed the maximum amount set forth in paragraph (b) of this section nor will it be less than $12.70 per day.
(b)
Maximum daily benefit rate.
The maximum daily benefit rate is the product of the monthly compensation base, as computed under part 302 of this chapter, for the base year immediately preceding the beginning of the benefit year, multiplied by five percent. If the maximum daily benefit rate so computed is not a multiple of $1.00, the Board will round it down to the nearest multiple of $1.00.
(c)
When increase effective.
Whenever the annual application of the formula in paragraph (b) of this section triggers an increase in the maximum daily benefit rate, such increase will apply to days of unemployment or days of sickness in registration periods beginning after June 30 of the calendar year immediately following the base year referred to in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Notice.
Whenever the annual application of the formula in paragraph (b) of this section triggers an increase in the maximum daily benefit rate, or if the annual application of the formula does not trigger an increase, the Board will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
explaining how it computed the maximum daily benefit rate for the year. The Board will also notify each employer of the maximum amount of the daily benefit rate. The Board will make the computation as soon as it has computed the amount of the monthly compensation base under part 302 of this chapter and will publish notice as soon as possible thereafter, but in no event later than June 1 of each year. Information as to the current amount of the maximum daily benefit rate will also be available in any Board district or regional office.
(e)
Sources of information.
In determining an employee's daily rate of compensation for the purpose of computing his or her daily benefit rate, the Board will rely on information furnished by the employee and his or her last employer in the base year. An employee's earnings from employment not covered by the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act are not considered in computing his or her daily benefit rate.
[56 FR 28702, June 24, 1991, as amended at 65 FR 19648, Apr. 12, 2000]
§ 330.3
Daily rate of compensation.
(a)
Definition.
An employee's daily rate of compensation is his or her straight-time rate of pay, including any cost-of-living allowance provided in any applicable working agreement. It does not include any overtime pay, penalty payment, or other special allowance except as hereinafter provided. An employer's or employee's report of the daily rate of compensation shall, in the absence of information to the contrary, and subject to the considerations set forth in this section and §§ 330.4 and 330.5, be considered to show the daily rate of compensation of the employee by or for whom the report has been furnished. Where a rate other than a daily rate is reported, the Board will convert it to a daily rate.
(b)
Hourly, weekly or monthly rate.
An hourly rate shall be converted to a daily rate by multiplying such hourly rate by the number of hours constituting a working day for the employee's occupation or class of service. A weekly or monthly rate shall be converted to a daily rate by dividing such rate by the number of working days
constituting the work week or work month, as the case may be, for the employee's occupation or class of service.
(c)
Mileage rate.
When a collective bargaining agreement provides for payment of compensation on a mileage basis, the employee's daily rate of compensation is his or her rate of pay for the number of miles constituting a basic day, including any allowance, as prescribed by the agreement, that is added to his or her basic rate of pay for the number of miles constituting a basic day.
(d)
Piece rate or tonnage rate.
Where a piece rate or tonnage rate is reported, the daily rate of compensation shall be determined by computing the employee's average earnings per day for the days on which he or she worked substantially full time (excluding any overtime pay or penalty rates) at such piece rate or tonnage rate during the last two pay periods in which he or she engaged in such work in the base year.
(e)
Commissions or percentage of sales.
Where the compensation reported consists of or includes commissions or percentages of sales, the daily rate of such commissions or percentage of sales shall be determined by computing the employee's average net commissions or percentage earnings (excluding any amounts he or she received to compensate him or her for expenses) per day for the days in the last two pay periods in which he or she worked on a commission or percentage basis in the base year.
(f)
International service.
In the case of an employee who, on his last day of employment in the base year, worked partly outside the United States and partly in the United States for an employer not conducting the principal part of its business in the United States, the employee's daily rate of compensation shall be determined in the same manner as it would if all his service on that day had been rendered in the United States.
§ 330.4
Last railroad employment in the base year.
The phrase “last railroad employment in the applicable base year,” as used in § 330.2(a) of this part, means generally the employee's last “service performed as an employee,” within the meaning of section 1(g) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. If an employee did not actually perform any service as an employee in the applicable base year (the calendar year preceding a benefit year) but did receive qualifying compensation such as vacation pay or pay for time lost for days in such base year, the Board will consider that his or her last railroad employment in the base year was the employment on which the qualifying compensation was based. The daily rate of such compensation shall be deemed to be the employee's daily rate of compensation for purposes of this part. If an employee's last railroad employment in the base year was casual or temporary work and was performed while on furlough from other base year railroad employment, the Board will disregard the daily rate of compensation paid for the casual or temporary work if such rate of compensation produces a daily benefit rate lower than the daily benefit rate based on the daily rate of compensation for the employment from which the employee was furloughed.
§ 330.5
Procedure for obtaining and using information about daily rate of compensation.
(a)
Information furnished by employers.
Every employer, as defined in part 301 of this chapter, shall furnish information to the Board with respect to the daily rate of compensation of each employee for his or her last employment in the applicable base year. The employer shall make such report when it files its annual report of compensation in accordance with part 209 of this chapter and shall use the form prescribed by the Board for that purpose. If an employee's last daily rate of compensation in the base year is $99.99 or more, the employer may report such rate as $99.99 instead of the employee's actual last daily rate of compensation. In the absence of evidence to the contrary or a challenge by the employee, the daily rate of compensation provided by an employer under this section shall be used to compute a qualified employee's daily benefit rate. If an employer fails to report the last daily rate of compensation for a qualified employee who has applied for benefits
or if an employee challenges the daily rate reported by an employer, the procedure in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section will apply.
(b)
Information furnished by employee.
The Board will afford an employee an opportunity to establish his or her last daily rate of compensation if the base year employer did not report a rate for the employee on its annual report of compensation or if the employee challenges the accuracy of the rate reported by the employer. Unless deemed unreasonable, a daily rate of compensation reported by an employee under this paragraph will be used provisionally to compute his or her daily benefit rate, but such rate will be verified in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. In any case in which the employee's report is deemed unreasonable and no employer report has been provided, the employee's report shall be disregarded, and the Board will seek to verify the employee's last daily pay rate in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Pending receipt of such verification, the employee's daily benefit rate shall be set at $12.70. When an unverified and uncorrected pay rate has been verified or corrected, appropriate redetermination of the daily benefit rate shall be made, and such redetermined benefit rate shall be applied to all the employee's days of unemployment or sickness in the benefit year.
(c)
Employer verification.
Whenever an employee has established a daily rate of compensation under paragraph (b) of this section, the Board will request the employee's base year employer to verify such rate within 30 days. If such verification is not received within 30 days, the employee's daily rate of compensation may be based upon other evidence gathered by the Board if such evidence is reasonable in light of compensation rates reported for other employees of the base year employer in the same occupation or class of service as the employer or in light of previous compensation rates reported by the base year employer for its employees. A daily benefit rate established under this paragraph may not exceed the maximum daily benefit rate established under this part.
(d)
Protest.
An employee who is dissatisfied with the daily benefit rate computed under this part may contest such computation in accordance with part 320 of this chapter.

§ 332.1
Statutory provisions.
* * * (1) a day of unemployment with respect to any employee, means a calendar day on which he is able to work and is available for work and with respect to which * * * no remuneration is payable or accrues to him * * * and (2) a “day of sickness”, with respect to any employee, means a calendar day on which because of any physical, mental, psychological, or nervous injury, illness, sickness, or disease he is not able to work, or, with respect to a female employee, a calendar day on which, because of pregnancy, miscarriage, or the birth of a child, (i) she is unable to work or (ii) working would be injurious to her health, and with respect to which * * * no remuneration is payable or accrues to him * * *
Provided, further,
That any calendar day on which no remuneration is payable to or accrues to an employee solely because of the application to him of mileage or work restrictions agreed upon in schedule agreements between employers and employees or solely because he is standing by for or laying over between regularly assigned trips or tours of duty shall not be considered either a day of unemployment or a day of sickness. (Section 1(k), Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act)
[Board Order 68-72, 33 FR 11115, Aug. 6, 1968]
§ 332.2
General considerations.
(a)
Classes of service covered.
Conditions under which remuneration with respect to a day may not be payable to
or accrue to an employee solely because of the application to him of a mileage or work restriction exist in train-and-engine service, yard service, dining-car service, sleeping-car service, and other Pullman-car service, and similar service, and express service on trains. In the determination of a claim for benefits of an employee in any other service, the employee's lack of remuneration with respect to any claimed day shall be presumed not to be due solely to the application of a mileage or work restriction. Conditions under which remuneration with respect to a day may not be payable to or accrue to an employee solely because he is standing by for or laying over between regularly assigned trips or tours of duty exist in train-and-engine service, dining-car service, sleeping-car service, and other Pullman-car service, and similar service, and express service on trains. In the determination of a claim for benefits of an employee in any other service, the employee's lack of remuneration with respect to any claimed day shall be presumed not to be due solely to his standing by for or laying over between regularly assigned trips or tours of duty.
(b)
Sickness claims.
An employee who, in connection with a claim to a day as a day of sickness, is held to be not able to work because of any physical, mental, psychological, or nervous injury, illness, sickness, or disease shall not be considered to lack remuneration with respect to such day solely because of the application to him of mileage or work restrictions or solely because he is standing by for or laying over between regularly assigned trips or tours of duty. Nor shall a female employee be considered to lack remuneration with respect to a day solely because of the application to her of mileage or work restrictions or solely because she is standing by for or laying over between regularly assigned trips or tours of duty if the day is one on which, because of pregnancy, miscarriage, or the birth of a child, (1) she is unable to work or (2) working would be injurious to her health.
[Board Order 59-95, 24 FR 3372, Apr. 30, 1959, as amended at 26 FR 8593, Sept. 14, 1961; Board Order 68-72, 33 FR 11115, Aug. 6, 1968]
§ 332.3
Mileage and work restrictions.
Subject to the provisions of § 332.2(b), a day shall not be considered as a day of unemployment or as a day of sickness with respect to an employee if no remuneration is payable or accrues to him solely because of the application to him of a mileage or work restriction agreed upon in a written agreement between his employer and employees of his employer, or authorized pursuant to such written agreement. Provisions of agreements setting overtime or other premium rates of pay shall not be regarded as work restrictions. Mileage or work restrictions shall be considered as applicable to an employee with respect to any day on which he is out of service because of having reached or exceeded the maximum mileage, earnings, or hours of work prescribed in such an agreement, or authorized pursuant to such an agreement. Performance of other work by an employee while he is out of service because of having reached or exceeded the maximum mileage, earnings, or hours of work shall not serve to make the mileage or work restriction inapplicable to him.
§ 332.4
Restrictions in extra service.
Mileage or work restrictions shall be considered to exist in rotating extra board, pool, or chain gang service when there is in effect an arrangement between the employer and its employees for increasing or decreasing the number of employees in such service according to the amount of work available. When the arrangement is such that an employee in extra board, pool, or chain gang service gets the equivalent of full-time work, his lack of remuneration on any non-work day shall, subject to the provisions of § 332.2(b), be considered as due solely to the application to him of a mileage or work restriction.
§ 332.5
Equivalent of full-time work.
An employee who has the equivalent of full-time work with respect to service on days within a registration period is not eligible for unemployment benefits for any non-work days within such registration period. In determining whether an employee has the equivalent of full-time work, the Board will
consider the provisions of labor-management agreements that prescribe the number of miles or hours of credit constituting a basic work day, week, or month in the employee's occupation or service. The Board will consider that an employee had the equivalent of full-time work if the number of miles or hours credited to the employee for service in the registration period is at least 10 times the number of miles or hours constituting a basic day in the employee's occupation or service. For this purpose, any miles or hours of credit not earned because the employee missed his or her turn and any penalty miles assessed to the employee shall be added to the miles or hours of credit actually earned on the basis of service on days within the registration period.
[55 FR 1813, Jan. 19, 1990]
§ 332.6
Standing by for and laying over between regularly assigned trips or tours of duty.
Subject to the provisions of § 332.2(b), a day shall not be considered as a day of unemployment or as a day of sickness with respect to an employee if no remuneration is payable or accrues to him solely because he is standing by for or laying over between regularly assigned trips or tours of duty. Only employees who hold regular assignments may be regarded as standing by for or laying over between regularly assigned trips or tours of duty. In determining whether an employee has a regular assignment, consideration shall be given to whether the trips or tours of duty have definite starting times; whether there are a definite number of trips or tours of duty, either periodically or for the whole duration of the assignment; and whether there is a definite route of each trip or definite duration of each tour of duty. An employee who is separated from a regular assignment shall not be regarded as standing by for or laying over between regularly assigned trips or tours of duty. An employee shall be deemed separated from a regular assignment when he is suspended or discharged from service or displaced by a senior employee or held out of service for investigation or discipline, or when his regular assignment is abolished or discontinued.
§ 332.7
Consideration of evidence.
An employee shall be requested to furnish such information as to any mileage or work restrictions or as to lay-over or stand-by status as may be necessary for the determination of his claim. An employee's statement in connection with his claim that he was not out of service because of a lay-over or stand-by rule or because of a mileage or work restriction shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be accepted as sufficient for a finding on that point. An employee's report of the number of miles or hours' credit earned in rotating extra board, pool, or chain gang service shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be accepted as correct for purposes of determining whether he had the equivalent of full-time work during the period covered by his claim. When it appears clear that an employee in rotating extra board, pool, or chain gang service who fails to report the number of miles or hours' credit earned on days in the period covered by his claim form was not employed on enough days to have had the equivalent of full-time work in the period, no additional information as to mileage or work restrictions shall be deemed necessary for the determination of his claim.

§ 335.1
General.
(a)
Statutory basis.
The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act provides for the payment of sickness benefits to a qualified railroad employee for days of sickness within a period of continuing sickness. To establish basic eligibility for sickness benefits, a qualified employee must have at least four consecutive days of sickness with respect to
each period of continuing sickness. The terms “day of sickness” and “period of continuing sickness” as used in this part, are defined in sections 1(k) and 2(a) of the Act, respectively, and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. As evidence of days of sickness based upon illness or injury or upon pregnancy, miscarriage or childbirth, section 1(k) requires an employee to file a statement of sickness. Other information that is required to identify an employee's days of sickness is obtained by means of an application for sickness benefits at the beginning of each period of continuing sickness and by means of a claim for sickness benefits which is filed for each registration period within a period of continuing sickness. The term “registration period”, generally refers to a period of 14 consecutive days and is defined in paragraph (d) of this section.
(b)
Day of sickness.
The term “day of sickness” means, in general, any calendar day, including days that would normally be rest days, on which an employee is not able to work because of any physical or mental illness or injury. With respect to a female employee, a “day of sickness” also includes any calendar day on which she is not able to work, or working would be injurious to her health, because of pregnancy, miscarriage or childbirth.
(c)
Period of continuing sickness.
(1) The term “period of continuing sickness” refers to a period of time when an employee is not able to work on account of illness, injury, sickness or disease, including inability caused by pregnancy, miscarriage or childbirth. An employee has a period of continuing sickness under either of these circumstances:
(i) He or she has any number of “consecutive” days of sickness based on one or more infirmities; or
(ii) He or she has any number of “successive” days of sickness based on a single infirmity and there is no interruption of more than 90 “consecutive” days which are not days of sickness.
(2) Days of sickness are “consecutive” when they occur one after another continuously and without interruption by any day that is not a day of sickness. Days of sickness are “successive” when one or more days of sickness follow any day of sickness with an interval of one or more days that are not days of sickness.

# Example:
An employee is sick for 11 “consecutive” days from October 1 through October 11, meaning that each day in the period October 1 through October 11 is a day of sickness and there is no day in that period that is not a day of sickness. If the employee also had days of sickness on October 16, 17, 18, 21 and 22, those five days are considered “successive” days of sickness.
(3) A period of continuing sickness with respect to any employee begins with the first day of a number of consecutive days of sickness or with the first day of a number of successive days of sickness attributable to a single cause with no interval of more than 90 days that are not days of sickness. In the example given in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, October 1 begins a period of continuing sickness. The days October 16, 17, 18, 21, and 22 are in the period of continuing sickness beginning October 1, and benefits are payable for them, provided that the employee's inability to work on those five days is due to one or more of the same infirmities that caused the employee to be unable to work on the days from October 1 through October 11. Otherwise, October 16 begins another period of continuing sickness.
(4) A period of continuing sickness ends when either of these circumstances occurs:
(i) 91 consecutive days have elapsed none of which is a day of sickness resulting from the infirmity that was the basis for the preceding days of sickness; or
(ii) One or more days that are not days of sickness have elapsed and a statement of sickness is filed with respect to a day of sickness based on an infirmity other than any infirmity causing inability on the preceding days of sickness. The end of a benefit year, generally the 12-month period beginning July 1 of any year and ending June 30 of the next year (see 45 U.S.C. 351(m)), does not end a period of continuing sickness. In the example in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if the inability to work on October 16 was not due to an infirmity or infirmities that
caused the inability to work on October 11, then a period of continuing sickness ends on October 11. A new application and statement of sickness would be required in order for the employee to be paid sickness benefits for days beginning October 16. See § 335.2 of this part.
(5) A period of continuing sickness can be interrupted, provided that:
(i) The interruption is for not more than 90 consecutive days; and
(ii) The days of sickness after the interruption are due to one or more of the same causes as the days of sickness before the interruption. A period of continuing sickness can be interrupted any number of times so long as each interruption is not more than 90 days and the days of sickness are all due to the same cause. If a period of continuing sickness is caused by more than one infirmity, any one of the infirmities can be considered as the single continuing cause that will permit the interruption of the period of continuing sickness for not more than 90 days without ending it.
(d)
Registration period.
The term “registration period” means, with respect to any employee, the period which begins with the first day with respect to which a statement of sickness for a period of continuing sickness is filed in his or her behalf in accordance with this part, or the first such day after the end of a registration period which will have begun with a day with respect to which a statement of sickness for a period of continuing sickness was filed in his or her behalf, and ends with whichever is the earlier of:
(1) The thirteenth day thereafter; or
(2) The day immediately preceding the day with respect to which a statement of sickness for a new period of continuing sickness is filed in his or her behalf. However, each of the successive 14-day periods in an extended sickness benefit period shall constitute a registration period.
(e)
Liability for infirmity.
When sickness benefits are paid to an employee on the basis of an infirmity for which he or she recovers a personal injury settlement or judgment, the Board shall receive reimbursement for the sickness benefits in accordance with part 341 of this chapter.
§ 335.2
Manner of claiming sickness benefits.
(a)
Forms required for claiming benefits.
To claim sickness benefits for a period of inability to work due to an illness or injury, or in the case of a female employee, pregnancy, miscarriage, or childbirth, an employee must file the following forms:
(1) An application for sickness benefits at the beginning of each period of continuing sickness;
(2) A statement of sickness to accompany the employee's application;
(3) A claim for sickness benefits for each 14-day registration period during the employee's period of continuing sickness; and
(4) A supplemental doctor's statement, if the adjudicating office requests additional proof of the employee's inability to work.
(b)
Mailing or delivering the forms.
The forms required by paragraph (a) of this section may be mailed or delivered to any Board office. If the Board is satisfied that the employee is too sick or injured to execute the required forms, the Board may accept forms executed by someone in the employee's behalf. Instructions for completing and filing the forms are printed on the forms themselves.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 3220-0034, 3220-0039 and 3220-0045)
§ 335.3
Execution of statement of sickness and supplemental doctor's statement.
(a)
Who may execute.
A statement of sickness and any required supplemental doctor's statement shall be executed by any of the following individuals:
(1) A licensed medical doctor;
(2) A licensed dentist if the infirmity relates to the teeth or gums;
(3) A licensed podiatrist or chiropodist if the infirmity relates to the feet or toes;
(4) A licensed chiropractor;
(5) A clinical psychologist;
(6) A certified nurse mid-wife;
(7) The superintendent or other supervisory official of a hospital, clinic, or group health association, or similar organization, in which all examinations and treatment are conducted
under the supervision of licensed medical doctors or under the supervision of licensed chiropractors, and in which medical records are maintained for each patient;
(8) A physician assistant-certified (PAC);
(9) An accredited Christian Science Practitioner;
(10) A substance-abuse professional as defined in 49 CFR part 40.3, if the infirmity involves alcohol or controlled substances-related disorders; or
(11) A nurse practitioner.
(b)
Use of Board form or other form.
The statement of sickness and supplemental doctor's statement referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be completed on the forms prescribed by the Board, except that other standardized medical forms may be substituted if they provide the same information as that called for by the Board's forms.
[54 FR 43057, Oct. 20, 1989, as amended at 60 FR 40073, Aug. 7, 1995; 62 FR 44408, Aug. 21, 1997; 65 FR 66499, Nov. 6, 2000]
§ 335.4
Filing statement of sickness and claim for sickness benefits.
(a)
General requirement.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, statements of sickness and claims for sickness benefits must be filed within the time limits specified by this section. Failure to comply with the time restrictions on filing claims will result in a denial of benefits for days for which timely statements and claims are not filed, as such days would not be considered days of sickness.
(b)
Statement of sickness.
An employee shall file a statement of sickness within ten calendar days of the first day that he or she wishes to claim as a day of sickness. For example, if an employee wishes to claim sickness benefits for days starting November 1, the statement of sickness should reach the Board no later than November 10. If the statement of sickness is received November 11, the employee cannot be paid sickness benefits for November 1. Such day would not be considered as a “day of sickness”, unless the form may be considered as timely filed under paragraph (d)(3), (4) or (5) of this section.
(c)
Claim for sickness benefits.
An employee shall file a claim for sickness benefits within 30 days after the ending date shown on the claim form, or within 30 days after the date on which the Board mails the claim form to the employee, whichever date is later. Failure to comply with this provision shall bar the payment of sickness benefits with respect to any day included within the calendar period covered by the claim form.

# Example:
If a form for claiming sickness benefits is mailed to an employee on July 13, for the period from July 1 to July 14, the employee must file the claim within 30 days after July 14 [on or before August 13], to be paid benefits for the period July 1 to July 14. If the claim form was not mailed to the employee until July 16, the claim must be filed within 30 days after July 16 [on or before August 15].
(d)
When form considered timely filed.
The Board will consider a statement of sickness or a claim for sickness benefits as timely filed if:
(1) The statement or form was received in a Board office within the prescribed time; or
(2) The statement or form was mailed to a Board office in accordance with instructions printed on the form and was received at such office; or
(3) The employee made a reasonable effort to file the statement of sickness or claim form within the prescribed time but was prevented from doing so by circumstances beyond his or her control, and such statement or claim was received at a Board office within a reasonable time following the removal of the circumstances that prevented the employee from filing the form. The phrase “circumstances beyond his or her control” shall not include an employee's forgetfulness or lack of knowledge of the sickness benefit program or the time limit for filing for sickness benefits or any other lack of diligence by the employee. For the purposes of this provision, if a statement of sickness is not received within the prescribed time but is received within 30 days of the first day that an employee intends to claim as a day of sickness, the Board will consider that the employee made a reasonable effort to file the statement within the prescribed time, unless it is clear on the basis of affirmative evidence that the delay was not the result of circumstances beyond the employee's control; or
(4) The employee mistakenly registered for unemployment benefits when he or she should have applied for sickness benefits for the day or days claimed and the appropriate statement of sickness was then received at an office of the Board within a reasonable time after unemployment benefits were denied; or
(5) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim that is not filed within two years of the day or days claimed shall not be considered as timely filed, and such day or days shall not be considered as days of sickness.
(e)
Days for which no statement of sickness deemed filed.
A statement of sickness shall not be deemed to be filed with respect to any day in a benefit year in which the employee is not a qualified employee as defined in section 3 of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act or has exhausted his or her rights to sickness benefits under the Act. See part 336 of this chapter.
[54 FR 43057, Oct. 20, 1989, as amended at 57 FR 807, Jan. 9, 1992; 60 FR 40073, Aug. 7, 1995]
§ 335.5
Death of employee.
If an employee dies before filing one or more of the required forms, the form or forms may be filed by or in behalf of the person or persons to whom benefits would be payable pursuant to section 2(g) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. Such form or forms shall be filed within the time prescribed in § 335.4 of this part. Under these circumstances, the word “employee” as used in § 335.4(b) of this part and as used in § 335.4(d)(3) of this part shall include the individual or individuals by or in behalf of whom the form is filed. The order of distribution for benefits due but unpaid as of the date of an employee's death is the same as the order of distribution for annuities unpaid at death under the Railroad Retirement Act and may be found at § 234.31 of this title.
§ 335.6
Payment of sickness benefits.
(a)
General rule.
Except as provided in this section, benefits are payable to any qualified employee for each day of sickness after the fourth consecutive day of sickness in a period of continuing sickness, as defined in § 335.1(c), but excluding four days of sickness in any registration period in such period of continuing sickness.
(b)
Waiting period.
Benefits are payable to any qualified employee for each day of sickness in excess of seven during his or her first registration period in a period of continuing sickness if such period of continuing sickness is his or her initial period of continuing sickness beginning in the benefit year. For this purpose, the first registration period in a period of continuing sickness is the registration period that first begins with four consecutive days of sickness and includes more than four days of sickness. For the purpose of computing benefits under this section, a period of continuing sickness ends on the last day of a benefit year in which the employee exhausts rights to sickness benefits as provided for under part 336 of this chapter.
(c)
Computation of compensable days
—(1)
Example 1.
An employee has an initial period of continuing sickness from June 14 through July 25, and all days in that period are days of sickness. The employee's first registration period covers June 14 to June 27, and his or her subsequent registration period covers June 28 to July 11, and July 12 to July 25. In the one-week waiting period the employee is paid benefits for days of sickness in excess of seven. In each of the two ensuing registration periods the employee is paid benefits for days of sickness in excess of four.
(2)
Example 2.
Same facts as in Example 1, but the employee later has a new period of continuing sickness based upon a different illness or impairment beginning September 17. The employee's first registration period in his or her new period of continuing sickness covers September 17 to September 30. The employee is paid benefits for days of sickness in excess of seven in that 14-day period because that period is his or her first registration period in a new period of continuing sickness commencing in the benefit year beginning July 1, and he or she did not previously have a waiting period in any registration period earlier in the benefit year.
(3)
Example 3.
Same facts as in examples 1 and 2, but the employee then has a new period of continuing sickness beginning January 1 in the same benefit year. January 1 to January 14 is the
employee's first registration period in that period of continuing sickness. The employee is paid benefits for days of sickness in excess of four in that registration period because earlier in the benefit year he or she had a registration period, September 17 to September 30, in which he or she satisfied the initial seven-day waiting period.
(d)
Amount payable.
The gross amount of sickness benefits for any registration period in a period of continuing sickness shall be computed by multiplying the number of compensable days of sickness in such registration period by the employee's daily benefit rate, as computed under part 330 of this chapter.

# Subpart A—Normal Benefits
§ 336.1
Introduction.
(a)
General.
This subpart explains how long a qualified employee may receive normal unemployment or sickness benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act during a benefit year. Under section 2(c) of that Act, normal unemployment benefits are payable for up to 130 days of unemployment within a benefit year, or in an amount equal to the amount of the employee's “base year compensation”, whichever is less. A similar limitation applies to the payment of sickness benefits. An employee who exhausts his or her normal unemployment or sickness benefits may be eligible for payment of extended unemployment or extended sickness benefits under the conditions set forth in subpart B of this part.
(b)
Definitions.
The terms “benefit year”, “base year”, and “compensation” are defined in part 302 of this chapter. The term “registration period” is defined in parts 325 and 335 of this chapter. For the purposes of this subpart, and as explained in § 336.4 of this part, an employee's “base year compensation” may include compensation in excess of the monthly compensation base (as defined in part 302 of this chapter) even though such excess may not be counted for the purpose of determining whether such employee is a “qualified employee” within the meaning of part 302.
(c)
Recovery of benefits.
When unemployment or sickness benefits are recovered by the Board for one or more days, the Board will disregard those days in determining whether the employee has exhausted normal unemployment or sickness benefits with respect to the applicable benefit year.
§ 336.2
Duration of normal unemployment benefits.
(a)
130 compensable day limitation.
A qualified employee who has satisfied the waiting period for a benefit year may receive benefits for a maximum of 130 days of unemployment within such benefit year, subject to the limitation on payment explained in paragraph (b) of this section. In any registration period beginning after the end of the waiting period and before the beginning of the next ensuing benefit year, benefits are payable for days of unemployment in excess of four, but the aggregate number of compensable days may not exceed 130 for the benefit year. An employee who is unemployed on all days during a registration period could have a maximum of 10 compensable days of unemployment in such registration period. The amount of benefits for each compensable day of unemployment is the amount of the daily
benefit rate computed for such employee pursuant to part 330 of this chapter.
(b)
Base year compensation limit.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the Board will not pay unemployment benefits to a qualified employee, with respect to his or her days of unemployment within a benefit year, in an amount greater than the amount of his or her base year compensation, as computed under § 336.4 of this part.
(c)
Unemployment due to a strike.
The limitations set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section also apply to an employee whose unemployment is due to a stoppage of work because of a strike in the establishment, premises, or enterprise at which he was last employed. But no unemployment benefits are payable for the employee's first 14 days of unemployment due to such stoppage of work.
§ 336.3
Duration of normal sickness benefits.
The duration of normal sickness benefits is the same as the duration of normal unemployment benefits, as set forth in § 336.2 of this part. A qualified employee who has satisfied the benefit year waiting period and is otherwise eligible for sickness benefits may receive benefits for a maximum of 130 days of sickness within a benefit year, but the amount paid as sickness benefits may not exceed the amount of the employee's base year compensation, as computed under § 336.4 of this part.
§ 336.4
Base year compensation.
(a)
Formula.
For the purposes of this part, an employee's base year compensation includes any compensation in excess of the monthly compensation base (as defined in part 302 of this chapter) for any month in the applicable base year but shall not include any amount that exceeds the value of “X” in the following formula: X = $775(A/$600). In this formula, “A” is the dollar amount of the monthly compensation base with respect to months in such base year. For example, if an employee had railroad earnings of $1,500 per month in each of three months in base year 1990, the employee's base year compensation for purposes of part 302 of this chapter would be $2,235 (three times the monthly compensation base of $745 per month for months in 1990). But the employee's base year compensation for purposes of computing maximum normal unemployment (or sickness) benefits under this subpart would be $2,886 (three times $962), and his or her normal unemployment (or sickness) benefits would not be considered exhausted until he or she is paid unemployment (or sickness) benefits in an amount equal to $2,886. In this example, $962 is the amount computed as the value of “X” in the above formula when “A” is equal to $745.
(b)
Employer's duty to report.
The base year employer(s) of an employee shall provide information as to the amount of an employee's monthly compensation in excess of the monthly compensation base, as defined in part 302 of this chapter, unless the amount of the employee's compensation at the monthly compensation base limit, as already reported to the Board, is equal to or greater than an amount equal to 130 times the daily benefit rate applicable to the employee's days of unemployment or days of sickness.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3220-0070)
§ 336.5
Notice to employee.
The Board will notify an employee when it appears that his or her right to normal unemployment or normal sickness benefits will be exhausted. Such notice will include information about the availability of extended benefits under subpart B of this part if the employee has completed 10 years of railroad service and the availability of normal benefits for the next ensuing benefit year if the employee is not eligible for extended benefits.

# Subpart B—Extended Benefits
§ 336.10
Eligibility.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an employee may receive extended unemployment or extended sickness benefits under this part if he or she:
(1) Has exhausted normal unemployment or normal sickness benefits (as
the case may be) under subpart A of this part;
(2) Has completed 10 years of railroad service, as set forth in § 336.13 of this part; and
(3) Continues to have days of unemployment or days of sickness, as the case may be.
(b) An employee is not eligible for extended sickness benefits if he or she has voluntarily retired or has attained age 65. In the case of claims for unemployment benefits, an employee is not eligible for extended unemployment benefits if he or she has voluntarily left work without good cause or has voluntarily retired.
§ 336.11
Exhaustion of rights to normal unemployment benefits.
For the purposes of this part, the Board considers that an employee has exhausted his or her current rights to normal benefits for days of unemployment if:
(a) The employee received unemployment benefits for 130 days of unemployment in the benefit year; or
(b) The employee received unemployment benefits in the benefit year equal to the amount of his or her base year compensation; or
(c) At the end of a normal benefit year during which the employee was qualified for benefits, he or she received less than the maximum unemployment benefits for the benefit year and he or she is not qualified for benefits in the next succeeding benefit year.
§ 336.12
Exhaustion of rights to normal sickness benefits.
For the purposes of this part, the Board considers that an employee has exhausted his or her current rights to normal benefits for days of sickness if:
(a) The employee received sickness benefits for 130 days of sickness in the benefit year; or
(b) The employee received sickness benefits in the benefit year equal to the amount of his or her base year compensation; or
(c) At the end of the normal benefit year during which the employee was qualified for benefits, he or she received less than the maximum sickness benefits for the benefit year and he or she is not qualified for benefits in the next succeeding benefit year.
§ 336.13
Years of service requirement.
(a)
Eligibility.
For the purposes of this part, an employee is not eligible for extended unemployment or sickness benefits if he or she does not have at least 10 years of railroad service. An employee who has 120 service months, as defined in part 210 of this chapter, whether or not consecutive, is considered to have 10 years of railroad service.
(b)
Initial determination.
The Board will determine whether an employee has 10 years of railroad service on the basis of reports filed by employers pursuant to part 209 of this chapter. The number of years of service shown in the Board's records will be accepted as correct for the purposes of this part, unless the employee claims credit for more service than that shown in the Board's records and such additional service is verified, subject to part 211 of this chapter.
(c)
Effective date.
An employee acquires ten years of railroad service as of the first day with respect to which creditable compensation is attributable in his 120th month of service.
[65 FR 19649, Apr. 12, 2000]
§ 336.14
Extended benefit period.
(a)
Defined.
An extended benefit period consists of seven consecutive 14-day registration periods.
(b)
Beginning date.
In the case of unemployment benefits, an extended benefit period begins with the first day of unemployment after the day on which the employee exhausts his or her rights to normal unemployment benefits. In the case of sickness benefits, the beginning date is the first day of sickness after the employee exhausts normal sickness benefits. Such first day of unemployment or first day of sickness must be within the same benefit year with respect to which the employee exhausted normal unemployment or normal sickness benefits, as the case may be. However, no extended benefit period may begin on any day of unemployment or sickness prior to the date on which the employee acquired 10 years of railroad service.
(c)
Ending date.
An employee's extended benefit period ends on the 97th day after it began. If an employee attains age 65 during an extended sickness benefit period, such extended benefit period will terminate on the day next preceding the date on which the employee attains age 65, except that it may continue for the purpose of paying benefits for his or her days of unemployment, if any, during such extended period. If an extended sickness benefit period terminates because the employee has attained age 65, and if at that point the employee has rights to normal sickness benefits, the employee will be paid normal sickness benefits if he or she is otherwise entitled to payment thereof.
(d)
Maximum number of compensable days.
Extended benefits may be paid for a maximum of 65 days of unemployment (or 65 days of sickness, as the case may be) within an employee's extended benefit period.
[59 FR 3996, Jan. 28, 1994, as amended at 65 FR 19649, Apr. 12, 2000]
§ 336.15
How to claim extended benefits.
An employee who has 10 or more years of railroad service who exhausts his or her rights to normal unemployment or normal sickness benefits and who wishes to claim extended unemployment or extended sickness benefits may do so by claiming benefits on the forms provided by the Board pursuant to parts 325 or 335 of this chapter. The claim forms provided for this purpose are the same as those provided for claiming normal benefits. No special application for extended benefits is required, and no waiting period applies to the payment of extended benefits.
§ 336.16
Notice to employee.
Upon determining that an employee is eligible for a period of extended unemployment or sickness benefits, the Board will notify the employee of the beginning and ending dates of such extended benefit period.

Board Order 27-22, 32 FR 3341, Feb. 28, 1967, unless otherwise noted.
§ 340.1
Statutory provisions.
(a) Section 2(d) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act provides that:
If the Board finds that at any time more than the correct amount of benefits has been paid to any individual under this Act or a payment has been made to an individual not entitled thereto (including payments made prior to July 1, 1940) recovery by adjustments in subsequent payments to which such individual is entitled under this Act or any other Act administered by the Board may, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, be made under regulations prescribed by the Board. If such individual dies before recovery is completed, recovery may be made by setoff or adjustments, under regulations prescribed by the Board, in subsequent payments due, under this Act or any other Act administered by the Board to the estate, designee, next of kin, legal representative, or surviving spouse of such individual, with respect to the employment of such individual.
Adjustments under this subsection may be made either by deductions from subsequent payments or, with respect to payments which are to be made during a lifetime or lifetimes, by subtracting the total amount of benefits paid in excess of the proper amount from the actuarial value, as determined by
the Board, of such payments to be made during a lifetime or lifetimes and recertifying such payments on the basis of the reduced actuarial value. In the latter case recovery shall be deemed to have been completed upon such recertification.
There shall be no recovery in any case in which more than the correct amount of benefits has been paid to an individual or payment has been made to an individual not entitled thereto (including payments made prior to July 1, 1940) who, in the judgment of the Board, is without fault when, in the judgment of the Board, recovery would be contrary to the purpose of this Act or would be against equity or good conscience.
No certifying or disbursing officer shall be held liable for any amount certified or paid by him in good faith to any person where the recovery of such amount is waived under the third paragraph of this subsection or has been begun but cannot be completed under the first paragraph of this subsection.
(b) Section 2(f) of the Act provides, in part, that:
If (i) benefits are paid to any employee with respect to unemployment or sickness in any registration period, and it is later determined that remuneration is payable to such employee with respect to any period which includes days in such registration period which had been determined to be days of unemployment or sickness, and (ii) the person or company from which such remuneration is payable has, before payment thereof, notice of the payment of benefits upon the basis of days of unemployment or sickness included in such period, the remuneration so payable shall not be reduced by reason of such benefits but the remuneration so payable, to the extent to which benefits were paid upon the basis of days which had been determined to be days of unemployment or sickness and which are included in the period for which such remuneration is payable, shall be held to be a special fund in trust for the Board. * * *
(c) Section 4(a-1) of the Act provides, in part, that:
There shall not be considered as a day of unemployment or as a day of sickness, with respect to any employee— * * *
(ii) Any day in any period with respect to which the Board finds that he is receiving or will have received annuity payments or pensions under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1935 or the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, or insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act, or unemployment, maternity, or sickness benefits under an unemployment, maternity, or sickness compensation law other than this Act, or any other social insurance payments under any law:
Provided,
That if an employee receives or is held entitled to receive any such payments, other than unemployment, maternity, or sickness payments, with respect to any period which include days of unemployment or sickness in a registration period, after benefits under this Act for such registration period will have been paid, the amount by which such benefits under this Act will have been increased by including such days as days of unemployment or as days of sickness shall be recoverable by the Board:
Provided further,
That, if that part of any such payment or payments, other than unemployment, maternity, or sickness payments, which is apportionable to such days of unemployment or days of sickness is less in amount than the benefits under this Act which, but for this paragraph, would be payable and not recoverable with respect to such days of unemployment or days of sickness, the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall not apply but such benefits under this Act for such days of unemployment or days of sickness shall be diminished or recoverable in the amount of such part of such other payment or payments;
(d) Section 12(o) of the Act provides that:
Benefits payable to an employee with respect to days of sickness shall be payable regardless of the liability of any person to pay damages for such infirmity. The Board shall be entitled to reimbursement from any sum or damages paid or payable to such employee or other person through suit, compromise, settlement, judgment, or otherwise on account of any liability (other than a liability under a health, sickness, accident, or similar insurance policy) based upon such infirmity, to the extent that it will have paid or will pay benefits for days of sickness resulting from such infirmity. Upon notice to the person against whom such right or claim exists or is asserted, the Board shall have a lien upon such right or claim, any judgment obtained thereunder, and any sum or damages paid under such right or claim, to the extent of the amount to which the Board is entitled by way of reimbursement.
(e) Section 3, Pub. L. 89-508, 80 Stat. 308, provides that:
(a) The head of an agency or his designee, pursuant to regulations prescribed by him and in conformity with such standards as may be promulgated jointly by the Attorney General and the Comptroller General, shall attempt collection of all claims of the United States for money or property arising out of the activities of, or referred to, his agency.
(b) With respect to such claims of the United States that have not been referred to another agency, including the General Accounting Office, for further collection action
and that do not exceed $20,000, exclusive of interest, the head of an agency or his designee, pursuant to regulations prescribed by him and in conformity with such standards as may be promulgated jointly by the Attorney General and the Comptroller General, may (1) compromise any such claim, or (2) cause collection action on any such claim to be terminated or suspended where it appears that no person liable on the claim has the present or prospective financial ability to pay any significant sum thereon or that the cost of collecting the claim is likely to exceed the amount of recovery. The Comptroller General or his designee shall have the foregoing authority with respect to claims referred to the General Accounting Office by another agency for further collection action. The head of an agency or his designee shall not exercise the foregoing authority with respect to a claim as to which there is an indication of fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any other party having an interest in the claim, or a claim based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws; nor shall the head of an agency, other than the Comptroller General of the United States, have authority to compromise a claim that arises from an exception made by the General Accounting Office in the account of an accountable officer.
(c) A compromise effected pursuant to authority conferred by subsection (b) of this section shall be final and conclusive on the debtor and on all officials, agencies, and courts of the United States, except if procured by fraud, misrepresentation, the presentation of a false claim, or mutual mistake of fact. No accountable officer shall be liable for any amount paid or for the value of property lost, damaged, or destroyed, where the recovery of such amount or value may not be had because of a compromise with a person primarily responsible under subsection (b).
§ 340.2
Amount recoverable.
For purposes of this part, an “amount recoverable” is an amount of unemployment, sickness, or maternity benefits paid under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act which is:
(a) Determined to have been paid erroneously;
(b) Recoverable under section 2(f) of the Act because remuneration is found to be payable with respect to a period which includes days which had been determined to be days of unemployment or sickness;
(c) Recoverable under section 4(a-1)(ii) of the Act because of the employee's having received or been held entitled to receive annuity payments under the Railroad Retirement Act, insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act, unemployment, sickness or maternity benefits under any law other than the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, or any other social insurance payments under any law; or
(d) Recoverable under section 12(o) of the Act by virtue of the Board's right to reimbursement from any sum or damages payable through suit, compromise, settlement, judgment, or otherwise on account of liability based upon an infirmity, to the extent that it will have paid or will pay benefits for days of sickness resulting from that infirmity.
§ 340.3
When amounts recoverable to be recovered.
Amounts recoverable shall be recovered in all cases except those in which recovery is waived under § 340.10 or a compromise is approved under § 340.13.
§ 340.4
Methods of recovery of amounts recoverable.
An amount recoverable may be recovered by any one or a combination of the methods described in §§ 340.5, 340.6, 340.7, and 340.8.
§ 340.5
Recovery by cash payment.
The Board shall have the right to require that amounts recoverable be immediately and fully repaid in cash and any debtor shall have the absolute right to repay such amount recoverable in this manner. However if the debtor is financially unable to pay the indebtedness in a lump sum, payment may be accepted in regular installments. The amount and frequency of such installment payments should bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. Whenever possible installment payments should be sufficient in amounts and frequency to liquidate the debt in not more than three years.
§ 340.6
Recovery by setoff.
An amount recoverable may be recovered by setoff against any subsequent payments to which the individual from whom the amount is recoverable is entitled under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, the
Railroad Retirement Act, or any other Act administered by the Board, or, in the case of that individual's death, from any payments due under those Acts to his or her estate, designee, next of kin, legal representative, or surviving spouse. In any case in which full recovery is not effected by setoff, the balance due may be recovered by one or more of the other methods described in this part. If the individual dies before recovery is completed, such recovery shall be made from his estate or heirs.
[53 FR 2489, Jan. 28, 1988]
§ 340.7
Deduction in computation of death benefit.
In computing the residual lump sum provided for in part 234, subpart D, of this chapter, the Board shall include in the benefits to be deducted from the gross residual all amounts recoverable under this part, but not recovered, including amounts where recovery was waived, that were paid to the individual or paid to others as benefits accrued to the individual but not paid at death.
[57 FR 1379, Jan. 14, 1992]
§ 340.8
Recovery by adjustment in connection with subsequent payments under the Railroad Retirement Act.
Recovery under this part may be made by permanently reducing the amount of any annuity payable to the overpaid individual (or an individual receiving an annuity based upon the same compensation record as that of the overpaid individual) under the Railroad Retirement Act. This method of recovery is called an actuarial adjustment of the annuity. The Board cannot require any individual to take an actuarial adjustment in order to recover an overpayment nor is an actuarial adjustment available as a matter of right. An actuarial adjustment does not become effective until the overpaid individual negotiates the first annuity check which reflects the annuity rate after actuarial adjustment.

# Example:
An individual agrees to recovery of a $5,000 overpayment made to him by actuarial adjustment to an annuity awarded him under the Railroad Retirement Act. However, he dies before negotiating the first annuity check reflecting his actuarially reduced rate. The $5,000 is not considered recovered.
[57 FR 1379, Jan. 14, 1992]
§ 340.9
Effect of adjustment in connection with subsequent payments.
Adjustment by the method described in § 340.8 shall constitute recovery of the amount recoverable.
§ 340.10
Waiver of recovery of erroneous payments.
(a)
When waiver of recovery may be applied.
Section 2(d) of the Act provides that there shall be no recovery in any case where more than the correct amount of benefits has been paid to an individual or where payment has been made to an individual not entitled to benefits if, in the judgment of the Board:
(1) The individual is without fault; and
(2) Recovery would be contrary to the purpose of the Act or would be against equity or good conscience.
(b)
Fault.
(1) Fault means a defect of judgment or conduct arising from inattention or bad faith. Judgment or conduct is defective when it deviates from a prudent standard of care taken to comply wih the entitlement provisions of the Act. Conduct includes both action and inaction. Unlike fraud, fault does not require a deliberate intent to deceive.
(2) Whether an individual is at fault in causing erroneous payments generally depends on all circumstances surrounding the erroneous payments. Among the factors the Board will consider are: the ability of the overpaid individual to understand the reporting requirements of the Act or to realize that he or she is being overpaid (
e.g.
, age, comprehension, memory, physical and mental condition); the particular cause of benefit non-entitlement; and the number of claims on which the individual made erroneous statements.
(3) Circumstances in which the Board will find an individual at fault include but are not limited to:
(i) Failure to furnish information which the individual knew or should have known was material;
(ii) An incorrect statement made by the individual which he or she knew or
should have known was incorrect (including furnishing an opinion or conclusion when asked for facts);
(iii) Failure to return a payment which the individual knew or should have known was incorrect.
(c)
When recovery defeats the purpose of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act.
(1) The purpose of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is to furnish some replacement for an individual's railroad earnings lost because of days of sickness or unemployment. The purpose of the Act is defeated when an erroneous payment is recovered from income and resources which the individual requires to meet ordinary and necessary living expenses. If either income or resources are sufficient to meet expenses, the purpose of the Act is not defeated by recovery of an erroneous payment.
(2) For purposes of this section, income includes any funds which may reasonably be considered available for the individual's use, regardless of source. Income to the individual's spouse or dependents is available if the spouse or dependent lived with the individual at the time waiver is considered. Types of income include, but are not limited to:
(i) Government benefits such as Black Lung, Social Security, Workers' Compensation, and Unemployment Compensation benefits;
(ii) Wages and self-employment income;
(iii) Regular payments such as rent or pensions; and
(iv) Investment income.
(3) For purposes of this section, resources include, but are not limited to, liquid assets such as cash on hand, the value of stocks, bonds, savings accounts, mutual funds, any accrual benefit payable by the United States of America or any other source.
(4) Whether an individual has sufficient income and resources to meet ordinary and necessary living expenses depends not only on the amount of his or her income and resources, but also on whether the expenses are “ordinary and necessary.” While the level of expenses which is “ordinary and necessary” may vary between individuals, it must be held at a level reasonable for an individual who is temporarily unemployed or incapacitated due to sickness. The Board will consider the discretionary nature of an expense in determining whether it is reasonable. Ordinary and necessary living expenses include:
(i) Fixed living expenses, such as food and clothing, rent, mortgage payments, utilities, maintenance, insurance (
e.g.,
life, accident, and health insurance), taxes, installment payments, etc.;
(ii) Medical, hospitalization, and other similar expenses;
(iii) Expenses for the support of others for whom the individual is legally responsible; and
(iv) Miscellaneous expenses (
e.g.,
newspapers, haircuts).
(5) Where recovery of the full amount of an erroneous payment would be made from income and resources required to meet ordinary and necessary living expenses, but recovery of a lesser amount would leave income or resources sufficient to meet expenses, recovery of the lesser amount does not defeat the purpose of the Act.
(d)
When recovery is against equity or good conscience.
Recovery is considered to be against equity or good conscience when a person, in reliance on such payments or on notice that such payment would be made, relinquished a valuable right or changed his or her position for the worse.
(e)
Recoveries not subject to waiver.
(1) Where an amount is recoverable pursuant to section 2(f) of the Act from remuneration payable to an employee by a person or company, or where a lien for reimbursement of sickness benefits has arisen pursuant to section 12(o) of the Act, and in either case recovery is sought from a person other than the employee, no right to waiver of recovery exists.
(2) Where the amount recoverable is equal to or less than 10 times the current maximum daily benefit rate under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act it shall not be considered contrary to the purpose of the Act or against equity or good conscience to recover such payment. Consequently, the amount recoverable is not subject to waiver under this part.
(3) Where the amount recoverable is the result of an overpayment of benefits payable under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act due to entitlement to annuities under the Railroad Retirement Act for the same days for which benefits were payable, and recovery of such overpayment may be made by offset against an accrual of the annuities, it shall not be considered contrary to the purpose of the Act or against equity or good conscience to recover the erroneous payment by offset against such accrual. Consequently, the amount recoverable is not subject to waiver under this part.
(4) Where there exists accumulated Federal benefits payable by any executive agency of the United States, any amount recoverable which is equal to or less than the accumulated Federal benefits is not subject to waiver. Any amount recoverable which is greater than the identified accumulated Federal benefits may be considered for waiver in accordance with the provisions of this part and part 320 of this chapter.
[53 FR 2489, Jan. 28, 1988, as amended at 57 FR 1379, Jan. 14, 1992]
§ 340.11
Waiver of methods of recovery.
The Board may waive any right to recover all or any part of an amount recoverable by any one or more methods without waiving the right to recover by some other method or methods if, in the judgment of the Board, the individual is without fault and if, in the judgment of the Board, recovery by the methods waived would be against equity and good conscience and recovery by such other methods would not be against equity and good conscience.
§ 340.12
Waiver not a matter of right.
A waiver under § 340.10 or § 340.11 is not a matter of right, but is at all times within the judgment of the Board.
§ 340.13
Compromise of amounts recoverable.
The Board or its designee may compromise an amount recoverable, provided such amount does not exceed $100,000, excluding interest, or such higher amount as the Attorney General may from time to time prescribe. Compromise of an amount recoverable may not be considered in any case in which there is an indication of fraud, the presentation of a false claim or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or his representative. Compromise is at all times within the discretionary authority of the Board or its designee.
[Board Order 27-22, 32 FR 3341, Feb. 28, 1967, as amended at 62 FR 41271, Aug. 1, 1997]
§ 340.14
Factors due to be considered in a compromise.
The following indicate the character of reasons which will be considered in approving a compromise:
(a) The debtor's ability to repay the full amount within a reasonable time;
(b) The debtor's refusal to pay the claim in full and the Board's inability to effect collection in full within a reasonable time by other collection methods;
(c) Doubt concerning the Board's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount because of a bona fide dispute as to the facts or because of the legal issues involved;
(d) The cost of collecting the amount recoverable does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount.
§ 340.15
Suspension or termination of collection action.
Collection action on a Board claim may be suspended or terminated under the following conditions:
(a) Collection action on a Board claim may be suspended temporarily when the debtor cannot be located and there is reason to believe future collection action may be productive or collection may be effected by offset in the near future.
(b) Collection action may be terminated when:
(1) The debtor is unable to make any substantial payment;
(2) The debtor cannot be located and offset is too remote to justify retention of the claim;
(3) The cost of collection action will exceed the amount recoverable;
(4) The claim is legally without merit or cannot be substantiated by the evidence.
§ 340.16
Debt collection.
(a) The Associate Executive Director for Unemployment and Sickness Insurance shall take steps to collect all delinquent debts due the Board under the benefit provisions of the Act, except those that have been classed as uncollectible. Such steps shall commence not later than July 1, 1985 and shall include notice to each debtor of the time limit for paying the debt and the consequences of failure to pay on time.
(b) It shall be the duty of every employer or other person paying remuneration for time lost or any sum or damages for personal injury to remit the amount of reimbursement due the Board, if any, within 30 days of the date of the payment of remuneration or damages to an employee. Failure to remit the amount due within 30 days shall subject the employer or other person to interest and penalties, in addition to the principal amount due the Board.

(1) An amount specified in a settlement or award as payment for any loss of property, or the amount of a settlement or award specifically apportioned as pay for lost time.
(2) An amount paid as a result of a lawsuit based on wrongful death.
(3) Workers' compensation payments.
(4) “No-Fault” personal-injury protection benefits or any other benefits paid under a health, sickness, accident or similar insurance policy carried by an employee.
(5) Payments made to an employee under the terms of his or her insurance policy providing for payment of all amounts that the employee is legally entitled to recover for bodily injury from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle.
§ 341.3
Notice of lien.
(a)
Notice to alleged tortfeasor.
The Board shall mail a “Notice of Lien” to each person or company identified as liable or potentially liable for causing the employee's infirmity. The “Notice of Lien” will notify the person or company of the Board's right to reimbursement. The notice shall include:
(1) The employee's name, address and social security number;
(2) The date and place of the accident; and
(3) The employee's occupation, if injured on duty.
(b)
Notice to employee.
A notice regarding repayment of sickness benefits shall be sent to an employee who names a party other than a railroad as the alleged tortfeasor.

Notice of amount of lien.
The amount of the Board's lien shall be reported, upon request, to a railroad or other person or company that may be liable for paying damages, or to the employee, or to an attorney representing any of those parties. The amount of the lien shall be reported
whether or not the terms of a settlement have been agreed upon. When requested, a list showing the sickness benefits paid for each claim period may be furnished.
§ 341.4
Information required to be furnished by the employee.

(b) The employee shall, upon request, tell the Board whether and from whom he or she has collected any damages for the infirmity.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3220-0036)
[49 FR 570, Jan. 5, 1984, as amended at 52 FR 11018, Apr. 6, 1987]
§ 341.5
Amount of reimbursement.
(a) The Board shall receive as reimbursement the lesser of:
(1) The amount of sickness benefits paid to the employee for the infirmity for which he or she recovers any sum or damages; or
(2) The net amount of the sum or damages paid to the employee for the infirmity, after substracting the amount of the expenses listed in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) The expenses that may be subtracted from the amount of damages recovered are:
(1) The medical and hospital expenses that the employee incurred because of his or her injury. These expenses are deductible even if they are paid under an insurance policy covering the employee or are covered by his or her membership in a medical or hospital plan or association. But such expenses are not deductible if they are not covered by insurance or by membership in a medical or hospital plan or association and are consequently paid by a railroad or other person directly to the doctor, clinic or hospital that provided the medical care or services.
(2) The cost of litigation. This includes both the amount of the fee to which the attorney and the employee have agreed and the other expenses that the employee incurred in the conduct of the litigation itself.
§ 341.6
Report of settlement or judgment.
(a) When a person or company makes a settlement or must satisfy a final judgment based on an injury for which the employee received sickness benefits, the person or company shall notify the Board of the settlement or final judgment. That notice shall be in writing and submitted within five days of the settlement or final judgment. A railroad employer may fulfill the written notice requirement by sending an electronic message in the manner prescribed by the agency. That notification shall contain:
(1) The amount of the settlement or final judgment;
(2) The date of the settlement or final judgment; and
(3) The amount withheld from the settlement or final judgment to satisfy the Board's lien.
(b) Payment of the amount due the Board shall be delivered to the Board within 30 days after the date of the settlement agreement or the entry of final judgment.
(c) If the damages payable are to be paid directly to the court to satisfy a final judgment, thus making it impossible for the person or company to remit the amount of reimbursement due the Board, the person or company shall immediately notify the Board of the situation.
[49 FR 570, Jan. 5, 1984, as amended at 71 FR 53005, Sept. 8, 2006]
§ 341.7
Liability on Board's claim.
(a) A person or company paying any sum or damages to an employee who has received sickness benefits from the Board shall, upon receipt of notice as provided in § 341.3(a), be liable to the Board for the amount of reimbursement computed under § 341.5. This liability may be relieved by either:
(1) Withholding the amount reimbursable to the Board from the sum or damages payable to the employee, and subsequently paying that amount to the Board; or
(2) Including the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board as a payee on the check or draft along with the employee and
any others who have an interest in the damages.
(b) If the person or company paying the damages does not protect the Board's lien or attempts to protect the Board's lien in some manner other than those described in paragraph (a) of this section, that person or company shall remain liable to the Board until the Board is reimbursed in full.
§ 341.8
Termination of sickness benefits due to a settlement.
(a) Sickness benefits payable to an eligible employee shall be paid without regard to whether any person or company may be liable for causing the employee's infirmity. However, the Board will terminate the payment of sickness benefits upon receipt of an oral or written report that a settlement or final judgment for the infirmity has been made. A railroad employer may file the required report by sending an electronic message in the manner prescribed by the agency.
(b) A report of settlement shall be made to the Sickness and Unemployment Benefits Section and shall include the information required in § 341.6. Where the report is an oral report, and the informant is neither the employee nor his or her representative, the informant shall be told that written confirmation containing the information called for by § 341.6 must be submitted to the Board within 5 days from the date of the oral report. A railroad employer may fulfill the written report requirement by sending an electronic message in the manner prescribed by the agency.
(c) If, in the case of an oral report, the written confirmation as described in paragraph (b) of this section is not received within five days, the Sickness and Unemployment Benefits Section shall take steps within five additional working days to verify whether there has been a settlement or final judgment. If there has been no settlement or final judgment, the payment of sickness benefits shall be reinstated.
(d) Within five days of the notification of a settlement or final judgment, the Board shall inform the employee of the report of the settlement or final judgment. The notice to the employee shall state how the employee may inform the Board that there has not been a settlement or final judgment. If the employee states that there has not been a settlement or final judgment, the adjudicating office shall, within 10 days after the receipt of such a statement, make a determination as to the employee's rights to future sickness benefits and shall notify him or her accordingly.
(e) An employee shall have the right to appeal from the determination of the amount of sickness benefits recoverable from the settlement or judgment.
An employee shall also have the right to appeal the termination of his or her sickness benefits after the report of a settlement or final judgment made in accordance with the procedures provided in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section. Such appeals shall be filed and processed in accordance with part 320 of these regulations.
[49 FR 570, Jan. 5, 1984, as amended at 71 FR 53005, Sept. 8, 2006]
§ 341.9
Board as a party; attorney's fee.
(a) The Board shall not participate in the prosecution of a personal-injury claim of an employee eligible for sickness benefits and shall neither encourage nor discourage such employee with respect to the pursuit of a claim for damages.
(b) The Board shall not be a party in any action for damages brought by an employee claiming sickness benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. The Board's right of reimbursement under section 12(o) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act shall not be construed as giving the Board a right of subrogation or other cause of action for damages against an alleged tortfeasor. The Board shall intervene in such an action only when it is apparent that intervention may be required to protect its right of reimbursement.
(c) The Board shall not be liable for the payment of any attorney's fee or other expenses incurred in connection with such a claim for damages.

# Subpart A—General Provisions and Definitions
§ 345.101
Requirement for contribution.
Every employer, as defined in part 301 of this chapter, shall pay to the Railroad Retirement Board a contribution with respect to the compensation paid to an employee in any calendar month for service by such employee (except for service to a local lodge or division of a railway labor organization). For the purposes of this part, the term “compensation” is defined in part 302 of this chapter. The compensation subject to contribution is the gross amount of compensation paid to an employee for service in any month, not to exceed the amount of the monthly compensation base (MCB), as defined in part 302 of this chapter. The amount of contribution payable by each employer is to be computed and paid pursuant to the provisions of this part.
§ 345.102
Multiple employer limitation.
(a) The contributions required by this part shall not apply to any amount of the aggregate compensation paid to such employee by all such employers in such calendar month which is in excess of the MCB; and
(b) Each employer (other than a subordinate unit of a national-railway-labor-organization employer) shall be liable for that portion of the contribution with respect to such compensation paid by all such employers which the compensation paid by the employer to such employee bears to the total compensation paid in such month by all such employers to such employee.
(c) In the event that the compensation paid by such employers to the employee in such month is less than the
MCB, each subordinate unit of a national-railway-labor-organization employer shall be liable for such portion of any additional contribution as the compensation paid by such employer to such employee in such month bears to the total compensation paid by all national-railway-labor-organization employers to such employee in such month.
§ 345.103
Rate of contribution.
(a) Each employer will have an experience-rated rate of contribution computed by the Board under the provisions of section 8(a)(1)(C) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. See subpart D of this part.
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section the rate of contribution applicable to an employer that first becomes subject to this part after December 31, 1989, will be computed by the Board in accordance with section 8(a)(1)(D) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. See subpart D of this part.
§ 345.104
Employees and employee representatives not liable.
The amount of contributions for which an employer is liable under this part shall not be deducted from an employee's compensation, and the Board will not recognize any agreement under which an employee assumes liability for such contributions. Employee representatives under part 205 of this chapter are not employees for purposes of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act and are not liable for payment of contributions under this part.
§ 345.105
Definitions.
(a)
Chief Financial Officer.
References in this part to the Board's Chief Financial Officer mean the Chief Financial Officer, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 North Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611. The Chief Financial Officer shall be responsible for assessing, collecting, and depositing contributions due from employers under this part.
(b)
Monthly compensation base.
For the purposes of this part, the monthly compensation base (MCB) is the maximum monthly amount of compensation per employee that is subject to contribution pursuant to this part. On or before December 1 of each year, the Board will compute the amount of the MCB in accordance with section 1(i) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act and part 302 of this chapter, and will publish notice of the amount so computed in the
Federal Register
within 10 days after such computation has been made. Information as to the amount of the MCB should be requested from the Board's Chief Financial Officer.
(c)
Month defined.
(1) For the purposes of this part, if the date prescribed for filing a report or paying a contribution is the last day of a calendar month, each succeeding calendar month or fraction thereof during which the failure to file or pay the contribution continues shall constitute a month.
(2) If the date prescribed for filing the report or paying the contribution is a date other than the last day of a calendar month, the period that terminates with the date numerically corresponding thereto in the succeeding calendar month and each such successive period shall constitute a month. If, in the month of February, there is no date corresponding to the date prescribed for filing the report or paying, the period from such date in January through the last day of February shall constitute a month. Thus, if a report is due on January 30, the first month shall end on February 28 (or 29 if a leap year), and the succeeding months shall end on March 30, April 30, etc.
(3) If a report is not timely filed or a contribution is not timely paid, the fact that the date prescribed for filing the report or paying the contribution, or the corresponding date in any succeeding calendar month, falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday is immaterial in determining the number of months.
(d)
Reference to forms.
Any reference in this part to any prescribed reporting or other form of the Board includes a reference to any other form of the Board prescribed in substitution for such prescribed form.
(e)
Showing reasonable cause.
For purposes of this part if an employer exercised ordinary business care and prudence and was nevertheless unable to file the return within the prescribed
time, then the delay is due to reasonable cause. A failure to pay any amount due under this part within the prescribed time will be considered to be due to reasonable cause to the extent that the employer has made a satisfactory showing that he exercised ordinary business care and prudence in providing for payment but nevertheless was unable to pay on time.

# Subpart B—Reporting and Collecting Contributions
§ 345.110
Reports of compensation of employees.
The provisions of part 209 of this chapter shall be applicable to the reporting of compensation under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act to the same extent and in the same manner as they are applicable to the reporting of compensation under the Railroad Retirement Act.
§ 345.111
Contribution reports.
(a)
General.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, every employer shall, for each calendar quarter of each year, prepare a contribution report, in duplicate, on Form DC-1. If the Form DC-1 is filed electronically, no duplicate submission is required.
(2) Contribution reports of employers who are required by State law to pay compensation on a weekly basis shall include with respect to such compensation all payroll weeks in which all or the major part of the compensation falls within the period for which the reports are required.
(b)
Compensation to be reported on Form DC-1.
Employers shall enter on the employer's quarterly contribution report, prior to any additions or subtractions, the amount of creditable compensation appearing on payrolls or other disbursement documents for the corresponding quarter as the amount of creditable compensation from which the contribution payable for that quarter is to be computed.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3220-0012)
[67 FR 13567, Mar. 25, 2002]
§ 345.112
Final contribution reports.
Upon termination of employer status, as determined under part 301 of this chapter, the last contribution report of the employer shall be so indicated by checking the box on the Form DC-1 entitled “Final Report”. Such contribution report shall be filed with the Board on or before the sixtieth day after the final date for which there is payable compensation with respect to which contribution is required. The period covered by each such contribution report shall be plainly written thereon, indicating the final date for which compensation is payable. There shall be executed as part of each such final contribution report a statement giving the address at which compensation records will be kept and the name of the person keeping the records.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3220-0012)
§ 345.113
Execution of contribution reports.
(a) Each contribution report on Form DC-1 shall be signed by hand by:
(1) The individual, if the employer is an individual;
(2) The president, vice president, or other duly authorized officer, if the employer is a corporation; or
(3) A responsible and duly authorized member or officer having knowledge of its affairs if the employer is a partnership or other unincorporated organization.
(b) The Form DC-1 may be filed electronically through the Board's authorized agent. If filed electronically, no further authentication is required.
[67 FR 13567, Mar. 25, 2002]
§ 345.114
Prescribed forms for contribution reports.
Each employer's contribution report, together with any prescribed copies and supporting data, shall be filled out in accordance with the instructions and regulations applicable thereto. The prescribed forms may be obtained from or accessed by contacting the Board. An employer will not be excused from making a contribution report for the reason that no form has been furnished to such employer. Application should be made to the Board for the prescribed
forms in ample time to have the contribution report prepared, verified, and filed with the Board on or before the due date. Contribution reports that have not been so prepared will not be accepted and shall not be considered filed for purposes of § 345.115 of this part. In case the prescribed form has not been obtained, a statement made by the employer disclosing the period covered and the amount of compensation with respect to which the contribution is required may be accepted as a tentative contribution report if accompanied by the amount of contribution due. If filed within the prescribed time, the statements so made will relieve the employer from liability for any penalty imposed under this part for the delinquent filing of the contribution report provided that the failure to file a contribution report on the prescribed form was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect,
and provided further,
that within 30 days after receipt of the tentative report, such tentative report is supplemented by a contribution report made on the proper form.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3220-0012)
[67 FR 13568, Mar. 25, 2002]
§ 345.115
Place and time for filing contribution reports.
Each employer shall file its contribution report with the Chief Financial Officer, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 North Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60611-2092, or the Chief Financial Officer's designee. The employer's contribution report for each quarterly period shall be filed on or before the last day of the calendar month following the period for which it is made. If such last day falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a national legal holiday, the report may be filed on the next following business day. If mailed, reports must be postmarked on or before the date on which the report is required to be filed.
[67 FR 13568, Mar. 25, 2002]
§ 345.116
Payment of contributions.
(a) The contribution required to be reported on an employer's contribution report is due and payable to the Board without assessment or notice, at the time fixed for filing the contribution report as provided for in § 345.115 of this part.
(b) An employer shall deposit the contributions required under this part in accord with instructions issued by the Railroad Retirement Board. At the direction of the Board, the Secretary of the Treasury shall credit such contributions to the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account in accord with section 10 of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act and to the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Administration Fund in accord with section 11 of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act.
§ 345.117
When fractional part of cent may be disregarded.
In the payment of employers' contributions to the Board a fractional part of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent or more, in which case it shall be increased to one cent.
§ 345.118
Adjustments.
(a)
In general.
If more or less than the correct amount of an employer's contribution is paid with respect to any compensation, proper adjustments with respect to the contributions shall be made, without interest, in subsequent contribution payments by the same employer, as provided for in this section.
(b)
Compensation adjustment.
A compensation adjustment is the amount of any adjustment reported by an employer on Form BA-4. See part 209 of this chapter.
(c)
Adjustment of contributions.
(1) All adjustments of contributions based on compensation adjustments shall be accounted for by the employer on the contribution report for the same quarter in which the Form BA-4 reflecting the compensation adjustments is filed with the Board.
(2) If less than the correct amount of contributions is paid for any previous calendar quarter or calendar year because of an error that does not constitute a compensation adjustment as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, the employer shall adjust the error by—
(i) Reporting the additional contribution on the next report filed after discovery of the error; and
(ii) Paying the amount thereof to the Board at the time such report is filed.
(3) If more than the correct amount of contributions is paid for any previous calendar quarter or calendar year because of an error that does not constitute a compensation adjustment as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, the employer shall adjust the error by applying the excess payment as a credit against the contribution due on the next report filed after discovery of the error. However, if the overpayment cannot be adjusted because the employer is no longer required to file a report or because the overpayment to be adjusted exceeds the amount of contribution due on the employer's next report, the employer may file for a refund of the amount which cannot be adjusted as provided for in this section. If the overpayment is the result of an incorrect contribution rate as determined by the Board, the employer may file for a refund of the amount of overpayment or may take an adjustment as provided for in this section.
(d)
Limitations on adjustments.
No overpayment shall be adjusted under this section after the expiration of three years from the time the contribution report was required to be filed, or two years from the time the contribution was paid, whichever of such periods expires the later, or if no contribution report was filed, two years from the time the contribution was paid. Any underpayment not adjusted within the time limits as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section shall be adjusted on the employer's next contribution report or reported immediately on a supplemental return. Interest shall accrue on such underpayment as provided for in § 345.122 of this part from the time the adjustment should have been made under paragraph (c) of this section to date of payment. However, no underpayment shall be adjusted under this section after the receipt from the Board of formal notice and demand.
§ 345.119
Refunds.
(a)
In general.
If more than the correct amount of the employer's contribution is paid with respect to any compensation and the overpayment may not be adjusted in accordance with § 345.118 of this part, the amount of the overpayment shall be refunded in accordance with this section.
(b)
When permitted.
A claim for refund may be made only when the overpayment cannot be adjusted in accordance with the procedure set forth in § 345.118.
(c)
Form of claim.
A claim for refund shall be directed to the Chief Financial Officer and shall set forth all grounds in detail and all facts alleged in support of the claim, including the amount and date of each payment to the Board of the contribution to the Board, and the period covered by the contribution report on which such contribution was reported.
(d)
Claim by fiduciary.
If an executor, administrator, guardian, trustee, or receiver files a claim for refund, evidence to establish the legal authority of the fiduciary shall be annexed to the claim filed by such fiduciary under this section.
(e)
Time limit.
No refund shall be allowed after the expiration of three years from the time the contribution report was required to be filed or two years from the time the contribution was paid, whichever of such periods expires the later, or if no contribution report was filed, two years from the time the contribution was paid.
(f)
Interest.
Interest shall be payable on any contribution refunded at the overpayment rate provided for in section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 from the date of the overpayment to a date preceding the date of the refund check by not more than 30 days.
(g)
Refunds reduced by underpayments.
Any overpayment claimed or a refund under this section shall be reduced by the amount of any amount of any contributions previously assessed under § 345.120 of this part, which has not already been collected.
§ 345.120
Assessment and collection of contributions or underpayments of contributions.
(a) If any employer's contribution is not paid to the Board when due or is not paid in full when due, the Board
may, as the circumstances warrant, assess the contribution or the deficiency and any interest or penalty applicable under this part (whether or not the deficiency is adjustable as an underpayment under § 345.118 of this part).
(b) The amount of any such assessment will be collected in accordance with the applicable provisions of law. If any employer liable to pay any contribution neglects or refuses to pay the same within ten days after notice and demand, the Board may collect such contribution with such interest and other additional amounts as are required by law, by levy, by administrative offset as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3716 and in accordance with the procedures set forth in part 367 of this chapter, or by a proceeding in court, but only if the levy is made or proceeding begun:
(1) Within 10 years after assessment of the contribution; or
(2) Prior to the expiration of any period, including extension thereof, for collection agreed upon by the Chief Financial Officer and the employer.
(c) All provisions of law, including penalties, applicable with respect to any tax imposed by the provisions of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act and the regulations thereunder, insofar as not inconsistent with the provisions in this part, shall be applicable with respect to the assessment and collection of contributions under this part.
§ 345.121
Jeopardy assessment.
(a) Whenever in the opinion of the Board it becomes necessary to protect the interests of the Government by effecting an immediate reporting and collection of an employer's contribution, the Board will assess the contribution whether or not the time otherwise prescribed by law for filing the contribution report and paying such contribution has expired, together with all penalties and interest thereon. Upon assessment, such contribution, and any penalty, and interest provided for under this part shall be immediately due and payable, and the Board shall thereupon issue immediately a notice and demand for payment of the contribution, penalty, and interest.
(b) The collection of the whole or any part of the amount of the jeopardy assessment may be stayed by filing with the Board a bond in an amount equal to the amount with respect to which the stay is desired, and with such sureties as the Board may deem necessary. Such bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of the amount (together with interest and any penalties thereon) the collection of which is stayed, at the time at which, but for the jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due. In lieu of surety or sureties the employer may deposit with the Board bonds or notes of the United States, or bonds or notes fully guaranteed by the United States as to principal and interest, having a par value not less than the amount of the bond required to be furnished, together with an agreement authorizing the Board in case of default to collect or sell such bonds or notes so deposited.
§ 345.122
Interest.
(a)
Rate.
If the employer's contribution is not paid to the Board when due and is not adjusted under § 345.118 of this part, interest accrues at the rate of 1 percent per month, or fraction of a month. Interest on past due contributions from the due date thereof until the date paid will be assessed after payment of the contributions, and notice and demand made upon the employer for payment thereof, in any case in which payment of the contribution is made before assessment under § 345.120.
(b)
Waiver of interest.
The Chief Financial Officer may waive, in whole or in part, any interest imposed by paragraph (a) of this section if in his or her judgment—
(1) There was a reasonable cause and not willful neglect for the late filing, late payment or underpayment, such as: the serious illness or death of an individual with the sole authority to execute the return and payment; fire, casualty, or natural disaster at the place where the railroad unemployment insurance records are kept; or reasons outside the employer's control, such as, the failure of the employer's bank to comply with the employer's filing and payment instructions;
(2) The amount of interest attributed to the delinquency is totally disproportionate to the period of the delay and the amount of contributions paid; and
(3) The employer's past record for timely compliance with railroad unemployment insurance reporting and payment requirements warrants such action considering such factors as the number and extent of delays associated with late reports, payments, and underpayments.
§ 345.123
Penalty for delinquent or false contribution reports.
(a)
Delinquent reports.
Unless waived under paragraph (b) of this section, the failure to file a contribution report on or before the due date shall cause a penalty to accrue of five percent of the amount of such contribution if the failure is for not more than one month, with an additional five percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding 25 percent in the aggregate.
(b)
Waiver of penalty.
The Chief Financial Officer may waive all or a portion of the penalty imposed under paragraph (a) of this section consistent with the criteria applicable to waiver of interest as provided for in § 345.122(b) of this part.
(c)
Penalty on net amount.
For the purpose of paragraph (a) of this section the amount of contribution required to be shown on Form DC-1 shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the contribution that is paid on or before the date prescribed for the payment of the contribution and by the amount of any credit against the contribution that may be claimed upon the DC-1.
(d)
False reports.
If a fraudulent contribution report is made, a penalty equal to 50 percent of the amount of any underpayment shall be imposed on the employer.
§ 345.124
Right to appeal the amount of a contribution, interest, or penalty.
(a) Except as otherwise provided, an employer may seek administrative review of any determination with respect to any contribution, interest, or penalty made under this part by filing a request for reconsideration with the Chief Financial Officer within 30 days after the mailing of notice of such determination. An employer shall have a right to appeal to the Board from any reconsideration decision under this section by filing notice of appeal to the Secretary to the Board within 14 days after the mailing of the decision on reconsideration. Upon receipt of a notice of an appeal, the Board may designate one of its officers or employees to receive evidence and report to the Board under the procedures set forth in part 319 of this chapter. An appeal of the contribution rate is made under § 345.307 of this part.
(b) Any appeal filed under this part shall not relieve the employer from filing any reports or paying any contribution required under this part nor stay the collection thereof. Upon the request of an employer, the Board may relieve the employer of any obligation required under this part pending an appeal. Unless specifically provided by the Board, such relief shall not stay the accrual of interest on any disputed amount as provided for in § 345.122 of this part.

§ 345.125
Records.
Every employer subject to the payment of contributions for any calendar quarter shall, with respect to each such quarter, keep such permanent records as are necessary to establish the total amount of compensation payable to its employees, for a period of at least five calendar years after the date the contribution report to which the compensation relates was required to be filed, or the date the contribution is paid, whichever is later. The record should be in such form as to contain the information required to be shown on the quarterly contribution report. All records required by the regulations in this part shall be kept at a safe and convenient location accessible to inspection by the Board or any of its officers or employees, or by the Inspector General of the Railroad Retirement Board. Such records shall be at all times open for inspection by such officers or employees.

§ 345.126
Liens.
If any employer, after demand, neglects or refuses to pay a contribution
required under this part, the amount of such contribution (including any interest, penalties, additional amount, or additions to such contribution, together with any costs that may accrue in addition thereto) shall be a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such employer.

# Subpart C—Individual Employer Records
§ 345.201
Individual employer record defined.
Effective January 1, 1990, the Board will establish and maintain a record, hereinafter known as an Individual Employer Record, for each employer subject to this part. As used in this subpart, “Individual Employer Record” means a record of each employer's benefit ratio; reserve ratio; 1-year compensation base; 3-year compensation base; unallocated charge; reserve balance; net cumulative contribution balance; and cumulative benefit balance. See § 345.302 of this part for a definition of these terms. Whenever a new employer begins paying compensation with respect to which contributions are payable under this part, the Board will establish and maintain an individual employer record for such employer.
§ 345.202
Consolidated employer records.
(a)
Establishing a consolidated employer record.
Two or more employers that are under common ownership or control may request the Board to consolidate their individual employer records into a joint individual employer record. Such joint individual employer record shall be treated as though it were a single employer record. A request for such consolidation shall be made to the Director of Policy and Systems, and such consolidation shall be effective commencing with the calendar year following the year of the request.
(b)
Discontinuance of a consolidated employer record.
Two or more employers that have established and maintained a consolidated employer record will be permitted to discontinue such consolidated record only if the individual employers agree to an allocation of the consolidated employer record and such allocation is approved by the Director of Policy and Systems. The discontinuance of the consolidated record shall be effective commencing with the calendar year following the year of the Director of Policy and Systems' approval.
[80 FR 13764, Mar. 17, 2015]
§ 345.203
Merger or combination of employers.
In the event of a merger or combination of two or more employers, or an employer and non-employer, the individual employer record of the employer surviving the merger (or any person that becomes an employer as the result of the merger or combination) shall consist of the combination of the individual employer records of the entities participating in the merger. Where the person surviving the merger is an existing employer under part 202 of this chapter, the individual employer record for the surviving employer will not be updated to reflect the combined record until the calendar year following the year of the Board's determination. Where the entity surviving the merger becomes an employer under part 202 of this chapter by virtue of the merger, the individual employer record shall consist of the combined record effective with its employer effective date.
[70 FR 42489, July 25, 2005]
§ 345.204
Sale or transfer of assets.
(a) In the event property of an employer is sold or transferred to another employer (or to a person that becomes an employer as the result of the sale or transfer) or is partitioned among two or more employers or persons, the individual employer record of such employer shall be prorated among the employer or employers that receive the property (including any person that becomes an employer by reason of such transaction or partition), in accordance with any agreement among the respective parties (including an agreement that there shall be no proration of the employer record). Such agreement shall be subject to the approval of the Board. Where the employer acquiring the assets is an existing employer under part 202 of this chapter,
that employer's individual employer record will take into consideration the acquired assets no earlier than the calendar year following the year of the Board's determination, unless an agreement among the respective parties provides otherwise. Where the employer acquiring the assets becomes an employer under part 202 of this chapter by virtue of such acquisition, the individual employer record for such employer shall consider the acquired assets as of such person's employer effective date, subject to any agreement between the respective parties and the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) There shall be no transfer of the employer record where an employer abandons a line of track in accordance with the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act and the applicable regulations thereunder, and a new entity, found by the Board to be an “employer” under part 301 of this chapter, is formed to operate or continue service over such line; the Board will assign to such entity a new-employer contribution rate in accordance with section 8(a)(1)(D) of the RUIA and § 345.304 of this part.
[61 FR 20072, May 3, 1996, as amended at 70 FR 42489, July 25, 2005]
§ 345.205
Reincorporation.
The cumulative benefit balance, net cumulative contribution balance, 1-year compensation base, and 3-year compensation base of an employer that reincorporates or otherwise alters its corporate identity in a transaction not involving a merger, consolidation, or unification will attach to the reincorporated or altered identity.
§ 345.206
Abandonment.
If an employer abandons property or discontinues service but continues to operate as an employer, the employer's individual employer record shall continue to be calculated as provided in this subpart without retroactive adjustment.
§ 345.207
Defunct employer.
If the Board determines that an employer has permanently ceased to pay compensation with respect to which contributions are payable under this part, the Board will, on the date of such determination, transfer the employer's net cumulative contribution balance as a subtraction from, and the cumulative benefit balance as an addition to, the system unallocated charge balance and will cancel all other accumulations of the employer. The Board's determination that an employer is defunct will be based on evidence indicating that the employer has ceased all operations as an employer and has terminated its status as an employer. In making its determination, the Board will consider evidence as described in part 202 of this chapter with respect to termination of employer status under the Railroad Retirement Act. Mere failure of an employer to pay contributions due under this part does not indicate that such employer is defunct.
§ 345.208
System records.
Effective January 1, 1990, the Board will establish and maintain records necessary to determine pooled charges, pooled credits, and unallocated charges for the experience rating system and will publish a notice with respect thereto no later than October 15 of each year. See § 345.302 of this part for the definition of these terms.

# Subpart D—Contribution Rates
§ 345.301
Introduction.
(a)
General.
Effective January 1, 1993, each employer that is subject to this part will have an experience-rated rate of contribution computed as set forth in § 345.303 of this part. A transitional rate of contribution applies to each such employer for 1991 and 1992, in accordance with section 8(a)(1)(B) of the RUIA. An employer that first becomes subject to section 8 of the RUIA after December 31, 1989 will have a “new-employer” contribution rate as computed in § 345.304 of this part. An employer's experience-rated contribution rate will be not less than 0.65 percent nor more than 12.5 percent. Not later than October 15 of each year, the Board will notify each employer of its experience-rated contribution rate for the following calendar year.
(b)
Components of an experience-rated contribution rate.
An employer's experience-rated contribution rate for each
calendar year beginning with 1993 will be based upon the following charges:
(1) An allocated charge based upon the amount of benefits paid to employees of such employer; this charge is explained in subpart E of this part;
(2) An unallocated charge based upon a proportionate share of the system unallocated charge balance, the computation of which is explained in § 345.302(p) of this part;
(3) A pooled charge, also referred to as risk-sharing, to cover the cost of benefit payments that are chargeable to a base year employer but are not captured by the contribution rate assigned to such employer because it is paying contributions at the maximum rate of contribution; the formula for computing the pooled charge is set forth in § 345.302(j) of this part;
(4) A surcharge of 1.5, 2.5, or 3.5 percent, or a pooled credit, depending on the balance to the credit of the Account as of June 30 of a given year; and
(5) An addition of 0.65 percent to the rate of contribution to cover the expenses incurred by the Board in administering the RUIA.
(c)
Maximum rate of contribution.
Notwithstanding any provision of this part, an employer's contribution rate for any calendar year shall be limited to 12 percent, except when a surcharge of 3.5 percent is in effect with respect to that calendar year. If a 3.5 percent surcharge is in effect, the maximum contribution limit with respect to that calendar year is 12.5 percent. The surcharge rate for a calendar year will be 3.5 percent when the balance to the credit of the Account is less than zero. The Board will compute the surcharge rate in accordance with § 345.302(n) of this part.
§ 345.302
Definition of terms and phrases used in experience-rating.
(a)
Account.
The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account established by section 10 of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) and maintained by the Secretary of the Treasury in the unemployment trust fund established pursuant to section 904 of the Social Security Act. Benefits paid under the RUIA for an employee's days of unemployment or days of sickness are paid from this Account.
(b)
Benefit ratio.
This ratio is computed for each employer as of any given June 30 by dividing all benefits charged to the employer under subpart E of this part during the 12 calendar quarters ending on such June 30 by the employer's three-year compensation base as of such June 30, as computed under paragraph (q) of this section. The ratio is computed to four decimal places.
(c)
Benefits.
Benefits are money payments paid or payable by the Board to a qualified employee with respect to his or her days of unemployment or days of sickness, as provided by the RUIA.
(d)
Compensation.
This term has the meaning given in part 302 of this chapter.
(e)
Contributions.
Contributions are the money payments paid or payable by an employer subject to this part with respect to the compensation paid or payable to employees of such employer.
(f)
Cumulative benefit balance.
An employer's cumulative benefit balance as of any given June 30 is determined by adding:
(1) The net amount of the benefits charged to the employer under subpart E on or after January 1, 1990, and
(2) The cumulative amount of the employer's unallocated charges on and after January 1, 1990, as computed under paragraph (r) of this section.
(g)
Fund.
The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Administration Fund established by section 11 of the RUIA and maintained by the Secretary of the Treasury in the unemployment trust fund established pursuant to section 904 of the Social Security Act. The costs incurred by the Board in administering the RUIA are paid from the Fund.
(h)
Net cumulative contribution balance.
The Board will determine an employer's net cumulative contribution balance as of any given June 30, as follows:
(1)
Step 1.
Compute the sum of all contributions paid by the employer pursuant to this part after December 31, 1989; add that portion of the tax, if any, imposed under 26 U.S.C. 3321(a) that is attributable to the surtax rate under section 7106(b) of the Railroad
Unemployment Insurance and Retirement Improvement Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-647) and any repayment taxes paid by the employer pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 3321(a) after the outstanding balance of loans made under section 10(d) of the RUIA before October 1, 1985, plus interest, has been paid;
(2)
Step 2.
Subtract an amount equal to the amount of such contributions deposited, pursuant to section 8(i) of the RUIA, to the credit of the Fund; and
(3)
Step 3.
Add an amount equal to the aggregate amount by which such contributions were reduced in prior calendar years as a result of pooled credits, if any, under paragraph (k) of this section.
(i)
One-year compensation base.
An employer's one-year compensation base is the aggregate amount of compensation with respect to which the employer is liable for contributions under this part in the four calendar quarters ending on such June 30.
(j)
Pooled charge ratio.
The pooled charge ratio, when applicable, is a pro-rata increase in the rate of contribution assigned to each employer that is not already paying contributions at the maximum rate. A pooled charge will become applicable to each such employer during a calendar year when the Account loses income because one or more other employers are paying contributions at the maximum rate (12 or 12.5 percent) rather than at the higher experience-based rate that their benefit charges would otherwise require. The pooled charge ratio thus picks up the cost of benefits paid to employees of employers whose rate of contribution is capped at the maximum rate. The pooled charge ratio for a calendar year is the same for all employers whose rate is less than the maximum and is computed as follows:
(1)
Step 1.
For each employer paying contributions at the maximum contribution limit under § 345.301(c) of this part, compute the amount of contributions that such employer would have paid if its experience-based rate were applied to its one-year compensation base as of the preceding June 30 and by then deducting from such amount the amount derived by applying the maximum contribution rate to the same one-year compensation base. For the purposes of this computation, the experience-based rate is the rate computed for such employer under § 345.303 of this part.
(2)
Step 2.
After the amount is computed for each employer in accordance with Step 1 of this paragraph (j), add the amounts for all such employers. The aggregate amount so computed represents the amount of contributions not collected by the Account because of the maximum contribution limit.
(3)
Step 3.
For each employer whose experience-based rate of contribution, as computed at Step 3 of § 345.303(a) of this part, is less than zero, the percentage rate by which the employer's rate was raised in order to bring that rate to the minimum rate of zero is multiplied by the employer's 1-year compensation base. The total of the amounts so computed is subtracted from the aggregate amount computed in Step 2 of this paragraph (j).
(4)
Step 4.
Divide the net aggregate amount computed at Step 3 of this paragraph (j) by the system compensation base as of the preceding June 30, excluding from such base the one-year compensation base of each employer whose experience-based contribution rate, computed at Step 6 of § 345.303(a) of this part, exceeds the maximum contribution limit. The result is the pooled charge ratio for the current calendar year. This ratio is computed to four decimal places.
(k)
Pooled credit ratio.
Effective January 1, 1991, and on the first of each subsequent calendar year, the Board will reduce each employer's rate of contribution, as computed under § 345.303 of this part, by the amount of the pooled credit ratio, if any, applicable to such calendar year. This ratio is computed by reference to the accrual balance to the credit of the Account as of the preceding June 30. The Board will determine the amount of the pooled credit ratio, as follows:
(1)
Step 1.
First, the Board computes the accrual balance to the credit of the Account as of the close of business on the preceding June 30 in the same manner as under Step 1 of paragraph (n) of this section. There will be a pooled credit ratio for the calendar year if that balance is in excess of the greater
of $250 million or of the amount that bears the same ratio to $250 million as the system compensation base as of that June 30 bears to the system compensation base as of June 30, 1991, as computed in accordance with paragraph (o) of this section.
(2)
Step 2.
If there is such an excess amount, divide that excess amount by the system compensation base as of the June 30 preceding the calendar year. The result is the pooled credit ratio applicable to each employer for the calendar year involved in the computation. This ratio is computed to four decimal places.
(l)
Reserve balance.
An employer's reserve balance is computed as of any given June 30 by subtracting its cumulative benefit balance as of such June 30 from its net cumulative contribution balance as of such June 30. An employer's net cumulative benefit balance is computed under paragraph (f) of this section and its net cumulative contribution balance under paragraph (h) of this section. An employer's reserve balance may be either positive or negative, depending upon whether its net cumulative contribution balance exceeds its cumulative benefit balance.
(m)
Reserve ratio.
This ratio is computed for each employer as of any given June 30 by dividing its reserve balance as of June 30 by its one-year compensation base as of such June 30. An employer's reserve balance is computed under paragraph (l) of this section and its one-year compensation base under paragraph (i) of this section. This ratio is computed to four decimal places; it may be either a positive or negative figure, depending on whether the employer's reserve balance is a positive or negative figure.
(n)
Surcharge rate.
Effective January 1, 1991, and on the first of each subsequent calendar year, the Board will add to each employer's rate of contribution, as computed under § 345.303 of this part, a surcharge rate of 1.5, 2.5, or 3.5 percent if the accrual balance to the credit of the Account, as of the preceding June 30, falls within the range of balances set forth in Steps 1 and 2 of this paragraph (n). The Board will determine which surcharge rate, if any, is in effect for a calendar year by means of the following computation:
(1)
Step 1.
First, the Board computes the accrual balance to the credit of the Account as of the close of business on the preceding June 30. Such balance will include any amounts in the Account attributable to loans made under section 10(d) of the Act before October 1, 1985, but not the obligation of the Account to repay such loans with interest. For this purpose, the Account will be deemed to include any balance to the credit of the Fund that exceeds $6 million. The surcharge rate, as specified in Step 2 of this paragraph (n), will apply if that balance is less than the greater of $100 million or of the amount that bears the same ratio to $100 million as the system compensation base as of that June 30 bears to the system compensation base as of June 30, 1991, as computed in accordance with paragraph (o) of this section.
(2)
Step 2.
If the balance to the credit of the Account is less than the greater of the amounts referred to in the last sentence of Step 1 of this paragraph (n), but is equal to or more than the greater of $50 million or of the amount that bears the same ratio to $50 million as the system compensation base as of that June 30 bears to the system compensation base as of June 30, 1991, then the surcharge rate for the calendar year shall be 1.5 percent. If the balance to the credit of the Account is less than the greater of the amounts referred to in this Step 2, but greater than or equal to zero, then the surcharge rate for the calendar year shall be 2.5 percent. If the balance to the credit of the Account is less than zero, the surcharge rate for the calendar year shall be 3.5 percent.
(o)
System compensation base.
The system compensation base as of June 30 of each year is the total of the amounts of the one-year compensation bases of all base year employers, computed in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section. Not later than October 15 of each year, the Board will compute the amount of the system compensation base and will publish notice of such amount in the
Federal Register
as soon as practicable thereafter.
(p)
System unallocated charge balance.
This balance, as computed initially for the period January 1 through June 30, 1990 and updated as of June 30 of each
subsequent calendar year, represents the net amount of expenditures from, and income to, the Account that cannot be allocated as benefit charges, or adjustments, to the cumulative benefit balances of individual base year employers. The Board computes this balance, as of June 30 of each year, as follows:
(1)
Step 1.
Compute the aggregate amount of all interest paid by the Account on loans from the Railroad Retirement Account after September 30, 1985, pursuant to section 10(d) of the RUIA, during the 12-month period ending on June 30;
(2)
Step 2.
Add the amount of unemployment benefits paid by reason of strikes or work stoppages growing out of labor disputes and the cumulative benefit balance of any defunct employer;
(3)
Step 3.
Add the aggregate amount of any other benefit payment that is not chargeable to a base year employer pursuant to subpart E of this part and any other expenditure not chargeable to the Fund;
(4)
Step 4.
Subtract the aggregate amount of income to the Account received as a proportionate part of the earnings of the unemployment trust fund, computed in accordance with section 904(e) of the Social Security Act, and all income to the Account received as fines or penalties collected under the RUIA;
(5)
Step 5.
Subtract the aggregate amount of all transfers from the Fund to the Account pursuant to section 11(d) of the RUIA;
(6)
Step 6.
Subtract the aggregate amount of any other cash receipt to the Account that cannot be treated as an adjustment to the benefit charges of a base year employer;
(7)
Step 7.
Subtract the net cumulative contribution balance of any defunct employer, calculated as of the date on which the Board determines that such employer is defunct. After the Board has computed the amount of the system unallocated charge balance as of June 30 of each year, the Board will publish notice of such amount in the
Federal Register
on or before October 15 of such year.
(q)
Three-year compensation base.
An employer's three-year compensation base as of any given June 30 is the aggregate amount of compensation with respect to which the employer is liable for contributions under this part in the 12 calendar quarters ending on such June 30.
(r)
Unallocated charge.
An employer's unallocated charge as of any given June 30 is the amount that, as of such June 30, bears the same ratio to the system unallocated charge balance as the employer's 1-year compensation base bears to the system compensation base. The system unallocated charge balance is computed under paragraph (p) of this section and the system compensation base under paragraph (o) of this section.
§ 345.303
Computation of rate.
(a) With respect to compensation in a calendar year that begins after December 31, 1992, the Board will compute, by October 15, 1992, and by October 15 of each subsequent year, a contribution rate for each employer (other than a new employer) in accordance with the following 8-step process:
(1)
Step 1.
Compute the employer's
benefit ratio
as of the preceding June 30;
(2)
Step 2.
Compute the employer's
reserve ratio
as of the preceding June 30 and subtract it from the
benefit ratio;
(3)
Step 3.
Subtract the
pooled credit ratio
(if any) for the calendar year;
(4)
Step 4.
Multiply the Step 3 result by 100, in order to obtain a percentage rate, and then round such rate to the nearest 100th of one percent. If the rate so computed is zero or less than zero, the percentage rate will be deemed zero at this point;
(5)
Step 5.
Add 0.65 (the administrative charge) to the percentage rate computed through Step 4.
(6)
Step 6.
Add the
surcharge rate
(if any) for the calendar year;
(7)
Step 7.
Add the
pooled charge ratio
(if any) for the calendar year, as computed to four decimal places and multiplied by 100;
(8)
Step 8.
If the rate computed through Step 7 is greater than 12 percent (or 12.5 percent if a surcharge of 3.5 percent is in effect for the calendar year), reduce the percentage rate so computed to 12 percent or 12.5 percent, if appropriate.
(b) The percentage rate computed under paragraph (a) of this section is the employer's rate of contribution for the calendar year in question.
(c)(1) Any computation that is to be made under this section on the basis of a 12-quarter period ending on a given June 30 shall be made on the basis of a period beginning on January 1, 1990, or on the first day of the first calendar quarter that begins after the date on which the employer first began to pay compensation subject to this part, or on July 1 of the third calendar year preceding that June 30, whichever date is later, and ending on that June 30.
(2) The amount computed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be increased to an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount so computed as 12 bears to the number of calendar quarters on which the computation is based.
§ 345.304
New-employer contribution rates.
(a) An employer whose coverage under the RUIA becomes effective after December 31, 1989, is considered a “new employer” for the purposes of this part and will be assigned a contribution rate as computed under this section. The Board shall determine where an employer is a new employer and, if so, the effective date of its coverage under the RUIA and its rate of contribution with respect to compensation paid to employees on and after such effective date.
(b)
Initial contribution rate.
The rate of contribution with respect to compensation paid in calendar months before the end of the first full calendar year that the employer is subject to this section shall be the average contribution rate paid by all employers during the three calendar years preceding the calendar year before the calendar year in which the compensation is paid. The Board will compute the average contribution rate by dividing the aggregate contributions paid by all employers during those three calendar years by the aggregate compensation with respect to which such contributions were paid and by then multiplying the resulting ratio, as computed to four decimal points, by 100.
(c)
Second contribution rate.
The rate of contribution with respect to compensation paid in months in the second full calendar year shall be the smaller of the maximum contribution limit under the RUIA or the percentage rate computed as follows:
ER03MY96.047
(d)
Third contribution rate.
The rate of contribution with respect to compensation paid in months in the third full calendar year shall be the smaller of the maximum contribution limit under the RUIA or the percentage rate computed as follows:
ER03MY96.048
(e)
Subsequent calendar years.
The rate of contribution with respect to months after the third full calendar year shall be determined under § 345.303 of this part.
(f)
Meaning of symbols.
For the purpose of the formulas in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, “R” is the applicable contribution rate being computed; “A2” is the contribution rate that would have been determined under paragraph (b) of this section if the employer's second calendar year had been its first full calendar year; “A3” is the contribution rate that would have been determined under paragraph (b) of this section, if the employer's third calendar year had been such employer's first full calendar year; “B” is the contribution rate for the employer as determined under § 345.303 of this part for the employer's second full calendar year; and “C” is the contribution rate for the employer as determined under § 345.303 of this part for the employer's third full calendar year.
(g)
Special rule for certain computations.
For purposes of computing “B” and “C” in the formulas in this section, the percentage rate computed under § 345.303 shall not be reduced under Step 8 of that section; and any computations that, under § 345.303, are to be made on the basis of a 4-quarter or 12-quarter period ending on a given June 30 shall be made on the basis of a period commencing with the first day
of the first calendar quarter that begins after the date on which the employer first began paying compensation subject to this part and ending on that June 30, and the amount so computed shall be increased to an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount so computed as four or twelve, as appropriate, bears to the number of calendar quarters in the period on which the computation was based.
§ 345.305
Notification and proclamations.
(a)
Quarterly notifications to employers.
Not later than the last day of any calendar quarter that begins after March 31, 1990, the Board will notify each employer of its cumulative benefit balance and its net cumulative contribution balance as of the end of the preceding calendar quarter, as computed in accordance with § 345.302(f) and (h) of this part as of the last day of such preceding calendar quarter rather than as of a given June 30 if such last day is not a June 30.
(b)
Annual notifications to employers.
Not later than October 15, 1990, and October 15 of each year thereafter, the Board will notify each employer of its benefit ratio, reserve ratio, one-year compensation base, three-year compensation base, unallocated charge, and reserve balance as of the preceding June 30, as computed in accordance with this part, and of the contribution rate applicable to the employer for the following calendar year as computed under the applicable section of this part.
(c)
Proclamations.

# Subpart E—Benefit Charging
§ 345.401
General rule.
Effective January 1, 1990, all benefits paid to an employee for his or her days of unemployment or days of sickness will be charged to the base year employer of such employee, except as hereinafter provided in this part. The Board will make the charge by adding the gross amount of the benefits payable to an employee on the basis of a claim for benefits to that employee's base year employer's cumulative benefit balance. The benefit charge does not depend on whether the employee receiving the benefit payment is a current employee of the base year employer.
§ 345.402
Strikes or work stoppages.
If benefits are payable to an employee for days of unemployment resulting from a strike or work stoppage growing out of a labor dispute, the Board will charge the benefit payment to the system unallocated charge balance, not to the cumulative benefit balance of the employee's base year employer. For the purposes of this section, the phrase “strike or work stoppage growing out of a labor dispute” does not include an employee's protected refusal to work under section 212(b) of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 441(b)).
§ 345.403
Multiple base year employers.
(a)
General rules for benefit charging.
All benefits paid to an employee who had more than one base year employer shall be charged to the cumulative benefit balances of such employers, as follows:
(1) If the employer at the time of the claim is the same as the last employer in the base year, benefits will be charged in reverse chronological order, but the amount charged to each base year employer shall not exceed the amount of compensation paid by such employer to the employee in the base year;
(2) In all other cases, benefits will be charged in the same ratio as the compensation paid to such employee by the employer bears to the total of such compensation paid to such employee by all such employers in the base year; benefit charging in accordance with this method shall apply whether the base year employment was with successive employers or with concurrent employers.
(b)
Excess benefit payments.
If, in applying the rule in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, there remain benefit payments, in whole or in part, that cannot be charged to any base year employer, the amount of benefits paid in excess of those chargeable under paragraph (a)(1) shall be charged to the system unallocated charge balance.
(c)
Board records as basis for charging multiple base year employers.
Where an employee has more than one base year employer, the Board will use records compiled on the basis of employer reports filed under § 345.110 of this part for the purpose of determining whether the employer at the time of the claim for benefits is the last employer in the base year and for other purposes related to benefit charging under this subpart. If, in a particular case, such records do not contain all the data necessary to determine the charge, the Board will request the necessary data from the base year employers who may be liable for the charge.
§ 345.404
Adjustments.
(a)
Recovery of benefits charged to base year employer.
Where the Board recovers a benefit payment that it had previously charged, in whole or in part, to one or more base year employers, the Board will subtract the amount of the recovery from the cumulative benefit balances of the employers of the employee to whom such amount was paid as a benefit in proportion to the amount by which each such employer's cumulative benefit balance was increased as a result of the payment of the benefit.
(b)
Recovery of other benefit payments.
Where the Board recovers a benefit payment that was not charged, in whole or in part, to any base year employer, or was made before January 1, 1990, the Board will treat the amount of the recovery as a subtraction from the system unallocated charge balance.
(c)
Payment of interest or other debt collection-related charges.
The Board will not adjust a base year employer's cumulative benefit balance to reflect payment by a debtor of interest or other charges assessed by the Board under § 200.7 of this chapter with respect to the collection of a debt arising from a benefit payment charged to such employer and later found to be recoverable by the Board.
(d)
Limitations.
The Board will adjust a base year employer's cumulative benefit balance only when the Board actually recovers, by cash payment or setoff, a debt that represents a benefit payment that was charged, in whole or in part, to such employer. No adjustment shall be made—
(1) If the Board waives recovery of a debt in accordance with part 340 of this chapter, or
(2) If the Board finds that a debt is uncollectible, or
(3) To the extent of the amount not recovered by the Board by reason of a compromise settlement of a debt.
§ 345.405
Notices to base year employers.
(a)
Prepayment notification.
When the Board receives an employee's claim for unemployment or sickness benefits, the Board will give the employee's base year employer notice of the claim and an opportunity to provide information to the Board with respect to the employee's eligibility for benefits for the period of time covered by the claim.
(b)
Notice of claim determination.
After the base year employer has had an opportunity to provide information in accordance with the prepayment notification process described in paragraph (a) of this section, the office of the Board that is adjudicating the employee's claim for benefits will determine whether to pay or to deny benefits on the claim. Such office will send notice to the base year employer showing what determination was made on the claim. If benefits are found to be payable, the amount of the payment will be charged to the cumulative benefit balance of the base year employer in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. If the base year employer disagrees with the payment of benefits, it may request reconsideration in accordance with part 320 of this chapter.
(c)
Quarterly notice of benefit charges.
As soon as practical following the end of each calendar quarter, the Board will send to each employer a report of its cumulative benefit balance computed as of the end of such quarter. The computation of such balance will reflect the following:
(1) The total amount of unemployment and sickness benefit payments made after December 31, 1989, that have been charged to the employer as the base year employer of the employees who received the benefits; minus
(2) The total amount realized in recovery of such benefits; plus
(3) The total amount of the unallocated charges assigned to such base year employer after December 31, 1989; minus
(4) The total amount realized in recovery of such unallocated charges.
§ 345.406
Defunct employer.
Whenever the Board determines, pursuant to § 345.207 of this part, that an employer is defunct, the Board will add the amount of such employer's benefit charges, as shown in its cumulative benefit balance, to the system unallocated charge balance.

§ 348.1
Introduction.
(a)
Explanation of representative payment.
This part explains the principles and procedures that the Board follows in determining whether to make representative payment and in selecting a representative payee. It also explains the responsibilities that a representative payee has concerning the use of the funds which he or she receives on behalf of a claimant. A representative payee may be either a person or an organization selected by the Board to receive benefits on behalf of a claimant. A representative payee will be selected if the Board believes that the interest of a claimant will be served by representative payment rather than direct payment of benefits. Generally, the Board will appoint a representative payee if it determines that the claimant is not able to manage or direct the management of benefit payments in his or her interest.
(b)
Statutory authority.
Section 12 of the Railroad Retirement Act, which is also applicable to the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, provides that every claimant shall be conclusively presumed to have been competent until the date on which the Board receives a notice in writing that a legal guardian or other person legally vested with the care of the person or estate of an incompetent or a minor has been appointed:
Provided, however,
That despite receiving such notice, the Board may, if it finds the interests of such claimant to be served thereby, recognize actions by, conduct transactions with, and make payments to such claimant.
(c)
Policy used to determine whether to make representative payment.
(1) The Board's policy is that every claimant has the right to manage his or her own benefits. However, due to mental or physical condition some claimants may be unable to do so. If the Board determines that the interests of a claimant would be better served if benefit payments were certified to another person as representative payee, the Board will appoint a representative payee in accordance with the procedures set forth in this part. The Board may appoint a representative payee even if the claimant is a legally competent individual. If the claimant is a legally incompetent individual, the Board may appoint the legal guardian or some other person as a representative payee.
(2) If payment is being made directly to a claimant and a question arises concerning his or her ability to manage or direct the management of benefit
payments, the Board may, if the claimant has not been adjudged legally incompetent, continue to pay the claimant until the Board makes a determination about his or her ability to manage or direct the management of benefit payments and the selection of a representative payee.
§ 348.2
Recognition by the Board of a person to act in behalf of another.
The provisions of part 266 of this chapter shall be applicable to the appointment of a representative payee under this part to the same extent and in the same manner as they are applicable to the appointment of a representative payee under the Railroad Retirement Act.

§ 349.1
Reopening and revising decisions.
(a) This part sets forth the Board's rules governing finality of decisions with respect to benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. After the expiration of the time limits for review as set forth in part 320 of this chapter, decisions may be reopened and revised only under the conditions described in this subpart, by the bureau, office or entity that made the earlier decision or by a bureau, office, or other entity at a higher level which has the claim properly before it. Whether a final decision is reopened or not reopened is solely within the discretion of the Board.
(b) A
final decision,
as that term is used in this part, means any decision under § 320.5 of this chapter where the time limit for review, as set forth in part 320 of this chapter or in the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, has expired.
(c)
Reopening
a final decision under this part means a conscious determination on the part of the agency to reconsider an otherwise final decision for purposes of revising that decision.
(d)
New and material evidence,
as that phrase is used in this part, means evidence which was unavailable to the agency at the time the decision was made, and which the claimant could not reasonably have been expected to have submitted at that time.
§ 349.2
Conditions for reopening.
A final decision may be reopened:
(a) Within 12 months of the date of the notice of such decision, for any reason;
(b) Within four years of the date of the notice of such decision:
(1) If there is new and material evidence; or
(2) If the decision was not reasonably consistent with the evidence of record at the time of adjudication.
(c) At any time if:
(1) The decision was obtained by fraud or similar fault;
(2) The decision was that the claimant was not a qualified employee, and he or she is now qualified because compensation was credited to the employee's record of compensation in accordance with part 211 of this chapter:
(i) To correct errors apparent on the face of the compensation record;
(ii) To enter items transferred by the Social Security Administration which were credited under the Social Security Act when they should have been credited to the employee's railroad retirement compensation record; or
(iii) To correct errors made in the allocation of earnings to individuals or periods which would have made him or her a qualified employee at the time of the decision if the earnings had been credited to his or her earnings record at that time;
(3) The decision is wholly or partially unfavorable to a claimant, but only to correct a clerical error or an error that appears on the face of the evidence that was considered when the decision was made.
§ 349.3
Change of legal interpretation or administrative ruling.
A change of legal interpretation or administrative ruling upon which a decision is based does not render a decision erroneous and does not provide a basis for reopening.
§ 349.4
Late completion of timely investigation.
(a) A decision may be revised after the applicable time period in §§ 349.2(a) or (b) expires if the Board begins an investigation into whether to revise the decision before the applicable time period expires and the agency diligently pursues the investigation to the conclusion. The investigation may be based on a request by a claimant or on action by the Board.
(b)
Diligently pursued
for purposes of this section means that in view of the facts and circumstances of a particular case, the necessary action was undertaken and carried out as promptly as the circumstances permitted. Diligent pursuit will be presumed to have been met if the investigation is concluded and, if necessary, the decision is revised within six months from the date the investigation began.
(c) If the investigation is not diligently pursued to its conclusion, the decision will be revised if a revision is applicable and if it is favorable to the claimant. It will not be revised if it would be unfavorable to the claimant.
§ 349.5
Notice of revised decision.
(a) When a decision is revised, notice of the revision will be mailed to the parties to the decision at their last known address. The notice will state the basis for the revised decision and the effect of the revision. The notice will also inform the parties of the right to further review.
(b) If a hearings officer or the three-member Board proposes to revise a decision, and the revision would be based only on evidence included in the record on which the prior decision was based, all parties will be notified in writing of the proposed action. If a revised decision is issued by a hearings officer, any party may request that it be reviewed by the three-member Board, or the three-member Board may review the decision on its own initiative.
§ 349.6
Effect of revised decision.
A revised decision is binding unless:
(a) The revised decision is being reconsidered or appealed in accord with part 320 of this chapter;
(b) The three-member Board reviews the revised decision; or
(c) The revised decision is further revised consistent with this part.
§ 349.7
Time and place to request a review and/or hearing on revised decision.
A party to a revised decision may request, as appropriate, further review of the decision in accordance with the rules set forth in part 320 of this chapter. Further review or a hearing will be held according to the rules set forth in part 320 of this chapter.
§ 349.8
Discretion of the three-member Board to reopen or not to reopen a final decision.
In any case in which the three-member Board may deem proper, the Board may direct that any decision, which is otherwise subject to reopening under this part, shall not be reopened or direct that any decision, which is otherwise not subject to reopening under this part, shall be reopened.

§ 350.1
Authorization for garnishment of benefits paid by the Board.
(a) Annuities and accrued annuities payable under the Railroad Retirement Act, sickness and unemployment benefits payable under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, and benefits payable under any other Act administered by the Board, are subject, in like manner and to the same extent as if the Board were a private person, to legal process brought for the enforcement of legal obligations to provide child support or to make alimony payments.
(b) Lump sums, other than accrued annuities, which are payable under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, such as those payable under sections 6(b)(1) and 6(c)(1) of that Act, are not subject to legal process as defined in this subchapter. However, an individual entitled to a benefit under section 6 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 may assign the right to receive all or any part of that benefit.
(c) Except as authorized under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and part 295 of this chapter, no benefit paid by the Board shall be assignable or be subject to garnishment, attachment, or other legal process, nor shall the payment thereof be anticipated.
(d) In the absence of law to the contrary, it will be assumed that “wages,” “earnings,” and analogous terms referred to in relevant provisions of state law include payments made by a private person which are analogous to those paid by the Board.

§ 350.2
Definitions.
(a)
Child support
means periodic payments of funds for the support and maintenance of a child or children; such term also includes attorney's fees, interest, and court costs, when and to the same extent that they are expressly made recoverable pursuant to a decree, order, or judgment issued in accordance with applicable state law by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(b)
Alimony
means periodic payments of funds for the support and maintenance of a spouse or former spouse and, subject to and in accord with state law, includes but is not limited to, separate maintenance, alimony pendente lite, maintenance, and spousal support; such term also includes attorney's fees, interest, and court costs, when and to the extent that they are expressly made recoverable pursuant to a decree, order, or judgment issued in accord with applicable State law by a court of competent jurisdiction. Alimony does not include any payment or transfer of property or of its value in compliance with any community property settlement, equitable distribution of property, or other division of property, nor does it include any payment to an estate.
(c)
Legal process
means any court order, summons, or other similar process, including administrative orders, in the nature of garnishment, which is directed to and the purpose of which is to compel the Board to make a payment from moneys which are otherwise payable to an individual, to another party in order to satisfy a legal obligation of such individual to provide child support or make alimony payments. For purposes of this subchapter, legal process additionally includes assignments in lieu of garnishment, but only where
grounds for the issuance of legal process in the nature of garnishment exist. Such assignments are revocable.
(d)
Legal obligation
means an obligation to pay alimony or child support which is enforceable under appropriate state law.
[45 FR 28314, Apr. 29, 1980, as amended at 53 FR 35807, Sept. 15, 1988]
§ 350.3
Procedure.
(a) Service of legal process brought for the enforcement of an individual's obligation to provide child support or make alimony payments shall be accomplished by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, directed to the Deputy General Counsel of the Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611, or by personal service upon the Deputy General Counsel.
(b) Where the Deputy General Counsel is effectively served with legal process relating to an individual's legal obligation to provide child support or to make alimony payments, he shall, as soon as possible and not later than 15 days after the date of effective service of such process, send written notice that such process has been so served, together with a copy thereof, to the individual whose moneys are affected thereby; and, if response to such process is required, shall respond within 30 days, or within such longer period as may be prescribed by state law, after the date effective service is made. These requirements do not apply in the case of an assignment in lieu of garnishment or an assignment of a portion, attributable to the existence of the annuitant's family members, of a railroad retirement annuity computed under the social security minimum guaranty provision of the Railroad Retirement Act.
(c) Included with the legal process issued to the Board should be the name of the individual against whom the legal obligation to provide child support or to make alimony payments is sought to be enforced and, if available, the individual's social security or railroad retirement number, the individual's address, and the type of benefit that the individual is receiving from the Board.
(d) Legal process which refers to a payment in terms of a percentage of some other amount must also refer to that payment in terms of a specific amount or amounts. In connection with any legal process which does not refer to a payment in terms of a specific amount or amounts, the Board may compute the amount or may comply with that portion of the legal process which specifies an amount or amounts and withhold compliance with the balance of the process pending clarification from the issuing court or from the party which procured that process.
[45 FR 28314, Apr. 29, 1980, as amended at 48 FR 51448, Nov. 9, 1983]
§ 350.4
Exemptions.
(a) Unless a lower percentage or dollar amount limitation on garnishment is provided by applicable state or local law, the portion of any payment due to an individual which is subject to legal process to enforce any order for the support of any person shall not exceed 65 percent. Where the individual is supporting a spouse or dependent child, other than a spouse or child with respect to whose support that legal process is issued, the portion subject to legal process is reduced by 10 percent. Where the alimony or support arrearage is less than 12 weeks old, the portion subject to legal process is reduced by 5 percent. If a lower limitation is provided by applicable state or local law, then that lower limitation shall be applied.
(b) In the absence of some evidence to the contrary, it will be assumed that the defendant is not supporting a spouse or dependent child other than a spouse or child with respect to whose support the legal process is issued.
(c) In any case in which a recurring benefit payment is reduced, whether due to a recovery by the Board of an overpayment or for some other reason, below the rate at which it is ordinarily paid, any applicable exemptions shall be applied to the amount of the reduced benefit which is actually paid.
(d) For purposes of the applicability of exemptions, amounts deducted for medicare premiums must first be subtracted from the annuity amount.
[45 FR 28314, Apr. 29, 1980]
§ 350.5
Miscellaneous.
(a) The Board may not be required to vary its normal disbursement cycles in order to comply with legal process. However, legal process which is received too late to be honored during the disbursement cycle in which it is received may be honored to the extent that the legal process may, in compliance with this part, be satisfied from the next payment due to the obligor.
(b) Except as provided in these regulations, the Board may not be required in connection with proceedings under this part to forward documents which have been sent to the Board, to an individual, whether or not he is entitled to benefits paid by the Board, or to disclose information other than that relating to the type, amount (whether actual or estimated), and dates of payment of benefits paid by the Board to that individual.
(c) Neither the Board nor any of its employees shall be liable with respect to any payment made to any individual from moneys due from or payable by the Board pursuant to legal process regular on its face, if such payment is made in accordance with this part.
(d) No employee of the Board whose duties include responding to legal process pursuant to requirements contained in this part shall be subject under any law to any disciplinary action or civil or criminal liability or penalty for, or on account of, any disclosure of information made by such employee in connection with the performance of the employee's duties in responding to any such process.
(e) For purposes of a proceeding under this part, the Board will apply the law of the state in which the legal process is issued unless it comes to the attention of the Board that the state of issuance has no contact with the plaintiff or defendant in the action; in which case, the Board may, in its sole discretion, apply the law of any state with significant interest in the matter.
(f) No acknowledgement or response will be made to legal process which does not contain the mailing address to which acknowledgement may be made. No response to any legal process will be notarized or verified.

§ 355.30

(c) The defendant shall prove any affirmative defenses and any mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence.
(d) The hearing shall be open to the public unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ for good cause shown.
§ 355.31
Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.
(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and upon appeal, the authority head, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible
costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.
(b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the authority head in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (
i.e.,
the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint:
(1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements;
(2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;
(3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misconduct;
(4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;
(5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation;
(6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;
(7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of such programs;
(8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;
(9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;
(10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;
(11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;
(12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;
(13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;
(14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;
(15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a state, directly or indirectly; and
(16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct.
(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ALJ or the authority head from considering any other factors that in any given case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and assessments are imposed.
§ 355.32
Location of hearing.
(a) The hearing may be held—
(1) In any judicial district of the United States in which the defendant resides or transacts business;

(b) At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony may be admitted in the form of a written statement or deposition. Any such written statement must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address of such witness, in a manner which allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts
shall be exchanged as provided in § 355.22(a).
(c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to—
(1) Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth.
(2) Avoid needless consumption of time, and
(3) Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.
(d) The ALJ shall permit the parties to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
(e) At the discretion of the ALJ, a witness may be cross-examined on matters relevant to the proceeding without regard to the scope of his or her direct examination. To the extent permitted by the ALJ, cross-examination on matters outside the scope of direct examination shall be conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading questions only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party.
(f) Upon motion of any party, the ALJ shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This rule does not authorize exclusion of—
(1) A party who is an individual;
(2) In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or employee of the party designated by the party's representative; or
(3) An individual whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of its case, including an individual employed by the Government engaged in assisting the representative for the Government.

(d) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or by considerations of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.
(e) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if it is privileged under Federal law.
(f) Evidence concerning offers of compromise or settlement shall be inadmissible to the extent provided in Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.
(g) The ALJ shall permit the parties to introduce rebuttal witnesses and evidence.
(h) All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by all parties, unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ pursuant to § 355.24.

If the ALJ fails to meet the deadline contained in this paragraph, he or she shall notify the parties of the reason for the delay and shall set a new deadline.
(d) Unless the initial decision of the ALJ is timely appealed to the authority head, or a motion for reconsideration of the initial decision is timely filed, the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the authority head and shall be final and binding on the parties 30 days after it is issued by the ALJ.

§ 356.1
Introduction.
(a) The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act, as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015 (28 U.S.C. 2461 note), requires that civil monetary penalties be adjusted on an annual basis by the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for the month of October preceding the adjustment exceeds the CPI-U for the month of October of the calendar year prior to the October preceding the adjustment, with final amounts rounded to the nearest dollar. That Act also requires a one-time catch up adjustment in the amount of the percentage by which the CPI-U for October 2015 exceeds the CPI-U for the month of October of the calendar year during which the amount of civil monetary penalty was established or adjusted under a provision of law other than the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act.
(b) Other than adjustments under the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act, the Board last established or adjusted civil monetary penalties in 1986. The CPI-U increased by 215.628 percent between October 1986 and October 2015.
(c) Imposition of the increased civil monetary penalties are limited to actions occurring after the effective date of the increases.
(d) The amount of the one-time catch up adjustment may not exceed 150 percent of the penalty amount or range as of November 2, 2015. The ten percent cap on increases imposed by the Debt Collection Improvements Act of 1996 was eliminated in the 2015 amendments to the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act, and is no longer applicable.
§ 356.2
Penalties under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986.
(a) For claims or statements made on or before October 23, 1996, the maximum penalty which may be assessed under part 355 of this chapter is $5,000.
(b) For claims or statements made after October 23, 1996, but before August 1, 2016, the maximum penalty which may be assessed under part 355 of this chapter is $5,500.
(c) For claims or statements made on or after August 1, 2016, but before January 1, 2017, the maximum penalty which may be assessed under part 355 of this chapter is $10,781.
(d) For claims or statements made on or after January 1, 2017, the maximum penalty which may be assessed under part 355 of this chapter is the larger of:
(1) The amount for the previous calendar year; or
(2) An amount adjusted for inflation, calculated by multiplying the amount for the previous calendar year by the percentage by which the CPI-U for the month of October preceding the current calendar year exceeds the CPI-U for the month of October of the calendar year two years prior to the current calendar year, adding that amount to the amount for the previous calendar year, and rounding the total to the nearest dollar.
(e) Notice of the maximum penalty which may be assessed under part 355 of this chapter for calendar years after 2016 will be published by the Board in the
Federal Register
on an annual basis on or before January 15 of each calendar year.
§ 356.3
False claims.
(a) For claims or statements made on or before October 23, 1996, the minimum penalty which may be assessed under 31 U.S.C. 3729 is $5,000 and the maximum penalty is $10,000.
(b) For claims or statements made after October 23, 1996, but before August 1, 2016, the minimum penalty which may be assessed under 31 U.S.C. 3729 is $5,500 and the maximum penalty is $11,000.
(c) For claims or statements made on or after August 1, 2016, but before January 1, 2017, the minimum penalty which may be assessed under 31 U.S.C. 3729 is $10,781 and the maximum penalty is $21,563.
(d) For claims or statements made on or after January 1, 2017, the minimum and maximum penalty amounts which may be assessed under 31 U.S.C. 3729 is the larger of:
(1) The amount for the previous calendar year; or
(2) An amount adjusted for inflation, calculated by multiplying the amount for the previous calendar year by the percentage by which the CPI-U for the month of October preceding the current calendar year exceeds the CPI-U for the month of October of the calendar year two years prior to the current calendar year, adding that amount to the amount for the previous calendar year, and rounding the total to the nearest dollar.
(e) Notice of the minimum and maximum penalty which may be assessed under 31 U.S.C. 3729 for calendar years after 2016 will be published by the Board in the

§ 361.1
Purpose.
These regulations, which implement 5 U.S.C. 5514, provide the standards and procedures which the Board will utilize to collect debts owed to the United States from the current pay accounts of its employees, including the current pay accounts of employees who owe debts to agencies other than the Board.
§ 361.2
Scope.
(a)
Coverage.
This part applies to agencies and employees as defined by § 361.3 of this part.
(b)
Applicability.
This part and 5 U.S.C. 5514 apply in recovering certain debts by administrative offset, except where the employee consents to the recovery, from the current pay account of an employee. Because it is an administrative offset, debt collection procedures for salary offset which are not specified in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and these regulations shall be consistent with the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS).
(1)
Excluded debts or claims.
The procedures contained in this part do not apply to debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended (26 U.S.C. 1,
et seq.
), the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301,
et seq.
), or the tariff laws of the United States; or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (
e.g.,
travel advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 4108).
(2)
Waiver requests and claims to the U.S. General Accounting Office.
This part does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of recovery of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or any other similar provision of law, or from questioning the amount of validity of a debt by submitting a subsequent claim to the U.S. General Accounting Office.
(3)
Compromise, suspension, or termination under the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR 101.1, et seq.).
Nothing in this part precludes the compromise, suspension or termination of collection actions where appropriate under the standards implementing 31 U.S.C. 3711,
et seq.
(4 CFR 101.1,
et seq.
).
§ 361.3
Definitions.

(f) If not previously provided, notification of the opportunity (under terms agreeable to the Board) to establish a schedule for the voluntary repayment of the debt or to enter into a written agreement to establish a schedule for
repayment of the debt in lieu of offset. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the Board, and documented in the Board's files (4 CFR 102.2(e));
(g) Advice that the Board will accept a repayment agreement which is reasonable in view of the financial condition of the employee at that time;
(h) If there is a statutory provision for waiver, cancellation, remission or forgiveness of the debt to be collected, advice that waiver may be requested within the period and by the procedure specified and explaining the conditions under which waiver, cancellation, remission or forgiveness is granted;
(i) Advice as to the employee's right to a hearing conducted by an official arranged by the Board (an administrative law judge, or alternatively, a hearing official not under the control of the head of the agency) on the Board's determination of the debt, the amount of the debt, and the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted each pay period if a petition is filed as prescribed by the Board;
(j) Advice that the timely filing of a petition for hearing or a request for waiver (if the waiver statute or regulations are not “permissive” in nature) will stay the commencement of collection proceedings;
(k) Advice that a final decision on the hearing (if one is requested) will be issued at the earliest practical date, but not later than sixty days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;
(l) Advice as to the method and time period for requesting a hearing as provided for in § 361.5 and for requesting waiver, if it is available;
(m) Advice that any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the employee to:

(o) Advice that unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee. Such refunds will not bear interest unless required or permitted by law.
§ 361.6
Requests for waiver or hearing.
(a) A request for waiver or for a hearing must be made in writing and received by the Chief Financial Officer no later than thirty calendar days after the notice is sent to the employee. This time limit may, at the discretion of the Chief Financial Officer, be extended if the employee can show that the delay was caused by circumstances which were beyond the employee's control or because of the employee's failure to receive notice of the time limit. Any right to waiver or to a hearing is forfeited unless the time limits set forth in this paragraph are complied with.
(b) The employee's request for a hearing must be signed by the employee and fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence and witnesses, if any, which the employee believes support his or her position.
(c) A request for a hearing under this paragraph is not a request for waiver. A request for waiver must state the basis for the request for waiver and whether a hearing is requested. If no request for a hearing is contained in the waiver request, no hearing will be provided.
(d) A hearing, if requested, will be an informal proceeding conducted by an administrative law judge or hearing official not under the control of the Board. The employee, or his/her representative, and the Board will be
given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses and argument.
§ 361.7
Written decision following a hearing.
Within thirty days after the hearing, the administrative law judge or hearing official shall issue a written decision stating the facts evidencing the nature and origin of the alleged debt; the amount and validity of the alleged debt; and the judge or hearing official's analysis, findings and conclusions with respect to the employee's position on liability for the debt and with respect to his or her eligibility for waiver. The decision of the administrative law judge or hearing official shall be the final agency decision.
§ 361.8
Limitations on notice and hearing requirements.
(a) The procedural requirements of this part are not applicable to collections which result from:
(1) An employee's election of coverage or of a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program which requires periodic deductions from pay and which cannot be placed into effect immediately because of normal processing delays; and
(2) Ministerial adjustments in pay rates or allowances which cannot be placed into effect immediately because of normal processing delays.
(b)
Limited procedures.
If the period of the normal processing delay for which the retroactive deduction must be recovered does not exceed four pay periods, the procedures provided in §§ 361.4 and 361.5 of this part shall not apply, but the Board shall in advance of the collection issue a general notice that:
(1) Because of the employee's election, future salary will be reduced to cover the period between the effective date of the election and the first regular withholding, and the employee may dispute the amount of the retroactive collection by notifying a specified office or official; or
(2) Due to a normal ministerial adjustment in pay or allowances which could not be placed into effect immediately, future salary will be reduced to cover any excess pay or allowances received by the employee, the employee may dispute the amount of the retroactive collection by notifying a specified office or official.
(c)
Limitation on exceptions.
The exceptions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not include a recovery required to be made for any reason other than normal processing delays in putting the change into effect, even if the period of time for which the amounts must be retroactively withheld is less than four pay periods. Further, if normal processing delays exceed four pay periods, then the full procedures prescribed under §§ 361.4 and 361.5 of this part shall be extended to the employee.
§ 361.9
Exception to requirement that a hearing be offered.
When an employee is overpaid due to the hours worked reported on the payroll exceeding the actual hours worked, no pre-offset hearing must be granted since in such cases there is no question regarding credibility and veracity. In these cases the Board will make its determination under this part based upon review of the written record.
§ 361.10
Written agreement to repay debt as alternative to salary offset.
(a)
Notification by employee.
The employee may propose, in response to a Notice of Intent, a written agreement to repay the debt as an alternative to salary offset. Any employee who wishes to do this must submit a proposed written agreement to repay the debt which is received by the Board within thirty calendar days of the date of the Notice of Intent.
(b)
Board's response.
In response to timely notice by the debtor as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Board will notify the employee whether the employee's proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within the Board's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding by offset. In making this determination, the Board will balance the agency's interest in collecting the debt against hardship to the employee. If the debt is delinquent and the employee has not disputed its existence or amount, the Board will accept a repayment agreement instead of offset only if the employee is able to establish that offset would result in
undue financial hardship or would be against equity and good conscience.
§ 361.11
Procedures for salary offset: When deductions may begin.
(a) Deductions to liquidate an employee's debt will be by the method and in the amount stated in the Notice of Intent to collect from the employee's current pay.
(b) If the employee filed a petition for hearing with the Board before the expiration of the period provided for in § 361.5, then deductions will begin after the hearing officer has provided the employee with a hearing and the hearing officer's final written decision is in favor of the Board.
(c) If an employee retires, resigns or his or her period of employment ends before collection of a debt is completed, offset shall be made from subsequent payments of any nature (
e.g.,
final salary payment, lump sum leave, etc.) due the employee from the Board to the extent necessary to liquidate the debt. If the debt cannot be liquidated by offset from any final payment due the employee from the Board, the Board shall liquidate the debt by administrative offset, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, from later payments of any kind which are due the employee from the United States.
§ 361.12
Procedures for salary offset: Types of collection.
A debt will be collected in a lump sum or in installments. Collection will be effected in one lump sum collection unless the employee is financially unable to pay in one lump sum, or if the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay. In these cases, deduction will be by installments.
§ 361.13
Procedures for salary offset: Methods of collection.
(a)
General.
A debt will be collected by deductions at officially-established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account, unless the employee and the Board agree to alternative arrangements for repayment. The alternative arrangement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the Board.
(b)
Installment deductions.
Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, the installment payment will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years. Installment payments of less than $25 per pay period or $50 a month will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.
(c)
Sources of deductions.
The Board will make deductions only from basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay.
§ 361.14
Procedures for salary offset: Imposition of interest, penalties and administrative costs.
Interest will be charged in accordance with 4 CFR 102.13.
§ 361.15
Non-waiver of rights.
So long as there are no statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary, no employee involuntary payment (of all or a portion of a debt) collected under these regulations will be interpreted as a waiver of any rights that the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514.
§ 361.16
Refunds.
The Board will refund promptly to the appropriate individual amounts offset under these regulations when:
(a) A debt is waived or otherwise found not owing the United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or
(b) The Board is directed by an administrative or judicial order to refund amounts deducted from the employee's current pay.
§ 361.17
Coordination with other government agencies.
(a)
Board is paying agency.
(1) If the Board receives a claim which meets the requirements of 5 CFR 550.1108 from another agency, deductions shall begin
prospectively at the next officially established pay interval. The employee will receive written notice that the Board has received a certified debt claim from a creditor agency. The notice will contain the amount of the debt and the date deductions from salary will commence and the amount of such deductions.
(2) If the Board receives a claim which does not meet the requirements of 5 CFR 550.1108, then the Board will return the claim to the creditor agency and inform the creditor agency that before any action is taken to collect the debt from the employee's current pay account, the procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550 must be followed and a claim which meets the requirements of 5 CFR 550.1108 must be received.
(b)
Board is creditor agency.
When the Board is owed a debt by an employee of another agency, the other agency shall not initiate the requested offset until the Board provides the agency with a written certification that the procedures under this part have been followed and the Board has provided the other agency with a claim which meets the requirement of 5 CFR 550.1108.

§ 362.1
Purposes.
(a) This part prescribes regulations under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act of 1964, as amended, for the settlement of a claim against the United States made by an officer or employee of the Railroad Retirement Board for damage to, or loss of, personal property incident to his service. In accordance with that Act, the possession of such property must be reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances.
(b) The Railroad Retirement Board is not an insurer of its officers' or employees' personal property and does not underwrite the damage or loss of such property that may be sustained by an officer or employee. Officers and employees of the Board are encouraged to carry private insurance to the maximum extent practicable to avoid large losses or losses which may not be recoverable from the Board. The procedures set forth in this section are designed to enable the claimant to obtain the maximum amount of otherwise unreimbursed or uninsured compensation for his loss or damage. Failure of the claimant to comply with these procedures may reduce or preclude payment of his claim under this part.
§ 362.2
Definitions.

(d)
Board
means the Railroad Retirement Board.
(e)
Employee

(f)
Settle

A claim may be filed by an employee, by his spouse in his name as authorized agent, or by any other authorized agent or legal representative of the employee. If the employee is dead, his (a) spouse, (b) child, (c) father or mother, or both, or (d) brother or sister, or both, may file the claim and be entitled to payment in that order of priority.
§ 362.4
Delegation of authority.
The Deputy General Counsel of the Board is authorized to settle any claim filed under this part.
(45 U.S.C. 231f(b)(5))
[45 FR 57709, Aug. 29, 1980, as amended at 48 FR 51448, Nov. 9, 1983]
§ 362.5
Time limits for filing a claim.
A claim under this part may be considered only if:
(a) The damage or loss occurred after August 31, 1964; and
(b) The claim is filed in writing within two years after the damage, loss or theft occurred or became known to the employee.
§ 362.6
Procedure for filing a claim.
(a) Railroad Retirement Board Form G-108, Employee Claim for Loss or Damage to Personal Property, is the prescribed form for filing claims pursuant to the regulations in this part and must be completed by the employee, the person acting on his behalf, or his survivor and forwarded directly to the General Counsel of the Board for processing. Railroad Retirement Board Form G-108 may be obtained from the Board's Bureau of Law.
(b) In addition to the information required to complete the form described § 362.6(a), the following information or data must be submitted with each claim:
(1) With respect to claims involving property which is stolen or lost, the purchase receipt, or if not available, statements from the employee estimating the value and what security measures or precautions were taken to protect the property;
(2) With respect to claims involving property which is damaged, an itemized repair estimate from an appropriate commercial source, or, if beyond repair, a statement from an appropriate commercial source or, if such a statement is not available, from the employee, indicating that the damaged property is beyond repair;
(3) With respect to claims involving property stated to be beyond repair in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a statement from the employee estimating the value and the purchase receipt, if available;
(4) With respect to claims considered under § 362.10(b)(3), a statement by the employee's supervisor verifying that the supervisor required the employee to provide, or that the supervisor consented to having the employee provide, such property and that the provision of such personal property was in the interest of the Board;
(5) With respect to a claim filed by an agent or survivor of an employee, a power of attorney or other satisfactory evidence of authority to file the claim.

[45 FR 57709, Aug. 29, 1980, as amended at 48 FR 51448, Nov. 9, 1983]
§ 362.8
Investigation of a claim.
The Deputy General Counsel or his designee may investigate the circumstances surrounding the theft, loss or damage of an employee's property.
In order to complete such investigation, the Deputy General Counsel or his designee may request the submission of information in addition to that described in § 362.7 of this part.

[45 FR 57709, Aug. 29, 1980, as amended at 48 FR 51448, Nov. 9, 1983]
§ 362.9
Fraudulent claims.
Claims are not payable for items fraudulently claimed. When investigation discloses that an employee, an agent of the employee, or a survivor of the employee has intentionally misrepresented an item claimed, as to cost, condition, cost of repair or other significant information, the claim as to that item will be disallowed in its entirety even though some actual loss or damage may have been sustained. However, if the remainder of the claim is proper it will be paid as to other items. This section does not preclude appropriate prosecution and disciplinary action if warranted.
§ 362.10
Principal types of claims allowable.
(a) In general, a claim may be allowed only for tangible personal property of a type and quantity that was, from the Board's perspective, reasonable, useful, or proper for the employee to possess under the circumstances at the time of the loss or damage. Any questions in this regard are to be resolved by the Deputy General Counsel.
(b) Claims that will ordinarily be allowed include, but are not limited to, cases in which the loss or damage occurred:
(1) In a common or natural disaster;
(2) When the property was subjected to extraordinary risks in the performance of duty or efforts to save human life or property of the United States Government;
(3) When the property was used for the benefit of the Board at the direction, or with the consent, of a supervisor.
(45 U.S.C. 231f(b)(5))

§ 362.11
Principal types of claims not allowable.
(a) Claims will be disallowed when:
(1) The personal property was lost, stolen or damaged prior to August 31, 1964;
(2) The loss or damage totals less than $5 or, to the extent of the excess, more than the maximum amount provided in section 241(b)(1) of title 31 of the U.S. Code;
(3) The loss or damage was caused, at least in part, by the negligence of the employee or his agent;
(4) The personal property was acquired, possessed or transported in violation of law or regulation;
(5) The personal property was brought into Board offices for temporary storage in anticipation of delivery to another person or removal to another location;
(6) The personal property lost or damaged was food-stuffs or furniture;
(b) Claims which will ordinarily not be allowed include, but are not limited to, claims for:
(1) Money or currency, except when lost in a common or natural disaster;
(2) Articles of extraordinary value;
(3) Articles being worn (unless allowable under § 362.10);
(4) Intangible property, such as bank books, checks, notes, stock certificates, money orders or travelers' checks;
(5) Property owned by the United States, unless the employee is financially responsible for it to another U.S. Government agency;
(6) Losses of insurers or subrogees and those losses recoverable from an insurer or carrier;
(7) Losses or damages sustained in quarters not assigned or otherwise provided in kind by the Board;
(8) Losses recoverable or recovered pursuant to contract;
(9) Loss or damage to any vehicle used for transportation or in transportation (unless allowable under § 362.10).
§ 362.12
Computation of amount of reimbursement.
(a) The amount awarded with regard to any item of personal property will not exceed its depreciated replacement cost at the time of loss. Unless proven to be otherwise, replacement cost will
be based on the price paid in cash for the property or, if not acquired by purchase or exchange, the value at the time of acquisition. The amount normally payable on property damaged beyond economical repair is found by determining its depreciated value immediately before it was damaged or lost, less any salvage value. If the cost of repair is less than the depreciated value of the property, then it is economically repairable, and the cost of repair is the amount payable.
(b) Depreciation in value of an item of personal property is determined by considering the type of article involved, its cost, condition when lost or damaged beyond economical repair, and the time elapsed between the date of acquisition and the date of accrual of the claim.
(c) Allowance for articles acquired by barter will not exceed the cost of the articles tendered in barter.
§ 362.13
Property recovered after payment of claim.
When previously lost or stolen property is recovered by the employee after allowance of a claim by the Board, the employee shall return the amount of reimbursement.
§ 362.14
Finality of settlement.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, settlement of a claim under the Act and this part is final and conclusive.
§ 362.15
Agent's or attorney's fee.
Under the terms of the Act, no more than 10 percent of the amount paid in settlement of a claim submitted and settled under this part may be paid or delivered to or received by any agent or attorney on account of services rendered in connection with that claim, any contract to the contrary notwithstanding.

§ 363.1
Authorization for garnishment of remuneration for employment paid by the Board.
(a) Remuneration for employment paid or payable by the Board is subject, in like manner and to the same extent as if the Board were a private person, to legal process brought for the enforcement of legal obligations to provide child support or to make alimony payments.
(b) Remuneration for employment includes compensation paid or payable for personal services, whether such compensation is denominated as wages, salary, commission, bonus, pay, or otherwise, and includes, but is not limited to, severance pay, sick pay, and incentive pay, but does not include awards for making suggestions.

§ 363.2
Definitions.
(a)
Child support
means periodic payments of funds for the support and maintenance of a child or children;

Legal process additionally includes assignments in lieu of garnishment, but only where grounds for the issuance of legal process in the nature of garnishment exist. Such assignments are revocable.

§§ 365.131-365.139
[Reserved]
§ 365.140
Employment.
No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities.
§§ 365.141-365.148
[Reserved]
§ 365.149
Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.
Except as otherwise provided in § 365.150, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.
§ 365.150
Program accessibility: Existing facilities.
(a)
General.
The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity when viewed in its entirety is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. Although all facilities in which the agency operates, except for the headquarters building, are either owned or leased by and under the general control of the General Services Administration (GSA), the agency recognizes its obligation to request the GSA to make space reassignments or any structural changes which the agency determines are necessary to ensure program accessibility. This paragraph does not—
(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps; or
(2) Require the agency to take or to recommend to the GSA any action that the agency can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or result in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 365.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Chief Executive Officer after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens that would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
(b)
Methods.
In general the agency will comply with this section by making home visits. The agency may also comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aids to beneficiaries, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs
or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make or request the GSA to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making or requesting space reassignments or alterations to existing buildings, shall ensure that accessibility requirements, to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it are met. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
(c)
Time period for compliance.
The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by February 27, 1989, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, the agency will make such changes or, where applicable, request the GSA to make such changes by December 27, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
(d)
Transition plan.
In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop or, where applicable, request the GSA to develop, by June 27, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—
(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;
(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;
(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and
(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.
§ 365.151
Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.
Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.
§§ 365.152-365.159
[Reserved]
§ 365.160
Communications.
(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.
(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.
(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.
(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.
(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.
(b) The agency shall take appropriate steps to provide individuals with handicaps with information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities and information regarding their section 504
rights under the agency's programs or activities.
(c) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 365.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Chief Executive Officer after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
§§ 365.161-365.169
[Reserved]
§ 365.170
Compliance procedures.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of handicap in programs or activities conducted by the agency;

(c) Except with respect to complaints arising under § 365.170(b), responsibility for implementation and operation of this section shall be vested in the Chief Executive Officer.
(d) The Chief Executive Officer shall accept and investigate all complete complaints for which he or she has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed within 90 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The Chief Executive Officer may extend this time period for good cause.
(e) If the Chief Executive Officer receives a complaint over which the agency does not have jurisdiction, he or she shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate government entity.
(f) The Chief Executive Officer shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility used by the agency that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps.
(g) Within 120 days of the receipt of a complete complaint under § 365.170(d) for which the agency has jurisdiction, the Chief Executive Officer shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation in a letter containing—
(1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
(2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
(3) A notice of the right to appeal.
(h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or remedies must be filed by the complainant within 45 days of receipt from the Chief Executive Officer of the letter required by § 365.170(g). The Chief Executive Officer may extend this time for good cause.
(i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the Board.
(j) The Board shall notify the complainant of the results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request.

(k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
(l) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint investigations to other Federal agencies
except that the authority for making the final determination may not be delegated to another agency.

§ 367.1
Purpose and scope.
The regulations in this part establish procedures to implement the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365), as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-134), 31 U.S.C. 3716. The statute authorizes the Board to collect a claim arising under an agency program by means of administrative offset, and requires the Board to refer nontax debts over 180 days delinquent to the Department of Treasury for administrative offset (the “Treasury Offset Program”). No claim may be collected by such means if outstanding for more than 10 years after the Board's right to collection of the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials of the government
who were charged with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts. This part specifies the agency procedures that will be followed by the Board for referral and collection by administrative offset.
[62 FR 19220, Apr. 21, 1997]
§ 367.2
Past-due legally enforceable debt.
A past-due legally enforceable debt which may be referred to another governmental agency for administrative offset is a debt:
(a) Which arose under any statute administered by the Board or under any contract; and with respect to debts referred to the Department of Treasury, is a nontax debt;
(b) Which is an obligation of a debtor who is a natural person or a business;
(c) Which, except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent at least three months but not more than ten years at the time the offset is made;
(d) Which is at least $25.00;
(e) With respect to which the rights described in part 260 or 320 of this chapter or the applicable law regarding reconsideration, waiver, and appeal, if applicable, have been exhausted;
(f) With respect to which:
(1) The Board's records do not contain evidence that the debtor (or, if an individual, his or her spouse) has filed for bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code; or
(2) The Board can clearly establish at the time of the referral that the automatic stay under section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code has been lifted or is no longer in effect with respect to the debtor (or, if an individual, his or her spouse) and the debt was not discharged in the bankruptcy proceeding; or
(3) The Board's records do not contain evidence that foreclosure is pending on collateral securing the debt.
(g) Which cannot currently be collected pursuant to the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);
(h) Which cannot currently be collected by administrative offset under § 255.6 or § 340.6 of this chapter against amounts payable to the debtor under any statute administered by the Board;
(i) With respect to which the Board has notified, or has made a reasonable attempt to notify, the debtor that the debt is past due, and that unless the debtor repays the debt within 60 days, the debt will be referred to any other agency of the United States government for offset against any money owed the debtor by that agency; and
(j) With respect to which the Board has given the debtor at least 60 days from the date of the notification required in paragraph (i) of this section to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable, has considered evidence, if any, presented by the debtor, and has determined that the amount of such debt is past due and legally enforceable; and
(k) Which has not been referred to the Department of Justice or which is not otherwise in litigation with the Board.
[56 FR 46375, Sept. 12, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 66073, Dec. 21, 1995; 62 FR 19220, Apr. 21, 1997]
§ 367.3
Board responsibilities.
(a) The Board may delegate to an employee or employees the responsibility for collecting any claims owed the Board by means of administrative offset, except that all nontax debts over 120 days delinquent shall be referred to the Department of Treasury for administrative offset through the Treasury Offset Program as required by 31 U.S.C. 3716;
(b) Except for mandatory referral of claims to the Department of Treasury or as otherwise directed by the Secretary of Treasury, before collecting a claim by means of administrative offset, the Board must ensure that administrative offset is feasible, allowable, and appropriate, and must notify the debtor of the Board's policies for collecting a claim by means of administrative offset.
(c) Except for mandatory referral of claims to the Department of Treasury or as otherwise directed by the Secretary of Treasury, whether collection by administrative offset is feasible is a determination to be made on a case-by-case basis, in the exercise of its sound discretion. The Board shall consider not only whether administrative offset
can be accomplished, both practically and legally, but also whether offset is best suited to further and protect all of the Government's interests. In appropriate circumstances, the Board may give due consideration to the debtor's financial condition, and is not required to use offset in every instance in which there is an available source of funds. The Board may also consider whether offset would substantially interfere with or defeat the purposes of the program authorizing the payments against which offset is contemplated.
(d) Before advising the debtor that the delinquent debt will be subject to administrative offset, the agency official responsible for administering the program under which the debt arose shall review the claim and determine that the debt is valid and overdue.
(e) Administrative offset shall be considered by the Board only after attempting to collect a claim under the statutes administered by the Board except that no claim under this Act that has been outstanding for more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued may be collected by means of administrative offset, unless facts material to the right to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official of the agency who was charged with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts.
[56 FR 46375, Sept. 12, 1991, as amended at 62 FR 19220, Apr. 21, 1997; 81 FR 30173, May 16, 2016]
§ 367.4
Notification to another agency.
When the Board refers a debt under this part to another agency forcollection by means of administrative offset, the Board shall provide a written certification to the other agency stating that the debtor owes the debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of this part have been fully complied with.
§ 367.5
Notification to debtor.
The notification provided by the Board to the debtor will inform the debtor how he or she may present evidence to the Board that all or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable.
§ 367.6
Consideration of evidence.
Evidence submitted by the debtor will be considered only by officials or employees of the Board, and a determination that all or a portion of such debt is past-due and legally enforceable will be made only by such officials or employees.
§ 367.7
Change in notification to another government agency.
If, after submitting notification of liability for a debt to another agency, the Board:
(a) Determines that an error has been made with respect to the information contained in the notification;
(b) Receives a payment or credits a payment to the account of the debtor named in the notification that reduces the amount of the debt referred to the other agency for offset; or
(c) Receives notification that the debtor has filed for bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code or has been adjudicated bankrupt and the debt has been discharged; the Board will promptly notify the other agency. If the amount of a debt is reduced after referral by the Board and offset by the other agency, the Board will refund to the debtor any excess amount and will promptly notify the other agency of any refund made by the Board. If the amount of debt has increased after referral by the Board but prior to offset by the other agency, then the Board will promptly notify the other agency of such increase.
[56 FR 46375, Sept. 12, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 66073, Dec. 21, 1995]
§ 367.8
Administrative offset against amounts payable from Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.
(a) The Board may request that moneys which are due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund be administratively offset in reasonable amounts in order to collect debts owed to the Board by the debtor. Such requests shall be made to the appropriate officials of the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Director of that Office.
(b) When making a request for administrative offset under paragraph (a)
of this section, the Board shall include a written certification that:
(1) The debtor owes the United States a debt, including the amount of the debt;
(2) The Board has complied with all applicable statutes, regulations, and procedures of the Office of Personnel Management; and
(3) The Board has complied with the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards, the Railroad Retirement Act and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act including any required hearing or review.
(c) When the Board decides to request administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, it should make the request as soon as practical after completion of the applicable due process procedures in order that the Office of Personnel Management may identify and flag the debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor becomes eligible and requests to receive payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. At such time as the debtor makes a claim for payments from the Fund, if at least a year has elapsed since the offset request was originally made, the debtor will be permitted to offer a satisfactory repayment plan in lieu of offset upon establishing that changed financial circumstances would render the offset unjust.
(d) In accordance with procedures established by the Office of Personnel Management, the Board may request an offset from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund prior to completion of due process procedures.
(e) If the Board collects part or all of the debt by other means before deductions are made or completed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the Board shall act promptly to modify or terminate its request for offset under paragraph (a) of this section.
