(ii) The remaining amount of the commission, $y, is classified as exempt foreign trade income under section 923(a)(3) and is treated as income of FSC from sources outside the United States that is not effectively connected income. This amount is one to which the provisions of this section do not apply, since it is an amount other than interest from sources outside the United States and is not effectively connected income. Therefore, a deduction for $y is allowable to RS as of the day on which it accrues the otherwise deductible amount, without regard to section 267 (a)(2) and (a)(3) and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Exceptions and special rules
—(1)
Effectively connected income subject to United States tax.
The provisions of section 267(a)(2) and the regulations thereunder, and not the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, apply to an amount that is income of the related foreign person that is effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business of such related foreign person. An amount described in this paragraph (c)(1) thus is allowable as a deduction as of the day on which the amount is includible in the gross income of the related foreign person as effectively connected income under sections 872(a)(2) or 882(b) (or, if later, as of the day on which the deduction would be so allowable but for section 267(a)(2)). However, this paragraph (c)(1) does not apply if the related foreign person is exempt from United States income tax on the amount owed, or is subject to a reduced rate of tax, pursuant to a treaty obligation of the United States (such as under an article relating to the taxation of business profits).
(2)
Items exempt from tax by treaty.
Except with respect to interest, neither paragraph (b) of this section nor section 267 (a)(2) applies to any amount that is income of a related foreign person with respect to which the related foreign person is exempt from United States taxation on the amount owed pursuant to a treaty obligation of the United States (such as under an article relating to the taxation of business profits). Interest that is effectively connected income of the related foreign person under sections 872(a)(2) or 882(b) is an amount covered by paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Interest that is not effectively connected income of the related foreign person is an amount covered by paragraph (b) of this section, regardless of whether the related foreign person is exempt from United States taxation on the amount owed pursuant to a treaty obligation of the United States.
(3)
Items subject to reduced rate of tax by treaty.
Paragraph (b) of this section applies to amounts that are income of a related foreign person with respect to which the related foreign person claims a reduced rate of United States income tax on the amount owed pursuant to a treaty obligation of the United States (such as under an article relating to the taxation of royalties).
(4)
Certain amounts owed to certain controlled foreign corporations.
An amount that is income of a related foreign person is exempt from the application of section 267(a)(3)(B)(i) if the related foreign person is a controlled foreign corporation that does not have any United States shareholders (as defined in section 951(b)) that own (within the meaning of section 958(a)) stock of the controlled foreign corporation. However, in this case, the amount is subject to the application of section 267(a)(3)(A) in the same manner as if the related foreign person were a foreign corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation.
(d)
Effective date.
The rules of this section are effective with respect to interest that is allowable as a deduction under chapter 1 (without regard to the rules of this section) in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1983, but are not effective with respect to interest that is incurred with respect to indebtedness incurred on or before September 29, 1983, or incurred after that date pursuant to a contract that was binding on that date and at all times thereafter (unless the indebtedness or the contract was renegotiated, extended, renewed, or revised after that date). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d), the regulations in this section issued under section 267 apply to all other deductible amounts that are incurred after July 31, 1989, but do not apply to amounts that are incurred pursuant to a contract that was binding on September 29, 1983, and
at all times thereafter (unless the contract was renegotiated, extended, renewed, or revised after that date). Paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies to payments accrued on or after October 22, 2004. For payments accrued before October 22, 2004, see § 1.267(a)-3(c)(2), as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2004. Paragraph (c)(4) of this section applies to payments accrued on or after October 1, 2019. For payments accrued before October 1, 2019, a taxpayer may apply paragraph (c)(4) of this section for payments accrued during the last taxable year of a foreign corporation beginning before January 1, 2018, and each subsequent taxable year of the foreign corporation, provided that the taxpayer and United States persons that are related (within the meaning of section 267 or 707) to the taxpayer consistently apply such paragraph with respect to all foreign corporations. For payments accrued before October 22, 2004, see § 1.267(a)-3(c)(4), as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2004.
[T.D. 8465, 58 FR 237, Jan. 5, 1993, as amended by T.D 9908, 85 FR 59430, Sept. 22, 2020]
§ 1.267(b)-1
Relationships.
(a)
In general.
(1) The persons referred to in section 267(a) and § 1.267 (a)-1 are specified in section 267(b).
(2) Under section 267(b)(3), it is not necessary that either of the two corporations be a personal holding company or a foreign personal holding company for the taxable year in which the sale or exchange occurs or in which the expenses or interest are properly accruable, but either one of them must be such a company for the taxable year next preceding the taxable year in which the sale or exchange occurs or in which the expenses or interest are accrued.
(3) Under section 267(b)(9), the control of certain educational and charitable organizations exempt from tax under section 501 includes any kind of control, direct or indirect, by means of which a person in fact controls such an organization, whether or not the control is legally enforceable and regardless of the method by which the control is exercised or exercisable. In the case of an individual, control possessed by the individual's family, as defined in section 267(c)(4) and paragraph (a)(4) of § 1.267 (c)-1, shall be taken into account.
(b)
Partnerships.
(1) Since section 267 does not include members of a partnership and the partnership as related persons, transactions between partners and partnerships do not come within the scope of section 267. Such transactions are governed by section 707 for the purposes of which the partnership is considered to be an entity separate from the partners. See section 707 and § 1.707-1. Any transaction described in section 267(a) between a partnership and a person other than a partner shall be considered as occurring between the other person and the members of the partnership separately. Therefore, if the other person and a partner are within any one of the relationships specified in section 267(b), no deductions with respect to such transactions between the other person and the partnership shall be allowed:
(i) To the related partner to the extent of his distributive share of partnership deductions for losses or unpaid expenses or interest resulting from such transactions, and
(ii) To the other person to the extent the related partner acquires an interest in any property sold to or exchanged with the partnership by such other person at a loss, or to the extent of the related partner's distributive share of the unpaid expenses or interest payable to the partnership by the other person as a result of such transaction.
(2) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, an equal partner in the ABC partnership, personally owns all the stock of M Corporation. B and C are not related to A. The partnership and all the partners use an accrual method of accounting, and are on a calendar year. M Corporation uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and is also on a calendar year. During 1956 the partnership borrowed money from M Corporation and also sold property to M Corporation, sustaining a loss on the sale. On December 31, 1956, the partnership accrued its interest liability to the M Corporation and on April 1, 1957 (more than 2
1/2
months after the close of its taxable year), it paid the M Corporation the amount of such accrued interest. Applying the rules of this paragraph, the transactions are considered as occurring between M Corporation and the
partners separately. The sale and interest transactions considered as occurring between A and the M Corporation fall within the scope of section 267 (a) and (b), but the transactions considered as occurring between partners B and C and the M Corporation do not. The latter two partners may, therefore, deduct their distributive shares of partnership deductions for the loss and the accrued interest. However, no deduction shall be allowed to A for his distributive shares of these partnership deductions. Furthermore, A's adjusted basis for his partnership interest must be decreased by the amount of his distributive share of such deductions. See section 705(a)(2).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
of this subparagraph except that the partnership and all the partners use the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, and that M Corporation uses an accrual method. Assume further, that during 1956 M Corporation borrowed money from the partnership and that on a sale of property to the partnership during that year M Corporation sustained a loss. On December 31, 1956, the M Corporation accrued its interest liability on the borrowed money and on April 1, 1957 (more than 2
1/2
months after the close of its taxable year) it paid the accrued interest to the partnership. The corporation's deduction for the accrued interest is not allowed to the extent of A's distributive share (one-third) of such interest income. M Corporation's deduction for the loss on the sale of the property to the partnership is not allowed to the extent of A's one-third interest in the purchased property.
§ 1.267(c)-1
Constructive ownership of stock.
(a)
In general.
(1) The determination of stock ownership for purposes of section 267(b) shall be in accordance with the rules in section 267(c).
(2) For an individual to be considered under section 267(c)(2) as constructively owning the stock of a corporation which is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for members of his family it is not necessary that he own stock in the corporation either directly or indirectly. On the other hand, for an individual to be considered under section 267(c)(3) as owning the stock of a corporation owned either actually, or constructively under section 267(c)(1), by or for his partner, such individual must himself actually own, or constructively own under section 267(c)(1), stock of such corporation.
(3) An individual's constructive ownership, under section 267(c) (2) or (3), of stock owned directly or indirectly by or for a member of his family, or by or for his partner, is not to be considered as actual ownership of such stock, and the individual's constructive ownership of the stock is not to be attributed to another member of his family or to another partner. However, an individual's constructive ownership, under section 267(c)(1), of stock owned directly or indirectly by or for a corporation, partnership, estate, or trust shall be considered as actual ownership of the stock, and the individual's ownership may be attributed to a member of his family or to his partner.
(4) The family of an individual shall include only his brothers and sisters, spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants. In determining whether any of these relationships exist, full effect shall be given to a legal adoption. The term
ancestors
includes parents and grandparents, and the term
lineal descendants
includes children and grandchildren.
(b)
Examples.
The application of section 267(c) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On July 1, 1957, A owned 75 percent, and AW, his wife, owned 25 percent, of the outstanding stock of the M Corporation. The M Corporation in turn owned 80 percent of the outstanding stock of the O Corporation. Under section 267(c)(1), A and AW are each considered as owning an amount of the O Corporation stock actually owned by M Corporation in proportion to their respective ownership of M Corporation stock. Therefore, A constructively owns 60 percent (75 percent of 80 percent) of the O Corporation stock and AW constructively owns 20 percent (25 percent of 80 percent) of such stock. Under the family ownership rule of section 267(c)(2), an individual is considered as constructively owning the stock actually owned by his spouse. A and AW, therefore, are each considered as constructively owning the M Corporation stock actually owned by the other. For the purpose of applying this family ownership rule, A's and AW's constructive ownership of O Corporation stock is considered as actual ownership under section 267(c)(5). Thus, A constructively owns the 20 percent of the O Corporation stock constructively owned by AW, and AW constructively owns the 60 percent of the O Corporation stock constructively owned by A. In addition, the family ownership rule may be applied to make AWF, AW's father, the constructive owner of the 25 percent of the M Corporation stock actually owned by AW. As
noted above, AW's constructive ownership of 20 percent of the O Corporation stock is considered as actual ownership for purposes of applying the family ownership rule, and AWF is thereby considered the constructive owner of this stock also. However, AW's constructive ownership of the stock constructively and actually owned by A may not be considered as actual ownership for the purpose of again applying the family ownership rule to make AWF the constructive owner of these shares. The ownership of the stock in the M and O Corporations may be tabulated as follows:
Person
Stock ownership in M Corporation
Actual (Percent)
Constructive (Percent)
Total under Section 267 (Percent)
Stock ownsership in O Corporation

Constructive (Percent)

Assuming that the M Corporation and the O Corporation make their income tax returns for calendar years, and that there was no distribution in liquidation of the M or O Corporation, and further assuming that other corporation was a personal holding company under section 542 for the calendar year 1956, no deduction is allowable with respect to losses from sales or exchanges of property made on July 1, 1957, between the two corporations. Moreover, whether or not either corporation was a personal holding company, no loss would be allowable on a sale or exchange between A or AW and either corporation. A deduction would be allowed, however, for a loss sustained in an arm's length sale or exchange between A and AWF, and between AWF and the M or O Corporation.

# Example 2.
On June 15, 1957, all of the stock of the N Corporation was owned in equal proportions by A and his partner, AP. Except in the case of distributions in liquidation by the N Corporation, no deduction is allowable with respect to losses from sales or exchanges of property made on June 15, 1957, between A and the N Corporation or AP and the N Corporation since each partner is considered as owning the stock owned by the other; therefore, each is considered as owning more than 50 percent in value of the outstanding stock of the N Corporation.

# Example 3.
On June 7, 1957, A owned no stock in X Corporation, but his wife, AW, owned 20 percent in value of the outstanding stock of X, and A's partner, AP, owned 60 percent in value of the outstanding stock of X. The partnership firm of A and AP owned no stock in X Corporation. The ownership of AW's stock is attributed to A, but not that of AP since A does not own any X Corporation stock either actually, or constructively under section 267(c)(1). A's constructive ownership of AW's stock is not the ownership required for the attribution of AP's stock. Therefore, deductions for losses from sales or exchanges of property made on June 7, 1957, between X Corporation and A or AW are allowable since neither person owned more than 50 percent in value of the outstanding stock of X, but deductions for losses from sales or exchanges between X Corporation and AP would not be allowable by section 267(a) (except for distributions in liquidation of X Corporation).
§ 1.267(d)-1
Amount of gain where loss previously disallowed.
(a)
General rule.
(1) If a taxpayer acquires property by purchase or exchange from a transferor who, on the transaction, sustained a loss not allowable as a deduction by reason of section 267(a)(1) (or by reason of section 24(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), then any gain realized by the taxpayer on a sale or other disposition of the property after December 31, 1953, shall be recognized only to the extent that the gain exceeds the amount of such loss as is properly allocable to the property sold or otherwise disposed of by the taxpayer.
(2) The general rule is also applicable to a sale or other disposition of property by a taxpayer when the basis of such property in the taxpayer's hands is determined directly or indirectly by reference to other property acquired by the taxpayer from a transferor through
a sale or exchange in which a loss sustained by the transferor was not allowable. Therefore, section 267(d) applies to a sale or other disposition of property after a series of transactions if the basis of the property acquired in each transaction is determined by reference to the basis of the property transferred, and if the original property was acquired in a transaction in which a loss to a transferor was not allowable by reason of section 267(a)(1) (or by reason of section 24(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939).
(3) The benefit of the general rule is available only to the original transferee but does not apply to any original transferee (for example, a donee or a person acquiring property from a decedent where the basis of property is determined under section 1014 or 1022) who acquired the property in any manner other than by purchase or exchange.
(4) The application of the provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
H sells to his wife, W, for $500, certain corporate stock with an adjusted basis for determining loss to him of $800. The loss of $300 is not allowable to H by reason of section 267(a)(1) and paragraph (a) of § 1.267 (a)-1. W later sells this stock for $1,000. Although W's realized gain is $500 ($1,000 minus $500, her basis), her recognized gain under section 267(d) is only $200, the excess of the realized gain of $500 over the loss of $300 not allowable to H. In determining capital gain or loss W's holding period commences on the date of the sale from H to W.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that W later sells her stock for $300 instead of $1,000. Her recognized loss is $200 and not $500 since section 267(d) applies only to the nonrecognition of gain and does not affect basis.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that W transfers her stock as a gift to X. The basis of the stock in the hands of X for the purpose of determining gain, under the provisions of section 1015, is the same as W's, or $500. If X later sells the stock for $1,000 the entire $500 gain is taxed to him.

# Example 4.
H sells to his wife, W, for $5,500, farmland, with an adjusted basis for determining loss to him of $8,000. The loss of $2,500 is not allowable to H by reason of section 267(a)(1) and paragraph (a) of § 1.267 (a)-1. W exchanges the farmland, held for investment purposes, with S, an unrelated individual, for two city lots, also held for investment purposes. The basis of the city lots in the hands of W ($5,500) is a substituted basis determined under section 1031(d) by reference to the basis of the farmland. Later W sells the city lots for $10,000. Although W's realized gain is $4,500 (10,000 minus $5,500), her recognized gain under section 267(d) is only $2,000, the excess of the realized gain of $4,500 over the loss of $2,500 not allowable to H.
(b)
Determination of basis and gain with respect to divisible property
—(1)
Taxpayer's basis.
When the taxpayer acquires divisible property or property that consists of several items or classes of items by a purchase or exchange on which loss is not allowable to the transferor, the basis in the taxpayer's hands of a particular part, item, or class of such property shall be determined (if the taxpayer's basis for that part is not known) by allocating to the particular part, item, or class a portion of the taxpayer's basis for the entire property in the proportion that the fair market value of the particular part, item, or class bears to the fair market value of the entire property at the time of the taxpayer's acquisition of the property.
(2)
Taxpayer's recognized gain.
Gain realized by the taxpayer on sales or other dispositions after December 31, 1953, of a part, item, or class of the property shall be recognized only to the extent that such gain exceeds the amount of loss attributable to such part, item, or class of property not allowable to the taxpayer's transferor on the latter's sale or exchange of such property to the taxpayer.
(3)
Transferor's loss not allowable.
(i) The transferor's loss on the sale or exchange of a part, item, or class of the property to the taxpayer shall be the excess of the transferor's adjusted basis for determining loss on the part, item, or class of the property over the amount realized by the transferor on the sale or exchange of the part, item, or class. The amount realized by the transferor on the part, item, or class shall be determined (if such amount is not known) in the same manner that the taxpayer's basis for such part, item, or class is determined. See subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
(ii) If the transferor's basis for determining loss on the part, item, or class cannot be determined, the transferor's loss on the particular part, item, or class transferred to the taxpayer shall
be determined by allocating to the part, item, or class a portion of his loss on the entire property in the proportion that the fair market value of such part, item, or class bears to the fair market value of the entire property on the date of the taxpayer's acquisition of the entire property.
(4)
Examples.
The application of the provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
During 1953, H sold class A stock which had cost him $1,100, and common stock which had cost him $2,000, to his wife W for a lump sum of $1,500. Under section 24(b)(1)(A) of the 1939 Code, the loss of $1,600 on the transaction was not allowable to H. At the time the stocks were purchased by W, the fair market value of class A stock was $900 and the fair market value of common stock was $600. In 1954, W sold the class A stock for $2,500. W's recognized gain is determined as follows:
Amount realized by W on sale of class A stock
$2,500
Less: Basis allocated to class A stock—$900/$1,500 × $1,500
900
Realized gain on transaction
1,600
Less: Loss sustained by H on sale of class A stock to W not allowable as a deduction:
Basis to H of class A stock
$1,100
Amount realized by H on class A stock—$900/ $1,500 × $1,500
900
Unallowable loss to H on sale of class A stock
200
Recognized gain on sale of class A stock by W
1,400

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as those stated in
Example 1
of this subparagraph except that H originally purchased both classes of stock for a lump sum of $3,100. The unallowable loss to H on the sale of all the stock to W is $1,600 ($3,100 minus $1,500). An exact determination of the unallowable loss sustained by H on sale to W of class A stock cannot be made because H's basis for class A stock cannot be determined. Therefore, a determination of the unallowable loss is made by allocating to class A stock a portion of H's loss on the entire property transferred to W in the proportion that the fair market value of class A stock at the time acquired by W ($900) bears to the fair market value of both classes of stock at that time ($1,500). The allocated portion is $900/$1,500 × $1,600, or $960. W's recognized gain is, therefore, $640 (W's realized gain of $1,600 minus $960).
(c)
Special rules.
(1) Section 267(d) does not affect the basis of property for determining gain. Depreciation and other items which depend on such basis are also not affected.
(2) The provisions of section 267(d) shall not apply if the loss sustained by the transferor is not allowable to the transferor as a deduction by reason of section 1091, or section 118 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, which relate to losses from wash sales of stock or securities.
(3) In determining the holding period in the hands of the transferee of property received in an exchange with a transferor with respect to whom a loss on the exchange is not allowable by reason of section 267, section 1223(2) does not apply to include the period during which the property was held by the transferor. In determining such holding period, however, section 1223(1) may apply to include the period during which the transferee held the property which he exchanged where, for example, he exchanged a capital asset in a transaction which, as to him, was nontaxable under section 1031 and the property received in the exchange has the same basis as the property exchanged.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6237, Jan. 19, 2017]
§ 1.267(d)-2
Effective/applicability dates.
Pursuant to section 7851(a)(1)(C), the regulations prescribed in § 1.267(d)-1, to the extent that they relate to determination of gain resulting from the sale or other disposition of property after December 31, 1953, with respect to which property a loss was not allowable to the transferor by reason of section 267(a)(1) (or by reason of section 24(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), shall also apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1954, and ending after December 31, 1953, and taxable years beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending before August 17, 1954, which years are subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. The provisions of § 1.267(d)-1(a)(3) relating to section 1022 are effective on and after January 19, 2017.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6237, Jan. 19, 2017]
§ 1.267(f)-1
Controlled groups.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Purpose.
This section provides rules under section 267(f) to defer losses and deductions from certain transactions between members of a controlled group (intercompany sales). The purpose of this section is to prevent members of a controlled group from taking into account a loss or deduction solely as the result of a transfer of property between a selling member (S) and a buying member (B).
(2)
Application of consolidated return principles.
Under this section, S's loss or deduction from an intercompany sale is taken into account under the
timing
principles of § 1.1502-13 (intercompany transactions between members of a consolidated group), treating the intercompany sale as an intercompany transaction. For this purpose:
(i) The matching and acceleration rules of § 1.1502-13 (c) and (d), the definitions and operating rules of § 1.1502-13 (b) and (j), and the simplifying rules of § 1.1502-13(e)(1) apply with the adjustments in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to reflect that this section—
(A) Applies on a controlled group basis rather than consolidated group basis; and
(B) Generally affects only the
timing
of a loss or deduction, and not
it's attributes
(
e.g., its source
and
character
) or the holding period of property.
(ii) The special rules under § 1.1502-13(f) (stock of members) and (g) (obligations of members) apply under this section only to the extent the transaction is also an intercompany transaction to which § 1.1502-13 applies.
(iii) Any election under § 1.1502-13 to take items into account on a separate entity basis does not apply under this section. See § 1.1502-13(e)(3).
(3)
Other law.
The rules of this section apply in addition to other applicable law (including nonstatutory authorities). For example, to the extent a loss or deduction deferred under this section is from a transaction that is also an intercompany transaction under § 1.1502-13(b)(1), attributes of the loss or deduction are also subject to recharacterization under § 1.1502-13. See also, sections 269 (acquisitions to evade or avoid income tax) and 482 (allocations among commonly controlled taxpayers). Any loss or deduction taken into account under this section can be deferred, disallowed, or eliminated under other applicable law. See, for example, section 1091 (loss eliminated on wash sale).
(b)
Definitions and operating rules.
The definitions in § 1.1502-13(b) and the operating rules of § 1.1502-13(j) apply under this section with appropriate adjustments, including the following:
(1)
Intercompany sale.
An intercompany sale is a sale, exchange, or other transfer of property between members of a controlled group, if it would be an intercompany transaction under the principles of § 1.1502-13, determined by treating the references to a consolidated group as references to a controlled group and by disregarding whether any of the members join in filing consolidated returns.
(2)
S's losses or deductions.
Except to the extent the intercompany sale is also an intercompany transaction to which § 1.1502-13 applies, S's losses or deductions subject to this section are determined on a separate entity basis. For example, the principles of § 1.1502-13(b)(2)(iii) (treating certain amounts not yet recognized as items to be taken into account) do not apply. A loss or deduction is from an intercompany sale whether it is directly or indirectly from the intercompany sale.
(3)
Controlled group; member.
For purposes of this section, a controlled group is defined in section 267(f). Thus, a controlled group includes a FSC (as defined in section 922) and excluded members under section 1563(b)(2), but does not include a DISC (as defined in section 992). Corporations remain members of a controlled group as long as they remain in a controlled group relationship with each other. For example, corporations become nonmembers with respect to each other when they cease to be in a controlled group relationship with each other, rather than by having a separate return year (described in § 1.1502-13(j)(7)). Further, the principles of § 1.1502-13(j)(6) (former common parent treated as continuation of group) apply to any corporation if, immediately before it becomes a nonmember, it is both the selling member and the owner of property with respect to which a loss or deduction is deferred (whether or not it becomes a member
of a different controlled group filing consolidated or separate returns). Thus, for example, if S and B merge together in a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(A), the surviving corporation is treated as the successor to the other corporation, and the controlled group relationship is treated as continuing.
(4)
Consolidated taxable income.
References to consolidated taxable income (and consolidated tax liability) include references to the combined taxable income of the members (and their combined tax liability). For corporations filing separate returns, it ordinarily will not be necessary to actually combine their taxable incomes (and tax liabilities) because the taxable income (and tax liability) of one corporation does not affect the taxable income (or tax liability) of another corporation.
(c)
Matching and acceleration principles of § 1.1502-13
—(1)
Adjustments to the timing rules.
Under this section, S's losses and deductions are deferred until they are taken into account under the timing principles of the matching and acceleration rules of § 1.1502-13(c) and (d) with appropriate adjustments. For example, if S sells depreciable property to B at a loss, S's loss is deferred and taken into account under the principles of the matching rule of § 1.1502-13(c) to reflect the difference between B's depreciation taken into account with respect to the property and the depreciation that B would take into account if S and B were divisions of a single corporation; if S and B subsequently cease to be in a controlled group relationship with each other, S's remaining loss is taken into account under the principles of the acceleration rule of § 1.1502-13(d). For purposes of this section, the adjustments to § 1.1502-13 (c) and (d) include the following:
(i)
Application on controlled group basis.
The matching and acceleration rules apply on a controlled group basis, rather than a consolidated group basis. Thus if S and B are wholly-owned members of a consolidated group and 21% of the stock of S is sold to an unrelated person, S's loss continues to be deferred under this section because S and B continue to be members of a controlled group even though S is no longer a member of the consolidated group. Similarly, S's loss would continue to be deferred if S and B remain in a controlled group relationship after both corporations become nonmembers of their former consolidated group.
(ii)
Different taxable years.
If S and B have different taxable years, the taxable years that include a December 31 are treated as the same taxable years. If S or B has a short taxable year that does not include a December 31, the short year is treated as part of the succeeding taxable year that does include a December 31.
(iii)
Transfer to a section 267(b) or 707(b) related person.
To the extent S's loss or deduction from an intercompany sale of property is taken into account under this section as a result of B's transfer of the property to a nonmember that is a person related to any member, immediately after the transfer, under sections 267(b) or 707(b), or as a result of S or B becoming a nonmember that is related to any member under section 267(b), the loss or deduction is taken into account but allowed only to the extent of any income or gain taken into account as a result of the transfer. The balance not allowed is treated as a loss referred to in section 267(d) if it is from a sale or exchange by B (rather than from a distribution).
(iv)
B's item is excluded from gross income or noncapital and nondeductible.
To the extent S's loss would be redetermined to be a noncapital, nondeductible amount under the principles of § 1.1502-13, but is not redetermined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section (which generally renders the attribute redetermination rule inapplicable to sales between members of a controlled group), S's loss continues to be deferred. For purposes of this paragraph, stock held by S, stock held by B, stock held by all members of S's consolidated group, stock held by any member of a controlled group of which S is a member that was acquired from a member of S's consolidated group, and stock issued by T to a member of the controlled group must be taken into account in determining whether a loss would be redetermined to be a noncapital, nondeductible amount under the
principles of § 1.1502-13. If the loss remains deferred, it is taken into account when S and B (including their successors) are no longer in a controlled group relationship. (If, however, the property is transferred to certain related persons, paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section will cause the loss to be permanently disallowed.) For example, if S sells all of the T stock to B at a loss (in a transaction that is treated as a sale or exchange for Federal income tax purposes), and T subsequently liquidates in an unrelated transaction that qualifies under section 332, S's loss is deferred until S and B are no longer in a controlled group relationship. Similarly, if S owns all of the T stock and sells 30 percent of T's stock to B at a loss (in a transaction that is treated as a sale or exchange for Federal income tax purposes), and T subsequently liquidates, S's loss on the sale is deferred until S and B (including their successors) are no longer in a controlled group relationship.
(v)
Circularity of references.
References to deferral or elimination under the Internal Revenue Code or regulations do not include references to section 267(f) or this section. See, e.g., § 1.1502-13(a)(4) (applicability of other law).
(2)
Attributes generally not affected.
The matching and acceleration rules are not applied under this section to affect the attributes of S's intercompany item, or cause it to be taken into account before it is taken into account under S's separate entity method of accounting. However, the attributes of S's intercompany item may be redetermined, or an item may be taken into account earlier than under S's separate entity method of accounting, to the extent the transaction is also an intercompany transaction to which § 1.1502-13 applies. Similarly, except to the extent the transaction is also an intercompany transaction to which § 1.1502-13 applies, the matching and acceleration rules do not apply to affect the timing or attributes of B's corresponding items.
(d)
Intercompany sales of inventory involving foreign persons
—(1)
General rule.
Section 267(a)(1) and this section do not apply to an intercompany sale of property that is inventory (within the meaning of section 1221(1)) in the hands of both S and B, if—
(i) The intercompany sale is in the ordinary course of S's trade or business;
(ii) S or B is a foreign corporation; and
(iii) Any income or loss realized on the intercompany sale by S or B is not income or loss that is recognized as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States within the meaning of section 864 (unless the income is exempt from taxation pursuant to a treaty obligation of the United States).
(2)
Intercompany sales involving related partnerships.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a partnership and a foreign corporation described in section 267(b)(10) are treated as members, provided that the income or loss of the foreign corporation is described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.
(3)
Intercompany sales in ordinary course.
For purposes of this paragraph (d), whether an intercompany sale is in the ordinary course of business is determined under all the facts and circumstances.
(e)
Treatment of a creditor with respect to a loan in nonfunctional currency.
Sections 267(a)(1) and this section do not apply to an exchange loss realized with respect to a loan of nonfunctional currency if—
(1) The loss is realized by a member with respect to nonfunctional currency loaned to another member;
(2) The loan is described in § 1.988-1(a)(2)(i);
(3) The loan is not in a hyperinflationary currency as defined in § 1.988-1(f); and
(4) The transaction does not have as a significant purpose the avoidance of Federal income tax.
(f)
Receivables.
If S acquires a receivable from the sale of goods or services to a nonmember at a gain, and S sells the receivable at fair market value to B, any loss or deduction of S from its sale to B is not deferred under this section to the extent it does not exceed S's income or gain from the sale to the nonmember that has been taken into account at the time the receivable is sold to B.
(g)
Earnings and profits.
A loss or deduction deferred under this section is not reflected in S's earnings and profits before it is taken into account under this section. See, e.g., §§ 1.312-6(a), 1.312-7, and 1.1502-33(c)(2).
(h)
Anti-avoidance rule.
If a transaction is engaged in or structured with a principal purpose to avoid the purposes of this section (including, for example, by avoiding treatment as an intercompany sale or by distorting the timing of losses or deductions), adjustments must be made to carry out the purposes of this section.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Examples.
For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (j), unless otherwise stated, corporation P owns 75% of the only class of stock of subsidiaries S and B, X is a person unrelated to any member of the P controlled group, the taxable year of all persons is the calendar year, all persons use the accrual method of accounting, tax liabilities are disregarded, the facts set forth the only activity, and no member has a special status. If a member acts as both a selling member and a buying member (e.g., with respect to different aspects of a single transaction, or with respect to related transactions), the member is referred as to M (rather than as S or B). This section is illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1. Matching and acceleration rules.
(a)
Facts.
S holds land for investment with a basis of $130. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100. On a separate entity basis, S's loss is long-term capital loss. B holds the land for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. On July 1 of Year 3, B sells the land to X for $110.
(b)
Matching rule.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S's sale of land to B is an intercompany sale. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, S's $30 loss is taken into account under the timing principles of the matching rule of § 1.1502-13(c) to reflect the difference for the year between B's corresponding items taken into account and the recomputed corresponding items. If S and B were divisions of a single corporation and the intercompany sale were a transfer between the divisions, B would succeed to S's $130 basis in the land and would have a $20 loss from the sale to X in Year 3. Consequently, S takes no loss into account in Years 1 and 2, and takes the entire $30 loss into account in Year 3 to reflect the $30 difference in that year between the $10 gain B takes into account and its $20 recomputed loss. The attributes of S's intercompany items and B's corresponding items are determined on a separate entity basis. Thus, S's $30 loss is long-term capital loss and B's $10 gain is ordinary income.
(c)
Acceleration resulting from sale of B stock.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 1,
except that on July 1 of Year 3 P sells all of its B stock to X (rather than B's selling the land to X). Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, S's $30 loss is taken into account under the timing principles of the acceleration rule of § 1.1502-13(d) immediately before the effect of treating S and B as divisions of a single corporation cannot be produced. Because the effect cannot be produced once B becomes a nonmember, S takes its $30 loss into account in Year 3 immediately before B becomes a nonmember. S's loss is long-term capital loss.
(d)
Subgroup principles applicable to sale of S and B stock.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 1,
except that on July 1 of Year 3 P sells all of its S and B stock to X (rather than B's selling the land to X). Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, S and B are considered to remain members of a controlled group as long as they remain in a controlled group relationship with each other (whether or not in the original controlled group). P's sale of their stock does not affect the controlled group relationship of S and B with each other. Thus, S's loss is not taken into account as a result of P's sale of the stock. Instead, S's loss is taken into account based on subsequent events (e.g., B's sale of the land to a nonmember).

# Example 2. Distribution of loss property.
(a)
Facts.
S holds land with a basis of $130 and value of $100. On January 1 of Year 1, S distributes the land to P in a transaction to which section 311 applies. On July 1 of Year 3, P sells the land to X for $110.
(b)
No loss taken into account.
Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, because P and S are not members of a consolidated group, § 1.1502-13(f)(2)(iii) does not apply to cause S to recognize a $30 loss under the principles of section 311(b). Thus, S has no loss to be taken into account under this section. (If P and S were members of a consolidated group, § 1.1502-13(f)(2)(iii) would apply to S's loss in addition to the rules of this section, and the loss would be taken into account in Year 3 as a result of P's sale to X.)

# Example 3. Loss not yet taken into account under separate entity accounting method.
(a)
Facts.
S holds land with a basis of $130. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B at a $30 loss but does not take into account the loss under its separate entity method of accounting until Year 4. On July 1 of Year 3, B sells the land to X for $110.
(b)
Timing.
Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, S's loss is determined on a separate entity basis. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, S's loss is not taken into account
before it is taken into account under S's separate entity method of accounting. Thus, although B takes its corresponding gain into account in Year 3, S has no loss to take into account until Year 4. Once S's loss is taken into account in Year 4, it is not deferred under this section because B's corresponding gain has already been taken into account. (If S and B were members of a consolidated group, S would be treated under § 1.1502-13(b)(2)(iii) as taking the loss into account in Year 3.)

# Example 4. Consolidated groups.
(a)
Facts.
P owns all of the stock of S and B, and the P group is a consolidated group. S holds land for investment with a basis of $130. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100. B holds the land for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. On July 1 of Year 3, P sells 25% of B's stock to X. As a result of P's sale, B becomes a nonmember of the P consolidated group but S and B remain in a controlled group relationship with each other for purposes of section 267(f). Assume that if S and B were divisions of a single corporation, the items of S and B from the land would be ordinary by reason of B's activities.
(b)
Timing and attributes.
Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, S's sale to B is subject to both § 1.1502-13 and this section. Under § 1.1502-13, S's loss is redetermined to be an ordinary loss by reason of B's activities. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, because S and B remain in a controlled group relationship with each other, the loss is not taken into account under the acceleration rule of § 1.1502-13(d) as modified by paragraph (c) of this section. See § 1.1502-13(a)(4). Nevertheless, S's loss is redetermined by § 1.1502-13 to be an ordinary loss, and the character of the loss is not further redetermined under this section. Thus, the loss continues to be deferred under this section, and will be taken into account as ordinary loss based on subsequent events (e.g., B's sale of the land to a nonmember).
(c)
Resale to controlled group member.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this
Example 4,
except that P owns 75% of X's stock, and B resells the land to X (rather than P's selling any B stock). The results for S's loss are the same as in paragraph (b) of this
Example 4.
Under paragraph (b) of this section, X is also in a controlled group relationship, and B's sale to X is a second intercompany sale. Thus, S's loss continues to be deferred and is taken into account under this section as ordinary loss based on subsequent events (e.g., X's sale of the land to a nonmember).

# Example 5. Intercompany sale followed by installment sale.
(a)
Facts.
S holds land for investment with a basis of $130x. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100x. B holds the land for investment. On July 1 of Year 3, B sells the land to X in exchange for X's $110x note. The note bears a market rate of interest in excess of the applicable Federal rate, and provides for principal payments of $55x in Year 4 and $55x in Year 5. Section 453A applies to X's note.
(b)
Timing and attributes.
Under paragraph (c) of this section, S's $30x loss is taken into account under the timing principles of the matching rule of § 1.1502-13(c) to reflect the difference in each year between B's gain taken into account and its recomputed loss. Under section 453, B takes into account $5x of gain in Year 4 and in Year 5. Therefore, S takes $20x of its loss into account in Year 3 to reflect the $20x difference in that year between B's $0 loss taken into account and its $20x recomputed loss. In addition, S takes $5x of its loss into account in Year 4 and in Year 5 to reflect the $5x difference in each year between B's $5x gain taken into account and its $0 recomputed gain. Although S takes into account a loss and B takes into account a gain, the attributes of B's $10x gain are determined on a separate entity basis, and therefore the interest charge under section 453A(c) applies to B's $10x gain on the installment sale beginning in Year 3.

# Example 6. Section 721 transfer to a related nonmember.
(a)
Facts.
S owns land with a basis of $130. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100. On July 1 of Year 3, B transfers the land to a partnership in exchange for a 40% interest in capital and profits in a transaction to which section 721 applies. P also owns a 25% interest in the capital and profits of the partnership.
(b)
Timing.
Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, because the partnership is a nonmember that is a related person under sections 267(b) and 707(b), S's $30 loss is taken into account in Year 3, but only to the extent of any income or gain taken into account as a result of the transfer. Under section 721, no gain or loss is taken into account as a result of the transfer to the partnership, and thus none of S's loss is taken into account. Any subsequent gain recognized by the partnership with respect to the property is limited under section 267(d). (The results would be the same if the P group were a consolidated group, and S's sale to B were also subject to § 1.1502-13.)

# Example 7. Receivables.
(a)
Controlled group.
S owns goods with a $60 basis. In Year 1, S sells the goods to X for X's $100 note. The note bears a market rate of interest in excess of the applicable Federal rate, and provides for payment of principal in Year 5. S takes into account $40 of income in Year 1 under its method of accounting. In Year 2, the fair market value of X's note falls to $90 due to an increase in prevailing market interest rates, and S sells the note to B for its $90 fair market value.
(b)
Loss not deferred.
Under paragraph (f) of this section, S takes its $10 loss into account in Year 2. (If the sale were not at fair market value, paragraph (f) of this section would not
apply and none of S's $10 loss would be taken into account in Year 2.)
(c)
Consolidated group.
Assume instead that P owns all of the stock of S and B, and the P group is a consolidated group. In Year 1, S sells to X goods having a basis of $90 for X's $100 note (bearing a market rate of interest in excess of the applicable Federal rate, and providing for payment of principal in Year 5), and S takes into account $10 of income in Year 1. In Year 2, S sells the receivable to B for its $85 fair market value. In Year 3, P sells 25% of B's stock to X. Although paragraph (f) of this section provides that $10 of S's loss (i.e., the extent to which S's $15 loss does not exceed its $10 of income) is not deferred under this section, S's entire $15 loss is subject to § 1.1502-13 and none of the loss is taken into account in Year 2 under the matching rule of § 1.1502-13(c). See paragraph (a)(3) of this section (continued deferral under § 1.1502-13). P's sale of B stock results in B becoming a nonmember of the P consolidated group in Year 3. Thus, S's $15 loss is taken into account in Year 3 under the acceleration rule of § 1.1502-13(d). Nevertheless, B remains in a controlled group relationship with S and paragraph (f) of this section permits only $10 of S's loss to be taken into account in Year 3. See § 1.1502-13(a)(4) (continued deferral under section 267). The remaining $5 of S's loss continues to be deferred under this section and taken into account under this section based on subsequent events (e.g., B's collection of the note or P's sale of the remaining B stock to a nonmember).

# Example 8. Selling member ceases to be a member.
(a)
Facts.
P owns all of the stock of S and B, and the P group is a consolidated group. S has several historic assets, including land with a basis of $130 and value of $100. The land is not essential to the operation of S's business. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100. On July 1 of Year 3, P transfers all of S's stock to newly formed X in exchange for a 20% interest in X stock as part of a transaction to which section 351 applies. Although X holds many other assets, a principal purpose for P's transfer is to accelerate taking S's $30 loss into account. P has no plan or intention to dispose of the X stock.
(b)
Timing.
Under paragraph (c) of this section, S's $30 loss ordinarily is taken into account immediately before P's transfer of the S stock, under the timing principles of the acceleration rule of § 1.1502-13(d). Although taking S's loss into account results in a $30 negative stock basis adjustment under § 1.1502-32, because P has no plan or intention to dispose of its X stock, the negative adjustment will not immediately affect taxable income. P's transfer accelerates a loss that otherwise would be deferred, and an adjustment under paragraph (h) of this section is required. Thus, S's loss is never taken into account, and S's stock basis and earnings and profits are reduced by $30 under §§ 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33 immediately before P's transfer of the S stock.
(c) Nonhistoric assets. Assume instead that, with a principal purpose to accelerate taking into account any further loss that may accrue in the value of the land without disposing of the land outside of the controlled group, P forms M with a $100 contribution on January 1 of Year 1 and S sells the land to M for $100. On December 1 of Year 1, when the value of the land has decreased to $90, M sells the land to B for $90. On July 1 of Year 3, while B still owns the land, P sells all of M's stock to X and M becomes a nonmember. Under paragraph (c) of this section, M's $10 loss ordinarily is taken into account under the timing principles of the acceleration rule of § 1.1502-13(d) immediately before M becomes a nonmember. (S's $30 loss is not taken into account under the timing principles of § 1.1502-13(c) or § 1.1502-13(d) as a result of M becoming a nonmember, but is taken into account based on subsequent events such as B's sale of the land to a nonmember or P's sale of the stock of S or B to a nonmember.) The land is not an historic asset of M and, although taking M's loss into account reduces P's basis in the M stock under § 1.1502-32, the negative adjustment only eliminates the $10 duplicate stock loss. Under paragraph (h) of this section, M's loss is never taken into account. M's stock basis, and the earnings and profits of M and P, are reduced by $10 under §§ 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33 immediately before P's sale of the M stock.

# Example 9. Sale of stock by consolidated group member to controlled group member.
(a)
Facts.
P1, a domestic corporation, owns 75% of the outstanding stock of P, the common parent of a consolidated group. P owns all of the outstanding stock of subsidiaries M and S, which are members of P's consolidated group. M and S each own 50% of the only class of stock of L, a nonmember life insurance company. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells 25% of L's stock to P1 for $50 cash. At the time of the sale, S's aggregate basis in the L shares transferred to P1 was $80, and S recognizes a $30 loss. On February 18 of Year 3, at a time when the L shares held by P1 are worth $60, L liquidates. As a result of the liquidation, P1 recognizes a $10 gain.
(b)
Timing.
Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, S's loss on the sale of the L stock to P1 is deferred. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, upon the liquidation of L, to the extent S's loss would be redetermined to be a noncapital, nondeductible amount under the principles of § 1.1502-13, S's loss continues to be deferred. Under the principles of § 1.1502-13, S's loss is not redetermined to be a noncapital, nondeductible amount to the extent of P1's $10 of gain recognized. Accordingly, S takes into account $10 of loss as a result of the liquidation. In determining
whether the remainder of S's $20 loss would be redetermined to be a noncapital, nondeductible amount, under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, stock held by P1, stock held by M, and stock held by S is taken into account. Accordingly, under the principles of § 1.1502-13, the liquidation of L would be treated as a liquidation qualifying under section 332, and the remainder of S's loss would be redetermined to be a noncapital, nondeductible amount. Thus, under paragraph (c)(1)(iv), S's remaining $20 loss continues to be deferred until S and P1 are no longer in a controlled group relationship.

# Example 10. Issuance of stock to controlled group member.
(a)
Facts.
FP is a foreign corporation that owns all the stock of FS, a foreign corporation, and all the stock of P, a domestic corporation. P owns all of the single class of outstanding common stock of T. In Year 1, FS contributes cash to T in exchange for newly issued stock of T that constitutes 40 percent of T's outstanding stock. In Year 2, when the value of the T stock owned by P is less than its basis in P's hands, P sells all of its T stock to FP. In Year 3, in a transaction unrelated to the issuance of the T stock in Year 1, T converts under state law to a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes.
(b)
Timing.
Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, P's loss on the sale of its T stock is deferred. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, upon the conversion of T, to the extent P's loss would be redetermined to be a noncapital, nondeductible amount under the principles of § 1.1502-13, P's loss continues to be deferred. In determining whether the loss would be redetermined to be a noncapital, nondeductible amount, stock held by FS (which was acquired from T) and stock held by FP (the buyer of the T stock from P and a member of P's controlled group) is taken into account. Accordingly, under the principles of § 1.1502-13 the deemed liquidation of T resulting from the conversion of T would be treated as a liquidation qualifying under section 332, and P's loss would be redetermined to be a noncapital, nondeductible amount. Thus, under paragraph (c)(1)(iv), P's loss continues to be deferred until P and FP are no longer in a controlled group relationship.

For additional rules applicable to the disposition, deconsolidation, or transfer of the stock of members of consolidated groups, see §§ 1.337(d)-2, 1.1502-13(f)(6), 1.1502-35, and 1.1502-36.
(l)
Effective dates
—(1)
In general.
This section applies with respect to transactions occurring in S's years beginning on or after July 12, 1995. If both this section and prior law apply to a transaction, or neither applies, with the result that items are duplicated, omitted, or eliminated in determining taxable income (or tax liability), or items are treated inconsistently, prior law (and not this section) applies to the transaction.
(2)
Avoidance transactions.
This paragraph (l)(2) applies if a transaction is engaged in or structured on or after April 8, 1994, with a principal purpose to avoid the rules of this section (and instead to apply prior law). If this paragraph (l)(2) applies, appropriate adjustments must be made in years beginning on or after July 12, 1995, to prevent the avoidance, duplication, omission, or elimination of any item (or tax liability), or any other inconsistency with the rules of this section.
(3)
Effective/applicability date.
Paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section applies to a loss that continues to be deferred pursuant to that paragraph if the event that would cause the loss to be redetermined as a noncapital nondeductible amount under the principles of § 1.1502-13 occurs on or after April 16, 2012.
(4)
Prior law.
For transactions occurring in S's years beginning before July 12, 1995 see the applicable regulations issued under sections 267 and 1502. See, e.g., §§ 1.267(f)-1, 1.267(f)-1T, 1.267(f)-2T, 1.267(f)-3, 1.1502-13, 1.1502-13T, 1.1502-14, 1.1502-14T, and 1.1502-31 (as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1995).

§ 1.268-1
Items attributable to an unharvested crop sold with the land.
In computing taxable income no deduction shall be allowed in respect of items attributable to the production of an unharvested crop which is sold, exchanged, or involuntarily converted with the land and which is considered as property used in the trade or business under section 1231(b)(4). Such items shall be so treated whether or not the taxable year involved is that of the sale, exchange, or conversion of
such crop and whether they are for expenses, depreciation, or otherwise. If the taxable year involved is not that of the sale, exchange, or conversion of such crop, a recomputation of the tax liability for such year shall be made; such recomputation should be in the form of an “amended return” if necessary. For the adjustments to basis as a result of such disallowance, see section 1016(a)(11) and the regulations thereunder.
§ 1.269-1
Meaning and use of terms.
As used in section 269 and §§ 1.269-2 through 1.269-7:
(a)
Allowance.
The term
allowance
refers to anything in the internal revenue laws which has the effect of diminishing tax liability. The term includes, among other things, a deduction, a credit, an adjustment, an exemption, or an exclusion.
(b)
Evasion or avoidance.
The phrase
evasion or avoidance
is not limited to cases involving criminal penalties, or civil penalties for fraud.
(c)
Control.
The term
control
means the ownership of stock possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or at least 50 percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of the corporation. For control to be “acquired on or after October 8, 1940”, it is not necessary that all of such stock be acquired on or after October 8, 1940. Thus, if A, on October 7, 1940, and at all times thereafter, owns 40 percent of the stock of X Corporation and acquires on October 8, 1940, an additional 10 percent of such stock, an acquisition within the meaning of such phrase is made by A on October 8, 1940. Similarly, if B, on October 7, 1940, owns certain assets and transfers on October 8, 1940, such assets to a newly organized Y Corporation in exchange for all the stock of Y Corporation, an acquisition within the meaning of such phrase is made by B on October 8, 1940. If, under the facts stated in the preceding sentence, B is a corporation, all of whose stock is owned by Z Corporation, then an acquisition within the meaning of such phrase is also made by Z Corporation on October 8, 1940, as well as by the shareholders of Z Corporation taken as a group on such date, and by any of such shareholders if such shareholders as a group own 50 percent of the stock of Z on such date.
(d)
Person.
The term
person
includes an individual, a trust, an estate, a partnership, an association, a company or a corporation.
[T.D. 6595, 27 FR 3596, Apr. 14, 1962, as amended by T.D. 8388, 57 FR 345, Jan. 6, 1992]
§ 1.269-2
Purpose and scope of section 269.
(a)
General.
Section 269 is designed to prevent in the instances specified therein the use of the sections of the Internal Revenue Code providing deductions, credits, or allowances in evading or avoiding Federal income tax. See § 1.269-3.
(b)
Disallowance of deduction, credit, or other allowance.
Under the Code, an amount otherwise constituting a deduction, credit, or other allowance becomes unavailable as such under certain circumstances. Characteristic of such circumstances are those in which the effect of the deduction, credit, or other allowance would be to distort the liability of the particular taxpayer when the essential nature of the transaction or situation is examined in the light of the basic purpose or plan which the deduction, credit, or other allowance was designed by the Congress to effectuate. The distortion may be evidenced, for example, by the fact that the transaction was not undertaken for reasons germane to the conduct of the business of the taxpayer, by the unreal nature of the transaction such as its sham character, or by the unreal or unreasonable relation which the deduction, credit, or other allowance bears to the transaction. The principle of law making an amount unavailable as a deduction, credit, or other allowance in cases in which the effect of making an amount so available would be to distort the liability of the taxpayer, has been judicially recognized and applied in several cases. Included in these cases are Gregory v. Helvering (1935) (293 U.S. 465; Ct. D. 911, C.B. XIV-1, 193); Griffiths v. Helvering (1939) (308 U.S. 355; Ct. D. 1431, C.B. 1940-1, 136); Higgins v. Smith (1940) (308 U.S. 473; Ct. D. 1434, C.B. 1940-1, 127); and J. D.
A. B. Spreckles Co. v. Commissioner (1940) (41 B.T.A. 370). In order to give effect to
such principle, but not in limitation thereof, several provisions of the Code, for example, section 267 and section 270, specify with some particularity instances in which disallowance of the deduction, credit, or other allowance is required. Section 269 is also included in such provisions of the Code. The principle of law and the particular sections of the Code are not mutually exclusive and in appropriate circumstances they may operate together or they may operate separately. See, for example, § 1.269-6.
[T.D. 6595, 27 FR 3596, Apr. 14, 1962]
§ 1.269-3
Instances in which section 269(a) disallows a deduction, credit, or other allowance.
(a)
Instances of disallowance.
Section 269 specifies two instances in which a deduction, credit, or other allowance is to be disallowed. These instances, described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 269(a), are those in which:
(1) Any person or persons acquire, or acquired on or after October 8, 1940, directly or indirectly, control of a corporation, or
(2) Any corporation acquires, or acquired on or after October 8, 1940, directly or indirectly, property of another corporation (not controlled, directly or indirectly, immediately before such acquisition by such acquiring corporation or its stockholders), the basis of which property in the hands of the acquiring corporation is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor corporation.
In either instance the principal purpose for which the acquisition was made must have been the evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax by securing the benefit of a deduction, credit, or other allowance which such person, or persons, or corporation, would not otherwise enjoy. If this requirement is satisfied, it is immaterial by what method or by what conjunction of events the benefit was sought. Thus, an acquiring person or corporation can secure the benefit of a deduction, credit, or other allowance within the meaning of section 269 even though it is the acquired corporation that is entitled to such deduction, credit, or other allowance in the determination of its tax. If the purpose to evade or avoid Federal income tax exceeds in importance any other purpose, it is the principal purpose. This does not mean that only those acquisitions fall within the provisions of section 269 which would not have been made if the evasion or avoidance purpose was not present. The determination of the purpose for which an acquisition was made requires a scrutiny of the entire circumstances in which the transaction or course of conduct occurred, in connection with the tax result claimed to arise therefrom.
(b)
Acquisition of control; transactions indicative of purpose to evade or avoid tax.
If the requisite acquisition of control within the meaning of paragraph (1) of section 269(a) exists, the transactions set forth in the following subparagraphs are among those which, in the absence of additional evidence to the contrary, ordinarily are indicative that the principal purpose for acquiring control was evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax:
(1) A corporation or other business enterprise (or the interest controlling such corporation or enterprise) with large profits acquires control of a corporation with current, past, or prospective credits, deductions, net operating losses, or other allowances and the acquisition is followed by such transfers or other action as is necessary to bring the deduction, credit, or other allowance into conjunction with the income (see further § 1.269-6). This subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Individual A acquires all of the stock of L Corporation which has been engaged in the business of operating retail drug stores. At the time of the acquisition, L Corporation has net operating loss carryovers aggregating $100,000 and its net worth is $100,000. After the acquisition, L Corporation continues to engage in the business of operating retail drug stores but the profits attributable to such business after the acquisition are not sufficient to absorb any substantial portion of the net operating loss carryovers. Shortly after the acquisition, individual A causes to be transferred to L Corporation the assets of a hardware business previously controlled by A which business produces profits sufficient to absorb a substantial portion of L Corporation's net operating loss carryovers. The transfer of the profitable business, which has the effect of using net operating loss carryovers to offset gains of a business unrelated to that which
produced the losses, indicates that the principal purpose for which the acquisition of control was made is evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax.
(2) A person or persons organize two or more corporations instead of a single corporation in order to secure the benefit of multiple surtax exemptions (see section 11(c)) or multiple minimum accumulated earnings credits (see section 535(c)(2) and (3)).
(3) A person or persons with high earning assets transfer them to a newly organized controlled corporation retaining assets producing net operating losses which are utilized in an attempt to secure refunds.
(c)
Acquisition of property; transactions indicative of purpose to evade or avoid tax.
If the requisite acquisition of property within the meaning of paragraph (2) of section 269(a) exists, the transactions set forth in the following subparagraphs are among those which, in the absence of additional evidence to the contrary, ordinarily are indicative that the principal purpose for acquiring such property was evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax:
(1) A corporation acquires property having in its hands an aggregate carryover basis which is materially greater than its aggregate fair market value at the time of such acquisition and utilizes the property to create tax-reducing losses or deductions.
(2) A subsidiary corporation, which has sustained large net operating losses in the operation of business X and which has filed separate returns for the taxable years in which the losses were sustained, acquires high earning assets, comprising business Y, from its parent corporation. The acquisition occurs at a time when the parent would not succeed to the net operating loss carryovers of the subsidiary if the subsidiary were liquidated, and the profits of business Y are sufficient to offset a substantial portion of the net operating loss carryovers attributable to business X (see further
Example 3
of § 1.269-6).
(d)
Ownership changes to which section 382(l)(5) applies; transactions indicative of purpose to evade or avoid tax
—(1)
In general.
Absent strong evidence to the contrary, a requisite acquisition of control or property in connection with an ownership change to which section 382(l)(5) applies is considered to be made for the principal purpose of evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax unless the corporation carries on more than an insignificant amount of an active trade or business during and subsequent to the title 11 or similar case (as defined in section 382(l)(5)(G)). The determination of whether the corporation carries on more than an insignificant amount of an active trade or business is made without regard to the continuity of business enterprise set forth in § 1.368-1(d). The determination is based on all the facts and circumstances, including, for example, the amount of business assets that continue to be used, or the number of employees in the work force who continue employment, in an active trade or business (although not necessarily the historic trade or business). Where the corporation continues to utilize a significant amount of its business assets or work force, the requirement of carrying on more than an insignificant amount of an active trade or business may be met even though all trade or business activities temporarily cease for a period of time in order to address business exigencies.
(2)
Effective date.
The presumption under paragraph (d) of this section applies to acquisitions of control or property effected pursuant to a plan of reorganization confirmed by a court in a title 11 or similar case (within the meaning of section 368(a)(3)(A)) after August 14, 1990.
(e)
Relationship of section 269 to 11 U.S.C. 1129(d).
In determining for purposes of section 269 of the Internal Revenue Code whether an acquisition pursuant to a plan of reorganization in a case under title 11 of the United States Code was made for the principal purpose of evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax, the fact that a governmental unit did not seek a determination under 11 U.S.C. 1129(d) is not taken into account and any determination by a court under 11 U.S.C. 1129(d) that the principal purpose of the plan is not avoidance of taxes is not controlling.
[T.D. 6595, 27 FR 3596, Apr. 14, 1962, as amended by T.D. 8388, 57 FR 345, Jan. 6, 1992]
§ 1.269-4
Power of district director to allocate deduction, credit, or allowance in part.
The district director is authorized by section 269(b) to allow a part of the amount disallowed by section 269(a), but he may allow such part only if and to the extent that he determines that the amount allowed will not result in the evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax for which the acquisition was made. The district director is also authorized to use other methods to give effect to part of the amount disallowed under section 269(a), but only to such extent as he determines will not result in the evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax for which the acquisition was made. Whenever appropriate to give proper effect to the deduction, credit, or other allowance, or such part of it which may be allowed, this authority includes the distribution, apportionment, or allocation of both the gross income and the deductions, credits, or other allowances the benefit of which was sought, between or among the corporations, or properties, or parts thereof, involved, and includes the disallowance of any such deduction, credit, or other allowance to any of the taxpayers involved.
[T.D. 6595, 27 FR 3597, Apr. 14, 1962]
§ 1.269-5
Time of acquisition of control.
(a)
In general.
For purposes of section 269, an acquisition of control occurs when one or more persons acquire beneficial ownership of stock possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 50 percent of the total value of share of all classes of stock of the corporation.
(b)
Application of general rule to certain creditor acquisitions.
(1) For purposes of section 269, creditors of an insolvent or bankrupt corporation (by themselves or in conjunction with other persons) acquire control of the corporation when they acquire beneficial ownership of the requisite amount of stock. Although insolvency or bankruptcy may cause the interests of creditors to predominate as a practical matter, creditor interests do not constitute beneficial ownership of the corporation's stock. Solely for purposes of section 269, creditors of a bankrupt corporation are treated as acquiring beneficial ownership of stock of the corporation no earlier than the time a bankruptcy court confirms a plan of reorganization.
(2) The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
Corporation
L
files a petition under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on January 5, 1987. A creditors' committee is formed. On February 22, 1987, and upon the request of the creditors, the bankruptcy court removes the debtor-in-possession from business management and operations and appoints a trustee. The trustee consults regularly with the creditors' committee in formulating both short-term and long-term management decisions. After three years, the creditors approve a plan of reorganization in which the outstanding stock of Corporation
L
is canceled and its creditors receive shares of stock constituting all of the outstanding shares. The bankruptcy court confirms the plan of reorganization on March 23, 1990, and the plan is put into effect on May 25, 1990. For purposes of section 269, the creditors acquired control of Corporation
L
than March 23, 1990. Similarly, the determination of whether the creditors acquired control of Corporation
L
no earlier with the principal purpose of evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax is made by reference to the creditors' purposes as of no earlier than March 23, 1990.
[T.D. 8388, 57 FR 346, Jan. 6, 1992]
§ 1.269-6
Relationship of section 269 to section 382 before the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
Section 269 and §§ 1.269-1 through 1.269-5 may be applied to disallow a net operating loss carryover even though such carryover is not disallowed (in whole or in part) under section 382 and the regulations thereunder. This section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
L Corporation has computed its taxable income on a calendar year basis and has sustained heavy net operating losses for a number of years. Assume that A purchases all of the stock of L Corporation on December 31, 1955, for the principal purpose of utilizing its net operating loss carryovers by changing its business to a profitable new business. Assume further that A makes no attempt to revitalize the business of L Corporation during the calendar year 1956 and that during January 1957 the business is changed to an entirely new and profitable business. The carryovers will be disallowed
under the provisions of section 269(a) without regard to the application of section 382.

# Example 2.
L Corporation has sustained heavy net operating losses for a number of years. In a merger under State law, P Corporation acquires all of the assets of L Corporation for the principal purpose of utilizing the net operating loss carryovers of L Corporation against the profits of P Corporation's business. As a result of the merger, the former stockholders of L Corporation own, immediately after the merger, 12 percent of the fair market value of the outstanding stock of P Corporation. If the merger qualifies as a reorganization to which section 381(a) applies, the entire net operating loss carryovers will be disallowed under the provisions of section 269(a) without regard to the application of section 382.

# Example 3.
L Corporation has been sustaining net operating losses for a number of years. P Corporation, a profitable corporation, on December 31, 1955, acquires all the stock of L Corporation for the purpose of continuing and improving the operation of L Corporation's business. Under the provisions of sections 334(b)(2) and 381(a)(1), P Corporation would not succeed to L Corporation's net operating loss carryovers if L Corporation were liquidated pursuant to a plan of liquidation adopted within two years after the date of the acquisition. During 1956, P Corporation transfers a profitable business to L Corporation for the principal purpose of using the profits of such business to absorb the net operating loss carryovers of L Corporation. The transfer is such as to cause the basis of the transferred assets in the hands of L Corporation to be determined by reference to their basis in the hands of P Corporation. L Corporation's net operating loss carryovers will be disallowed under the provisions of section 269(a) without regard to the application of section 382.
[T.D. 6595, 27 FR 3597, Apr. 14, 1962, as amended by T.D. 8388, 57 FR 346, Jan. 6, 1992]
§ 1.269-7
Relationship of section 269 to sections 382 and 383 after the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
Section 269 and §§ 1.269-1 through 1.269-5 may be applied to disallow a deduction, credit, or other allowance notwithstanding that the utilization or amount of a deduction, credit, or other allowance is limited or reduced under section 382 or 383 and the regulations thereunder. However, the fact that the amount of taxable income or tax that may be offset by a deduction, credit, or other allowance is limited under section 382(a) or 383 and the regulations thereunder is relevant to the determination of whether the principal purpose of an acquisition is the evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax.
[T.D. 8388, 57 FR 346, Jan. 6, 1992]
§ 1.269B-1
Stapled foreign corporations.
(a)
Treatment as a domestic corporation
—(1)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided, if a foreign corporation is a stapled foreign corporation within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, such foreign corporation will be treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, for example, the worldwide income of such corporation will be subject to the tax imposed by section 11. For application of the branch profits tax under section 884, and application of sections 871(a), 881, 1441, and 1442 to dividends and interest paid by a stapled foreign corporation, see §§ 1.884-1(h) and 1.884-4(d).
(2)
Foreign owned exception.
Paragraph (a)(1) of this section will not apply if a foreign corporation and a domestic corporation are stapled entities (as provided in paragraph (b) of this section) and such foreign and domestic corporations are foreign owned within the meaning of this paragraph (a)(2). A corporation will be treated as foreign owned if it is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that United States persons hold directly (or indirectly applying section 958(a)(2) and (3) and section 318(a)(4)) less than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and less than 50 percent of the total value of the stock of such corporation. For the consequences of a stapled foreign corporation becoming or ceasing to be foreign owned, therefore converting its status as either a foreign or domestic corporation within the meaning of this paragraph (a)(2), see paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Definition of a stapled foreign corporation
—(1)
General rule.
A foreign corporation is a stapled foreign corporation if such foreign corporation and a domestic corporation are stapled entities. A foreign corporation and a domestic corporation are stapled entities if more than 50 percent of the aggregate value of each corporation's beneficial ownership consists of interests
that are stapled. In the case of corporations with more than one class of stock, it is not necessary for a class of stock representing more than 50 percent of the beneficial ownership of the foreign corporation to be stapled to a class of stock representing more than 50 percent of the beneficial ownership of the domestic corporation, provided that more than 50 percent of the aggregate value of each corporation's beneficial ownership (taking into account all classes of stock) are in fact stapled. Interests are stapled if a transferor of one or more interests in one entity is required, by form of ownership, restrictions on transfer, or other terms or conditions, to transfer interests in the other entity. The determination of whether interests are stapled for this purpose is based on the relevant facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to, the corporations' by-laws, articles of incorporation or association, and stock certificates, shareholder agreements, agreements between the corporations, and voting trusts with respect to the corporations. For the consequences of a foreign corporation becoming or ceasing to be a stapled foreign corporation (
e.g.
, a corporation that is no longer foreign owned) under this paragraph (b)(1), see paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Related party ownership rule.
For purposes of determining whether a foreign corporation is a stapled foreign corporation, the Commissioner may, at his discretion, treat interests that otherwise would be stapled interests as not being stapled if the same person or related persons (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)) hold stapled interests constituting more than 50 percent of the beneficial ownership of both corporations, and a principal purpose of the stapling of those interests is the avoidance of U.S. income tax. A stapling of interests may have a principal purpose of tax avoidance even though the tax avoidance purpose is outweighed by other purposes when taken together.
(3)
Example.
The principles of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
USCo, a domestic corporation, and FCo, a foreign corporation, are publicly traded companies, each having two classes of stock outstanding. USCo's class A shares, which constitute 75% of the value of all beneficial ownership in USCo, are stapled to FCo's class B shares, which constitute 25% of the value of all beneficial ownership in F Co. USCo's class B shares, which constitute 25% of the value of all beneficial ownership in USCo, are stapled to FCo class A shares, which constitute 75% of the value of all beneficial ownership in FCo. Because more than 50% of the aggregate value of the stock of each corporation is stapled to the stock of the other corporation, USCo and FCo are stapled entities within the meaning of section 269B(c)(2).
(c)
Changes in domestic or foreign status.
The deemed conversion of a foreign corporation to a domestic corporation under section 269B is treated as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F). Similarly, the deemed conversion of a corporation that is treated as a domestic corporation under section 269B to a foreign corporation is treated as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(F). For the consequences of a deemed conversion, including the closing of a corporation's taxable year, see §§ 1.367(a)-1(e), (f) and 1.367(b)-2(f).
(d)
Includible corporation
—(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a stapled foreign corporation treated as a domestic corporation under section 269B nonetheless is treated as a foreign corporation in determining whether it is an includible corporation within the meaning of section 1504(b). Thus, for example, a stapled foreign corporation is not eligible to join in the filing of a consolidated return under section 1501, and a dividend paid by such corporation is not a qualifying dividend under section 243(b), unless a valid section 1504(d) election is made with respect to such corporation.
(2) A stapled foreign corporation is treated as a domestic corporation in determining whether it is an includible corporation under section 1504(b) for purposes of applying §§ 1.904(i)-1 and 1.861-11T(d)(6).
(e)
U.S. treaties
—(1) A stapled foreign corporation that is treated as a domestic corporation under section 269B may not claim an exemption from U.S. income tax or a reduction in U.S. tax rates by reason of any treaty entered into by the United States.
(2) The principles of this paragraph (e) are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
FCo, a Country X corporation, is a stapled foreign corporation that is treated as a domestic corporation under section 269B. FCo qualifies as a resident of Country X pursuant to the income tax treaty between the United States and Country X. Under such treaty, the United States is permitted to tax business profits of a Country X resident only to the extent that the business profits are attributable to a permanent establishment of the Country X resident in the United States. While FCo earns income from sources within and without the United States, it does not have a permanent establishment in the United States within the meaning of the relevant treaty. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, however, FCo is subject to U.S. Federal income tax on its income as a domestic corporation without regard to the provisions of the U.S.-Country X treaty and therefore without regard to the fact that FCo has no permanent establishment in the United States.
(f)
Tax assessment and collection procedures
—(1)
In general.
(i) Any income tax imposed on a stapled foreign corporation by reason of its treatment as a domestic corporation under section 269B (whether such income tax is shown on the stapled foreign corporation's U.S. Federal income tax return or determined as a deficiency in income tax) shall be assessed as the income tax liability of such stapled foreign corporation.
(ii) Any income tax assessed as a liability of a stapled foreign corporation under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section shall be considered as having been properly assessed as an income tax liability of the stapled domestic corporation (as defined in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section) and all 10-percent shareholders of the stapled foreign corporation (as defined in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section). The date of such deemed assessment shall be the date the income tax liability of the stapled foreign corporation was properly assessed. The Commissioner may collect such income tax from the stapled domestic corporation under the circumstances set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this section and may collect such income tax from any 10-percent shareholders of the stapled foreign corporation under the circumstances set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
(2)
Collection from domestic stapled corporation.
If the stapled foreign corporation does not pay its income tax liability that was properly assessed, the unpaid balance of such income tax or any portion thereof may be collected from the stapled domestic corporation, provided that the following conditions are satisfied—
(i) The Commissioner has issued a notice and demand for payment of such income tax to the stapled foreign corporation in accordance with § 301.6303-1 of this Chapter;
(ii) The stapled foreign corporation has failed to pay the income tax by the date specified in such notice and demand;
(iii) The Commissioner has issued a notice and demand for payment of the unpaid portion of such income tax to the stapled domestic corporation in accordance with § 301.6303-1 of this Chapter.
(3)
Collection from 10-percent shareholders of the stapled foreign corporation.
The unpaid balance of the stapled foreign corporation's income tax liability may be collected from a 10-percent shareholder of the stapled foreign corporation, limited to each such shareholder's income tax liability as determined under paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section, provided the following conditions are satisfied—
(i) The Commissioner has issued a notice and demand to the stapled domestic corporation for the unpaid portion of the stapled foreign corporation's income tax liability, as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section;
(ii) The stapled domestic corporation has failed to pay the income tax by the date specified in such notice and demand;
(iii) The Commissioner has issued a notice and demand for payment of the unpaid portion of such income tax to such 10-percent shareholder of the stapled foreign corporation in accordance with § 301.6303-1 of this Chapter.
(4)
Special rules and definitions.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), the following rules and definitions apply:
(i)
Stapled domestic corporation.
A domestic corporation is a
stapled domestic corporation
with respect to a stapled foreign corporation if such domestic corporation and the stapled foreign
corporation are stapled entities as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(ii)
10-percent shareholder.
A
10-percent shareholder
of a stapled foreign corporation is any person that owned directly 10 percent or more of the total value or total combined voting power of all classes of stock in the stapled foreign corporation for any day of the stapled foreign corporation's taxable year with respect to which the income tax liability relates.
(iii)
10-percent shareholder in the case of indirect ownership of stapled foreign corporation stock.
[Reserved]
(iv)
Determination of a 10-percent shareholder's income tax liability.
The income tax liability of a 10-percent shareholder of a stapled foreign corporation, for the income tax of the stapled foreign corporation under section 269B and this section, is determined by assigning an equal portion of the total income tax liability of the stapled foreign corporation for the taxable year to each day in such corporation's taxable year, and then dividing that portion ratably among the shares outstanding for that day on the basis of the relative values of such shares. The liability of any 10-percent shareholder for this purpose is the sum of the income tax liability allocated to the shares held by such shareholder for each day in the taxable year.
(v)
Income tax.
The term
income tax
means any income tax liability imposed on a domestic corporation under title 26 of the United States Code, including additions to tax, additional amounts, penalties, and interest related to such income tax liability.
(g)
Effective dates
—(1) Except as provided in this paragraph (g), the provisions of this section are applicable for taxable years that begin after July 29, 2005.
(2) Paragraphs (d)(1) and (f) of this section (except as applied to the collection of tax from any 10-percent shareholder of a stapled foreign corporation that is a foreign person) are applicable beginning on—
(i) July 18, 1984, for any foreign corporation that became stapled to a domestic corporation after June 30, 1983; and
(ii) January 1, 1987, for any foreign corporation that was stapled to a domestic corporation as of June 30, 1983.
(3) Paragraph (d)(2) of this section is applicable for taxable years beginning after July 22, 2003, except that in the case of a foreign corporation that becomes stapled to a domestic corporation on or after July 22, 2003, paragraph (d)(2) of this section applies for taxable years ending on or after July 22, 2003.
(4) Paragraph (e) of this section is applicable beginning on July 18, 1984, except as provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section.
(5) In the case of a foreign corporation that was stapled to a domestic corporation as of June 30, 1983, which was entitled to claim benefits under an income tax treaty as of that date, and which remains eligible for such treaty benefits, paragraph (e) of this section will not apply to such foreign corporation and for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code such corporation will continue to be treated as a foreign entity. The prior sentence will continue to apply even if such treaty is subsequently modified by protocol, or superseded by a new treaty, so long as the stapled foreign corporation continues to be eligible to claim such treaty benefits. If the treaty benefits to which the stapled foreign corporation was entitled as of June 30, 1983, are terminated, then a deemed conversion of the foreign corporation to a domestic corporation shall occur pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section as of the date of such termination.
[T.D. 9216, 70 FR 43758, July 29, 2005, as amended by T.D. 9739, 80 FR 56912, Sept. 21, 2015]
§ 1.270-1
Limitation on deductions allowable to individuals in certain cases.
(a)
Recomputation of taxable income.
(1) Under certain circumstances, section 270 limits the deductions (other than certain deductions described in subsection (b) thereof) attributable to a trade or business carried on by an individual which are otherwise allowable to such individual under the provisions of chapter 1 of the Code or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue
laws. If, in each of five consecutive taxable years (including at least one taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954), the deductions attributable to a trade or business carried on by an individual (other than the specially treated deductions described in paragraph (b) of this section) exceed the gross income derived from such trade or business by more than $50,000, the taxable income computed under section 63 (or the net income computed under the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws) of such individual shall be recomputed for each of such taxable years.
(2) In recomputing the taxable income (or the net income, in the case of taxable years which are otherwise subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) for each of the five taxable years, the deductions (other than the specially treated deductions described in paragraph (b) of this section with the exception of the net operating loss deduction) attributable to the trade or business carried on by the individual shall be allowed only to the extent of (i) the gross income derived from such trade or business, plus (ii) $50,000. The specially treated deductions described in paragraph (b) of this section (other than the net operating loss deduction) shall each be allowed in full. The net operating loss deduction, to the extent attributable to such trade or business, shall be disallowed in its entirety. Thus, a carryover or a carryback of a net operating loss so attributable, either from a year within the period of five consecutive taxable years or from a taxable year outside of such period, shall be ignored in making the recomputation of taxable income or net income, as the case may be.
(3) The limitations on deductions provided by section 270 are also applicable in determining under section 172, or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, the amount of any net operating loss carryover or carryback from any year which falls within the provisions of section 270 to any year which does not fall within such provisions. Also, in determining under section 172, or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, the amount of any net operating loss carryover from a year which falls within the provisions of section 270 to a year which does not fall within such provisions, the amount of net operating loss is to be reduced by the taxable income or net income, as the case may be (computed as provided in § 1.172-5, or 26 CFR (1939) 39.122-4(c) (Regulations 118), as the case may be and, in the case of any taxable year which falls within the provisions of section 270, determined after the application of section 270), of any taxable year preceding or succeeding the taxable year of the net operating loss to which such loss must first be carried back or carried over under the provisions of section 172(b), or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, even though the net operating loss deduction is not an allowable deduction for such preceding or succeeding taxable year.
(4) If an individual carries on several trades or businesses, the deductions attributable to such trades or businesses and the gross income derived therefrom shall not be aggregated in determining whether the deductions (other than the specially treated deductions) exceed the gross income derived from such trades or businesses by more than $50,000 in any taxable year. For the purposes of section 270, each trade or business shall be considered separately. However, where a particular business of an individual is conducted in one or more forms such as a partnership, joint venture, or individual proprietorship, the individual's share of the profits and losses from each business unit must be aggregated to determine the applicability of section 270. See paragraphs (a)(8)(ii) and (b) of § 1.702-1, relating to applicability of section 270 to a partner. Where it is established that for tax purposes a husband and wife are partners in the same trade or business or that each is participating independently of the other in the same trade or business with his and her own money, the husband's gross income and deductions from that trade or business shall be considered separately from the wife's gross income and deductions from that trade or business even though they file a joint return. Where a taxpayer is engaged in a trade or business in a community property State under circumstances such that the income therefrom is considered to
be community income, the taxpayer and his spouse are treated for purposes of section 270 as two individuals engaged separately in the same trade or business and the gross income and deductions attributable to the trade or business are allocated one-half to the taxpayer and one-half to the spouse. Where several business activities emanate from a single commodity, such as oil or gas or a tract of land, it does not necessarily follow that such activities are one business for the purposes of section 270. However, in order to be treated separately, it must be established that such business activities are actually conducted separately and are not closely interrelated with each other. For the purposes of section 270, the trade or business carried on by an individual must be the same in each of the five consecutive years in which the deductions (other than the specially treated deductions) exceed the gross income derived from such trade or business by more than $50,000.
(5) For the purposes of section 270, a taxable year may be part of two or more periods of five consecutive taxable years. Thus, if the deductions (other than the specially treated deductions) attributable to a trade or business carried on by an individual exceed the gross income therefrom by more than $50,000 for each of six consecutive taxable years, the fifth year of such six consecutive taxable years shall be considered to be a part both of a five-year period beginning with the first and ending with the fifth taxable year and of a five-year period beginning with the second and ending with the sixth taxable year.
(6) For the purposes of section 270, a short taxable year required to effect a change in accounting period constitutes a taxable year. In determining the applicability of section 270 in the case of a short taxable year, items of income and deduction are not annualized.
(b)
Specially treated deductions.
(1) For the purposes of section 270 and paragraph (a) of this section, the specially treated deductions are:
(i) Taxes,
(ii) Interest,
(iii) Casualty and abandonment losses connected with a trade or business deductible under section 165(c)(1) or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws,
(iv) Losses and expenses of the trade or business of farming which are directly attributable to drought,
(v) The net operating loss deduction allowed by section 172, or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, and
(vi) Expenditures as to which a taxpayer is given the option, under law or regulations, either (
a
) to deduct as expenses when incurred, or (
b
) to defer or capitalize.
(2) For the purpose of subparagraph (1)(iv) of this paragraph, an individual is engaged in the “trade or business of farming” if he cultivates, operates, or manages a farm for gain or profit, either as owner or tenant. An individual who receives a rental (either in cash or in kind) which is based upon farm production is engaged in the trade or business of farming. However, an individual who receives a fixed rental (without reference to production) is engaged in the trade or business of farming only if he participates to a material extent in the operation or management of the farm. An individual engaged in forestry or the growing of timber is not thereby engaged in the trade or business of farming. An individual cultivating or operating a farm for recreation or pleasure rather than a profit is not engaged in the trade or business of farming. The term
farm
is used in its ordinarily accepted sense and includes stock, dairy, poultry, fruit, crop, and truck farms, and also plantations, ranches, ranges, and orchards. An individual is engaged in the trade or business of farming if he is a member of a partnership engaged in the trade or business of farming.
(3) In order for losses and expenses of the trade or business of farming to qualify as specially treated deductions under subparagraph (1)(iv) of this paragraph such losses and expenses must be directly attributable to drought conditions and not to other causes such as faulty management or unfavorable market conditions. In general, the following are the types of losses and expenses which, if otherwise deductible,
may qualify as specially treated deductions under subparagraph (1)(iv) of this paragraph:
(i) Losses for damages to or destruction of property as a result of drought conditions, if such property is used in the trade or business of farming or is purchased for resale in the trade or business of farming;
(ii) Expenses directly related to raising crops or livestock which are destroyed or damaged by drought. Included in this category are, for example, payments for labor, fertilizer, and feed used in raising such crops or livestock. If such crops or livestock to which the expenditures relate are only partially destroyed or damaged by drought then only a proportionate part of the expenditures is regarded as specially treated deductions; and
(iii) Expenses which would not have been incurred in the absence of drought conditions, such as expenses for procuring pasture or additional supplies of water or feed.
(4) The expenditures referred to in subparagraph (1)(vi) of this paragraph include, but are not limited to, intangible drilling and development costs in the case of oil and gas wells as provided in section 263(c) and the regulations thereunder, and expenditures for the development of a mine or other natural deposit (other than an oil or gas well) as provided in section 616 and the regulations thereunder.
(5) The provisions of section 270(b) do not operate to make an expenditure a deductible item if it is not otherwise deductible under the law applicable to the particular year in which it was incurred. Thus, for example, if it is necessary, pursuant to the provisions of section 270, to recompute the taxable or net income of an individual for the taxable years 1950 through 1954, the individual in making the recomputation may not deduct expenditures paid or incurred in the years 1950 through 1953 which must be capitalized under the law applicable to those years, even though the expenditures are deductible under the Code.
(c)
Applicability to taxable years otherwise subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
The net income of a taxable year otherwise subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 shall be recomputed pursuant to section 270 if (i) such taxable year is included in a period of five consecutive taxable years which includes at least one taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, and (ii) the deductions (other than the specially treated deductions specified in section 270(b)) for each taxable year in such five-year period exceed the $50,000 limitation specified in section 270. As described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, a taxable year may be part of two or more periods of five consecutive taxable years, one meeting the requirements for recomputation pursuant to section 130 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and the other meeting the requirements for recomputation pursuant to section 270 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, then the recomputation for such taxable year shall be made pursuant to section 270. For example, if a calendar year taxpayer sustains a loss from a trade or business for each of the years 1949 through 1954, the years 1950, 1951, 1952, and 1953 may be a part of two such periods of five consecutive taxable years. If, however, a taxable year is part of a period of five consecutive taxable years which meets the requirements for recomputation pursuant to section 130 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, but is not part of a period which meets the requirements for recomputation, pursuant to section 270, then a recomputation of net income for such taxable year must be made pursuant to section 130.
(d)
Redetermination of tax.
The tax imposed by Chapter 1 of the Code, or by the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, for each of the five consecutive taxable years specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be redetermined upon the basis of the taxable income or net income of the individual, as the case may be, recomputed in the manner described in paragraph (a) of this section. If the assessment of a deficiency is prevented (except for the provisions of Part II (section 1311 and following), Subchapter Q, Chapter 1 of the Code, relating to the effect of limitations and other provisions in income tax cases) by the operation of any provision of law (e.g., sections 6501 and 6502, or the corresponding provisions of
prior revenue laws, relating to the period of limitations upon assessment and collection) except section 7122, or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, relating to compromises, or by any rule of law (e.g., res judicata), then the excess of the tax for such year as recomputed over the tax previously determined for such year shall be considered a deficiency for the purposes of section 270. The term
tax previously determined
shall have the same meaning as that assigned to such term by section 1314(a). See § 1.1314 (a)-1.
(e)
Assessment of tax.
Any amount determined as a deficiency in the manner described in paragraph (d) of this section in respect of any taxable year of the five consecutive taxable years specified in paragraph (a) of this section may be assessed and collected as if on the date of the expiration of the period of limitation for the assessment of a deficiency for the fifth taxable year of such five consecutive taxable years, one year remained before the expiration of the period of limitation upon assessment for the taxable year in respect of which the deficiency is determined. If the taxable year is one in respect of which an assessment could be made without regard to section 270, the amount of the actual deficiency as defined in section 6211(a) (whether it is greater than, equal to, or less than the deficiency determined under section 270(c)) shall be assessed and collected. However, if the assessment of a deficiency for such taxable year would be prevented by any provision of law (e.g., the period of limitation upon the assessment of tax) except section 7122, or the corresponding provision of prior revenue laws, relating to compromises, or by the operation of any rule of law (e.g., res judicata), then the excess of the tax recomputed as described in paragraph (d) of this section over the tax previously determined may be assessed and collected even though in fact there is no actual deficiency, as defined in section 6211(a), in respect of the given taxable year.
(f)
Effective date; cross reference.
The provisions of section 270 and this section apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970. Thus, for instance, if the taxpayer had a profit of $2,000 attributable to a trade or business in 1965, section 270 and this section would not apply to the taxable years 1966 through 1970, even though he had losses of more than $50,000 in each of the 5 years ending with 1970. For provisions relating to activities not engaged in for profit applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, see section 183 and the regulations thereunder.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7198, 37 FR 13685, July 13, 1972]
§ 1.271-1
Debts owed by political parties.
(a)
General rule.
In the case of a taxpayer other than a bank (as defined in section 581 and the regulations thereunder), no deduction shall be allowed under section 166 (relating to bad debts) or section 165(g) (relating to worthlessness of securities) by reason of the worthlessness of any debt, regardless of how it arose, owed by a political party. For example, it is immaterial that the debt may have arisen as a result of services rendered or goods sold or that the taxpayer included the amount of the debt in income. In the case of a bank, no deduction shall be allowed unless, under the facts and circumstances, it appears that the bad debt was incurred to or purchased by, or the worthless security was acquired by, the taxpayer in accordance with its usual commercial practices. Thus, if a bank makes a loan to a political party not in accordance with its usual commercial practices but solely because the president of the bank has been active in the party no bad debt deduction will be allowed with respect to the loan.
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Political party.
For purposes of this section and § 1.276-1, the term
political party
means a political party (as commonly understood), a National, State, or local committee thereof, or any committee, association, or organization, whether incorporated or not, which accepts contributions (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) or makes expenditures (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) for the purpose of influencing or attempting to influence the
election of presidential or vice-presidential electors, or the selection, nomination, or election of any individual to any Federal, State, or local elective public office, whether or not such individual or electors are selected, nominated, or elected. Accordingly, a political party includes a committee or other group which accepts contributions or makes expenditures for the purpose of promoting the nomination of an individual for an elective public office in a primary election, or in any convention, meeting, or caucus of a political party. It is immaterial whether the contributions or expenditures are accepted or made directly or indirectly. Thus, for example, a committee or other group, is considered to be a political party, if, although it does not expend any funds, it turns funds over to another organization, which does expend funds for the purpose of attempting to influence the nomination of an individual for an elective public office. An organization which engages in activities which are truly nonpartisan in nature will not be considered a political party merely because it conducts activities with respect to an election campaign if, under all the facts and circumstances, it is clear that its efforts are not directed to the election of the candidates of any particular party or parties or to the selection, nomination or election of any particular candidate. For example, a committee or group will not be treated as a political party if it is organized merely to inform the electorate as to the identity and experience of all candidates involved, to present on a nonpreferential basis the issues or views of the parties or candidates as described by the parties or candidates, or to provide a forum in which the candidates are freely invited on a nonpreferential basis to discuss or debate the issues.
(2)
Contributions.
For purposes of this section and § 1.276-1, the term
contributions
includes a gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit, of money or anything of value, and includes a contract, promise, or agreement to make a contribution, whether or not legally enforceable.
(3)
Expenditures.
For purposes of this section and § 1.276-1, the term
expenditures
includes a payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift, of money or anything of value, and includes a contract, promise, or agreement to make an expenditure, whether or not legally enforceable.
[T.D. 6996, 34 FR 832, Jan. 18, 1969]
§ 1.272-1
Expenditures relating to disposal of coal or domestic iron ore.
(a)
Introduction.
Section 272 provides special treatment for certain expenditures paid or incurred by a taxpayer in connection with a contract (hereafter sometimes referred to as a “coal royalty contract” or “iron ore royalty contract”) for the disposal of coal or iron ore the gain or loss from which is treated under section 631(c) as a section 1231 gain or loss on the sale of coal or iron ore. See paragraph (e) of § 1.631-3 for special rules relating to iron ore. The expenditures covered by section 272 are those which are attributable to the making and administering of such a contract or to the preservation of the economic interest retained under the contract. For examples of such expenditures, see paragraph (d) of this section. For a taxable year in which gross royalty income is realized under the contract of disposal, such expenditures shall not be allowed as a deduction. Instead, they are to be added to the adjusted depletion basis of the coal or iron ore disposed of in the taxable year in computing gain or loss under section 631(c). However, where no gross royalty income is realized under the contract of disposal in a particular taxable year, such expenditure shall be treated without regard to section 272.
(b)
In general.
(1) Where the disposal of coal or iron ore is covered by section 631(c), the provisions of section 272 and this section shall be applicable for a taxable year in which there is income under the contract of disposal. (For purposes of section 272 and this section, the term
income
means gross amounts received or accrued which are royalties or bonuses in connection with a contract to which section 631(c) applies.) All expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year which are attributable to the making and administering of the contract disposing of the coal or iron ore and all expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year in order to preserve
the owner's economic interest retained under the contract shall be disallowed as deductions in computing taxable income for the taxable year. The sum of such expenditures and the adjusted depletion basis of the coal or iron ore disposed of in the taxable year shall be used in determining the amount of gain or loss with respect to the disposal. See § 1.631-3. For special rule in case of loss, see paragraph (c) of this section. Section 272 and this section do not apply to capital expenditures, and such expenditures are not taken into account in computing gain or loss under section 631(c) except to the extent they are properly part of the depletable basis of the coal or iron ore.
(2) The expenditures covered under section 272 and this section are disallowed as a deduction only with respect to a taxable year in which income is realized under the coal royalty contract (or iron ore royalty contract) to which such expenditures are attributable. Where no income is realized under the contract in a taxable year, these expenditures shall be deducted as expenses for the production of income, or as a business expense, or they may be treated under section 266 (relating to taxes and carrying charges) if applicable.
(3) The provisions of section 272 and this section apply to a taxable year in which income from the disposal by the owner of coal or iron ore held by him for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) is subject to the provisions of section 631(c) even though the actual mining of coal or iron ore under the coal royalty contract (or iron ore royalty contract) does not take place during the taxable year. Where the right under the contract to mine coal or iron ore for which advance payment has been made expires, terminates, or is abandoned before the coal or iron ore is mined, and paragraph (c) of § 1.631-3 requires the owner to recompute his tax with respect to such payment, the recomputation must be made without applying the provisions of section 272 and this section.
(c)
Losses.
If, in any taxable year, the expenditures referred to in section 272 and this section plus the adjusted depletion basis (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.631-3) of the coal or iron ore disposed of during the taxable year exceed the amount realized under the contract which is subject to section 631(c) during the taxable year, such excess shall be considered under section 1231 as a loss from the sale of property used in the trade or business and, to the extent not availed of as a reduction of gain under that section, shall be a loss deductible under section 165(a) (relating to the deduction of losses generally).
(d)
Examples of expenditures.
(1) The expenditures referred to in section 272 include, but are not limited to, the following items, if such items are attributable to the making or administering of the contract or preserving the economic interest therein: Ad valorem taxes imposed by State or local authorities, costs of fire protection, costs of insurance (other than liability insurance), costs incurred in administering the contract (including costs of bookkeeping and technical supervision), interest on loans, expenses of flood control, legal and technical expenses, and expenses of measuring and checking quantities of coal or iron ore disposed of under the contract. Whether the interest on loans is attributable to the making or administering of the contract or preserving the economic interest therein will depend upon the use to which the borrowed monies are put.
(2) Any expenditure referred to in this section which is applicable to more than one coal royalty contract or iron ore royalty contract shall be reasonably apportioned to each of such contracts. Furthermore, if an expenditure applies only in part to the making or administering of the contract or the preservation of the economic interest, then only such part shall be treated under section 272. The apportionment of the expenditure shall be made on a reasonable basis. For example, where a taxpayer has other income (such as income from oil or gas royalties, rentals, right of way fees, interest, or dividends) as well as income under section 631(c), and where the salaries of some of its employees or other expenses relate to both classes of income, such expenses shall be allocated reasonably between the income subject to section
631(c) and the other income. Where a taxpayer has more than one coal royalty contract or iron ore royalty contract, expenditures under this section relating to a contract from which no income has been received in the taxable year may not be allocated to income from another contract from which income has been received in the taxable year.
(3) The taxpayer may have expenses which are not attributable even partly to making and administering a coal royalty contract or iron ore royalty contract or to the preservation of the economic interest retained under the contract and, accordingly, are not included in the expenditures described in section 272. These include such items as ad valorem taxes imposed by State or local authorities on property not covered by the contract, salaries, wages, or other expenses entirely incident to the ownership and protection of such property and depreciation of improvements thereon, fire insurance on such property, charitable contributions, and similar expenses unrelated to the making or to the administering of coal royalty contracts or iron ore royalty contracts or preserving the taxpayer's economic interest retained therein.
(e)
Nonapplication of section.
For purposes of section 543, the provisions of section 272 shall have no application. For example, the taxpayer may, for the purposes of section 543(a)(3)(C) or the corresponding provisions of prior income tax laws, include in the sum of the deductions which are allowable under section 162 an amount paid to an attorney as compensation for legal services rendered in connection with the making of a coal royalty contract or iron ore royalty contract (assuming the expenditure otherwise qualifies under section 162 as an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in the taxpayer's trade or business), even though such expenditure is disallowed as a deduction under section 272.

§ 1.273-1
Life or terminable interests.
(a)
In general.
Amounts paid as income to the holder of a life or a terminable interest acquired by gift, bequest, or inheritance shall not be subject to any deduction for shrinkage (whether called by depreciation or any other name) in the value of such interest due to the lapse of time. In other words, the holder of such an interest so acquired may not set up the value of the expected future payments as corpus or principal and claim deduction for shrinkage or exhaustion thereof due to the passage of time. For the treatment generally of distributions to beneficiaries of an estate or trust, see Subparts A, B, C, and D (section 641 and following), Subchapter J, Chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder. For basis of property acquired from a decedent and by gifts and transfers in trust, see sections 1014, 1015, and 1022, and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Effective/applicability date.
The provisions in this section are applicable for taxable years beginning on or after September 16, 1958. The provisions of this section relating to section 1022 are effective on and after January 19, 2017.
[T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6237, Jan. 19, 2017]
§ 1.274-1
Disallowance of certain entertainment, gift and travel expenses.
Section 274 disallows in whole, or in part, certain expenditures for entertainment, gifts and travel which would otherwise be allowable under Chapter 1 of the Code. The requirements imposed by section 274 are in addition to the requirements for deductibility imposed by other provisions of the Code. If a deduction is claimed for an expenditure for entertainment, gifts, or travel, the taxpayer must first establish that it is otherwise allowable as a deduction under Chapter 1 of the Code before the provisions of section 274 become applicable. An expenditure for entertainment, to the extent it is lavish or extravagant, shall not be allowable as a deduction. The taxpayer should then substantiate such an expenditure in accordance with the rules under section 274(d). See § 1.274-5. Section 274 is a disallowance provision exclusively, and does not make deductible any expense which is disallowed under any other provision of the Code. Similarly, section 274 does not affect the
includability of an item in, or the excludability of an item from, the gross income of any taxpayer. For specific provisions with respect to the deductibility of expenditures: for an activity of a type generally considered to constitute entertainment, amusement, or recreation, and for a facility used in connection with such an activity, as well as certain travel expenses of a spouse, etc., see § 1.274-2; for expenses for gifts, see § 1.274-3; for expenses for foreign travel, see § 1.274-4; for expenditures deductible without regard to business activity, see § 1.274-6; and for treatment of personal portion of entertainment facility, see § 1.274-7.

(i) That the expenditure was directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business, or
(ii) In the case of an expenditure directly preceding or following a substantial and bona fide business discussion (including business meetings at a convention or otherwise), that the expenditure was associated with the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business.
Such deduction shall not exceed the portion of the expenditure directly related to (or in the case of an expenditure described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the portion of the expenditure associated with) the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business.
(2)
Entertainment facilities

(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Entertainment defined
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the term
entertainment
means any activity which is of a type generally considered to constitute entertainment, amusement, or recreation, such as entertaining at night clubs, cocktail lounges, theaters, country clubs, golf and athletic clubs, sporting events, and on hunting, fishing, vacation and similar trips, including such activity relating solely to the taxpayer or the taxpayer's family. The term
entertainment
may include an activity, the cost of which is claimed as a business expense by the taxpayer, which satisfies the personal, living, or family needs of any individual, such as providing food and beverages, a hotel suite, or an automobile to a business customer or his family. The term
entertainment
does not include activities which, although satisfying personal, living, or family needs of an individual, are clearly not regarded as constituting entertainment, such as (
a
) supper money provided by an employer to his employee working overtime, (
b
) a hotel room maintained by an employer for lodging of his employees while in business travel status, or (
c
) an automobile used in the active conduct of trade or business even though used for routine personal purposes such as commuting to and from work. On the other hand, the providing of a hotel room or an automobile by an employer to his employee who is on vacation would constitute entertainment of the employee.
(ii)
Objective test.
An objective test shall be used to determine whether an activity is of a type generally considered to constitute entertainment. Thus, if an activity is generally considered to be entertainment, it will constitute entertainment for purposes of this section and section 274(a) regardless of whether the expenditure can also be described otherwise, and even though the expenditure relates to the taxpayer alone. This objective test precludes arguments such as that
entertainment
means only entertainment of others or that an expenditure for entertainment should be characterized as an expenditure for advertising or public relations. However, in applying this test the taxpayer's trade or business shall be considered. Thus, although attending a theatrical performance would generally be considered entertainment, it would not be so considered in the case of a professional theater critic, attending in his professional capacity. Similarly, if a manufacturer of dresses conducts a fashion show to introduce his products to a group of store buyers, the show would not be generally considered to constitute entertainment. However, if an appliance distributor conducts a fashion show for the wives of his retailers, the fashion show would be generally considered to constitute entertainment.
(iii)
Special definitional rules—(a) In general.
Except as otherwise provided
in (
b
) or (
c
) of this subdivision, any expenditure which might generally be considered either for a gift or entertainment, or considered either for travel or entertainment, shall be considered an expenditure for entertainment rather than for a gift or travel.
(
b
)
Expenditures deemed gifts.
An expenditure described in (
a
) of this subdivision shall be deemed for a gift to which this section does not apply if it is:
(
1
) An expenditure for packaged food or beverages transferred directly or indirectly to another person intended for consumption at a later time.
(
2
) An expenditure for tickets of admission to a place of entertainment transferred to another person if the taxpayer does not accompany the recipient to the entertainment unless the taxpayer treats the expenditure as entertainment. The taxpayer may change his treatment of such an expenditure as either a gift or entertainment at any time within the period prescribed for assessment of tax as provided in section 6501 of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
(
3
) Such other specific classes of expenditure generally considered to be for a gift as the Commissioner, in his discretion, may prescribe.
(
c
)
Expenditures deemed travel.
An expenditure described in (
a
) of this subdivision shall be deemed for travel to which this section does not apply if it is:
(
1
) With respect to a transportation type facility (such as an automobile or an airplane), even though used on other occasions in connection with an activity of a type generally considered to constitute entertainment, to the extent the facility is used in pursuit of a trade or business for purposes of transportation not in connection with entertainment. See also paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(
b
) of this section for provisions covering nonentertainment expenditures with respect to such facilities.
(
2
) Such other specific classes of expenditure generally considered to be for travel as the Commissioner, in his discretion, may prescribe.
(2)
Other definitions
—(i)
Expenditure.
The term
expenditure
as used in this section shall include expenses paid or incurred for goods, services, facilities, and items (including items such as losses and depreciation).
(ii)
Expenses for production of income.
For purposes of this section, any reference to
trade or business
shall include any activity described in section 212.
(iii)
Business associate.
The term
business associate
as used in this section means a person with whom the taxpayer could reasonably expect to engage or deal in the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business such as the taxpayer's customer, client, supplier, employee, agent, partner, or professional adviser, whether established or prospective.
(c)
Directly related entertainment
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section (relating to associated entertainment) or under paragraph (f) of this section (relating to business meals and other specific exceptions), no deduction shall be allowed for any expenditure for entertainment unless the taxpayer establishes that the expenditure was directly related to the active conduct of his trade or business within the meaning of this paragraph.
(2)
Directly related entertainment defined.
Any expenditure for entertainment, if it is otherwise allowable as a deduction under chapter 1 of the Code, shall be considered directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business if it meets the requirements of any one of subparagraphs (3), (4), (5), or (6) of this paragraph.
(3)
Directly related in general.
Except as provided in subparagraph (7) of this paragraph, an expenditure for entertainment shall be considered directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business if it is established that it meets all of the requirements of subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this subparagraph.
(i) At the time the taxpayer made the entertainment expenditure (or committed himself to make the expenditure), the taxpayer had more than a general expectation of deriving some income or other specific trade or business benefit (other than the goodwill of the person or persons entertained) at some indefinite future time from the making of the expenditure. A taxpayer,
however, shall not be required to show that income or other business benefit actually resulted from each and every expenditure for which a deduction is claimed.
(ii) During the entertainment period to which the expenditure related, the taxpayer actively engaged in a business meeting, negotiation, discussion, or other bona fide business transaction, other than entertainment, for the purpose of obtaining such income or other specific trade or business benefit (or, at the time the taxpayer made the expenditure or committed himself to the expenditure, it was reasonable for the taxpayer to expect that he would have done so, although such was not the case solely for reasons beyond the taxpayer's control).
(iii) In light of all the facts and circumstances of the case, the principal character or aspect of the combined business and entertainment to which the expenditure related was the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business (or at the time the taxpayer made the expenditure or committed himself to the expenditure, it was reasonable for the taxpayer to expect that the active conduct of trade or business would have been the principal character or aspect of the entertainment, although such was not the case solely for reasons beyond the taxpayer's control). It is not necessary that more time be devoted to business than to entertainment to meet this requirement. The active conduct of trade or business is considered not to be the principal character or aspect of combined business and entertainment activity on hunting or fishing trips or on yachts and other pleasure boats unless the taxpayer clearly establishes to the contrary.
(iv) The expenditure was allocable to the taxpayer and a person or persons with whom the taxpayer engaged in the active conduct of trade or business during the entertainment or with whom the taxpayer establishes he would have engaged in such active conduct of trade or business if it were not for circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control. For expenditures closely connected with directly related entertainment, see paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(4)
Expenditures in clear business setting.
An expenditure for entertainment shall be considered directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business if it is established that the expenditure was for entertainment occurring in a clear business setting directly in furtherance of the taxpayer's trade or business. Generally, entertainment shall not be considered to have occurred in a clear business setting unless the taxpayer clearly establishes that any recipient of the entertainment would have reasonably known that the taxpayer had no significant motive, in incurring the expenditure, other than directly furthering his trade or business. Objective rather than subjective standards will be determinative. Thus, entertainment which occurred under any circumstances described in subparagraph (7)(ii) of this paragraph ordinarily will not be considered as occurring in a clear business setting. Such entertainment will generally be considered to be socially rather than commercially motivated. Expenditures made for the furtherance of a taxpayer's trade or business in providing a “hospitality room” at a convention (described in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(
b
) of this section) at which goodwill is created through display or discussion of the taxpayer's products, will, however, be treated as directly related. In addition, entertainment of a clear business nature which occurred under circumstances where there was no meaningful personal or social relationship between the taxpayer and the recipients of the entertainment may be considered to have occurred in a clear business setting. For example, entertainment of business representatives and civic leaders at the opening of a new hotel or theatrical production, where the clear purpose of the taxpayer is to obtain business publicity rather than to create or maintain the goodwill of the recipients of the entertainment, would generally be considered to be in a clear business setting. Also, entertainment which has the principal effect of a price rebate in connection with the sale of the taxpayer's products generally will be considered to have occurred in a clear business setting. Such would be the case, for example, if a taxpayer owning a hotel were
to provide occasional free dinners at the hotel for a customer who patronized the hotel.
(5)
Expenditures for services performed.
An expenditure shall be considered directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business if it is established that the expenditure was made directly or indirectly by the taxpayer for the benefit of an individual (other than an employee), and if such expenditure was in the nature of compensation for services rendered or was paid as a prize or award which is required to be included in gross income under section 74 and the regulations thereunder. For example, if a manufacturer of products provides a vacation trip for retailers of his products who exceed sales quotas as a prize or award which is includible in gross income, the expenditure will be considered directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business.
(6)
Club dues, etc., allocable to business meals.
An expenditure shall be considered directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business if it is established that the expenditure was with respect to a facility (as described in paragraph (e) of this section) used by the taxpayer for the furnishing of food or beverages under circumstances described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section (relating to business meals and similar expenditures), to the extent allocable to the furnishing of such food or beverages. This paragraph (c)(6) applies to club dues paid or incurred before January 1, 1987.
(7)
Expenditures generally considered not directly related.
Expenditures for entertainment, even if connected with the taxpayer's trade or business, will generally be considered not directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business, if the entertainment occurred under circumstances where there was little or no possibility of engaging in the active conduct of trade or business. The following circumstances will generally be considered circumstances where there was little or no possibility of engaging in the active conduct of a trade or business:
(i) The taxpayer was not present;
(ii) The distractions were substantial, such as:
(
a
) A meeting or discussion at night clubs, theaters, and sporting events, or during essentially social gatherings such as cocktail parties, or
(
b
) A meeting or discussion, if the taxpayer meets with a group which includes persons other than business associates, at places such as cocktail lounges, country clubs, golf and athletic clubs, or at vacation resorts.
An expenditure for entertainment in any such case is considered not to be directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business unless the taxpayer clearly establishes to the contrary.
(d)
Associated entertainment
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section (relating to business meals and other specific exceptions) and subparagraph (4) of this paragraph (relating to expenditures closely connected with directly related entertainment), any expenditure for entertainment which is not directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business will not be allowable as a deduction unless:
(i) It was associated with the active conduct of trade or business as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, and
(ii) The entertainment directly preceded or followed a substantial and bona fide business discussion as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(2)
Associated entertainment defined.
Generally, any expenditure for entertainment, if it is otherwise allowable under Chapter 1 of the Code, shall be considered associated with the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business if the taxpayer establishes that he had a clear business purpose in making the expenditure, such as to obtain new business or to encourage the continuation of an existing business relationship. However, any portion of an expenditure allocable to a person who was not closely connected with a person who engaged in the substantial and bona fide business discussion (as defined in subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph) shall not be considered associated with the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business. The portion of an expenditure allocable to the spouse of a person who engaged in the
discussion will, if it is otherwise allowable under chapter 1 of the Code, be considered associated with the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business.
(3)
Directly preceding or following a substantial and bona fide business discussion defined
—(i)
Substantial and bona fide business discussion
—(
a
)
In general.
Whether any meeting, negotiation or discussion constitutes a “substantial and bona fide business discussion” within the meaning of this section depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. It must be established, however, that the taxpayer actively engaged in a business meeting, negotiation, discussion, or other bona fide business transaction, other than entertainment, for the purpose of obtaining income or other specific trade or business benefit. In addition, it must be established that such a business meeting, negotiation, discussion, or transaction was substantial in relation to the entertainment. This requirement will be satisfied if the principal character or aspect of the combined entertainment and business activity was the active conduct of business. However, it is not necessary that more time be devoted to business than to entertainment to meet this requirement.
(
b
)
Meetings at conventions, etc.
Any meeting officially scheduled in connection with a program at a convention or similar general assembly, or at a bona fide trade or business meeting sponsored and conducted by business or professional organizations, shall be considered to constitute a substantial and bona fide business discussion within the meaning of this section provided:
(
1
)
Expenses necessary to taxpayer's attendance.
The expenses necessary to the attendance of the taxpayer at the convention, general assembly, or trade or business meeting, were ordinary and necessary within the meaning of section 162 or 212;
(
2
)
Convention program.
The organization which sponsored the convention, or trade or business meeting had scheduled a program of business activities (including committee meetings or presentation of lectures, panel discussions, display of products, or other similar activities), and that such program was the principal activity of the convention, general assembly, or trade or business meeting.
(ii)
Directly preceding or following.
Entertainment which occurs on the same day as a substantial and bona fide business discussion (as defined in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) will be considered to directly precede or follow such discussion. If the entertainment and the business discussion do not occur on the same day, the facts and circumstances of each case are to be considered, including the place, date and duration of the business discussion, whether the taxpayer or his business associates are from out of town, and, if so, the date of arrival and departure, and the reasons the entertainment did not take place on the day of the business discussion. For example, if a group of business associates comes from out of town to the taxpayer's place of business to hold a substantial business discussion, the entertainment of such business guests and their wives on the evening prior to, or on the evening of the day following, the business discussion would generally be regarded as directly preceding or following such discussion.
(4)
Expenses closely connected with directly related entertainment.
If any portion of an expenditure meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section (relating to directly related entertainment in general), the remaining portion of the expenditure, if it is otherwise allowable under Chapter 1 of the Code, shall be considered associated with the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business to the extent allocable to a person or persons closely connected with a person referred to in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section. The spouse of a person referred to in paragraph(c)(3)(iv) of this section will be considered closely connected to such a person for purposes of this subparagraph. Thus, if a taxpayer and his wife entertain a business customer and the customer's wife under circumstances where the entertainment of the customer is considered directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3) of this section) the portion of the expenditure allocable to both wives will be considered associated with the active conduct of the
taxpayer's trade or business under this subparagraph.
(e)
Expenditures paid or incurred before January 1, 1979, with respect to entertainment facilities or before January 1, 1994, with respect to clubs
—(1)
In general.
Any expenditure paid or incurred before January 1, 1979, with respect to a facility, or paid or incurred before January 1, 1994, with respect to a club, used in connection with entertainment shall not be allowed as a deduction except to the extent it meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
(2)
Facilities used in connection with entertainment
—(i)
In general.
Any item of personal or real property owned, rented, or used by a taxpayer shall (unless otherwise provided under the rules of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) be considered to constitute a facility used in connection with entertainment if it is used during the taxable year for, or in connection with, entertainment (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section). Examples of facilities which might be used for, or in connection with, entertainment include yachts, hunting lodges, fishing camps, swimming pools, tennis courts, bowling alleys, automobiles, airplanes, apartments, hotel suites, and homes in vacation resorts.
(ii)
Facilities used incidentally for entertainment.
A facility used only incidentally during a taxable year in connection with entertainment, if such use is insubstantial, will not be considered a “facility used in connection with entertainment” for purposes of this section or for purposes of the recordkeeping requirements of section 274(d). See § 1.274-5(c)(6)(iii).
(3)
Expenditures with respect to a facility used in connection with entertainment
—(i)
In general.
The phrase
expenditures with respect to a facility used in connection with entertainment
includes depreciation and operating costs, such as rent and utility charges (for example, water or electricity), expenses for the maintenance, preservation or protection of a facility (for example, repairs, painting, insurance charges), and salaries or expenses for subsistence paid to caretakers or watchmen. In addition, the phrase includes losses realized on the sale or other disposition of a facility.
(ii)
Club dues
—(
a
)
Club dues paid or incurred before January 1, 1994.
Dues or fees paid before January 1, 1994, to any social, athletic, or sporting club or organization are considered expenditures with respect to a facility used in connection with entertainment. The purposes and activities of a club or organization, and not its name, determine its character. Generally, the phrase
social, athletic, or sporting club or organization
has the same meaning for purposes of this section as that phrase had in section 4241 and the regulations thereunder, relating to the excise tax on club dues, prior to the repeal of section 4241 by section 301 of Public Law 89-44. However, for purposes of this section only, clubs operated solely to provide lunches under circumstances of a type generally considered to be conducive to business discussion, within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, will not be considered social clubs.
(
b
)
Club dues paid or incurred after December 31, 1993.
See paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section with reference to the disallowance of deductions for club dues paid or incurred after December 31, 1993.
(iii)
Expenditures not with respect to a facility.
The following expenditures shall not be considered to constitute expenditures with respect to a facility used in connection with entertainment:
(
a
)
Out of pocket expenditures.
Expenses (exclusive of operating costs and other expenses referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) incurred at the time of an entertainment activity, even though in connection with the use of facility for entertainment purposes, such as expenses for food and beverages, or expenses for catering, or expenses for gasoline and fishing bait consumed on a fishing trip;
(
b
)
Non-entertainment expenditures.
Expenses or items attributable to the use of a facility for other than entertainment purposes such as expenses for an automobile when not used for entertainment; and
(
c
)
Expenditures otherwise deductible.
Expenses allowable as a deduction without regard to their connection with a taxpayer's trade or business such as taxes, interest, and casualty losses. The provisions of this subdivision shall be applied in the case of a
taxpayer which is not an individual as if it were an individual. See also § 1.274-6.
(iv)
Cross reference.
For other rules with respect to treatment of certain expenditures for entertainment-type facilities, see § 1.274-7.
(4)
Determination of primary use
—(i)
In general.
A facility used in connection with entertainment shall be considered as used primarily for the furtherance of the taxpayer's trade or business only if it is established that the primary use of the facility during the taxable year was for purposes considered ordinary and necessary within the meaning of sections 162 and 212 and the regulations thereunder. All of the facts and circumstances of each case shall be considered in determining the primary use of a facility. Generally, it is the actual use of the facility which establishes the deductibility of expenditures with respect to the facility; not its availability for use and not the taxpayer's principal purpose in acquiring the facility. Objective rather than subjective standards will be determinative. If membership entitles the member's entire family to use of a facility, such as a country club, their use will be considered in determining whether business use of the facility exceeds personal use. The factors to be considered include the nature of each use, the frequency and duration of use for business purposes as compared with other purposes, and the amount of expenditures incurred during use for business compared with amount of expenditures incurred during use for other purposes. No single standard of comparison, or quantitative measurement, as to the significance of any such factor, however, is necessarily appropriate for all classes or types of facilities. For example, an appropriate standard for determining the primary use of a country club during a taxable year will not necessarily be appropriate for determining the primary use of an airplane. However, a taxpayer shall be deemed to have established that a facility was used primarily for the furtherance of his trade or business if he establishes such primary use in accordance with subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph. Subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph shall not preclude a taxpayer from otherwise establishing the primary use of a facility under the general provisions of this subdivision.
(ii)
Certain transportation facilities.
A taxpayer shall be deemed to have established that a facility of a type described in this subdivision was used primarily for the furtherance of his trade or business if:
(
a
)
Automobiles.
In the case of an automobile, the taxpayer establishes that more than 50 percent of mileage driven during the taxable year was in connection with travel considered to be ordinary and necessary within the meaning of section 162 or 212 and the regulations thereunder.
(
b
)
Airplanes.
In the case of an airplane, the taxpayer establishes that more than 50 percent of hours flown during the taxable year was in connection with travel considered to be ordinary and necessary within the meaning of section 162 or 212 and the regulations thereunder.
(iii)
Entertainment facilities in general.
A taxpayer shall be deemed to have established that:
(
a
) A facility used in connection with entertainment, such as a yacht or other pleasure boat, hunting lodge, fishing camp, summer home or vacation cottage, hotel suite, country club, golf club or similar social, athletic, or sporting club or organization, bowling alley, tennis court, or swimming pool, or,
(
b
) A facility for employees not falling within the scope of section 274(e) (2) or (5) was used primarily for the furtherance of his trade or business if he establishes that more than 50 percent of the total calendar days of use of the facility by, or under authority of, the taxpayer during the taxable year were days of business use. Any use of a facility (of a type described in this subdivision) during one calendar day shall be considered to constitute a “day of business use” if the primary use of the facility on such day was ordinary and necessary within the meaning of section 162 or 212 and the regulations thereunder. For the purposes of this subdivision, a facility shall be deemed to have been primarily used for such pruposes on any one calendar day if the facility was used for the conduct of a
substantial and bona fide business discussion (as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section) notwithstanding that the facility may also have been used on the same day for personal or family use by the taxpayer or any member of the taxpayer's family not involving entertainment of others by, or under the authority of, the taxpayer.
(f)
Specific exceptions to application of this section
—(1)
In general.
The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section (imposing limitations on deductions for entertainment expenses) are not applicable in the case of expenditures set forth in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. Such expenditures are deductible to the extent allowable under chapter 1 of the Code. This paragraph shall not be construed to affect the allowability or nonallowability of a deduction under section 162 or 212 and the regulations thereunder. The fact that an expenditure is not covered by a specific exception provided for in this paragraph shall not be determinative of the allowability or nonallowability of the expenditure under paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. Expenditures described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph are subject to the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) to the extent provided in § 1.274-5.

Any expenditure for food or beverages furnished to an individual under circumstances of a type generally considered conducive to business discussion (taking into account the surroundings in which furnished, the taxpayer's trade, business, or income-producing activity, and the relationship to such trade, business or activity of the persons to whom the food or beverages are furnished) is not subject to the limitations on allowability of deductions provided for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. There is no requirement that business actually be discussed for this exception to apply.
(
b
)
Surroundings.
The surroundings in which the food or beverages are furnished must be such as would provide an atmosphere where there are no substantial distractions to discussion. This exception applies primarily to expenditures for meals and beverages served during the course of a breakfast, lunch or dinner meeting of the taxpayer and his business associates at a restaurant, hotel dining room, eating club or similar place not involving distracting influences such as a floor show. This exception also applies to expenditures for beverages served apart from meals if the expenditure is incurred in surroundings similarly conducive to business discussion, such as an expenditure for beverages served during the meeting of the taxpayer and his business associates at a cocktail lounge or hotel bar not involving distracting influences such as a floor show. This exception may also apply to expenditures for meals or beverages served in the taxpayer's residence on a clear showing that the expenditure was commercially rather than socially motivated. However, this exception, generally, is not applicable to any expenditure for meals or beverages furnished in circumstances where there are major distractions not conducive to business discussion, such as at night clubs, sporting events, large cocktail parties, sizeable social gatherings, or other major distracting influences.
(
c
)
Taxpayer's trade or business and relationship of persons entertained.
The taxpayer's trade, business, or income-producing activity and the relationship of the persons to whom the food or beverages are served to such trade, business or activity must be such as will reasonably indicate that the food or beverages were furnished for the primary purpose of furthering the taxpayer's trade or business and did not primarily serve a social or personal purpose. Such a business purpose would be indicated, for example, if a salesman employed by a manufacturing supply company meets for lunch during a normal business day with a purchasing agent for a manufacturer which is a prospective customer. Such a purpose would also be indicated if a life insurance agent meets for lunch during a normal business day with a client.
(
d
)
Business programs.
Expenditures for business luncheons or dinners which are part of a business program, or banquets officially sponsored by business or professional associations, will be regarded as expenditures to which the exception of this subdivision (i) applies. In the case of such a business luncheon or dinner it is not always necessary that the taxpayer attend the luncheon or dinner himself. For example, if a dental equipment supplier purchased a table at a dental association banquet for dentists who are actual or prospective customers for his equipment, the cost of the table would not be disallowed under this section. See also paragraph (c)(4) of this section relating to expenditures made in a clear business setting.
(ii)
Food and beverages for employees.
Any expenditure by a taxpayer for food and beverages (or for use of a facility in connection therewith) furnished on the taxpayer's business premises primarily for his employees is not subject to the limitations on allowability of deductions provided for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. This exception applies not only to expenditures for food or beverages furnished in a typical company cafeteria or an executive dining room, but also to expenditures with respect to the operation of such facilities. This exception applies even though guests are occasionally served in the cafeteria or dining room.
(iii)
Certain entertainment and travel expenses treated as compensation
—(A)
In general.
Any expenditure by a taxpayer for entertainment (or for use of a facility in connection therewith) or for travel described in section 274(m)(3), if an employee is the recipient of the entertainment or travel, is not subject to the limitations on allowability of deductions provided for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section to the extent that the expenditure is treated by the taxpayer—
(
1
) On the taxpayer's income tax return as originally filed, as compensation paid to the employee; and
(
2
) As wages to the employee for purposes of withholding under chapter 24 (relating to collection of income tax at source on wages).
(B)
Expenses includible in income of persons who are not employees.
Any expenditure by a taxpayer for entertainment (or for use of a facility in connection therewith), or for travel described in section 274(m)(3), is not subject to the limitations on allowability of deductions provided for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section to the extent the expenditure is includible in gross income as compensation for services rendered, or as a prize or award under section 74, by a recipient of the expenditure who is not an employee of the taxpayer. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any amount paid or incurred by the taxpayer if such amount is required to be included (or would be so required except that the amount is less that $600) in any information return filed by such taxpayer under part III of subchapter A of chapter 61 and is not so included. See section 274(e)(9).
(C)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions this paragraph (f):

# Example.
If an employer rewards the employee (and the employee's spouse) with an expense paid vacation trip, the expense is deductible by the employer (if otherwise allowable under section 162 and the regulations thereunder) to the extent the employer treats the expenses as compensation and as wages. On the other hand, if a taxpayer owns a yacht which the taxpayer uses for the entertainment of business customers, the portion of salary paid to employee members of the crew which is allocable to use of the yacht for entertainment purposes (even though treated on the taxpayer's tax return as compensation and treated as wages for withholding tax purposes) would not come within this exception since the members of the crew were not recipients of the entertainment. If an expenditure of a type described in this subdivision properly constitutes a dividend paid to a shareholder or if it constitutes unreasonable compensation paid to an employee, nothing in this exception prevents disallowance of the expenditure to the taxpayer under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
(iv)
Reimbursed entertainment, food, or beverage expenses
—(A)
Introduction.
In the case of any expenditure for entertainment, amusement, recreation, food, or beverages made by one person in performing services for another person (whether or not the other person is an employer) under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement, the limitations on deductions in
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section and section 274(n)(1) apply either to the person who makes the expenditure or to the person who actually bears the expense, but not to both. If an expenditure of a type described in this paragraph (f)(2)(iv) properly constitutes a dividend paid to a shareholder, unreasonable compensation paid to an employee, a personal expense, or other nondeductible expense, nothing in this exception prevents disallowance of the expenditure to the taxpayer under other provisions of the Code.
(B)
Reimbursement arrangements involving employees.
In the case of an employee's expenditure for entertainment, amusement, recreation, food, or beverages in performing services as an employee under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement with a payor (the employer, its agent, or a third party), the limitations on deductions in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section and section 274(n)(1) apply—
(
1
) To the employee to the extent the employer treats the reimbursement or other payment of the expense on the employer's income tax return as originally filed as compensation paid to the employee and as wages to the employee for purposes of withholding under chapter 24 (relating to collection of income tax at source on wages); or
(
2
) To the payor to the extent the reimbursement or other payment of the expense is not treated as compensation and wages paid to the employee in the manner provided in paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section (however, see paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C) of this section if the payor receives a payment from a third party that may be treated as a reimbursement arrangement under that paragraph).
(C)
Reimbursement arrangements involving persons that are not employees.
In the case of an expense for entertainment, amusement, recreation, food, or beverages of a person who is not an employee (referred to as an independent contractor) in performing services for another person (a client or customer) under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement with the person, the limitations on deductions in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section and section 274(n)(1) apply to the party expressly identified in an agreement between the parties as subject to the limitations. If an agreement between the parties does not expressly identify the party subject to the limitations, the limitations apply—
(
1
) To the independent contractor (which may be a payor described in paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section) to the extent the independent contractor does not account to the client or customer within the meaning of section 274(d) and the associated regulations; or
(
2
) To the client or customer if the independent contractor accounts to the client or customer within the meaning of section 274(d) and the associated regulations. See also § 1.274-5.
(D)
Reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement.
The term
reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement
means—
(
1
) For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, an arrangement under which an employee receives an advance, allowance, or reimbursement from a payor (the employer, its agent, or a third party) for expenses the employee pays or incurs; and
(
2
) For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, an arrangement under which an independent contractor receives an advance, allowance, or reimbursement from a client or customer for expenses the independent contractor pays or incurs if either—
(
a
) A written agreement between the parties expressly states that the client or customer will reimburse the independent contractor for expenses that are subject to the limitations on deductions in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section and section 274(n)(1); or
(
b
) A written agreement between the parties expressly identifies the party subject to the limitations.
(E)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f)(2)(iv).

# Example 1.
(i) Y, an employee, performs services under an arrangement in which L, an employee leasing company, pays Y a per diem allowance of $10x for each day that Y performs services for L's client, C, while traveling away from home. The per diem allowance is a reimbursement of travel expenses for food and beverages that Y pays in performing services as an employee. L enters
into a written agreement with C under which C agrees to reimburse L for any substantiated reimbursements for travel expenses, including meals, that L pays to Y. The agreement does not expressly identify the party that is subject to the deduction limitations. Y performs services for C while traveling away from home for 10 days and provides L with substantiation that satisfies the requirements of section 274(d) of $100x of meal expenses incurred by Y while traveling away from home. L pays Y $100x to reimburse those expenses pursuant to their arrangement. L delivers a copy of Y's substantiation to C. C pays L $300x, which includes $200x compensation for services and $100x as reimbursement of L's payment of Y's travel expenses for meals. Neither L nor C treats the $100x paid to Y as compensation or wages.
(ii) Under paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(D)(
1
) of this section, Y and L have established a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Because the reimbursement payment is not treated as compensation and wages paid to Y, under section 274(e)(3)(A) and paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B)(
1
) of this section, Y is not subject to the section 274 deduction limitations. Instead, under paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B)(
2
) of this section, L, the payor, is subject to the section 274 deduction limitations unless L can meet the requirements of section 274(e)(3)(B) and paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C) of this section.
(iii) Because the agreement between L and C expressly states that C will reimburse L for substantiated reimbursements for travel expenses that L pays to Y, under paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(D)(
2
)(
a
) of this section, L and C have established a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C) of this section. L accounts to C for C's reimbursement in the manner required by section 274(d) by delivering to C a copy of the substantiation L received from Y. Therefore, under section 274(e)(3)(B) and paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C)(
2
) of this section, C and not L is subject to the section 274 deduction limitations.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that, under the arrangements between Y and L and between L and C, Y provides the substantiation of the expenses directly to C, and C pays the per diem directly to Y.
(ii) Under paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(D)(
1
) of this section, Y and C have established a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C) of this section. Because Y substantiates directly to C and the reimbursement payment was not treated as compensation and wages paid to Y, under section 274(e)(3)(A) and paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C)(
1
) of this section Y is not subject to the section 274 deduction limitations. Under paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C)(
2
) of this section, C, the payor, is subject to the section 274 deduction limitations.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the written agreement between L and C expressly provides that the limitations of this section will apply to C.
(ii) Under paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(D)(
2
)(
b
) of this section, L and C have established a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement for purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C) of this section. Because the agreement provides that the 274 deduction limitations apply to C, under section 274(e)(3)(B) and paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, C and not L is subject to the section 274 deduction limitations.

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that the agreement between L and C does not provide that C will reimburse L for travel expenses.
(ii) The arrangement between L and C is not a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement within the meaning of section 274(e)(3)(B) and paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(D)(
2
) of this section. Therefore, even though L accounts to C for the expenses, L is subject to the section 274 deduction limitations.
(F)
Effective/applicability date.
This paragraph (f)(2)(iv) applies to expenses paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after August 1, 2013.
(v)
Recreational expenses for employees generally.
Any expenditure by a taxpayer for a recreational, social, or similar activity (or for use of a facility in connection therewith), primarily for the benefit of his employees generally, is not subject to the limitations on allowability of deductions provided for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. This exception applies only to expenditures made primarily for the benefit of employees of the taxpayer other than employees who are officers, shareholders on other owners who own a 10-percent or greater interest in the business, or other highly compensated employees. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an employee shall be treated as owning any interest owned by a member of his family (within the meaning of section 267(c)(4) and the regulations thereunder). Ordinarily, this exception applies to usual employee benefit programs such as expenses of a taxpayer (
a
) in holding Christmas parties, annual picnics, or summer outings, for his employees generally, or (
b
) of maintaining a swimming pool, baseball diamond, bowling alley, or golf course available to his
employees generally. Any expenditure for an activity which is made under circumstances which discriminate in favor of employees who are officers, shareholders or other owners, or highly compensated employees shall not be considered made primarily for the benefit of employees generally. On the other hand, an expenditure for an activity will not be considered outside of this exception merely because, due to the large number of employees involved, the activity is intended to benefit only a limited number of such employees at one time, provided the activity does not discriminate in favor of officers, shareholders, other owners, or highly compensated employees.
(vi)
Employee, stockholder, etc., business meetings.
Any expenditure by a taxpayer for entertainment which is directly related to bona fide business meetings of the taxpayer's employees, stockholders, agents, or directors held principally for discussion of trade or business is not subject to the limitations on allowability of deductions provided for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. For purposes of this exception, a partnership is to be considered a taxpayer and a member of a partnership is to be considered an agent. For example, an expenditure by a taxpayer to furnish refreshments to his employees at a bona fide meeting, sponsored by the taxpayer for the principal purpose of instructing them with respect to a new procedure for conducting his business, would be within the provisions of this exception. A similar expenditure made at a bona fide meeting of stockholders of the taxpayer for the election of directors and discussion of corporate affairs would also be within the provisions of this exception. While this exception will apply to bona fide business meetings even though some social activities are provided, it will not apply to meetings which are primarily for social or nonbusiness purposes rather than for the transaction of the taxpayer's business. A meeting under circumstances where there was little or no possibility of engaging in the active conduct of trade or business (as described in paragraph (c)(7) of this section) generally will not be considered a business meeting for purposes of this subdivision. This exception will not apply to a meeting or convention of employees or agents, or similar meeting for directors, partners or others for the principal purpose of rewarding them for their services to the taxpayer. However, such a meeting or convention of employees might come within the scope of subdivisions (iii) or (v) of this subparagraph.
(vii)
Meetings of business leagues, etc.
Any expenditure for entertainment directly related and necessary to attendance at bona fide business meetings or conventions of organizations exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(6) of the Code, such as business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate boards, boards of trade, and certain professional associations, is not subject to the limitations on allowability of deductions provided in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
(viii)
Items available to the public.
Any expenditure by a taxpayer for entertainment (or for a facility in connection therewith) to the extent the entertainment is made available to the general public is not subject to the limitations on allowability of deductions provided for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. Expenditures for entertainment of the general public by means of television, radio, newspapers and the like, will come within this exception, as will expenditures for distributing samples to the general public. Similarly, expenditures for maintaining private parks, golf courses and similar facilities, to the extent that they are available for public use, will come within this exception. For example, if a corporation maintains a swimming pool which it makes available for a period of time each week to children participating in a local public recreational program, the portion of the expense relating to such public use of the pool will come within this exception.
(ix)
Entertainment sold to customers.
Any expenditure by a taxpayer for entertainment (or for use of a facility in connection therewith) to the extent the entertainment is sold to customers in a bona fide transaction for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth is not subject to the limitations on allowability of deductions provided for in paragraphs (a)
through (e) of this section. Thus, the cost of producing night club entertainment (such as salaries paid to employees of night clubs and amounts paid to performers) for sale to customers or the cost of operating a pleasure cruise ship as a business will come within this exception.
(g)
Additional provisions of section 274—travel of spouse, dependent or others.
Section 274(m)(3) provides that no deduction shall be allowed under this chapter (except section 217) for travel expenses paid or incurred with respect to a spouse, dependent, or other individual accompanying the taxpayer (or an officer or employee of the taxpayer) on business travel, unless certain conditions are met. As provided in section 274(m)(3), the term
other individual
does not include a business associate (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section) who otherwise meets the requirements of sections 274(m)(3)(B) and (C).
[T.D. 6659, 28 FR 6499, June 25, 1963, as amended by T.D. 6996, 34 FR 835, Jan. 18, 1969; T.D. 8051, 50 FR 36576, Sept. 9, 1985; T.D. 8601, 60 FR 36994, July 19, 1995; T.D. 8666, 61 FR 27006, May 30, 1996; T.D. 9625, 78 FR 46503, Aug. 1, 2013]
§ 1.274-3
Disallowance of deduction for gifts.
(a)
In general.
No deduction shall be allowed under section 162 or 212 for any expense for a gift made directly or indirectly by a taxpayer to any individual to the extent that such expense, when added to prior expenses of the taxpayer for gifts made to such individual during the taxpayer's taxable year, exceeds $25.
(b)
Gift defined
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph the term
gift,
for purposes of this section, means any item excludable from the gross income of the recipient under section 102 which is not excludable from his gross income under any other provision of chapter 1 of the Code. Thus, a payment by an employer to a deceased employee's widow is not a gift, for purposes of this section, to the extent the payment constitutes an employee's death benefit excludable by the recipient under section 101(b). Similarly, a scholarship which is excludable from a recipient's gross income under section 117, and a prize or award which is excludable from a recipient's gross income under section 74(b), are not subject to the provisions of this section.
(2)
Items not treated as gifts.
The term
gift,
for purposes of this section, does not include the following:
(i) An item having a cost to the taxpayer not in excess of $4.00 on which the name of the taxpayer is clearly and permanently imprinted and which is one of a number of identical items distributed generally by such a taxpayer.
(ii) A sign, display rack, or other promotional material to be used on the business premises of the recipient, or
(iii) In the case of a taxable year of a taxpayer ending on or after August 13, 1981, an item of tangible personal property which is awarded before January 1, 1987, to an employee of the taxpayer by reason of the employee's length of service (including an award upon retirement), productivity, or safety achievement, but only to the extent that—
(A) The cost of the item to the taxpayer does not exceed $400; or
(B) The item is a qualified plan award (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section); or
(iv) In the case of a taxable year of a taxpayer ending before August 13, 1981, an item of tangible personal property having a cost to the taxpayer not in excess of $100 which is awarded to an employee of the taxpayer by reason of the employee's length of service (including an award upon retirement) or safety achievement.
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) (iii) and (iv) of this section, the term
tangible personal property
does not include cash or any gift certificate other than a nonnegotiable gift certificate conferring only the right to receive tangible personal property. Thus, for example, if a nonnegotiable gift certificate entitles an employee to choose between selecting an item of merchandise or receiving cash or reducing the balance due on his account with the issuer of the gift certificate, the gift certificate is not tangible personal property for purposes of this section. To the extent that an item is not treated as a gift for purposes of this section, the deductibility of the expense of the item is not governed by this section, and the taxpayer
need not take such item into account in determining whether the $25 limitation on gifts to any individual has been exceeded. For example, if an employee receives by reason of his length of service a gift of an item of tangible personal property that costs the employer $450, the deductibility of only $50 ($450 minus $400) is governed by this section, and the employer takes the $50 into account for purposes of the $25 limitation on gifts to that employee. The fact that an item is wholly or partially excepted from the applicability of this section has no effect in determining whether the value of the item is includible in the gross income of the recipient. For rules relating to the taxability to the recipient of any item described in this subparagraph, see sections 61, 74, and 102 and the regulations thereunder. For rules relating to the deductibility of employee achievement awards awarded after December 31, 1986, see section 274 (j).
(c)
Expense for a gift.
For purposes of this section, the term
expense for a gift
means the cost of the gift to the taxpayer, other than incidental costs such as for customary engraving on jewelry, or for packaging, insurance, and mailing or other delivery. A related cost will be considered “incidental” only if it does not add substantial value to the gift. Although the cost of customary gift wrapping will be considered an incidental cost, the purchase of an ornamental basket for packaging fruit will not be considered an incidental cost of packaging if the basket has a value which is substantial in relation to the value of the fruit.
(d)
Qualified plan award
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph the term
qualified plan award,
for purposes of this section, means an item of tangible personal property that is awarded to an employee by reason of the employee's length of service (including retirement), productivity, or safety achievement, and that is awarded pursuant to a permanent, written award plan or program of the taxpayer that does not discriminate as to eligibility or benefits in favor of employees who are officers, shareholders, or highly compensated employees. The “permanency” of an award plan shall be determined from all the facts and circumstances of the particular case, including the taxpayer's ability to continue to make the awards as required by the award plan. Although the taxpayer may reserve the right to change or to terminate an award plan, the actual termination of the award plan for any reason other than business necessity within a few years after it has taken effect may be evidence that the award plan from its inception was not a “permanent” award plan. Whether or not an award plan is discriminatory shall be determined from all the facts and circumstances of the particular case. An award plan may fail to qualify because it is discriminatory in its actual operation even though the written provisions of the award plan are not discriminatory.
(2)
Items not treated as qualified plan awards.
The term
qualified plan award,
for purposes of this section, does not include an item qualifying under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the extent that the cost of the item exceeds $1,600. In addition, that term does not include any items qualifying under paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the average cost of all items (whether or not tangible personal property) awarded during the taxable year by the taxpayer under any plan described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section exceeds $400. The average cost of those items shall be computed by dividing (i) the sum of the costs for those items (including amounts in excess of the $1,600 limitation) by (ii) the total number of those items.
(e)
Gifts made indirectly to an individual
—(1)
Gift to spouse or member of family.
If a taxpayer makes a gift to the wife of a man who has a business connection with the taxpayer, the gift generally will be considered as made indirectly to the husband. However, if the wife has a bona fide business connection with the taxpayer independently of her relationship to her husband, a gift to her generally will not be considered as made indirectly to her husband unless the gift is intended for his eventual use or benefit. Thus, if a taxpayer makes a gift to a wife who is engaged with her husband in the active conduct of a partnership business, the gift to the wife will not be considered
an indirect gift to her husband unless it is intended for his eventual use or benefit. The same rules apply to gifts to any other member of the family of an individual who has a business connection with the taxpayer.
(2)
Gift to corporation or other business entity.
If a taxpayer makes a gift to a corporation or other business entity intended for the eventual personal use or benefit of an individual who is an employee, stockholder, or other owner of the corporation or business entity, the gift generally will be considered as made indirectly to such individual. Thus, if a taxpayer provides theater tickets to a closely held corporation for eventual use by any one of the stockholders of the corporation, and if such tickets are gifts, the gifts will be considered as made indirectly to the individual who eventually uses such ticket. On the other hand, a gift to a business organization of property to be used in connection with the business of the organization (for example, a technical manual) will not be considered as a gift to an individual, even though, in practice, the book will be used principally by a readily identifiable individual employee. A gift for the eventual personal use or benefit of some undesignated member of a large group of individuals generally will not be considered as made indirectly to the individual who eventually uses, or benefits from, such gifts unless, under the circumstances of the case, it is reasonably practicable for the taxpayer to ascertain the ultimate recipient of the gift. Thus, if a taxpayer provides several baseball tickets to a corporation for the eventual use by any one of a large number of employees or customers of the corporation, and if such tickets are gifts, the gifts generally will not be treated as made indirectly to the individuals who use such tickets.
(f)
Special rules
—(1)
Partnership.
In the case of a gift by a partnership, the $25 annual limitation contained in paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to the partnership as well as to each member of the partnership. Thus, in the case of a gift made by a partner with respect to the business of the partnership, the $25 limitation will be applied at the partnership level as well as at the level of the individual partner. Consequently, deductions for gifts made with respect to partnership business will not exceed $25 annually for each recipient, regardless of the number of partners.
(2)
Husband and wife.
For purposes of applying the $25 annual limitation contained in paragraph (a) of this section, a husband and wife shall be treated as one taxpayer. Thus, in the case of gifts to an individual by a husband and wife, the spouses will be treated as one donor; and they are limited to a deduction of $25 annually for each recipient. This rule applies regardless of whether the husband and wife file a joint return or whether the husband and wife make separate gifts to an individual with respect to separate businesses. Since the term
taxpayer
in paragraph (a) of this section refers only to the donor of a gift, this special rule does not apply to treat a husband and wife as one individual where each is a recipient of a gift. See paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(g)
Cross reference.
For rules with respect to whether this section or § 1.274-2 applies, see § 1.274-2(b)(1) (iii).
[T.D. 6659, 28 FR 6505, June 25, 1963, as amended by T.D. 8230, 53 FR 36451, Sept. 20, 1988]
§ 1.274-4
Disallowance of certain foreign travel expenses.
(a)
Introductory.
Section 274(c) and this section impose certain restrictions on the deductibility of travel expenses incurred in the case of an individual who, while traveling outside the United States away from home in the pursuit of trade or business (hereinafter termed “business activity”), engages in substantial personal activity not attributable to such trade or business (hereinafter termed “nonbusiness activity”). Section 274(c) and this section are limited in their application to individuals (whether or not an employee or other person traveling under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement) who engage in nonbusiness activity while traveling outside the United States away from home, and do not impose restrictions on the deductibility of travel expenses incurred by an employer or client under an advance, reimbursement, or other arrangement with the individual who
engages in nonbusiness activity. For purposes of this section, the term
United States
includes only the States and the District of Columbia, and any reference to “trade or business” or “business activity” includes any activity described in section 212. For rules governing the determination of travel outside the United States away from home, see paragraph (e) of this section. For rules governing the disallowance of travel expense to which this section applies, see paragraph (f) of this section.
(b)
Limitations on application of section.
The restrictions on deductibility of travel expenses contained in paragraph (f) of this section are applicable only if:
(1) The travel expense is otherwise deductible under section 162 or 212 and the regulations thereunder,
(2) The travel expense is for travel outside the United States away from home which exceeds 1 week (as determined under paragraph (c) of this section), and
(3) The time outside the United States away from home attributable to nonbusiness activity (as determined under paragraph (d) of this section) constitutes 25 percent or more of the total time on such travel.
(c)
Travel in excess of 1 week.
This section does not apply to an expense of travel unless the expense is for travel outside the United States away from home which exceeds 1 week. For purposes of this section, 1 week means 7 consecutive days. The day in which travel outside the United States away from home begins shall not be considered, but the day in which such travel ends shall be considered, in determining whether a taxpayer is outside the United States away from home for more than 7 consecutive days. For example, if a taxpayer departs on travel outside the United States away from home on a Wednesday morning and ends such travel the following Wednesday evening, he shall be considered as being outside the United States away from home only 7 consecutive days. In such a case, this section would not apply because the taxpayer was not outside the United States away from home for more than 7 consecutive days. However, if the taxpayer travels outside the United States away from home for more than 7 consecutive days, both the day such travel begins and the day such travel ends shall be considered a “business day” or a “nonbusiness day”, as the case may be, for purposes of determining whether nonbusiness activity constituted 25 percent or more of travel time under paragraph (d) of this section and for purposes of allocating expenses under paragraph (f) of this section. For purposes of determining whether travel is outside the United States away from home, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(d)
Nonbusiness activity constituting 25 percent or more of travel time
—(1)
In general.
This section does not apply to any expense of travel outside the United States away from home unless the portion of time outside the United States away from home attributable to nonbusiness activity constitutes 25 percent or more of the total time on such travel.
(2)
Allocation on per day basis.
The total time traveling outside the United States away from home will be allocated on a day-by-day basis to (i) days of business activity or (ii) days of nonbusiness activity (hereinafter termed “business days” or “nonbusiness days” respectively) unless the taxpayer establishes that a different method of allocation more clearly reflects the portion of time outside the United States away from home which is attributable to nonbusiness activity. For purposes of this section, a day spent outside the United States away from home shall be deemed entirely a business day even though spent only in part on business activity if the taxpayer establishes:
(i)
Transportation days.
That on such day the taxpayer was traveling to or returning from a destination outside the United States away from home in the pursuit of trade or business. However, if for purposes of engaging in nonbusiness activity, the taxpayer while traveling outside the United States away from home does not travel by a reasonably direct route, only that number of days shall be considered business days as would be required for the taxpayer, using the same mode of transportation, to travel to or return from the same destination by a reasonably direct route. Also, if, while so traveling, the taxpayer interrupts the
normal course of travel by engaging in substantial diversions for nonbusiness reasons of his own choosing, only that number of days shall be considered business days as equals the number of days required for the taxpayer, using the same mode of transportation, to travel to or return from the same destination without engaging in such diversion. For example, if a taxpayer residing in New York departs on an evening on a direct flight to Quebec for a business meeting to be held in Quebec the next morning, for purposes of determining whether nonbusiness activity constituted 25 percent or more of his travel time, the entire day of his departure shall be considered a business day. On the other hand, if a taxpayer travels by automobile from New York to Quebec to attend a business meeting and while en route spends 2 days in Ottawa and 1 day in Montreal on nonbusiness activities of his personal choice, only that number of days outside the United States shall be considered business days as would have been required for the taxpayer to drive by a reasonably direct route to Quebec, taking into account normal periods for rest and meals.
(ii)
Presence required.
That on such day his presence outside the United States away from home was required at a particular place for a specific and bona fide business purpose. For example, if a taxpayer is instructed by his employer to attend a specific business meeting, the day of the meeting shall be considered a business day even though, because of the scheduled length of the meeting, the taxpayer spends more time during normal working hours of the day on nonbusiness activity than on business activity.
(iii)
Days primarily business.
That during hours normally considered to be appropriate for business activity, his principal activity on such day was the pursuit of trade or business.
(iv)
Circumstances beyond control.
That on such day he was prevented from engaging in the conduct of trade or business as his principal activity due to circumstances beyond his control.
(v)
Weekends, holidays, etc.
That such day was a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or other reasonably necessary standby day which intervened during that course of the taxpayer's trade or business while outside the United States away from home which the taxpayer endeavored to conduct with reasonable dispatch. For example, if a taxpayer travels from New York to London to take part in business negotiations beginning on a Wednesday and concluding on the following Tuesday, the intervening Saturday and Sunday shall be considered business days whether or not business is conducted on either of such days. Similarly, if in the above case the meetings which concluded on Tuesday evening were followed by business meetings with another business group in London on the immediately succeeding Thursday and Friday, the intervening Wednesday will be deemed a business day. However, if at the conclusion of the business meetings on Friday, the taxpayer stays in London for an additional week for personal purposes, the Saturday and Sunday following the conclusion of the business meeting will not be considered business days.
(e)
Domestic travel excluded
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, travel outside the United States away from home does not include any travel from one point in the United States to another point in the United States. However, travel which is not from one point in the United States to another point in the United States shall be considered travel outside the United States. If a taxpayer travels from a place within the United States to a place outside the United States, the portion, if any, of such travel which is from one point in the United States to another point in the United States is to be disregarded for purposes of determining:
(i) Whether the taxpayer's travel outside the United States away from home exceeds 1 week (see paragraph (c) of this section),
(ii) Whether the time outside the United States away from home attributable to nonbusiness activity constitutes 25 percent or more of the total time on such travel (see paragraph (d) of this section), or
(iii) The amount of travel expense subject to the allocation rules of this
section (see paragraph (f) of this section).
(2)
Determination of travel from one point in the United States to another point in the United States.
In the case of the following means of transportation, travel from one point in the United States to another point in the United States shall be determined as follows:
(i)
Travel by public transportation.
In the case of travel by public transportation, any place in the United States at which the vehicle makes a scheduled stop for the purpose of adding or discharging passengers shall be considered a point in the United States.
(ii)
Travel by private automobile.
In the case of travel by private automobile, any such travel which is within the United States shall be considered travel from one point in the United States to another point in the United States.
(iii)
Travel by private airplane.
In the case of travel by private airplane, any flight, whether or not constituting the entire trip, where both the takeoff and the landing are within the United States shall be considered travel from one point in the United States to another point in the United States.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of subparagraph (2) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A flies from Los Angeles to Puerto Rico with a brief scheduled stopover in Miami for the purpose of adding and discharging passengers and A returns by airplane nonstop to Los Angeles. The travel from Los Angeles to Miami is considered travel from one point in the United States to another point in the United States. The travel from Miami to Puerto Rico and from Puerto Rico to Los Angeles is not considered travel from one point in the United States to another point in the United States and, thus, is considered to be travel outside the United States away from home.

# Example 2.
Taxpayer B travels by train from New York to Montreal. The travel from New York to the last place in the United States where the train is stopped for the purpose of adding or discharging passengers is considered to be travel from one point in the United States to another point in the United States.

# Example 3.
Taxpayer C travels by automobile from Tulsa to Mexico City and back. All travel in the United States is considered to be travel from one point in the United States to another point in the United States.

# Example 4.
Taxpayer D flies nonstop from Seattle to Juneau. Although the flight passes over Canada, the trip is considered to be travel from one point in the United States to another point in the United States.

# Example 5.
If in
Example 4
above, the airplane makes a scheduled landing in Vancouver, the time spent in traveling from Seattle to Juneau is considered to be travel outside the United States away from home. However, the time spent in Juneau is not considered to be travel outside the United States away from home.
(f)
Application of disallowance rules
—(1)
In general.
In the case of expense for travel outside the United States away from home by an individual to which this section applies, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (4) or (5) of this paragraph, no deduction shall be allowed for that amount of travel expense specified in subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph (whichever is applicable) which is obtained by multiplying the total of such travel expense by a fraction:
(i) The numerator of which is the number of nonbusiness days during such travel, and
(ii) The denominator of which is the total number of business days and nonbusiness days during such travel.
For determination of “business days” and “nonbusiness days”, see paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2)
Nonbusiness activity at, near, or beyond business destination.
If the place at which the individual engages in nonbusiness activity (hereinafter termed “nonbusiness destination”) is at, near, or beyond the place to which he travels in the pursuit of a trade or business (hereinafter termed “business destination”), the amount of travel expense referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be the amount of travel expense, otherwise allowable as a deduction under section 162 or section 212, which would have been incurred in traveling from the place where travel outside the United States away from home begins to the business destination, and returning. Thus, if the individual travels from New York to London on business, and then takes a vacation in Paris before returning to New York, the amount of the travel expense subject to allocation is the expense which would have been incurred in traveling from New York to London and returning.
(3)
Nonbusiness activity on the route to or from business destination.
If the nonbusiness destination is on the route to or from the business destination, the amount of the travel expense referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be the amount of travel expense, otherwise allowable as a deduction under section 162 or 212, which would have been incurred in traveling from the place where travel outside the United States away from home begins to the nonbusiness destination and returning. Thus, if the individual travels on business from Chicago to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil with a scheduled stop in New York for the purpose of adding and discharging passengers, and while en route stops in Caracas, Venezuela for a vacation and returns to Chicago from Rio de Janeiro with another scheduled stop in New York for the purpose of adding and discharging passengers, the amount of travel expense subject to allocation is the expense which would have been incurred in traveling from New York to Caracas and returning.
(4)
Other allocation method.
If a taxpayer establishes that a method other than allocation on a day-by-day basis (as determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) more clearly reflects the portion of time outside the United States away from home which is attributable to nonbusiness activity, the amount of travel expense for which no deduction shall be allowed shall be determined by such other method.
(5)
Travel expense deemed entirely allocable to business activity.
Expenses of travel shall be considered allocable in full to business activity, and no portion of such expense shall be subject to disallowance under this section, if incurred under circumstances provided for in subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph.
(i)
Lack of control over travel.
Expenses of travel otherwise deductible under section 162 or 212 shall be considered fully allocable to business activity if, considering all the facts and circumstances, the individual incurring such expenses did not have substantial control over the arranging of the business trip. A person who is required to travel to a business destination will not be considered to have substantial control over the arranging of the business trip merely because he has control over the timing of the trip. Any individual who travels on behalf of his employer under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement shall be considered not to have had substantial control over the arranging of his business trip, provided the employee is not:
(
a
) A managing executive of the employer for whom he is traveling (and for this purpose the term
managing executive
includes only an employee who, by reason of his authority and responsibility, is authorized, without effective veto procedures, to decide upon the necessity for his business trip), or
(
b
) Related to his employer within the meaning of section 267(b) but for this purpose the percentage referred to in section 267(b)(2) shall be 10 percent.
(ii)
Lack of major consideration to obtain a vacation.
Any expense of travel, which qualifies for deduction under section 162 or 212, shall be considered fully allocable to business activity if the individual incurring such expenses can establish that, considering all the facts and circumstances, he did not have a major consideration, in determining to make the trip, of obtaining a personal vacation or holiday. If such a major consideration were present, the provisions of subparagraphs (1) through (4) of this paragraph shall apply. However, if the trip were primarily personal in nature, the traveling expenses to and from the destination are not deductible even though the taxpayer engages in business activities while at such destination. See paragraph (b) of § 1.162-2.
(g)
Examples.
The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Individual A flew from New York to Paris where he conducted business for 1 day. He spent the next 2 days sightseeing in Paris and then flew back to New York. The entire trip, including 2 days for travel en route, took 5 days. Since the time outside the United States away from home during the trip did not exceed 1 week, the disallowance rules of this section do not apply.

# Example 2.
Individual B flew from Tampa to Honolulu (from one point in the United States to another point in the United States) for a business meeting which lasted 3 days and for personal matters which took 10 days.
He then flew to Melbourne, Australia where he conducted business for 2 days and went sightseeing for 1 day. Immediately thereafter he flew back to Tampa, with a scheduled landing in Honolulu for the purpose of adding and discharging passengers. Although the trip exceeded 1 week, the time spent outside the United States away from home, including 2 days for traveling from Honolulu to Melbourne and return, was 5 days. Since the time outside the United States away from home during the trip did not exceed 1 week, the disallowance rules of this section do not apply.

# Example 3.
Individual C flew from Los Angeles to New York where he spent 5 days. He then flew to Brussels where he spent 14 days on business and 5 days on personal matters. He then flew back to Los Angeles by way of New York. The entire trip, including 4 days for travel en route, took 28 days. However, the 2 days spent traveling from Los Angeles to New York and return, and the 5 days spent in New York are not considered travel outside the United States away from home and, thus, are disregarded for purposes of this section. Although the time spent outside the United States away from home exceeded 1 week, the time outside the United States away from home attributable to nonbusiness activities (5 days out of 21) was less than 25 percent of the total time outside the United States away from home during the trip. Therefore, the disallowance rules of this section do not apply.

# Example 4.
D, an employee of Y Company, who is neither a managing executive of, nor related to, Y Company within the meaning of paragraph (f)(5)(i) of this section, traveled outside the United States away from home on behalf of his employer and was reimbursed by Y for his traveling expense to and from the business destination. The trip took more than a week and D took advantage of the opportunity to enjoy a personal vacation which exceeded 25 percent of the total time on the trip. Since D, traveling under a reimbursement arrangement, is not a managing executive of, or related to, Y Company, he is not considered to have substantial control over the arranging of the business trip, and the travel expenses shall be considered fully allocable to business activity.

# Example 5.
E, a managing executive and principal shareholder of X Company, travels from New York to Stockholm, Sweden, to attend a series of business meetings. At the conclusion of the series of meetings, which last 1 week, E spends 1 week on a personal vacation in Stockholm. If E establishes either that he did not have substantial control over the arranging of the trip or that a major consideration in his determining to make the trip was not to provide an opportunity for taking a personal vacation, the entire travel expense to and from Stockholm shall be considered fully allocable to business activity.

# Example 6.
F, a self-employed professional man, flew from New York to Copenhagen, Denmark, to attend a convention sponsored by a professional society. The trip lasted 3 weeks, of which 2 weeks were spent on vacation in Europe. F generally would be regarded as having substantial control over arranging this business trip. Unless F can establish that obtaining a vacation was not a major consideration in determining to make the trip, the disallowance rules of this section apply.

# Example 7.
Taxpayer G flew from Chicago to New York where he spent 6 days on business. He then flew to London where he conducted business for 2 days. G then flew to Paris for a 5 day vacation after which he flew back to Chicago, with a scheduled landing in New York for the purpose of adding and discharging passengers. G would not have made the trip except for the business he had to conduct in London. The travel outside the United States away from home, including 2 days for travel en route, exceeded a week and the time devoted to nonbusiness activities was not less than 25 percent of the total time on such travel. The 2 days spent traveling from Chicago to New York and return, and the 6 days spent in New York are disregarded for purposes of determining whether the travel outside the United States away from home exceeded a week and whether the time devoted to nonbusiness activities was less than 25 percent of the total time outside the United States away from home. If G is unable to establish either that he did not have substantial control over the arranging of the business trip or that an opportunity for taking a personal vacation was not a major consideration in his determining to make the trip, 5/9ths (5 days devoted to nonbusiness activities out of a total 9 days outside the United States away from home on the trip) of the expenses attributable to transportation and food from New York to London and from London to New York will be disallowed (unless G establishes that a different method of allocation more clearly reflects the portion of time outside the United States away from home which is attributable to nonbusiness activity).

Documentary evidence
—(A) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B), documentary evidence, such as receipts, paid bills, or similar evidence sufficient to support an expenditure, is required for—
(
1
) Any expenditure for lodging while traveling away from home, and
(
2
) Any other expenditure of $75 or more except, for transportation charges, documentary evidence will not be required if not readily available.
(B) The Commissioner, in his or her discretion, may prescribe rules waiving the documentary evidence requirements in circumstances where it is impracticable for such documentary evidence to be required. Ordinarily, documentary evidence will be considered adequate to support an expenditure if it includes sufficient information to establish the amount, date, place, and the essential character of the expenditure. For example, a hotel receipt is sufficient to support expenditures for business travel if it contains the following: name, location, date, and separate amounts for charges such as for lodging, meals, and telephone. Similarly, a restaurant receipt is sufficient to support an expenditure for a business meal if it contains the following: name and location of the restaurant, the date and amount of the expenditure, the number of people served, and, if a charge is made for an item other than meals and beverages, an indication that such is the case. A document may be indicative of only one (or part of one) element of an expenditure. Thus, a cancelled check, together with a bill from the payee, ordinarily would establish the element of cost. In contrast, a cancelled check drawn payable to a named payee would not by itself support a business expenditure without other evidence showing that the check was used for a certain business purpose.

Definition of an adequate accounting to the employer
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (f) an
adequate accounting
means the submission to the employer of an account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheet, or similar record maintained by the employee in which the information as to each element of an expenditure or use (described in paragraph (b) of this section) is recorded at or near the time of the expenditure or use, together with supporting documentary evidence, in a manner that conforms to all the adequate records requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. An adequate accounting requires that the employee account for all amounts received from the employer during the taxable year as advances, reimbursements, or allowances (including those charged directly or indirectly to the employer through credit cards or otherwise) for travel, entertainment, gifts, and the use of listed property. The methods of substantiation allowed under paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5) of this section also will be considered to be an adequate accounting if the employer accepts an employee's substantiation and establishes that such substantiation meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5). For purposes of an adequate accounting, the method of substantiation allowed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section will not be permitted.
(ii)
Procedures for adequate accounting without documentary evidence.
The Commissioner may, in his or her discretion, prescribe rules under which an employee may make an adequate accounting to an employer by submitting an account book, log, diary, etc., alone, without submitting documentary evidence.
(iii)
Employer.
For purposes of this section, the term
employer
includes an agent of the employer or a third party
payor who pays amounts to an employee under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement.
(5) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.274-5T(f)(5).
(g)
Substantiation by reimbursement arrangements or per diem, mileage, and other traveling allowances
—(1)
In general.
The Commissioner may, in his or her discretion, prescribe rules in pronouncements of general applicability under which allowances for expenses described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section will, if in accordance with reasonable business practice, be regarded as equivalent to substantiation by adequate records or other sufficient evidence, for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, of the amount of the expenses and as satisfying, with respect to the amount of the expenses, the requirements of an adequate accounting to the employer for purposes of paragraph (f)(4) of this section. If the total allowance received exceeds the deductible expenses paid or incurred by the employee, such excess must be reported as income on the employee's return. See paragraph (j)(1) of this section relating to the substantiation of meal expenses while traveling away from home, and paragraph (j)(2) of this section relating to the substantiation of expenses for the business use of a vehicle.
(2)
Allowances for expenses described.
An allowance for expenses is described in this paragraph (g)(2) if it is a—
(i) Reimbursement arrangement covering ordinary and necessary expenses of traveling away from home (exclusive of transportation expenses to and from destination);
(ii) Per diem allowance providing for ordinary and necessary expenses of traveling away from home (exclusive of transportation costs to and from destination); or
(iii) Mileage allowance providing for ordinary and necessary expenses of local transportation and transportation to, from, and at the destination while traveling away from home.
(h) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.274-5T(h).
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Authority for optional methods of computing certain expenses
—(1)
Meal expenses while traveling away from home.
The Commissioner may establish a method under which a taxpayer may use a specified amount or amounts for meals while traveling away from home in lieu of substantiating the actual cost of meals. The taxpayer will not be relieved of the requirement to substantiate the actual cost of other travel expenses as well as the time, place, and business purpose of the travel. See paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section.
(2)
Use of mileage rates for vehicle expenses.
The Commissioner may establish a method under which a taxpayer may use mileage rates to determine the amount of the ordinary and necessary expenses of using a vehicle for local transportation and transportation to, from, and at the destination while traveling away from home in lieu of substantiating the actual costs. The method may include appropriate limitations and conditions in order to reflect more accurately vehicle expenses over the entire period of usage. The taxpayer will not be relieved of the requirement to substantiate the amount of each business use (i.e., the business mileage), or the time and business purpose of each use. See paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section.
(3)
Incidental expenses while traveling away from home.
The Commissioner may establish a method under which a taxpayer may use a specified amount or amounts for incidental expenses paid or incurred while traveling away from home in lieu of substantiating the actual cost of incidental expenses. The taxpayer will not be relieved of the requirement to substantiate the actual cost of other travel expenses as well as the time, place, and business purpose of the travel.
(k)
Exceptions for qualified nonpersonal use vehicles
—(1)
In general.
The substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and this section do not apply to any qualified nonpersonal use vehicle (as defined in paragraph (k)(2) of this section).

In general.
For purposes of section 274(d) and this section, the term
qualified nonpersonal use vehicle
means any vehicle which, by reason of its nature (that is, design), is not likely to be used more than a de minimis amount for personal purposes.
(ii)
List of vehicles.
Vehicles which are qualified nonpersonal use vehicles include the following:
(A) Clearly marked police, fire, and public safety officer vehicles (as defined and to the extent provided in paragraph (k)(3) of this section).

(Q) Tractors and other special purpose farm vehicles.
(R) Unmarked vehicles used by law enforcement officers (as defined in paragraph (k)(6) of this section) if the use is officially authorized.
(S) Such other vehicles as the Commissioner may designate.
(3)
Clearly marked police, fire, or public safety officer vehicles.
A police, fire, or public safety officer vehicle is a vehicle, owned or leased by a governmental unit, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, that is required to be used for commuting by a police officer, fire fighter, or public safety officer (as defined in section 402(l)(4)(C) of this chapter) who, when not on a regular shift, is on call at all times, provided that any personal use (other than commuting) of the vehicle outside the limit of the police officer's arrest powers or the fire fighter's or public safety officer's obligation to respond to an emergency is prohibited by such governmental unit. A police, fire, or public safety officer vehicle is clearly marked if, through painted insignia or words, it is readily apparent that the vehicle is a police, fire, or public safety officer vehicle. A marking on a license plate is not a clear marking for purposes of this paragraph (k).
(4)
Qualified moving van.
The term
qualified moving van
means any truck or van used by a professional moving company in the trade or business of moving household or business goods if—
(i) No personal use of the van is allowed other than for travel to and from a move site (or for de minimis personal use, such as a stop for lunch on the way between two move sites);
(ii) Personal use for travel to and from a move site is an irregular practice (that is, not more than five times a month on average); and
(iii) Personal use is limited to situations in which it is more convenient to the employer, because of the location of the employee's residence in relation to the location of the move site, for the van not to be returned to the employer's business location.
(5)
Qualified specialized utility repair truck.
The term
qualified specialized utility repair truck
means any truck (not including a van or pickup truck) specifically designed and used to carry heavy tools, testing equipment, or parts if—
(i) The shelves, racks, or other permanent interior construction which has been installed to carry and store such heavy items is such that it is unlikely that the truck will be used more than a de minimis amount for personal purposes; and
(ii) The employer requires the employee to drive the truck home in order to be able to respond in emergency situations for purposes of restoring or maintaining electricity, gas, telephone, water, sewer, or steam utility services.
(6)
Unmarked law enforcement vehicles
—(i)
In general.
The substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and this section do not apply to officially authorized uses of an unmarked vehicle by a “law enforcement officer”. To qualify for this exception, any personal use must be authorized by the Federal, State, county, or local governmental
agency or department that owns or leases the vehicle and employs the officer, and must be incident to law-enforcement functions, such as being able to report directly from home to a stakeout or surveillance site, or to an emergency situation. Use of an unmarked vehicle for vacation or recreation trips cannot qualify as an authorized use.
(ii)
Law enforcement officer.
The term
law enforcement officer
means an individual who is employed on a full-time basis by a governmental unit that is responsible for the prevention or investigation of crime involving injury to persons or property (including apprehension or detention of persons for such crimes), who is authorized by law to carry firearms, execute search warrants, and to make arrests (other than merely a citizen's arrest), and who regularly carries firearms (except when it is not possible to do so because of the requirements of undercover work). The term “law enforcement officer” may include an arson investigator if the investigator otherwise meets the requirements of this paragraph (k)(6)(ii), but does not include Internal Revenue Service special agents.
(7)
Trucks and vans.
The substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and this section apply generally to any pickup truck or van, unless the truck or van has been specially modified with the result that it is not likely to be used more than a de minimis amount for personal purposes. For example, a van that has only a front bench for seating, in which permanent shelving that fills most of the cargo area has been installed, that constantly carries merchandise or equipment, and that has been specially painted with advertising or the company's name, is a vehicle not likely to be used more than a de minimis amount for personal purposes.
(8)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (k)(3) and (6) of this section:

# Example 1.
Detective C, who is a “law enforcement officer” employed by a state police department, headquartered in City M, is provided with an unmarked vehicle (equipped with radio communication) for use during off-duty hours because C must be able to communicate with headquarters and be available for duty at any time (for example, to report to a surveillance or crime site). The police department generally has officially authorized personal use of the vehicle by C but has prohibited use of the vehicle for recreational purposes or for personal purposes outside the state. Thus, C's use of the vehicle for commuting between headquarters or a surveillance site and home and for personal errands is authorized personal use as described in paragraph (k)(6)(i) of this section. With respect to these authorized uses the vehicle is not subject to the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and the value of these uses is not included in C's gross income.

# Example 2.
Detective T is a “law enforcement officer” employed by City M. T is authorized to make arrests only within M's city limits. T, along with all other officers of the force, is ordinarily on duty for eight hours each work day and on call during the other sixteen hours. T is provided with the use of a clearly marked police vehicle in which T is required to commute to his home in City M. The police department's official policy regarding marked police vehicles prohibits its personal use (other than commuting) of the vehicles outside the city limits. When not using the vehicle on the job, T uses the vehicle only for commuting, personal errands on the way between work and home, and personal errands within City M. All use of the vehicle by T conforms to the requirements of paragraph (k)(3) of this section. Therefore, the value of that use is excluded from T's gross income as a working condition fringe and the vehicle is not subject to the substantiation requirements of section 274(d).

# Example 3.
Director C is employed by City M as the director of the City's rescue squad and is provided with a vehicle for use in responding to emergencies. Director C is trained in rescue activity and has the legal authority and legal responsibility to engage in rescue activity. The city's rescue squad is not a part of City M's police or fire departments. The director's vehicle is a sedan which is painted with insignia and words identifying the vehicle as being owned by the City's rescue squad. C, when not on a regular shift, is on call at all times. The City's official policy regarding clearly marked public safety officer vehicles prohibits personal use (other than for commuting) of the vehicle outside of the limits of the public safety officer's obligation to respond to an emergency. When not using the vehicle to respond to emergencies, City M authorizes C to use the vehicle only for commuting, personal errands on the way between work and home, and personal errands within the limits of C's obligation to respond to emergencies. With respect to these authorized uses, the vehicle is not subject to the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and the value of these uses is not includable in C's gross income.

# Example 4.
Coroner D is employed by County N to investigate and determine the cause, time, and manner of certain deaths occurring in the County. Coroner D also safeguards the property of the deceased, notifies the next of kin, conducts inquests, and arranges for the burial of indigent persons. D is provided with a vehicle for use by County N. The vehicle is to be used in County N business and for commuting. Personal use other than for commuting purposes is forbidden. D is trained in rescue activity but has no legal authority or legal responsibility to engage in rescue activity. D's vehicle is a sedan which is painted with insignia and words identifying it as a County N vehicle. D, when not on a regular shift, is on call at all times. D does not satisfy the criteria of a public safety officer under 28 CFR 32.3 (2008). Thus, D's vehicle cannot qualify as a clearly marked public safety officer vehicle. Accordingly, business use of the vehicle is subject to the substantiation requirements of section 274(d), and the value of any personal use of the vehicle, such as commuting, is includable in D's gross income.

This section applies to expenses paid or incurred after December 31, 1997. However, paragraph (j)(3) of this section applies to expenses paid or incurred after September 30, 2002, and paragraph (k) applies to clearly marked public safety officer vehicles, as defined in § 1.274-5(k)(3), only with respect to uses occurring after May 19, 2010.
[T.D. 8864, 65 FR 4122, Jan. 26, 2000; 65 FR 15547, Mar. 23, 2000, as amended by T.D. 9020, 67 FR 68513, Nov. 12, 2002; T.D. 9064, 68 FR 39011, July 1, 2003; T.D. 9483, 75 FR 27936, May 19, 2010]
§ 1.274-5T
Substantiation requirements (temporary).
(a)
In general.
For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1986, no deduction or credit shall be allowed with respect to—
(1) Traveling away from home (including meals and lodging),
(2) Any activity which is of a type generally considered to constitute entertainment, amusement, or recreation, or with respect to a facility used in connection with such an activity, including the items specified in section 274(e),
(3) Gifts defined in section 274(b), or
(4) Any listed property (as defined in section 280F(d)(4) and § 1.280F-6T(b)), unless the taxpayer substantiates each element of the expenditure or use (as described in paragraph (b) of this section) in the manner provided in paragraph (c) of this section. This limitation supersedes the doctrine found in
Cohan v. Commissioner,
39 F. 2d 540 (2d Cir. 1930). The decision held that, where the evidence indicated a taxpayer incurred deductible travel or entertainment expenses but the exact amount could not be determined, the court should make a close approximation and not disallow the deduction entirely. Section 274(d) contemplates that no deduction or credit shall be allowed a taxpayer on the basis of such approximations or unsupported testimony of the taxpayer. For purposes of this section, the term
entertainment
means entertainment, amusement, or recreation, and use of a facility therefor; and the term
expenditure
includes expenses and items (including items such as losses and depreciation).
(b)
Elements of an expenditure or use
—(1)
In general.
Section 274(d) and this section contemplate that no deduction or credit shall be allowed for travel, entertainment, a gift, or with respect to listed property unless the taxpayer substantiates the requisite elements of each expenditure or use as set forth in this paragraph (b).

See also § 1.274-5T(e) relating to the substantiation of business use of employer-provided listed property and § 1.274-6T for special rules for substantiating the business/investment use of certain types of listed property.
(c)
Rules of substantiation
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this section and § 1.274-6T, a taxpayer must substantiate each element of an expenditure or use (described in paragraph (b) of this section) by adequate records or by sufficient evidence corroborating his own statement. Section 274(d) contemplates that a taxpayer will maintain and produce such substantiation as will constitute proof of each expenditure or use referred to in section 274. Written evidence has considerably more probative value than oral evidence alone. In addition, the probative value of written evidence is greater the closer in time it relates to the expenditure or use. A contemporaneous log is not required, but a record of the elements of an expenditure or of a business use of listed property made at or near the time of the expenditure or use, supported by sufficient documentary evidence, has a high degree of credibility not present with respect to a statement prepared subsequent thereto when generally there is a lack of accurate recall. Thus, the corroborative evidence required to support a statement not make at or near the time of the expenditure or use must have a high degree of probative value to elevate such statement and evidence to the level of credibility reflected by a record made at or near the time of the expenditure or use supported by sufficient documentary evidence. The substantiation requirements of section 274(d) are designed to encourage taxpayers to maintain the records, together with documentary evidence, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(2)
Substantiation by adequate records
—(i)
In general.
To meet the “adequate records” requirements of section 274(d), a taxpayer shall maintain an account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheets, or similar record (as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section), and documentary evidence (as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) which, in combination, are sufficient to establish each element of an expenditure or use specified in paragraph (b) of this section. It is not necessary to record information in an account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheet, or similar record which duplicates information reflected on a receipt so long as the account book, etc. and receipt complement each other in an orderly manner.
(ii)
Account book, diary, etc.
An account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheet, or similar record must be prepared or maintained in such manner that each recording of an element of an expenditure or use is made at or near the time of the expenditure or use.
(A)
Made at or near the time of the expenditure or use.
For purposes of this section, the phrase
made at or near the time of the expenditure or use
means the element of an expenditure or use are recorded at a time when, in relation to the use or making of an expenditure, the taxpayer has full present knowledge of each element of the expenditure or use, such as the amount, time, place, and business purpose of the expenditure and business relationship. An expense account statement which is a transcription of an account book, diary, log, or similar record prepared or maintained in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) shall be considered a record prepared or maintained in the manner prescribed in the preceding sentence if such expense account statement is submitted by an employee to his employer or by an independent contractor to his client or customer in the regular course of good business practice. For example, a log maintained on a weekly basis, which accounts for use during the week, shall be considered a record made at or near the time of such use.
(B)
Substantiation of business purpose.
In order to constitute an adequate record of business purpose within the meaning of section 274(d) and this paragraph (c)(2), a written statement of business purpose generally is required. However, the degree of substantiation necessary to establish business purpose will vary depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Where the business purpose is evident from the surrounding facts and circumstances, a written explanation of such business purpose will not be required. For example, in the case of a salesman calling on customers on an established sales route, a written explanation of the
business purpose of such travel ordinarily will not be required. Similarly, in the case of a business meal described in section 274(e)(1), if the business purpose of such meal is evident from the business relationship to the taxpayer of the persons entertained and other surrounding circumstances, a written explanation of such business purpose will not be required.
(C)
Substantiation of business use of listed property
—(
1
)
Degree of substantiation.
In order to constitute an adequate record (within the meaning of section 274(d) and this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)), which substantiates business/investment use of listed property (as defined in § 1.280F-6T(d)(3)), the record must contain sufficient information as to each element of every business/investment use. However, the level of detail required in an adequate record to substantiate business/investment use may vary depending upon the facts and circumstances. For example, a taxpayer who uses a truck for both business and personal purposes and whose only business use of a truck is to make deliveries to customers on an established route may satisfy the adequate record requirement by recording the total number miles driven during the taxable year, the length of the delivery route once, and the date of each trip at or near the time of the trips. Alternatively, the taxpayer may establish the date of each trip with a receipt, record of delivery, or other documentary evidence.
(
2
)
Written record.
Generally, an adequate record must be written. However, a record of the business use of listed property, such as a computer or automobile, prepared in a computer memory device with the aid of a logging program will constitute an adequate record.
(D)
Confidential information.
If any information relating to the elements of an expenditure or use, such as place, business purpose, or business relationship, is of a confidential nature, such information need not be set forth in the account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheet, or similar record, provided such information is recorded at or near the time of the expenditure or use and is elsewhere available to the district director to substantiate such element of the expenditure or use.
(iii) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.274-5(c)(2)(iii).
(iv)
Retention of written evidence.
The Commissioner may, in his discretion, prescribe rules under which an employer may dispose of the adequate records and documentary evidence submitted to him by employees who are required to, and do, make an adequate accounting to the employer (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4) of this section) if the employer maintains adequate accounting procedures with respect to such employees (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(5) of this section.
(v)
Substantial compliance.
If a taxpayer has not fully substantiated a particular element of an expenditure or use, but the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the district director that he has substantially complied with the “adequate records” requirements of this paragraph (c)(2) with respect to the expenditure or use, the taxpayer may be permitted to establish such element by evidence which the district director shall deem adequate.
(3)
Substantiation by other sufficient evidence
—(i)
In general.
If a taxpayer fails to establish to the satisfaction of the district director that he has substantially complied with the “adequate records” requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section with respect to an element of an expenditure or use, then, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the taxpayer must establish such element—
(A) By his own statement, whether written or oral, containing specific information in detail as to such element; and
(B) By other corrobative evidence sufficient to establish such element.
If such element is the description of a gift, or the cost or amount, time, place, or date of an expenditure or use, the corrobative evidence shall be direct evidence, such as a statement in writing or the oral testimony of persons entertained or other witnesses setting forth detailed information about such element, or the documentary evidence described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If such element is either the business relationship to the taxpayer
of persons entertained, or the business purpose of an expenditure, the corrobative evidence may be circumstantial evidence.
(ii)
Sampling
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, a taxpayer may maintain an adequate record for portions of a taxable year and use that record to substantiate the business/investment use of listed property for all or a portion of the taxable year if the taxpayer can demonstrate by other evidence that the periods for which an adequate record is maintained are representative of the use for the taxable year or a portion thereof.
(B)
Exception for pooled vehicles.
The sampling method of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section may not be used to substantiate the business/investment use of an automobile or other vehicle of an employer that is made available for use by more than one employee for all or a portion of a taxable year.
(C)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate this paragraph (c)(3)(ii).

# Example 1.
A, a sole proprietor and calendar year taxpayer, operates an interior decorating business out of her home. A uses an automobile for local business travel to visit the homes or offices of clients, to meet with suppliers and other subcontractors, and to pick up and deliver certain items to clients when feasible. There is no other business use of the automobile but A and other members of her family also use the automobile for personal purposes. A maintains adequate records for the first three months of 1986 that indicate that 75 percent of the use of the automobile was in A's business. Invoices from subcontractors and paid bills indicate that A's business continued at approximately the same rate for the remainder of 1986. If other circumstances do not change (e.g., A does not obtain a second car for exclusive use in her business), the determination that the business/investment use of the automobile for the taxable year is 75 percent is based on sufficient corroborative evidence.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that A maintains adequate records during the first week of every month, which indicate that 75 percent of the use of the automobile is in A's business. The invoices from A's business indicate that A's business continued at the same rate during the subsequent weeks of each month so that A's weekly records are representative of each month's business use of the automobile. Thus, the determination that the business/investment use of the automobile for the taxable year is 75 percent is based on sufficient corroborative evidence.

# Example 3.
B, a sole proprietor and calendar year taxpayer, is a salesman in a large metropolitan area for a company that manufactures household products. For the first three weeks of each month, B uses his own automobile occasionally to travel within the metropolitan area on business. During these three weeks, B's use of the automobile for business purposes does not follow a consistent pattern from day to day or week to week. During the fourth week of each month, B delivers to his customers all the orders taken during the previous month. B's use of his automobile for business purposes, as substantiated by adequate records, is 70 percent of the total use during that fourth week. In this example, a determination based on the records maintained during that fourth week that the business/investment use of the automobile for the taxable year is 70 percent is not based on sufficient corroborative evidence because use during this week is not representative of use during other periods.
(iii)
Special rules.
See § 1.274-6T for special rules for substantiation by sufficient corroborating evidence with respect to certain listed property.
(4)
Substantiation in exceptional circumstances.
If a taxpayer establishes that, by reason of the inherent nature of the situation—
(i) He was unable to obtain evidence with respect to an element of the expenditure or use which conforms fully to the “adequate records” requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section,
(ii) He is unable to obtain evidence with respect to such element which conforms fully to the “other sufficient evidence” requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and
(iii) He has presented other evidence, with respect to such element, which possesses the highest degree of probative value possible under the circumstances, such other evidence shall be considered to satisfy the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and this paragraph.
(5)
Loss of records due to circumstances beyond control of the taxpayer.
Where the taxpayer establishes that the failure to produce adequate records is due to the loss of such records through circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control, such as destruction by fire, flood,
earthquake, or other casualty, the taxpayer shall have a right to substantiate a deduction by reasonable reconstruction of his expenditures or use.
(6)
Special rules
—(i)
Separate expenditure or use
—(A)
In general.
For the purposes of this section, each separate payment or use by the taxpayer shall ordinarily be considered to constitute a separate expenditure. However, concurrent or repetitious expenses or uses may be substantiated as a single item. To illustrate the above rules, where a taxpayer entertains a business guest at dinner and thereafter at the theater, the payment for dinner shall be considered to constitute one expenditure and the payment for the tickets for the theater shall be considered to constitute a separate expenditure. Similarly, if during a day of business travel a taxpayer makes separate payments for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, he shall be considered to have made three separate expenditures. However, if during entertainment at a cocktail lounge the taxpayer pays separately for each serving of refreshments, the total amount expended for the refreshments will be treated as a single expenditure. A tip may be treated as a separate expenditure.
(B)
Aggregation of expenditures.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheet, or similar record required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section shall be maintained with respect to each separate expenditure and not with respect to aggregate amounts for two or more expenditures. Thus, each expenditure for such items as lodging and air or rail travel shall be recorded as a separate item and not aggregated. However, at the option of the taxpayer, amounts expended for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, may be aggregated. A tip or gratuity which is related to an underlying expense may be aggregated with such expense. In addition, amounts expended in connection with the use of listed property during a taxable year, such as for gasoline or repairs for an automobile, may be aggregated. If these expenses are aggregated, the taxpayer must establish the date and amount, but need not prove the business purpose of each expenditure. Instead, the taxpayer may prorate the expenses based on the total business use of the listed property. For other provisions permitting recording of aggregate amounts in an account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheet, or similar record, see paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(3) of this section (relating to incidental costs of travel and entertainment).
(C)
Aggregation of business use.
Uses which may be considered part of a single use, for example, a round trip or uninterrupted business use, may be accounted for by a single record. For example, use of a truck to make deliveries at several different locations which begins and ends at the business premises and which may include a stop at the business premises in between two deliveries may be accounted for by a single record of miles driven. In addition, use of a passenger automobile by a salesman for a business trip away from home over a period of time may be accounted for by a single record of miles traveled. De minimis personal use (such as a stop for lunch on the way between two business stops) is not an interruption of business use.
(ii)
Allocation of expenditure.
For purposes of this section, if a taxpayer has established the amount of an expenditure, but is unable to establish the portion of such amount which is attributable to each person participating in the event giving rise to the expenditure, such amount shall ordinarily be allocated to each participant on a pro rata basis, if such determination is material. Accordingly, the total number of persons for whom a travel or entertainment expenditure is incurred must be established in order to compute the portion of the expenditure allocable to such person.
(iii)
Primary use of a facility.
Section 274(a) (1)(B) and (2)(C) deny a deduction for any expenditure paid or incurred before January 1, 1979, with respect to a facility, or paid or incurred before January 1, 1994, with respect to a club, used in connection with an entertainment activity unless the taxpayer establishes that the facility (including a club) was used primarily for the furtherance of the taxpayer's trade or business. A determination whether a facility before January 1, 1979, or a
club before January 1, 1994, was used primarily for the furtherance of the taxpayer's trade or business will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. In order to establish that a facility was used primarily for the furtherance of his trade or business, the taxpayer shall maintain records of the use of the facility, the cost of using the facility, mileage or its equivalent (if appropriate), and such other information as shall tend to establish such primary use. Such records of use shall contain—
(A) For each use of the facility claimed to be in furtherance of the taxpayer's trade or business, the elements of an expenditure specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and
(B) For each use of the facility not in furtherance of the taxpayer's trade or business, an appropriate description of such use, including cost, date, number of persons entertained, nature of entertainment and, if applicable, information such as mileage or its equivalent. A notation such as “personal use” or “family use” would, in the case of such use, be sufficient to describe the nature of entertainment.
If a taxpayer fails to maintain adequate records concerning a facility which is likely to serve the personal purposes of the taxpayer, it shall be presumed that the use of such facility was primarily personal.
(iv)
Additional information.
In a case where it is necessary to obtain additional information, either—
(A) To clarify information contained in records, statements, testimony, or documentary evidence submitted by a taxpayer under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, or
(B) To establish the reliability or accuracy of such records, statements, testimony, or documentary evidence, the district director may, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, obtain such additional information by personal interview or otherwise as he determines necessary to implement properly the provisions of section 274 and the regulations thereunder.
(7)
Specific exceptions.
Except as otherwise prescribed by the Commissioner, substantiation otherwise required by this paragraph is not required for—
(i) Expenses described in section 274(e)(2) relating to food and beverages for employees, section 274(e)(3) relating to expenses treated as compensation, section 274(e)(8) relating to items available to the public, and section 274(e)(9) relating to entertainment sold to customers, and
(ii) Expenses described in section 274(e)(5) relating to recreational, etc., expenses for employees, except that a taxpayer shall keep such records or other evidence as shall establish that such expenses were for activities (or facilities used in connection therewith) primarily for the benefit of employees other than employees who are officers, shareholders or other owners (as defined in section 274(e)(5)), or highly compensated employees.
(d)
Disclosure on returns
—(1)
In general.
The Commissioner may, in his discretion, prescribe rules under which any taxpayer claiming a deduction or credit for entertainment, gifts, travel, or with respect to listed property, or any other person receiving advances, reimbursements, or allowances for such items, shall make disclosure on his tax return with respect to such items. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section.
(2)
Business use of passenger automobiles and other vehicles.
(i) On returns for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1984, taxpayers that claim a deduction or credit with respect to any vehicle are required to answer certain questions providing information about the use of the vehicle. The information required on the tax return relates to mileage (total, business, commuting, and other personal mileage), percentage of business use, date placed in service, use of other vehicles, after-work use, whether the taxpayer has evidence to support the business use claimed on the return, and whether or not the evidence is written.
(ii) Any employer that provides the use of a vehicle to an employee must obtain information from the employee sufficient to complete the employer's tax return. Any employer that provides more than five vehicles to its employees need not include any information on its return. The employer, instead, must obtain the information from its
employees, indicate on its return that it has obtained the information, and retain the information received. Any employer—
(A) That can satisfy the requirements of § 1.274-6T(a)(2), relating to vehicles not used for personal purposes,
(B) That can satisfy the requirements of § 1.274-6T(a)(3), relating to vehicles not used for personal purposes other than commuting, or
(C) That treats all use of vehicles by employees as personal use need not obtain information with respect to those vechicles, but instead must indicate on its return that it has vehicles exempt from the requirements of this paragraph (d)(2).
(3)
Business use of other listed property.
On returns for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1984, taxpayers that claim a deduction or credit with respect to any listed property other than a vehicle (for example, a yacht, airplane, or certain computers) are required to provide the following information:
(i) The date that the property was placed in service,
(ii) The percentage of business use,
(iii) Whether evidence is available to support the percentage of business use claimed on the return, and
(iv) Whether the evidence is written.
(e)

An employee may not exclude from gross income as a working condition fringe any amount of the value of the availability of listed property provided by an employer to the employee, unless the employee substantiates for the period of availability the amount of the exclusion in accordance with the requirements of section 274(d) and either this section or § 1.274-6T.
(ii)
Vehicles treated as used entirely for personal purposes.
If an employer includes the value of the availability of a vehicle (as defined in § 1.61-21(e)(2)) in an employee's gross income without taking into account any exclusion for a working condition fringe allowable under section 132 and the regulations thereunder with respect to the vehicle, the employee must substantiate any deduction claimed under §§ 1.162-25 and 1.162-25T for the business/investment use of the vehicle in accordance with the requirements of section 274(d) and either this section or § 1.274-6T.
(2)
Employer
—(i)
In general.
An employer substantiates its business/investment use of listed property by showing either—
(A) That, based on evidence that satisfies the requirements of section 274(d) or statements submitted by employees that summarize such evidence, all or a portion of the use of the listed property is by employees in the employer's trade or business and, if any employee used the property for personal purposes, the employer included an appropriate amount in the employee's income, or
(B) In the case of a vehicle, the employer treats all use by employees as personal use and includes an appropriate amount in the employees' income.
(ii)
Reliance on employee records.
For purposes of substantiating the business/investment use of listed property that an employer provides to an employee and for purposes of the information required by paragraph (d)(2) and (3) of this section, the employer may rely on adequate records maintained by the employee or on the employee's own statement if corroborated by other sufficient evidence unless the employer knows or has reason to know that the statement, records, or other evidence are not accurate. The employer must retain a copy of the adequate records maintained by the employee or the other sufficient evidence, if available. Alternatively, the employer may rely on a statement submitted by the employee that provides sufficient information to allow the employer to determine the business/investment use of the property unless the employer knows or has reason to know that the statement is not based on adequate records or on the employee's own statement corroborated by other sufficient evidence. If the employer relies on the employee's statement, the employer must retain only a copy of the statement. The employee must retain a copy of the adequate records or other evidence.
(f)
Reporting and substantiation of expenses of certain employees for travel, entertainment, gifts, and with respect to listed property
—(1)
In general.
The purpose of this paragraph is to provide rules for reporting and substantiation of certain expenses paid or incurred by employees in connection with the performance of services as employees. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
business expenses
means ordinary and necessary expenses for travel, entertainment, gifts, or with respect to listed property which are deductible under section 162, and the regulations thereunder, to the extent not disallowed by section 262, 274(c), and 280F. Thus, the term
business expenses
does not include personal, living, or family expenses disallowed by section 262, travel expenses disallowed by section 274(c), or cost recovery deductions and credits with respect to listed property disallowed by section 280F(d)(3) because the use of such property is not for the convenience of the employer and required as a condition of employment. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2), advances, reimbursements, or allowances for such expenditures must be reported as income by the employee.
(2)
Reporting of expenses for which the employee is required to make an adequate accounting to his employer
—(i)
Reimbursements equal to expenses.
For purposes of computing tax liability, an employee need not report on his tax return business expenses for travel, transportation, entertainment, gifts, or with respect to listed property, paid or incurred by him solely for the benefit of his employer for which he is required to, and does, make an adequate accounting to his employer (as defined in paragraph (f)(4) of this section) and which are charged directly or indirectly to the employer (for example, through credit cards) or for which the employee is paid through advances, reimbursements, or otherwise, provided that the total amount of such advances, reimbursements, and charges is equal to such expenses.
(ii)
Reimbursements in excess of expenses.
In case the total of the amounts charged directly or indirectly to the employer or received from the employer as advances, reimbursements, or otherwise, exceeds the business expenses paid or incurred by the employee and the employee is required to, and does, make an adequate accounting to his employer for such expenses, the employee must include such excess (including amounts received for expenditures not deductible by him) in income.
(iii)
Expenses in excess of reimbursements.
If an employee incurs deductible business expenses on behalf of his employer which exceed the total of the amounts charged directly or indirectly to the employer and received from the employer as advances, reimbursements, or otherwise, and the employee makes an adequate accounting to his employer, the employee must be able to substantiate any deduction for such excess with such records and supporting evidence as will substantiate each element of an expenditure (described in paragraph (b) of this section) in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(3)
Reporting of expenses for which the employee is not required to make an adequate accounting to his employer.
If the employee is not required to make an adequate accounting to his employer for his business expenses or, though required, fails to make an adequate accounting for such expenses, he must submit, as a part of his tax return, the appropriate form issued by the Internal Revenue Service for claiming deductions for employee business expenses (e.g., Form 2106, Employee Business Expenses, for 1985) and provide the information requested on that form, including the information required by paragraph (d)(2) and (3) of this section if the employee's business expenses are with respect to the use of listed property. In addition, the employee must maintain such records and supporting evidence as will substantiate each element of an expenditure or use (described in paragraph (b) of this section) in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(4) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.274-5(f)(4).
(5)
Substantiation of expenditures by certain employees.
An employee who makes an adequate accounting to his employer within the meaning of this paragraph will not again be required to
substantiate such expense account information except in the following cases:
(i) An employee whose business expenses exceed the total of amounts charged to his employer and amounts received through advances, reimbursements or otherwise and who claims a deduction on his return for such excess,
(ii) An employee who is related to his employer within the meaning of section 267(b), but for this purpose the percentage referred to in section 267(b)(2) shall be 10 percent, and
(iii) Employees in cases where it is determined that the accounting procedures used by the employer for the reporting and substantiation of expenses by such employees are not adequate, or where it cannot be determined that such procedures are adequate. The district director will determine whether the employer's accounting procedures are adequate by considering the facts and circumstances of each case, including the use of proper internal controls. For example, an employer should require that an expense account be verified and approved by a reasonable person other than the person incurring such expenses. Accounting procedures will be considered inadequate to the extent that the employer does not require an adequate accounting from his employees as defined in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, or does not maintain such substantiation. To the extent an employer fails to maintain adequate accounting procedures he will thereby obligate his employees to substantiate separately their expense account information.
(g) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.274-5(g).
(h)
Reporting and substantiation of certain reimbursements of persons other than employees
—(1)
In general.
The purpose of this paragraph is to provide rules for the reporting and substantiation of certain expenses for travel, entertainment, gifts, or with respect to listed property paid or incurred by one person (hereinafter termed “independent contractor”) in connection with services performed for another person other than an employer (hereinafter termed “client or customer”) under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement with such client or customer. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
business expenses
means ordinary and necessary expenses for travel, entertainment, gifts, or with respect to listed property which are deductible under section 162, and the regulations thereunder, to the extent not disallowed by sections 262 and 274(c). Thus, the term
business expenses
does not include personal, living, or family expenses disallowed by section 262 or travel expenses disallowed by section 274(c), and reimbursements for such expenditures must be reported as income by the independent contractor. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
reimbursements
means advances, allowances, or reimbursements received by an independent contractor for travel, entertainment, gifts, or with respect to listed property in connection with the performance by him of services for his client or customer, under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement with his client or customer, and includes amounts charged directly or indirectly to the client or customer through credit card systems or otherwise. See paragraph (j) of this section relating to the substantiation of meal expenses while traveling away from home.
(2)
Substantiation by independent contractors.
An independent contractor shall substantiate, with respect to his reimbursements, each element of an expenditure (described in paragraph (b) of this section) in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section; and, to the extent he does not so substantiate, he shall include such reimbursements in income. An independent contractor shall so substantiate a reimbursement for entertainment regardless of whether he accounts (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3) of this section) for such entertainment.
(3)
Accounting to a client or customer under section 274(e)(4)(B).
Section 274(e)(4)(B) provides that section 274(a) (relating to disallowance of expenses for entertainment) shall not apply to expenditures for entertainment for which an independent contractor has been reimbursed if the independent contractor accounts to his client or customer, to the extent provided by section 274(d). For purposes of section 274(e)(4)(B), an independent contractor
shall be considered to account to his client or customer for an expense paid or incurred under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement with his client or customer if, with respect to such expense for entertainment, he submits to his client or customer adequate records or other sufficient evidence conforming to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
(4)
Substantiation by client or customer.
A client or customer shall not be required to substantiate, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, reimbursements to an independent contractor for travel and gifts, or for entertainment unless the independent contractor has accounted to him (within the meaning of section 274(e)(4)(B) and paragraph (h)(3) of this section) for such entertainment. If an independent contractor has so accounted to a client or customer for entertainment, the client or customer shall substantiate each element of the expenditure (as described in paragraph (b) of this section) in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
(i) [Reserved]
(j) [Reserved]. For further guidance,
see
§ 1.274-5(j).
(k) and (l) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.274-5(k) and (l).
(m)
Effective date.
Section 274(d), as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1984 and Public Law 99-44, and this section (except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) and (3) of this section) apply with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1985. Section 274(d) and this section apply to any deduction or credit claimed in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1985, with respect to any listed property, regardless of the taxable year in which the property was placed in service. However, except as provided in § 1.132-5(h) with respect to qualified nonpersonal use vehicles, the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and this section do not apply to the determination of an employee's working condition fringe exclusion or to the determination under § 1.162-25(b) of an employee's deduction before the date that those requirements apply, under this paragraph (m), to the employer, if the employer is taxable. Paragraph (j)(3) of this section applies to expenses paid or incurred after September 30, 2002.
[T.D. 8061, 50 FR 46014, Nov. 6, 1985, as amended by T.D. 8063, 50 FR 52312, Dec. 23, 1985; T.D. 8276, 54 FR 51027, Dec. 12, 1989; T.D. 8451, 57 FR 57669, Dec. 7, 1992; T.D. 8601, 60 FR 36995, July 19, 1995; T.D. 8715, 62 FR 13990, Mar. 25, 1997; T.D. 8864, 65 FR 4123, Jan. 26, 2000; T.D. 9020, 67 FR 68513, Nov. 12, 2002; T.D. 9020, 67 FR 72273, Dec. 4, 2002; T.D. 9064, July 1, 2003; T.D. 9483, 75 FR 27937, May 19, 2010]
§ 1.274-6
Expenditures deductible without regard to trade or business or other income producing activity.
The provisions of §§ 1.274-1 through 1.274-5, inclusive, do not apply to any deduction allowable to the taxpayer without regard to its connection with the taxpayer's trade or business or other income producing activity. Examples of such items are interest, taxes such as real property taxes, and casualty losses. Thus, if a taxpayer owned a fishing camp, the taxpayer could still deduct mortgage interest and real property taxes in full even if deductions for its use are not allowable under section 274(a) and § 1.274-2. In the case of a taxpayer which is not an individual, the provisions of this section shall be applied as if it were an individual. Thus, if a corporation sustains a casualty loss on an entertainment facility used in its trade or business, it could deduct the loss even though deductions for the use of the facility are not allowable.
[T.D. 8051, 50 FR 36576, Sept. 9, 1985]
§ 1.274-6T
Substantiation with respect to certain types of listed property for taxable years beginning after 1985 (temporary).
(a)
Written policy statements as to vehicles
—(1)
In general.
Two types of written policy statements satisfying the conditions described in paragraph (a)(2) and (3) of this section, if initiated and kept by an employer to implement a policy of no personal use, or no personal use except for commuting, of a vehicle provided by the employer, qualify as sufficient evidence corroborating the taxpayer's own statement and therefore will satisfy the employer's substantiation requirements under section 274(d). Therefore, the employee need not keep a separate set of records
for purposes of the employer's substantiation requirements under section 274(d) with respect to use of a vehicle satisfying these written policy statement rules. A written policy statement adopted by a governmental unit as to employee use of its vehicles is eligible for these exceptions to the section 274(d) substantiation rules. Thus, a resolution of a city council or a provision of state law or a state constitution would qualify as a written policy statement, as long as the conditions described in paragraph (a)(2) and (3) of this section are met.
(2)
Vehicles not used for personal purposes
—(i)
Employers.
A policy statement that prohibits personal use by an employee satisfies an employer's substantiation requirements under section 274(d) if all the following conditions are met—
(A) The vehicle is owned or leased by the employer and is provided to one or more employees for use in connection with the employer's trade or business,
(B) When the vehicle is not used in the employer's trade or business, it is kept on the employer's business premises, unless it is temporarily located elsewhere, for example, for maintenance or because of a mechanical failure,
(C) No employee using the vehicle lives at the employer's business premises,
(D) Under a written policy of the employer, neither an employee, nor any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, may use the vehicle for personal purposes, except for de minimis personal use (such as a stop for lunch between two business deliveries), and
(E) The employer reasonably believes that, except for de minimis use, neither the employee, nor any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, uses the vehicle for any personal purpose.
There must also be evidence that would enable the Commissioner to determine whether the use of the vehicle meets the preceding five conditions.
(ii)
Employees.
An employee, in lieu of substantiating the business/investment use of an employer-provided vehicle under § 1.274-5T, may treat all use of the vehicle as business/investment use if the following conditions are met—
(A) The vehicle is owned or leased by the employer and is provided to one or more employees for use in connection with the employer's trade or business,
(B) When the vehicle is not used in the employer's trade or business, it is kept on the employer's business premises, unless it is temporarily located elsewhere, for example, for maintenance or because of a mechanical failure,
(C) No employee using the vehicle lives at the employer's business premises,
(D) Under a written policy of the employer, neither the employee, nor any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, may use the vehicle for personal purposes, except for de minimis personal use (such as a stop for lunch between two business deliveries), and
(E) Except for de minimis personal use, neither the employee, nor any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, uses the vehicle for any personal purpose.
There must also be evidence that would enable the Commissioner to determine whether the use of the vehicle meets the preceding five conditions.
(3)
Vehicles not used for personal purposes other than commuting
—(i)
Employers.
A policy statement that prohibits personal use by an employee, other than commuting, satisfies an employer's substantiation requirements under section 274(d) if all the following conditions are met—
(A) The vehicle is owned or leased by the employer and is provided to one or more employees for use in connection with the employer's trade or business and is used in the employer's trade or business,
(B) For bona fide noncompensatory business reasons, the employer requires the employee to commute to and/or from work in the vehicle,
(C) The employer has established a written policy under which neither the employee, nor any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, may use the vehicle for personal purposes, other than for commuting or de minimis personal use (such as a stop for a personal errand on the way between a
business delivery and the employee's home),
(D) The employer reasonably believes that, except for de minimis personal use, neither the employee, nor any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, uses the vehicle for any personal purpose other than commuting,
(E) The employee required to use the vehicle for commuting is not a control employee (as defined in § 1.61-21(f)(5) and (6)) required to use an automobile (as defined in § 1.61-21(d)(1)(ii)), and
(F) The employer accounts for the commuting use by including in the employee's gross income the commuting value provided in § 1.61-21(f)(3) (to the extent not reimbursed by the employee).
There must be evidence that would enable the Commissioner to determine whether the use of the vehicle met the preceding six conditions.
(ii)
Employees.
An employee, in lieu of substantiating the business/investment use of an employer-provided vehicle under § 1.274-5T, may substantiate any exclusion allowed under section 132 for a working condition fringe by including in income the commuting value of the vehicle (determined by the employer pursuant to § 1.61-21(f)(3)) if all the following conditions are met:
(A) The vehicle is owned or leased by the employer and is provided to one or more employees for use in connection with the employer's trade or business and is used in the employer's trade or business,
(B) For bona fide noncompensatory business reasons, the employer requires the employee to commute to and/or from work in the vehicle,
(C) Under a written policy of the employer, neither the employee, nor any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, may use the vehicle for personal purposes, other than for commuting or de minimis personal use (such as a stop for a personal errand on the way between a business delivery and the employee's home),
(D) Except for de minimis personal use, neither the employee, nor any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, uses the vehicle for any personal purpose other than commuting,
(E) The employee required to use the vehicle for commuting is not a control employee (as defined in § 1.61-21(f)(5) and (6) required to use an automobile (as defined in § 1.61-21(d)(1)(ii)), and
(F) The employee includes in gross income the commuting value determined by the employer as provided in § 1.61-21(f)(3)(to the extent that the employee does not reimburse the employer for the commuting use).
There must also be evidence that would enable the Commissioner to determine whether the use of the vehicle met the preceding six conditions.
(b)
Vehicles used in connection with the business of farming
—(1)
In general.
If, during a taxable year or shorter period, a vehicle, not otherwise described in section 274(i), § 1.274-5T(k), or paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section, is owned or leased by an employer and used during most of a normal business day directly in connection with the business of farming (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), the employer, in lieu of substantiating the use of the vehicle as prescribed in § 1.274-5T(b)(6)(i)(B), may determine any deduction or credit with respect to the vehicle as if the business/investment use (as defined in § 1.280F-6T(d)(3)(i)) and the qualified business use (as defined in § 1.280F-6T(d)(2)) of the vehicle in the business of farming for the taxable year or shorter period were 75 percent plus that percentage, if any, attributable to an amount included in an employee's gross income. If the vehicle is also available for personal use by employees, the employer must include the value of that personal use in the gross income of the employees, allocated among them in the manner prescribed in § 1.132-5(g).
(2)
Directly in connection with the business of farming.
The phrase
directly in connection with the business of farming
means that the vehicle must be used directly in connection with the business of operating a farm (i.e., cultivating land or raising or harvesting any agricultural or horticultural commodity, or the raising, shearing, feeding, caring for, training, and management of animals) or incidental thereto (for example, trips to the feed and supply store).
(3)
Substantiation by employees.
If an employee is provided with the use of a vehicle to which this paragraph (b) applies, the employee may, in lieu of substantiating the business/investment use of the vehicle in the manner prescribed in § 1.274-5T, substantiate any exclusion allowed under section 132 for a working condition fringe as if the business/investment use of the vehicle were 75 percent, plus that percentage, if any, determined by the employer to be attributable to the use of the vehicle by individuals other than the employee, provided that the employee includes in gross income the amount determined by the employer as includible in the employee's gross income.
See
§ 1.132-5(g)(3) for examples illustrating the allocation of use of a vehicle among employees.
(c)
Vehicles treated as used entirely for personal purposes.
An employer may satisfy the substantiation requirements under section 274(d) for a taxable year or shorter period with respect to the business use of a vehicle that is provided to an employee by including the value of the availability of the vehicle during the relevant period in the employee's gross income without any exclusion for a working condition fringe with respect to the vehicle and, if required, by withholding any taxes. Under these circumstances, the employer's business/investment use of the vehicle during the relevant period is 100 percent. The employer's qualified business use of the vehicle is dependent upon the relationship of the employee to the employer (
see
§ 1.280F-6T(d)(2)).
(d)
Limitation.
If a taxpayer chooses to satisfy the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and § 1.274-5T by using one of the methods prescribed in paragraphs (a) (2) or (3), (b), or (c) of this section and files a return with the Internal Revenue Service for a taxable year consistent with such choice, the taxpayer may not later use another of these methods. Similarly, if a taxpayer chooses to satisfy the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) in the manner prescribed in § 1.274-5T and files a return with the Internal Revenue Service for a taxable year consistent with such choice, the taxpayer may not later use a method prescribed in paragraph (a) (2) or (3), (b), or (c) of this section. This rule applies to an employee for purposes of substantiating any working condition fringe exclusion as well as to an employer. For example, if an employee excludes on his federal income tax return for a taxable year 90 percent of the value of the availability of an employer-provided automobile on the basis of records that allegedly satisfy the “adequate records” requirement of § 1.274-5T(c)(2), and that requirement is not satisfied, then the employee may not satisfy the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) for the taxable year by any method prescribed in this section, but may present other corroborative evidence as prescribed in § 1.274-5T(c)(3).
(e)
Definitions
—(1)
In general.
The definitions provided in this paragraph (e) apply for purposes of section 274(d), § 1.274-5T, and this section.

§ 1.274-7
Treatment of certain expenditures with respect to entertainment-type facilities.
If deductions are disallowed under § 1.274-2 with respect to any portion of a facility, such portion shall be treated as an asset which is used for personal, living, and family purposes (and not as
an asset used in a trade or business). Thus, the basis of such a facility will be adjusted for purposes of computing depreciation deductions and determining gain or loss on the sale of such facility in the same manner as other property (for example, a residence) which is regarded as used partly for business and partly for personal purposes.

§ 1.274-9
Entertainment provided to specified individuals.
(a)
In general.
Paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(9) of section 274 provide exceptions to the disallowance of section 274(a) for expenses for entertainment, amusement, or recreation activities, or for an entertainment facility. In the case of a specified individual (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section), the exceptions of paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(9) of section 274 apply only to the extent that the expenses do not exceed the amount of the expenses treated as compensation (under section 274(e)(2)) or as income (under section 274(e)(9)) to the specified individual. The amount disallowed is reduced by any amount that the specified individual reimburses a taxpayer for the entertainment.
(b)
Specified individual defined.
(1) A specified individual is an individual who is subject to section 16(a) of the Securities Act of 1934 in relation to the taxpayer, or an individual who would be subject to section 16(a) if the taxpayer were an issuer of equity securities referred to in that section. Thus, for example, a specified individual is an officer, director, or more than 10 percent owner of a corporation taxed under subchapter C or subchapter S or a personal service corporation. A specified individual includes every individual who—
(i) Is the direct or indirect beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of any class of any registered equity (other than an exempted security);
(ii) Is a director or officer of the issuer of the security;
(iii) Would be the direct or indirect beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of any class of a registered security if the taxpayer were an issuer of equity securities; or
(iv) Is comparable to an officer or director of an issuer of equity securities.
(2) For partnership purposes, a specified individual includes any partner that holds more than a 10 percent equity interest in the partnership, or any general partner, officer, or managing partner of a partnership.
(3) For purposes of this section,
officer
has the same meaning as in 17 CFR § 240.16a-1(f).
(4) A specified individual includes a director or officer of a tax-exempt entity.
(5) A specified individual of a taxpayer includes a specified individual of a party related to the taxpayer within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b).
(c)
Specified individual treated as recipient of entertainment provided to others.
For purposes of section 274(a), a specified individual is treated as the recipient of entertainment provided to another individual because of the relationship of the other individual to the specified individual if the entertainment is a fringe benefit to the specified individual under section 61(a)(1) (without regard to any exclusions from gross income). Thus, expenses allocable to entertainment provided to the other individual are attributed to the specified individual for purposes of determining the amount of disallowed expenses.
(d)
Entertainment use of aircraft by specified individuals.
For rules relating to entertainment use of aircraft by specified individuals, see § 1.274-10.
(e)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning after August 1, 2012.

§ 1.274-10
Special rules for aircraft used for entertainment.
(a)
Use of an aircraft for entertainment
—(1)
In general.
Section 274(a) disallows a deduction for certain expenses
for entertainment, amusement, or recreation activities, or for an entertainment facility. Under section 274(a) and this section, no deduction otherwise allowable under chapter 1 is allowed for expenses for the use of a taxpayer-provided aircraft for entertainment, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
In general.
Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to deductions for expenses for business entertainment air travel or to deductions for expenses that meet the exceptions of section 274(e), § 1.274-2(f), and this section. Section 274(e)(2) and (e)(9) provides certain exceptions to the disallowance of section 274(a) for expenses for goods, services, and facilities for entertainment, recreation, or amusement.
(ii)
Expenses treated as compensation
—(A)
Employees who are not specified individuals.
Section 274(a), § 1.274-2(a) through (d), and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in accordance with section 274(e)(2)(A), do not apply to expenses for entertainment air travel provided to an employee who is not a specified individual to the extent that a taxpayer—
(
1
) Properly treats the expenses relating to the recipient of entertainment as compensation to an employee under chapter 1 and as wages to the employee for purposes of chapter 24; and
(
2
) Treats the proper amount as compensation to the employee under § 1.61-21.
(B)
Persons who are not employees and are not specified individuals.
Section 274(a), § 1.274-2(a) through (d), and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in accordance with section 274(e)(9), do not apply to expenses for entertainment air travel provided to a person who is not an employee and is not a specified individual to the extent that the expenses are includible in the income of that person. This exception does not apply to any amount paid or incurred by the taxpayer that is required to be included in any information return filed by the taxpayer under part III of subchapter A of chapter 61 and is not so included.
(C)
Specified individuals.
Section 274(a), § 1.274-2(a) through (d), and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in accordance with section 274(e)(2)(B), do not apply to expenses for entertainment air travel of a specified individual to the extent that the amount of the expenses do not exceed the sum of—
(
1
) The amount treated as compensation to or included in the income of the specified individual in the manner specified under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A)(1) of this section (if the specified individual is an employee) or under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section (if the specified individual is not an employee); and
(
2
) Any amount the specified individual reimburses the taxpayer.
(iii)
Travel on regularly scheduled commercial airlines.
Section 274(a), § 1.274-2(a) through (d), and paragraph (a)(1) of this section do not apply to expenses for entertainment air travel that a taxpayer that is a commercial passenger airline provides to specified individuals of the taxpayer on the taxpayer's regularly scheduled flights on which at least 90 percent of the seats are available for sale to the public to the extent the expenses are includible in the income of the recipient of the entertainment in the manner specified under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A)(1) of this section (if the specified individual is an employee) or under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section (if the specified individual is not an employee).
(b)
Definitions.
The definitions in this paragraph (b) apply for purposes of this section.
(1)
Entertainment.
For the definition of
entertainment
for purposes of this section, see § 1.274-2(b)(1). Entertainment does not include personal travel that is not for entertainment purposes. For example, travel to attend a family member's funeral is not entertainment.
(2)
Entertainment air travel. Entertainment air travel
is any travel aboard a taxpayer-provided aircraft for entertainment purposes.
(3)
Business entertainment air travel. Business entertainment air travel
is any entertainment air travel aboard a taxpayer-provided aircraft that is directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business or related to an expenditure directly preceding or following a substantial and bona fide business discussion and associated with
the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business. See § 1.274-2(a)(1)(i) and (ii). Air travel is not business entertainment air travel merely because a taxpayer-provided aircraft is used for the travel as a result of a bona fide security concern under § 1.132-5(m).
(4)
Taxpayer-provided aircraft.
A
taxpayer-provided aircraft
is any aircraft owned by, leased to, or chartered to, a taxpayer or any party related to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)).
(5)
Specified individual.
For rules relating to the definition of a specified individual, see § 1.274-9.
(c)
Amount disallowed.
Except as otherwise provided, the amount disallowed under this section for an entertainment flight by a specified individual is the amount of expenses allocable to the entertainment flight of the specified individual under paragraph (e)(2), (e)(3), or (f)(3) of this section, reduced (but not below zero) by the amount the taxpayer treats as compensation or reports as income under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C)(1) of this section to the specified individual, plus any amount the specified individual reimburses the taxpayer.
(d)
Expenses subject to disallowance under this section
—(1)
Definition of expenses.
In determining the amount of expenses subject to disallowance under this section, a taxpayer must include all of the expenses of operating the aircraft, including all fixed and variable expenses the taxpayer deducts in the taxable year. These expenses include, but are not limited to, salaries for pilots, maintenance personnel, and other personnel assigned to the aircraft; meal and lodging expenses of flight personnel; take-off and landing fees; costs for maintenance flights; costs of on-board refreshments, amenities and gifts; hangar fees (at home or away); management fees; costs of fuel, tires, maintenance, insurance, registration, certificate of title, inspection, and depreciation; interest on debt secured by or properly allocated (within the meaning of § 1.163-8T) to an aircraft; and all costs paid or incurred for aircraft leased or chartered to the taxpayer.
(2)
Leases or charters to third parties.
Expenses allocable to a lease or charter of a taxpayer's aircraft to an unrelated (as determined under section 267(b) or 707(b)) third-party in a bona-fide business transaction for adequate and full consideration are excluded from the definition of expenses in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Only expenses allocable to the lease or charter period are excluded under this paragraph (d)(2).
(3)
Straight-line method permitted for determining depreciation disallowance under this section
—(i)
In general.
In lieu of the amount of depreciation deducted in the taxable year, solely for purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a taxpayer may elect to treat as its depreciation deduction the amount that would result from using the straight-line method of depreciation over the class life (as defined by section 168(i)(1) and using the applicable convention under section 168(d)) of an aircraft, even if the taxpayer uses a different methodology to calculate depreciation for the aircraft under other sections of the Internal Revenue Code (for example, section 168). If the property qualifies for the additional first-year depreciation deduction provided by, for example, section 168(k), 168(n), 1400L(b), or 1400N(d), depreciation for purposes of this straight-line election is determined on the unadjusted depreciable basis (as defined in § 1.168(b)-1(a)(3)) of the property. However, the amount of depreciation disallowed as a result of this paragraph (d)(3) for any taxable year cannot exceed a taxpayer's allowable depreciation for that taxable year. For purposes of this section, a taxpayer that elects to use the straight-line method and class life under this paragraph (d)(3) for any aircraft it operates must use that methodology for all depreciable aircraft it operates and must continue to use the methodology for the entire period the taxpayer uses any depreciable aircraft.
(ii)
Aircraft placed in service in earlier taxable years.
The amount of depreciation for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3) for aircraft placed in service in taxable years before the taxable year of the election is determined by applying the straight-line method of depreciation to the unadjusted depreciable basis (or, for property acquired in an exchange to which section 1031 applies, the basis of the aircraft as determined
under section 1031(d)) and over the class life (using the applicable convention under section 168(d)) of the aircraft as though the taxpayer used that methodology from the year the aircraft was placed in service.
(iii)
Manner of making and revoking election.
A taxpayer makes the election under this paragraph (d)(3) by filing an income tax return for the taxable year that determines the taxpayer's expenses for purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section by computing depreciation under this paragraph (d)(3). A taxpayer may revoke an election only for compelling circumstances upon consent of the Commissioner by private letter ruling.
(4)
Aggregation of aircraft
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer may aggregate the expenses of aircraft of similar cost profiles for purposes of calculating disallowed expenses under paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii)
Similar cost profiles.
Aircraft are of similar cost profiles if their operating costs per mile or per hour of flight are comparable. Aircraft must have the same engine type (jet or propeller) and the same number of engines to have similar cost profiles. Other factors to be considered in determining whether aircraft have similar cost profiles include, but are not limited to, maximum take-off weight, payload, passenger capacity, fuel consumption rate, age, maintenance costs, and depreciable basis.
(5)
Authority for establishing safe harbors for determining expenses.
The Commissioner may establish in published guidance, see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter, one or more safe harbor methods under which a taxpayer may determine the amount of expenses paid or incurred for entertainment flights.
(e)
Allocation of expenses
—(1)
General rule.
For purposes of determining the expenses allocated to entertainment air travel of a specified individual under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, a taxpayer must use either the occupied seat hours or miles method of paragraph (e)(2) of this section or the flight-by-flight method of paragraph (e)(3) of this section. A taxpayer must use the chosen method for all flights of all aircraft for the taxable year.
(2)
Occupied seat hours or miles method
—(i)
In general.
The occupied seat hours or miles method determines the amount of expenses allocated to a particular entertainment flight of a specified individual based on the occupied seat hours or miles for an aircraft for the taxable year. Under this method, a taxpayer may choose to use either occupied seat hours or miles for the taxable year to determine the amount of expenses allocated to entertainment flights of specified individuals, but must use occupied seat hours or miles consistently for all flights of all aircraft for the taxable year.
(ii)
Computation under the occupied seat hours or miles method.
The amount of expenses allocated to an entertainment flight taken by a specified individual is computed under the occupied seat hours or miles method by determining—
(A) The total expenses for the year under paragraph (d) of this section for the aircraft or group of aircraft (if aggregated under paragraph (d)(4) of this section), as applicable;
(B) The number of occupied seat hours or miles for the taxable year for the aircraft or group of aircraft by totaling the occupied seat hours or miles of all flights in the taxable year flown by the aircraft or group of aircraft, as applicable. The occupied seat hours or miles for a flight is the number of hours or miles flown for the flight multiplied by the number of seats occupied on that flight. For example, a flight of 6 hours with three passengers results in 18 occupied seat hours;
(C) The cost per occupied seat hour or mile for the aircraft or group of aircraft, as applicable, by dividing the total expenses under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section by the total number of occupied seat hours or miles under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section; and
(D) The amount of expenses allocated to an entertainment flight taken by a specified individual by multiplying the number of hours or miles of the flight by the cost per occupied hour or mile for that aircraft or group of aircraft, as applicable, as determined under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.
(iii)
Allocation of expenses of multi-leg trips involving both business and entertainment legs.
A taxpayer that uses the occupied seat hours or miles allocation method must allocate the expenses of a trip by a specified individual that involves at least one segment for business and one segment for entertainment between the business travel and the entertainment travel unless none of the expenses for the entertainment segment are disallowed. The entertainment cost of a multi-leg trip is the total cost of the flights (by occupied seat hours or miles) minus the cost of the flights that would have been taken without the entertainment segment or segments.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (e)(2):

# Example 1.
(i) A taxpayer-provided aircraft is used for Flights 1, 2, and 3, of 5 hours, 5 hours, and 4 hours, respectively, during the Taxpayer's taxable year. Each flight carries four passengers. On Flight 1, none of the passengers is a specified individual. On Flight 2, passengers A and B are specified individuals traveling for entertainment purposes and passengers C and D are not specified individuals. For Flight 2, Taxpayer treats $1,200 as compensation to A, and B reimburses Taxpayer $500. On Flight 3, all four passengers (A, B, E, and F) are specified individuals traveling for entertainment purposes. For Flight 3, Taxpayer treats $1,300 each as compensation to A, B, E, and F. Taxpayer incurs $56,000 in expenses for the operation of the aircraft for the taxable year. The aircraft is operated for 56 occupied seat hours for the period (four passengers times 5 hours (20 occupied seat hours) for Flight 1, plus four passengers times 5 hours (20 occupied seat hours) for Flight 2, plus four passengers times 4 hours (16 occupied seat hours) for Flight 3. The cost per occupied seat hour is $1,000 ($56,000/56 hours).
(ii) For purposes of determining the amount disallowed (to the extent not treated as compensation or reimbursed) for entertainment provided to specified individuals, $5,000 ($1,000 × 5 hours) each is allocable to A and B for Flight 2, and $4,000 ($1,000 × 4 hours) each is allocable to A, B, E, and F for Flight 3.
(iii) For Flight 2, because Taxpayer treats $1,200 as compensation to A, and B reimburses Taxpayer $500, Taxpayer may deduct $1,700 of the cost of Flight 2 allocable to A and B. The deduction for the remaining $8,300 cost allocable to entertainment provided to A and B on Flight 2 is disallowed (for A, $5,000 less the $1,200 treated as compensation, and for B, $5,000 less the $500 reimbursed).
(iv) For Flight 3, because Taxpayer treats $1,300 each as compensation to A, B, E, and F, Taxpayer may deduct $5,200 of the cost of Flight 3. The deduction for the remaining $10,800 cost allocable to entertainment provided to A, B, E, and F on Flight 3 is disallowed ($4,000 less the $1,300 treated as compensation to each specified individual).

# Example 2.
(i) G, a specified individual, is the sole passenger on an aircraft that makes three flights. First, G travels on a two-hour flight from City A to City B for business purposes. G then travels on a three-hour flight from City B to City C for entertainment purposes, and returns from City C to City A on a four-hour flight. G's flights have resulted in nine occupied seat hours (two for the first segment, plus three for the second segment, plus four for the third segment). If G had returned directly to City A from City B, the flights would have resulted in four occupied seat hours.
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, five occupied seat hours are allocable to G's entertainment (nine total occupied seat hours minus the four occupied seat hours that would have resulted if the travel had been a roundtrip business trip without the entertainment segment). If Taxpayer's cost per occupied seat hour for the year is $1,000, $5,000 is allocated to G's entertainment use of the aircraft ($1,000 × five occupied seat hours). The amount disallowed is $5,000 minus the total of any amount the Taxpayer treats as compensation to G plus any amount that G reimburses Taxpayer.
(3)
Flight-by-flight method
—(i)
In general.
The flight-by-flight method determines the amount of expenses allocated to a particular entertainment flight of a specified individual on a flight-by-flight basis by allocating expenses to individual flights and then to a specified individual traveling for entertainment purposes on that flight.
(ii)
Allocation of expenses.
A taxpayer using the flight-by-flight method must combine all expenses (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) for the taxable year for the aircraft or group of aircraft (if aggregated under paragraph (d)(4) of this section), as applicable, and divide the total amount of expenses by the number of flight hours or miles for the taxable year for that aircraft or group of aircraft, as applicable, to determine the cost per hour or mile. Expenses are allocated to each flight by multiplying the number of miles for the flight by the cost per mile or the number of hours for the flight by the
cost per hour. The expenses for the flight then are allocated to the passengers on the flight per capita. Thus, if five passengers are traveling on a flight, and the total expense allocated to the flight is $10,000, the expense allocable to each passenger is $2,000.
(f)
Special rules
—(1)
Determination of basis.
(i) If any deduction for depreciation is disallowed under this section, the rules of § 1.274-7 apply. In that case, the basis of an aircraft is not reduced for the amount of depreciation disallowed under this section.
(ii) The provisions of this paragraph (f)(1) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) B Co. is a calendar-year taxpayer that owns an aircraft not used in commercial or contract carrying of passengers or freight. The aircraft is placed in service on July 1 of Year 1 and has an unadjusted depreciable basis of $1,000,000. The class life of the aircraft for depreciation purposes is 6 years. For determining depreciation under section 168, B Co. uses the optional depreciation table that corresponds with the general depreciation system, the 200 percent declining balance method of depreciation, a 5-year recovery period, and the half-year convention. For determining the depreciation disallowance for each year under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, B Co. elects to use the straight-line method of depreciation and the class life of 6 years and, therefore, uses the optional depreciation table for purposes of section 168 that corresponds with the straight-line method of depreciation, a recovery period of 6 years, and the half-year convention. In each year, the aircraft entertainment use subject to disallowance under this section is 10 percent of the total use.
(ii) B Co. calculates the depreciation and basis of the aircraft as follows:
200 Percent declining

(iii) In Year 7, there is no further deduction for depreciation of the aircraft, therefore, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, no depreciation expense is disallowed. Under § 1.274-7 and this paragraph (f)(1), basis is not reduced for disallowed depreciation. Therefore, at the end of Year 7, the basis of the aircraft for purposes of § 1.274-7 is $91,670, which is the total amount of disallowed depreciation in Years 1 through 6. B Co.'s deductions for depreciation total $908,330, which added to $91,670 equals $1,000,000.

(iii) In Year 7, there is no further deduction for depreciation of the aircraft, therefore, under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, no depreciation expense is disallowed. Under § 1.274-7 and this paragraph (f)(1), basis is not reduced for disallowed depreciation. Therefore, at the end of Year 7, the basis of the aircraft for purposes of § 1.274-7 is $118,670, which is the total amount of disallowed depreciation in Years 1 through 6. B Co.'s deductions for depreciation total $881,330, which added to $118,670 equals $1,000,000.
(2)
Pro rata disallowance.
(i) The amount of disallowed expenses, and any amounts reimbursed or treated as compensation, under this section are applied on a pro rata basis to all of the categories of expenses subject to disallowance under this section.
(ii) The provisions of this paragraph (f)(2) are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) C Co. owns an aircraft that it uses for business and other purposes. The expenses of operating the aircraft in the current year total $1,000,000. This amount includes $250,000 for depreciation (25 percent of total expenses).
(ii) In the same year, the aircraft entertainment use subject to disallowance under this section is 20 percent of the total use and C Co. treats $80,000 as compensation to specified individuals. Thus, the amount of the disallowance under this section is $120,000 ($1,000,000 × 20 percent ($200,000) less $80,000).
(iii) Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, C Co. may calculate the amount by which a category of expense, such as depreciation, is disallowed by multiplying the total disallowance of $120,000 by the ratio of the amount of the expense to total expenses. Thus, $30,000 of the $120,000 total disallowed expenses is depreciation ($250,000/$1,000,000 (25 percent) × $120,000).
(iv) The result is the same if C Co. separately calculates the amount of depreciation in total disallowed expenses and in the amount treated as compensation and nets the result. Depreciation is 25 percent of total expenses, thus, the amount of depreciation in disallowed expenses is $50,000 (25 percent × $200,000 total disallowed expenses) and the amount of depreciation treated as compensation is $20,000 (25 percent × $80,000). Disallowed depreciation is $50,000 less $20,000, or $30,000.
(3)
Deadhead flights.
(i) For purposes of this section, an aircraft returning without passengers after discharging passengers or flying without passengers to pick up passengers (deadheading) is treated as having the same number and character of passengers as the leg of the trip on which passengers are aboard for purposes of allocating expenses under paragraphs (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section. For example, when an aircraft travels from point A to point B and then back to point A, and one of the legs is a deadhead flight, for determination of disallowed expenses, the aircraft is treated as having made both legs of the trip with the same passengers aboard for the same purposes.
(ii) When a deadhead flight does not occur within a roundtrip flight, but occurs between two unrelated flights involving more than two destinations (such as an occupied flight from point A to point B, followed by a deadhead flight from point B to point C, and then an occupied flight from point C to point A), the allocation of passengers and expenses to the deadhead flight occurring between the two occupied trips must be based solely on the number of passengers on board for the two occupied legs of the flight, the character of the travel of the passengers on board (entertainment or nonentertainment) and the length in hours or miles of the two occupied legs of the flight.
(iii) The provisions of this paragraph (f)(3) are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) Aircraft flies from City A to City B, a 6-hour trip, with 12 passengers aboard. Eight of the passengers are traveling for business and four of the passengers are specified individuals traveling for entertainment purposes. The aircraft flies empty (deadheads) from City B to City C, a 4-hour trip. At City C it picks up 12 passengers, six of whom are traveling for business and six of whom are specified individuals traveling for entertainment purposes, for a 2-hour trip to City A. The taxpayer uses the occupied seat hour method of allocating expenses.
(ii) The two legs of the trip on which the aircraft is occupied comprise 96 occupied seat hours (12 passengers × 6 hours (72) for the first leg plus 12 passengers × 2 hours (24) for the third leg). Sixty occupied seat hours are for business (8 passengers × 6 hours (48) for the first leg plus 6 passengers × 2 (12) hours for the third leg) and 36 occupied seat hours are for entertainment purposes (4 passengers × 6 hours (24) for the first leg plus 6 passengers × 2 (12) hours for the third leg). Dividing the 36 occupied seat entertainment hours by 96 total occupied seat hours, 37.5 percent of the total occupied seat hours of the two occupied flights are for entertainment.
(iii) The 4-hour deadhead leg comprises one-third of the total flight time of 12 hours. Therefore, the deadhead flight is deemed to have provided one-third of the total 96 occupied seat hours, or 32 occupied seat hours (96 ×
1/3
= 32). Of the 32 deemed occupied seat hours, 37.5 percent, or 12 deemed occupied seat hours, are treated as entertainment under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. The 32 deemed occupied seat hours for the deadhead flight are included in the calculation under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section and expenses are allocated under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(D) of this section to the 12 deemed occupied seat hours treated as entertainment.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as for
Example 1,
but the taxpayer uses the flight-by-flight method of allocation.
(ii) Of the 24 passengers on the occupied flights, 10 passengers, or 41.7 percent, are traveling for entertainment purposes. If the annual cost per flight hour calculated under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section is $1,000, $4,000 is allocated to the 4-hour deadhead leg. Under paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section, 41.7 percent of the $4,000, or $1,667, is treated as an expense for entertainment. The calculation of the cost per mile or hour for the year under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section includes the expenses and number of miles or hours flown for the deadhead leg.
(g)
Effective/applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning after August 1, 2012.
[T.D. 9597, 77 FR 45483, Aug. 1, 2012]
§ 1.274-11
Disallowance of deductions for certain entertainment, amusement, or recreation expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 2017.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in this section, no deduction otherwise allowable under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) is allowed for any expenditure with respect to an activity that is of a type generally considered to be entertainment, or with respect to a facility used in connection with an entertainment activity. For this purpose, dues or fees to any social, athletic, or sporting club or organization are treated as items with respect to facilities and, thus, are not deductible. In addition, no deduction otherwise allowable under chapter 1 of the Code is allowed for amounts paid or incurred for membership in any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purpose.
(b)
Definitions
—(1)
Entertainment
—(i)
In general.
For section 274 purposes, the term
entertainment
means any activity which is of a type generally considered to constitute entertainment, amusement, or recreation, such as entertaining at bars, theaters, country clubs, golf and athletic clubs, sporting events, and on hunting, fishing, vacation and similar trips, including such activity relating solely to the taxpayer or the taxpayer's family. These activities are treated as entertainment under this section, subject to the objective test, regardless of whether the expenditure for the activity is related to or associated with the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business. The term
entertainment
may include an activity, the cost of which otherwise is a business expense of the taxpayer, which satisfies the personal, living, or family needs of any individual, such as providing a hotel suite or an automobile to a business customer or the customer's family. The term
entertainment
does not include activities which, although satisfying personal, living, or family needs of an individual, are clearly not regarded as constituting
entertainment, such as the providing of a hotel room maintained by an employer for lodging of employees while in business travel status or an automobile used in the active conduct of a trade or business even though used for routine personal purposes such as commuting to and from work. On the other hand, the providing of a hotel room or an automobile by an employer to an employee who is on vacation would constitute entertainment of the employee.
(ii)
Food or beverages.
Under this section, the term
entertainment
does not include food or beverages unless the food or beverages are provided at or during an entertainment activity. Food or beverages provided at or during an entertainment activity generally are treated as part of the entertainment activity. However, in the case of food or beverages provided at or during an entertainment activity, the food or beverages are not considered entertainment if the food or beverages are purchased separately from the entertainment, or the cost of the food or beverages is stated separately from the cost of the entertainment on one or more bills, invoices, or receipts. The amount charged for food or beverages on a bill, invoice, or receipt must reflect the venue's usual selling cost for those items if they were to be purchased separately from the entertainment or must approximate the reasonable value of those items. If the food or beverages are not purchased separately from the entertainment, or the cost of the food or beverages is not stated separately from the cost of the entertainment on one or more bills, invoices, or receipts, no allocation between entertainment and food or beverage expenses may be made and, except as further provided in this section and section 274(e), the entire amount is a nondeductible entertainment expenditure under this section and section 274(a).
(iii)
Objective test.
An objective test is used to determine whether an activity is of a type generally considered to be entertainment. Thus, if an activity is generally considered to be entertainment, it will be treated as entertainment for purposes of this section and section 274(a) regardless of whether the expenditure can also be described otherwise, and even though the expenditure relates to the taxpayer alone. This objective test precludes arguments that
entertainment
means only entertainment of others or that an expenditure for entertainment should be characterized as an expenditure for advertising or public relations. However, in applying this test the taxpayer's trade or business is considered. Thus, although attending a theatrical performance generally would be considered entertainment, it would not be so considered in the case of a professional theater critic attending in a professional capacity. Similarly, if a manufacturer of dresses conducts a fashion show to introduce its products to a group of store buyers, the show generally would not be considered entertainment. However, if an appliance distributor conducts a fashion show, the fashion show generally would be considered to be entertainment.
(2)
Expenditure.
The term
expenditure
as used in this section includes amounts paid or incurred for goods, services, facilities, and other items, including items such as losses and depreciation.
(3)
Expenditures for production of income.
For purposes of this section, any reference to
trade or business
includes an activity described in section 212.
(c)
Exceptions.
Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to any expenditure described in section 274(e)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), or (9).
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. In each example, assume that the taxpayer is engaged in a trade or business for purposes of section 162 and that neither the taxpayer nor any business associate is engaged in a trade or business that relates to the entertainment activity. Also assume that none of the exceptions under section 274(e) and paragraph (c) of this section apply.
(1)
Example 1.
Taxpayer A invites, B, a business associate, to a baseball game to discuss a proposed business deal. A purchases tickets for A and B to attend the game. The baseball game is entertainment as defined in § 1.274-11(b)(1) and thus, the cost of the game tickets is an entertainment expenditure and is not deductible by A.
(2)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(1) of this section (
Example 1),
except that A also buys hot dogs and drinks for A and B from a concession stand. The cost of the hot dogs and drinks, which are purchased separately from the game tickets, is not an entertainment expenditure and is not subject to the disallowance under § 1.274-11(a) and section 274(a)(1). Therefore, A may deduct 50 percent of the expenses associated with the hot dogs and drinks purchased at the game if the expenses meet the requirements of section 162 and § 1.274-12.
(3)
Example 3.
Taxpayer C invites D, a business associate, to a basketball game. C purchases tickets for C and D to attend the game in a suite, where they have access to food and beverages. The cost of the basketball game tickets, as stated on the invoice, includes the food or beverages. The basketball game is entertainment as defined in § 1.274-11(b)(1), and, thus, the cost of the game tickets is an entertainment expenditure and is not deductible by C. The cost of the food and beverages, which are not purchased separately from the game tickets, is not stated separately on the invoice. Thus, the cost of the food and beverages is an entertainment expenditure that is subject to disallowance under section 274(a)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section, and C may not deduct the cost of the tickets or the food and beverages associated with the basketball game.
(4)
Example 4.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (d)(3) of this section (
Example 3
), except that the invoice for the basketball game tickets separately states the cost of the food and beverages and reflects the venue's usual selling price if purchased separately. As in paragraph (d)(3) of this section (
Example 3
), the basketball game is entertainment as defined in § 1.274-11(b)(1), and, thus, the cost of the game tickets, other than the cost of the food and beverages, is an entertainment expenditure and is not deductible by C. However, the cost of the food and beverages, which is stated separately on the invoice for the game tickets and reflects the venue's usual selling price of the food and beverages if purchased separately, is not an entertainment expenditure and is not subject to the disallowance under section 274(a)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section. Therefore, C may deduct 50 percent of the expenses associated with the food and beverages provided at the game if the expenses meet the requirements of section 162 and § 1.274-12.
(e)
Applicability date.
This section applies for taxable years that begin on or after October 9, 2020.
[T.D. 9925, 85 FR 64033, Oct. 9, 2020]

(ii) The taxpayer, or an employee of the taxpayer, is present at the furnishing of such food or beverages; and
(iii) The food or beverages are provided to the taxpayer or a business associate.
(2)
Only 50 percent of food or beverage expenses allowed as deduction.
Except as provided in this section, the amount allowable as a deduction for any food or beverage expense described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may not exceed 50 percent of the amount of the expense that otherwise would be allowable.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (a)(1) and (2) of this section. In each example, assume that the food or beverage expenses are ordinary and necessary expenses under section 162(a) that are paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on a trade or business and are not lavish or extravagant under the circumstances. Also assume that none of the exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section apply.
(i)
Example 1.
Taxpayer A takes client B out to lunch. Under section 274(k) and (n) and paragraph (a) of this section, A may deduct 50 percent of the food or beverage expenses.
(ii)
Example 2.
Taxpayer C takes employee D out to lunch. Under section 274(k) and (n) and paragraph (a) of this
section, C may deduct 50 percent of the food or beverage expenses.
(iii)
Example 3.
Taxpayer E holds a business meeting at a hotel during which food and beverages are provided to attendees. Expenses for the business meeting, other than the cost of food and beverages, are not subject to the deduction limitations in section 274 and are deductible if they meet the requirements for deduction under section 162. Under section 274(k) and (n) and paragraph (a) of this section, E may deduct 50 percent of the food and beverage expenses.
(iv)
Example 4.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section (Example 3), except that all the attendees of the meeting are employees of E. Expenses for the business meeting, other than the cost of food and beverages, are not subject to the deduction limitations in section 274 and are deductible if they meet the requirements for deduction under section 162. Under section 274(k) and (n) and paragraph (a) of this section, E may deduct 50 percent of the food and beverage expenses. The exception in section 274(e)(5) does not apply to food and beverage expenses under section 274(k) and (n).
(4)
Special rules for travel meals.
(i)
In general.
Food or beverage expenses paid or incurred while traveling away from home in pursuit of a trade or business generally are subject to the deduction limitations in section 274(k) and (n) and paragraph (a)(1) and (2) of this section, as well as the substantiation requirements in section 274(d). In addition, travel expenses generally are subject to the limitations in section 274(m)(1), (2), and (3).
(ii)
Substantiation.
Except as provided in this section, no deduction is allowed for the expense of any food or beverages paid or incurred while traveling away from home in pursuit of a trade or business unless the taxpayer meets the substantiation requirements in section 274(d).
(iii)
Travel meal expenses of spouse, dependent or others.
No deduction is allowed under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), except under section 217 for certain members of the Armed Forces of the United States, for the expense of any food or beverages paid or incurred with respect to a spouse, dependent, or other individual accompanying the taxpayer, or an officer or employee of the taxpayer, on business travel, unless—
(A) The spouse, dependent, or other individual is an employee of the taxpayer;
(B) The travel of the spouse, dependent, or other individual is for a bona fide business purpose of the taxpayer; and
(C) The expenses would otherwise be deductible by the spouse, dependent or other individual.
(D)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section:
(
1
)
Example.
Taxpayer F, a sole proprietor, and Taxpayer F's spouse travel from New York to Boston to attend a series of business meetings related to F's trade or business. F's spouse is not an employee of F, does not travel to Boston for a bona fide business purpose of F, and the expenses would not otherwise be deductible. While in Boston, F and F's spouse go out to dinner. Under section 274(m)(3) and paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, the expenses associated with the food and beverages consumed by F's spouse are not deductible. Therefore, the cost of F's spouse's dinner is not deductible. F may deduct 50 percent of the expense associated with the food and beverages F consumed while on business travel if F meets the requirements in sections 162 and 274, including section 274(k) and (d).

(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
Expenses treated as compensation
—(A)
Expenses includible in income of persons who are employees and are not specified individuals.
In accordance with section 274(e)(2)(A), and except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of this section, an expense paid or incurred by a taxpayer for food or beverages, if an employee who is not a specified individual is the recipient of the food or beverages, is not subject to the deduction limitations in paragraph (a) of this section to the extent that the taxpayer—
(
1
) Properly treats the expense relating to the recipient of food or beverages as compensation to an employee under chapter 1 and as wages to the employee for purposes of chapter 24 of the Code (chapter 24).; and
(
2
) Treats the proper amount as compensation to the employee under § 1.61-21.
(B)
Expenses includible in income of persons who are not employees and are not specified individuals.
In accordance with section 274(e)(9), and except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of this section, an expense paid or incurred by a taxpayer for food or beverages is not subject to the deduction limitations in paragraph (a) of this section to the extent that the expenses are properly included in income as compensation for services rendered by, or as a prize or award under section 74 to, a recipient of the expense who is not an employee of the taxpayer and is not a specified individual. The preceding sentence does not apply to any amount paid or incurred by the taxpayer if the amount is required to be included, or would be so required except that the amount is less than $600, in any information return filed by such taxpayer under part III of subchapter A of chapter 61 of the Code and is not so included.
(C)
Specified Individuals.
In accordance with section 274(e)(2)(B), in the case of a specified individual (as defined in section 274(e)(2)(B)(ii)), the deduction limitations in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to an expense for food or beverages of the specified individual to the extent that the amount of the expense does not exceed the sum of—
(
1
) The amount treated as compensation to the specified individual under chapter 1 and as wages to the specified individual for purposes of chapter 24 (if the specified individual is an employee) or as compensation for services rendered by, or as a prize or award under section 74 to, a recipient of the expense (if the specified individual is not an employee); and
(
2
) Any amount the specified individual reimburses the taxpayer.
(D)
Expenses for which an amount is excluded from income or is less than the proper amount.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, in the case of an expense paid or incurred by a taxpayer for food or beverages for which an amount is wholly or partially excluded from a recipients' income under any section of subtitle A of the Code (other than because the amount is reimbursed by the recipient), or for which an amount included in compensation and wages to an employee (or as income to a nonemployee) is less than the amount required to be included under § 1.61-21, the deduction limitations in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to the extent that the amount of the expense does not exceed the sum of—
(
1
) The amount treated as compensation to the employee under chapter 1 (or as income to a nonemployee) and as wages to the employee for purposes of chapter 24; and
(
2
) Any amount the recipient reimburses the taxpayer.
(E)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. In each example, assume that the food or beverage expenses are ordinary and necessary expenses under section 162(a) that are paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on a trade or business.
(
1
)
Example 1.
Employer G provides food and beverages to its non-specified individual employees without charge at a company cafeteria on its premises. The food and beverages do not meet the definition of a
de minimis
fringe under section 132(e). Thus, G treats the full fair market value of the food and beverage expenses as compensation and wages, and properly determines this amount under § 1.61-21. Under section 274(e)(2) and paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the expenses associated with the food and beverages provided to the employees are not subject to the 50 percent deduction limitation in paragraph (a) of this section. Thus, G may deduct 100 percent of the food and beverage expenses.
(
2
)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(E)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1),
except that each employee pays $8 per day for the food and beverages. The fair market value of the food and beverages is $10 per day, per employee. G incurs $9 per day, per employee for the food and beverages. G treats the food and beverage expenses as compensation and wages, and properly determines the amount of the inclusion under § 1.61-21 to be $2 per day, per employee ($10 fair market value−$8 reimbursed by the employee = $2).
Therefore, under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, G may deduct 100 percent of the food and beverage expenses, or $9 per day, per employee.
(
3
)
Example 3.
Employer H provides meals to its employees without charge. The meals are properly excluded from the employees' income under section 119 as meals provided for the convenience of the employer. Under § 1.61-21(b)(1), an employee must include in gross income the amount by which the fair market value of a fringe benefit exceeds the sum of the amount, if any, paid for the benefit by or on behalf of the recipient, and the amount, if any, specifically excluded from gross income by some other section of subtitle A of the Code. Because the entire value of the employees' meals is excluded from the employees' income under section 119, the fair market value of the fringe benefit does not exceed the amount excluded from gross income under subtitle A of the Code, so there is nothing to be included in the employees' income under § 1.61-21. Thus, the exception in section 274(e)(2) and paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section does not apply and, assuming no other exceptions provided under section 274(n)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply, H may deduct only 50 percent of the expenses for the food and beverages provided to employees. In addition, the limitations in section 274(k)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply because none of the exceptions in section 274(k)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply.
(ii)
Reimbursed food or beverage expenses
—(A)
In general.
In accordance with section 274(e)(3), in the case of expenses for food or beverages paid or incurred by one person in connection with the performance of services for another person, whether or not the other person is an employer, under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement, the deduction limitations in paragraph (a) of this section apply either to the person who makes the expenditure or to the person who actually bears the expense, but not to both. If an expense of a type described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section properly constitutes a dividend paid to a shareholder, unreasonable compensation paid to an employee, a personal expense, or other nondeductible expense, nothing in this exception prevents disallowance of the deduction to the taxpayer under other provisions of the Code.
(B)
Reimbursement arrangements involving employees.
In the case of expenses paid or incurred by an employee for food or beverages in performing services as an employee under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement with a payor, the limitations on deductions in paragraph (a) of this section apply—
(
1
) To the employee to the extent the employer treats the reimbursement or other payment of the expense on the employer's income tax return as originally filed as compensation paid to the employee and as wages to the employee for purposes of withholding under chapter 24 relating to collection of income tax at source on wages; or
(
2
) To the payor to the extent the reimbursement or other payment of the expense is not treated as compensation and wages paid to the employee in the manner provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section. However, see paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section if the payor receives a payment from a third party that may be treated as a reimbursement arrangement under that paragraph.
(C)
Reimbursement arrangements involving persons that are not employees.
In the case of expenses for food or beverages paid or incurred by an independent contractor in connection with the performance of services for a client or customer under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement with the independent contractor, the limitations on deductions in paragraph (a) of this section apply to the party expressly identified in an agreement between the parties as subject to the limitations. If an agreement between the parties does not expressly identify the party subject to the limitations, then the deduction limitations in paragraph (a) of this section apply—
(
1
) To the independent contractor (which may be a payor) to the extent the independent contractor does not account to the client or customer within the meaning of section 274(d); or
(
2
) To the client or customer if the independent contractor accounts to the
client or customer within the meaning of section 274(d).
(D)
Section 274(d) substantiation.
If the reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement involves persons who are not employees and the agreement between the parties does not expressly identify the party subject to the limitations on deductions in paragraph (a) of this section, the limitations on deductions in paragraph (a) of this section apply to the independent contractor unless the independent contractor accounts to the client or customer with substantiation that satisfies the requirements of section 274(d).
(E)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(
1
)
Example 1.
(
i
) Employee I performs services under an arrangement in which J, an employee leasing company, pays I a per diem allowance of $10x for each day that I performs services for J's client, K, while traveling away from home. The per diem allowance is a reimbursement of travel expenses for food or beverages that I pays in performing services as an employee. J enters into a written agreement with K under which K agrees to reimburse J for any substantiated reimbursements for travel expenses, including meal expenses, that J pays to I. The agreement does not expressly identify the party that is subject to the limitations on deductions in paragraph (a) of this section. I performs services for K while traveling away from home for 10 days and provides J with substantiation that satisfies the requirements of section 274(d) of $100x of meal expenses incurred by I while traveling away from home. J pays I $100x to reimburse those expenses pursuant to their arrangement. J delivers a copy of I's substantiation to K. K pays J $300x, which includes $200x compensation for services and $100x as reimbursement of J's payment of I's travel expenses for meals. Neither J nor K treats the $100x paid to I as compensation or wages.
(
ii
) Under paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section, I and J have established a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. Because the reimbursement payment is not treated as compensation and wages paid to I, under section 274(e)(3)(A) and paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section, I is not subject to the limitations on deductions in paragraph (a) of this section. Instead, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section, J, the payor, is subject to limitations on deductions in paragraph (a) of this section unless J can meet the requirements of section 274(e)(3)(B) and paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.
(
iii
) Because the agreement between J and K expressly states that K will reimburse J for substantiated reimbursements for travel expenses that J pays to I, under paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(A) of this section, J and K have established a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. J accounts to K for K's reimbursement in the manner required by section 274(d) by delivering to K a copy of the substantiation J received from I. Therefore, under section 274(e)(3)(B) and paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section, K and not J is subject to the deduction limitations in paragraph (a) of this section.
(
2
)
Example 2.
(
i
) The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1)
except that, under the arrangements between I and J and between J and K, I provides the substantiation of the expenses directly to K, and K pays the per diem directly to I.
(
ii
) Under paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section, I and K have established a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. Because I substantiates directly to K and the reimbursement payment was not treated as compensation and wages paid to I, under section 274(e)(3)(A) and paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
1
) of this section, I is not subject to the limitations on deductions in paragraph (a) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section, K, the payor, is subject to the limitations on deductions in paragraph (a) of this section.
(
3
)
Example 3.
(
i
) The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(E)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1),
except that the written agreement between J and K expressly provides that the limitations of this section will apply to K.
(
ii
) Under paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(B) of this section, J and K have established a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section. Because the agreement provides that the 274 deduction limitations apply to K, under section 274(e)(3)(B) and paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, K and not J is subject to the limitations on deductions in paragraph (a) of this section.

Example 4.
(
i
) The facts are the same as in (c)(2)(ii)(E)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1),
except that the agreement between J and K does not provide that K will reimburse J for travel expenses.
(
ii
) The arrangement between J and K is not a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement within the meaning of section 274(e)(3)(B) and paragraph (b)(7)(ii) of this section. Therefore, even though J accounts to K for the expenses, J is subject to the limitations on deductions in paragraph (a) of this section.
(iii)
Recreational expenses for employees
—(A)
In general.
In accordance with section 274(e)(4), any food or beverage expense paid or incurred by a taxpayer for a recreational, social, or similar activity, primarily for the benefit of a taxpayer's employees (other than employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q))) is not subject to the deduction limitations in paragraph (a) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), an employee owning less than a 10-percent interest in the taxpayer's trade or business is not considered a shareholder or other owner, and for such purposes an employee is treated as owning any interest owned by a member of the employee's family (within the meaning of section 267(c)(4)). Any expense for food or beverages that is made under circumstances which discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees is not considered to be made primarily for the benefit of employees generally. An expense for food or beverages is not to be considered outside of the exception of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) merely because, due to the large number of employees involved, the provision of food or beverages is intended to benefit only a limited number of employees at one time, provided the provision of food or beverages does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. This exception applies to expenses paid or incurred for events such as holiday parties, annual picnics, or summer outings. This exception does not apply to expenses for meals the value of which is excluded from employees' income under section 119 because the meals are provided for the convenience of the employer and are therefore not primarily for the benefit of the taxpayer's employees.
(B)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii). In each example, assume that the food or beverage expenses are ordinary and necessary expenses under section 162(a) that are paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on a trade or business.
(
1
)
Example 1.
Employer L invites all employees to a holiday party in a hotel ballroom that includes a buffet dinner and an open bar. Under section 274(e)(4), this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), and § 1.274-11(c), the cost of the party, including food and beverage expenses, is not subject to the deduction limitations in paragraph (a) of this section because the holiday party is a recreational, social, or similar activity primarily for the benefit of non-highly compensated employees. Thus, L may deduct 100 percent of the cost of the party.
(
2
)
Example 2.
The facts are the same as in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this section (
Example 1),
except that Employer L invites only highly-compensated employees to the holiday party, and the invoice provided by the hotel lists the costs for food and beverages separately from the cost of the rental of the ballroom. The costs reflect the venue's usual selling price for food or beverages. The exception in this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) does not apply to the rental of the ballroom or the food and beverage expenses because L invited only highly-compensated employees to the holiday party. However, under § 1.274-11(b)(1)(ii), the food and beverage expenses are not treated as entertainment. Therefore, L is not subject to the full disallowance for its separately stated food and beverage expense under section 274(a)(1) and § 1.274-
11(a). Unless another exception in section 274(n)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies, L may deduct only 50 percent of the food and beverage costs under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In addition, the limitations in section 274(k)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply because none of the exceptions in section 274(k)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply.
(
3
)
Example 3.
Employer M provides free coffee, soda, bottled water, chips, donuts, and other snacks in a break room available to all employees. A break room is not a recreational, social, or similar activity primarily for the benefit of the employees, even if some socializing related to the food and beverages provided occurs. Thus, the exception in section 274(e)(4) and this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) does not apply and unless another exception in section 274(n)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies, M may deduct only 50 percent of the expenses for food and beverages provided in the break room under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In addition, the limitations in section 274(k)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply because none of the exceptions in section 274(k)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply.
(
4
)
Example 4.
Employer N has a written policy that employees in a certain medical services-related position must be available for emergency calls due to the nature of the position that requires frequent emergency responses. Because these emergencies can and do occur during meal periods, N furnishes food and beverages to employees in this position without charge in a cafeteria on N's premises. N excludes food and beverage expenses from the employees' income as meals provided for the convenience of the employer excludable under section 119. Because these food and beverages are furnished for the employer's convenience, and therefore are not primarily for the benefit of the employees, the exception in section 274(e)(4) and this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) does not apply, even if some socializing related to the food and beverages provided occurs. Further, the exception in section 274(e)(2) and paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section does not apply. Thus, unless another exception in section 274(n)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies, N may deduct only 50 percent of the expenses for food and beverages provided to employees in the cafeteria under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. In addition, the limitations in section 274(k)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply because none of the exceptions in section 274(k)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply.
(
5
)
Example 5.
Employer O invites an employee and a client to dinner at a restaurant. Because it is the birthday of the employee, O orders a special dessert in celebration. Because the meal is a business meal, and therefore not primarily for the benefit of the employee, the exception in section 274(e)(4) and this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) does not apply, even though an employee social activity in the form of a birthday celebration occurred during the meal. Thus, unless another exception in section 274(n)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies, O may deduct only 50 percent of the meal expense. In addition, the limitations in section 274(k)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply because none of the exceptions in section 274(k)(2) and paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply.
(iv)
Items available to the public
—(A)
In general.
In accordance with section 274(e)(7), any expense paid or incurred by a taxpayer for food or beverages to the extent the food or beverages are made available to the general public is not subject to the deduction limitations in paragraph (a) of this section. If a taxpayer provides food or beverages to employees, this exception applies to the entire amount of expenses for those food or beverages if the same type of food or beverages is provided to, and are primarily consumed by, the general public.
(B)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv). In each example, assume that the food and beverage expenses are ordinary and necessary expenses under section 162(a) that are paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on a trade or business.
(
1
)
Example 1.
Employer P is a real estate agent and provides refreshments at an open house for a home available for sale to the public. The refreshments are consumed by P's employees, potential buyers of the property, and other
real estate agents. Under section 274(e)(7) and this paragraph (c)(2)(iv), the expenses associated with the refreshments are not subject to the deduction limitations in paragraph (a) of this section if P determines that over 50 percent of the food and beverages are actually or reasonably estimated to be consumed by potential buyers and other real estate agents. If more than 50 percent of the food and beverages are not actually or reasonably estimated to be consumed by the general public, only the costs attributable to the food and beverages provided to the general public are excepted under section 274(e)(7) and this paragraph (c)(2)(iv). In addition, the limitations in section 274(k)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply to the expenses associated with the refreshments that are not excepted under section 274(e)(7) and this paragraph (c)(2)(iv).
(
2
)
Example 2.
Employer Q is an automobile service center and provides refreshments in its waiting area. The refreshments are consumed by Q's employees and customers, and Q reasonably estimates that more than 50 percent of the refreshments are consumed by customers. Under section 274(e)(7) and this paragraph (c)(2)(iv), the expenses associated with the refreshments are not subject to the deduction limitations provided for in paragraph (a) of this section because the food and beverages are primarily consumed by customers. Thus, Q may deduct 100 percent of the food and beverage expenses.
(
3
)
Example 3.
Employer R operates a summer camp open to the general public for children and provides breakfast and lunch, as part of the fee to attend camp, both to camp counselors, who are employees, and to camp attendees, who are customers. There are 20 camp counselors and 100 camp attendees. The same type of meal is available to each counselor and attendee, and attendees consume more than 50 percent of the food and beverages. Under section 274(e)(7) and this paragraph (c)(2)(iv), the expenses associated with the food and beverages are not subject to the deduction limitations in paragraph (a) of this section, because over 50 percent of the food and beverages are consumed by camp attendees and the food and beverages are therefore primarily consumed by the general public. Thus, R may deduct 100 percent of the food and beverage expenses.
(
4
)
Example 4.
Employer S provides food and beverages to its employees without charge at a company cafeteria on its premises. Occasionally, customers or other visitors also eat without charge in the cafeteria. The occasional consumption of food and beverages at the company cafeteria by customers and visitors is less than 50 percent of the total amount of food and beverages consumed at the cafeteria. Therefore, the food and beverages are not primarily consumed by the general public, and only the costs attributable to the food and beverages provided to the general public are excepted under section 274(e)(7) and this paragraph (c)(2)(iv). In addition, the limitations in section 274(k)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply to the expenses associated with the food and beverages that are not excepted under section 274(e)(7) and this paragraph (c)(2)(iv).
(v)
Goods or services sold to customers
—(A)
In general.
In accordance with section 274(e)(8), an expense paid or incurred for food or beverages, to the extent the food or beverages are sold to customers in a bona fide transaction for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth, is not subject to the deduction limitations in paragraph (a) of this section. However,
money or money's worth
does not include payment through services provided. Under this paragraph (c)(2)(v), a restaurant or catering business may deduct 100 percent of its costs for food or beverage items, purchased in connection with preparing and providing meals to its paying customers, which are also consumed at the worksite by employees who work in the employer's restaurant or catering business. In addition, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(v), the term
customer
includes anyone, including an employee of the taxpayer, who is sold food or beverages in a bona fide transaction for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth.
(B)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(v):
Example.
Employer T operates a restaurant. T provides food and beverages
to its food service employees before, during, and after their shifts for no consideration. Under section 274(e)(8) and this paragraph (c)(2)(v), the expenses associated with the food and beverages provided to the employees are not subject to the 50 percent deduction limitation in paragraph (a) of this section because the restaurant sells food and beverages to customers in a bona fide transaction for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth. Thus, T may deduct 100 percent of the food and beverage expenses.
(d)
Applicability date.
This section applies for taxable years that begin on or after October 9, 2020.
[T.D. 9925, 85 FR 64035, Oct. 9, 2020]

General public.
(i)
In general.
The term
general public
includes, but is not limited to, customers, clients, visitors, individuals delivering goods or services to the taxpayer, students of an educational institution, and patients of a health care facility. The term general public does not include individuals that are employees, partners, 2-percent shareholders of S corporations (as defined in section 1372(b)), sole proprietors, or independent contractors of the taxpayer. Also, an exclusive list of guests of a taxpayer is not the general public. Parking spaces that are available to the general public but empty are treated as provided to the general public. Parking spaces that are used to park vehicles owned by the general public while the vehicles await repair or service by the taxpayer are also treated as provided to the general public.
(ii)
Multi-tenant building.
If a taxpayer owns or leases space in a multi-tenant building, the term
general public
includes employees, partners, 2-percent shareholders of S corporations (as defined in section 1372(b)), sole proprietors, independent contractors, clients, or customers of unrelated tenants in the building.
(4)
Parking facility.
The term
parking facility
includes indoor and outdoor garages and other structures, as well as parking lots and other areas, where a taxpayer provides qualified parking (as defined in section 132(f)(5)(C)) to one or more of its employees. The term
parking facility
may include one or more parking facilities but does not include parking spaces on or near property used by an employee for residential purposes.
(5)
Geographic location.
The term
geographic location
means contiguous tracts or parcels of land owned or leased by the taxpayer. Two or more tracts or parcels of land are contiguous if they share common boundaries or would share common boundaries but for the interposition of a road, street, railroad, stream, or similar property. Tracts or parcels of land which touch only at a common corner are not contiguous.
(6)
Total parking spaces.
The term
total parking spaces
means the total
number of parking spaces, or the taxpayer's portion thereof, in the parking facility.
(7)
Reserved employee spaces.
The term
reserved employee spaces
means the spaces in the parking facility, or the taxpayer's portion thereof, exclusively reserved for the taxpayer's employees. Employee spaces in the parking facility, or portion thereof, may be exclusively reserved for employees by a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, specific signage (for example, “Employee Parking Only”) or a separate facility or portion of a facility segregated by a barrier to entry or limited by terms of access. Inventory/unusable spaces are not included in
reserved employee spaces.
(8)
Reserved nonemployee spaces.
The term
reserved nonemployee spaces
means the spaces in the parking facility, or the taxpayer's portion thereof, exclusively reserved for nonemployees. Such parking spaces may include, but are not limited to, spaces reserved exclusively for visitors, customers, partners, sole proprietors, 2-percent shareholders of S corporations (as defined in section 1372(b)), vendor deliveries, and passenger loading/unloading. Nonemployee spaces in the parking facility, or portion thereof, may be exclusively reserved for nonemployees by a variety of methods, including, but not limited to, specific signage (for example, “Customer Parking Only”) or a separate facility, or portion of a facility, segregated by a barrier to entry or limited by terms of access. Inventory/unusable spaces are not included in
reserved nonemployee spaces.
(9)
Inventory/unusable spaces.
The term
inventory/unusable spaces
means the spaces in the parking facility, or the taxpayer's portion thereof, exclusively used or reserved for inventoried vehicles, qualified nonpersonal use vehicles described in § 1.274-5(k), or other fleet vehicles used in the taxpayer's business, or that are otherwise not usable for parking by employees or the general public. Examples of such parking spaces include, but are not limited to, parking spaces for vehicles that are intended to be sold or leased at a car dealership or car rental agency, parking spaces for vehicles owned by an electric utility used exclusively to maintain electric power lines, or parking spaces occupied by trash dumpsters (or similar property). Taxpayers may use any reasonable methodology to determine the number of inventory/unusable spaces in the parking facility. A reasonable methodology may include using the average of monthly inventory counts.
(10)
Available parking spaces.
The term
available parking spaces
means the total parking spaces, less reserved employee spaces and less inventory/unusable spaces, that are available to employees and the general public.
(11)
Primary use.
The term
primary use
means greater than 50 percent of actual or estimated usage of the available parking spaces in the parking facility.
(12)
Total parking expenses
—(i)
In general.
The term
total parking expenses
means all expenses of the taxpayer related to total parking spaces in a parking facility including, but not limited to, repairs, maintenance, utility costs, insurance, property taxes, interest, snow and ice removal, leaf removal, trash removal, cleaning, landscape costs, parking lot attendant expenses, security, and rent or lease payments or a portion of a rent or lease payment (if not broken out separately). A taxpayer may use any reasonable methodology to allocate mixed parking expenses to a parking facility. A deduction for an allowance for depreciation on a parking facility owned by a taxpayer and used for parking by the taxpayer's employees is an allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear, and obsolescence of property, and not included in
total parking expenses
for purposes of this section. Expenses paid or incurred for nonparking facility property, including items related to property next to the parking facility, such as landscaping or lighting, also are not included in
total parking expenses.
(ii)
Optional rule for allocating certain mixed parking expenses.
A taxpayer may choose to allocate 5 percent of any the following mixed parking expenses to a parking facility: Lease or rental agreement expenses, property taxes, interest expense, and expenses for utilities and insurance.
(13)
Mixed parking expense.
The term
mixed parking expense
means a single expense amount paid or incurred by a
taxpayer that includes both parking facility and nonparking facility expenses for a property that a taxpayer owns or leases.
(14)
Peak demand period
—(i)
In general.
The term
peak demand period
refers to the period of time on a typical business day during the taxable year when the greatest number of the taxpayer's employees are utilizing parking spaces in the taxpayer's parking facility. If a taxpayer's employees work in shifts, the
peak demand period
would take into account the shift during which the largest number of employees park in the taxpayer's parking facility. However, a brief transition period during which two shifts overlap in their use of parking spaces, as one shift of employees is getting ready to leave and the next shift is reporting to work, may be disregarded. Taxpayers may use any reasonable methodology to determine the total number of spaces used by employees during the
peak demand period
on a typical business day. A reasonable methodology may include periodic inspections or employee surveys.
(ii)
Optional rule for federally declared disasters.
If a taxpayer owns or leases a parking facility that is located in a federally declared disaster area, as defined in section 165(i)(5), the taxpayer may choose to identify a typical business day for the taxable year in which the disaster occurred by reference to a typical business day in that taxable year prior to the date that the taxpayer's operations were impacted by the federally declared disaster. Alternatively, a taxpayer may choose to identify a typical business day during the month(s) of the taxable year in which the disaster occurred by reference to a typical business day during the same month(s) of the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which the disaster first occurred. For purposes of applying the optional rule for federally declared disasters, the taxable year in which the disaster occurs is determined without regard to whether an election under section 165(i) is made with respect to the disaster.
(c)
Optional aggregation rule for calculating total parking spaces; taxpayer owned or leased parking facilities.
For purposes of determining total parking spaces in calculating the disallowance of deductions for qualified transportation fringe parking expenses under the general rule in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the primary use methodology in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, or the cost per space methodology in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, a taxpayer that owns or leases more than one parking facility in a single geographic location may aggregate the number of spaces in those parking facilities. For example, parking spaces at an office park or an industrial complex in the geographic location may be aggregated. However, a taxpayer may not aggregate parking spaces in parking facilities that are in different geographic locations. A taxpayer that chooses to aggregate its parking spaces under this paragraph (c) must determine its total parking expenses, including the allocation of mixed parking expenses, as if the aggregated parking spaces constitute one parking facility.
(d)
Calculation of disallowance of deductions for qualified transportation fringe expenses
—(1)
Taxpayer pays a third party for parking qualified transportation fringe.
If a taxpayer pays a third party an amount for its employees' parking qualified transportation fringe, the section 274(a)(4) disallowance generally is calculated as the taxpayer's total annual cost of employee parking qualified transportation fringes paid to the third party.
(2)
Taxpayer provides parking qualified transportation fringe at a parking facility it owns or leases.
If a taxpayer owns or leases all or a portion of one or more parking facilities where its employees park, the section 274(a)(4) disallowance may be calculated using the general rule in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section or any of the simplified methodologies in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section. A taxpayer may choose to use the general rule or any of the following methodologies for each taxable year and for each parking facility.
(i)
General rule.
A taxpayer that uses the general rule in this paragraph (d)(2)(i) must calculate the disallowance of deductions for qualified transportation fringe parking expenses for each employee receiving the qualified
transportation fringe based on a reasonable interpretation of section 274(a)(4). A taxpayer that uses the general rule in this paragraph (d)(2)(i) may use the aggregation rule in paragraph (c) of this section for determining total parking spaces. An interpretation of section 274(a)(4) is not reasonable unless the taxpayer applies the following rules when calculating the disallowance under this paragraph (d)(2)(i).
(A)
A taxpayer must not use value to determine expense.
A taxpayer may not use the value of employee parking to determine expenses allocable to employee parking that is either owned or leased by the taxpayer because section 274(a)(4) disallows a deduction for the expense of providing a qualified transportation fringe, regardless of its value.
(B)
A taxpayer must not deduct expenses related to reserved employee spaces.
A taxpayer must determine the allocable portion of total parking expenses that relate to any reserved employee spaces. No deduction is allowed for the parking expenses that relate to reserved employee spaces.
(C)
A taxpayer must not improperly apply the exception for qualified parking made available to the public.
A taxpayer must not improperly apply the exception in section 274(e)(7) or paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section to parking facilities, for example, by treating a parking facility regularly used by employees as available to the general public merely because the general public has access to the parking facility.
(ii)
Additional simplified methodologies.
Instead of using the general rule in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section for a taxpayer owned or leased parking facility, a taxpayer may use a simplified methodology under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.
(A)
Qualified parking limit methodology.
A taxpayer that uses the qualified parking limit methodology in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) must calculate the disallowance of deductions for qualified transportation fringe parking expenses by multiplying the total number of spaces used by employees during the peak demand period, or the total number of taxpayer's employees, by the section 132(f)(2) monthly per employee limitation on exclusion (adjusted for inflation), for each month in the taxable year. The result is the amount of the taxpayer's expenses that are disallowed under section 274(a)(4). In applying this methodology, a taxpayer calculates the disallowed amount as required under this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A), regardless of the actual amount of the taxpayer's total parking expenses. This methodology may be used only if the taxpayer includes the value of the qualified transportation fringe in excess of the sum of the amount, if any, paid by the employee for the qualified transportation fringe and the applicable statutory monthly limit in section 132(f)(2) as compensation paid to the employee under chapter 1 of the Code (chapter 1) and as wages to the employee for purposes of withholding under chapter 24 of the Code (chapter 24), relating to collection of Federal income tax at source on wages. In addition, the exception to the disallowance for amounts treated as employee compensation provided for in section 274(e)(2) and in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section cannot be applied to reduce a section 274(a)(4) disallowance calculated using this methodology. A taxpayer using this methodology may not use the aggregation rule in paragraph (c) of this section.
(B)
Primary use methodology.
A taxpayer that uses the primary use methodology in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) must use the following four-step methodology to calculate the disallowance of deductions for qualified transportation fringe parking expenses for each parking facility for which the taxpayer uses the primary use methodology. A taxpayer using this methodology may use the aggregation rule in paragraph (c) of this section for determining total parking spaces.
(
1
)
Step 1—Calculate the disallowance for reserved employee spaces.
A taxpayer must identify the total parking spaces in the parking facility, or the taxpayer's portion thereof, exclusively reserved for the taxpayer's employees. The taxpayer must then determine the percentage of reserved employee spaces in relation to total parking spaces and multiply that percentage by the taxpayer's total parking expenses for the parking facility. The product is the
amount of the deduction for total parking expenses that is disallowed under section 274(a)(4) for reserved employee spaces. There is no disallowance for reserved employee spaces if the following conditions are met:
(
i
) The primary use (as defined in paragraphs (b)(11) and (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section) of the available parking spaces is to provide parking to the general public;
(
ii
) There are five or fewer reserved employee spaces in the parking facility; and
(
iii
) The reserved employee spaces are 5 percent or less of the total parking spaces.
(
2
)
Step 2—Determine the primary use of available parking spaces.
A taxpayer must identify the available parking spaces in the parking facility and determine whether their primary use is to provide parking to the general public. If the primary use of the available parking spaces in the parking facility is to provide parking to the general public, then total parking expenses allocable to available parking spaces at the parking facility are excepted from the section 274(a)(4) disallowance by the general public exception under section 274(e)(7) and paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Primary use of available parking spaces is based on the number of available parking spaces used by employees during the peak demand period.
(
3
)
Step 3—Calculate the allowance for reserved nonemployee spaces.
If the primary use of a taxpayer's available parking spaces is not to provide parking to the general public, the taxpayer must identify the number of available parking spaces in the parking facility, or the taxpayer's portion thereof, exclusively reserved for nonemployees. A taxpayer that has no reserved nonemployee spaces may proceed to Step 4 in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
4
) of this section. If the taxpayer has reserved nonemployee spaces, it may determine the percentage of reserved nonemployee spaces in relation to remaining total parking spaces and multiply that percentage by the taxpayer's remaining total parking expenses. The product is the amount of the deduction for remaining total parking expenses that is not disallowed because the spaces are not available for employee parking.
(
4
)
Step 4—Determine remaining use of available parking spaces and allocable expenses.
If a taxpayer completes Steps 1—3 in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section and has any remaining total parking expenses not specifically categorized as deductible or nondeductible, the taxpayer must reasonably allocate such expenses by determining the total number of available parking spaces used by employees during the peak demand period.
(C)
Cost per space methodology.
A taxpayer using the cost per space methodology in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) must calculate the disallowance of deductions for qualified transportation fringe parking expenses by multiplying the cost per space by the number of total parking spaces used by employees during the peak demand period. The product is the amount of the deduction for total parking expenses that is disallowed under section 274(a)(4). A taxpayer may calculate cost per space by dividing total parking expenses by total parking spaces. This calculation may be performed on a monthly basis. A taxpayer using this methodology may use the aggregation rule in paragraph (c) of this section for determining total parking spaces.
(3)
Expenses for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle or transit pass.
If a taxpayer pays a third party an amount for its employees' commuter highway vehicle or a transit pass qualified transportation fringe, the section 274(a)(4) disallowance generally is equal to the taxpayer's total annual cost of employee commuter highway vehicle or a transit pass qualified transportation fringes paid to the third party. If a taxpayer provides transportation in a commuter highway vehicle or transit pass qualified transportation fringes in kind directly to its employees, the taxpayer must calculate the disallowance of deductions for expenses for such fringes based on a reasonable interpretation of section 274(a)(4). However, a taxpayer may not use the value of the qualified commuter highway vehicle or transit pass fringe to the employee to determine expenses allocable to such fringe because section 274(a)(4) disallows a deduction for the expense of providing a qualified transportation
fringe, regardless of its value to the employee.
(e)
Specific exceptions to disallowance of deduction for qualified transportation fringe expenses

In general.
The provisions of section 274(a)(4) and paragraph (a) of this section (imposing limitations on deductions for qualified transportation fringe expenses) are not applicable in the case of expenditures set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Such expenditures are deductible to the extent allowable under chapter 1 of the Code. This paragraph (e) cannot be construed to affect whether a deduction under section 162 or 212 is allowed or allowable. The fact that an expenditure is not covered by a specific exception provided for in this paragraph (e) is not determinative of whether a deduction for the expenditure is disallowed under section 274(a)(4) and paragraph (a) of this section.
(2)
Exceptions to disallowance.
The expenditures referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section are set forth in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i)
Certain qualified transportation fringe expenses treated as compensation
—(A)
Expenses includible in income of persons who are employees and are not specified individuals.
In accordance with section 274(e)(2)(A), and except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(i)(C) of this section, an expense paid or incurred by a taxpayer for a qualified transportation fringe, if an employee who is not a specified individual is the recipient of the qualified transportation fringe, is not subject to the disallowance of deductions provided for in paragraph (a) of this section to the extent that the taxpayer—
(
1
) Properly treats the expense relating to the recipient of the qualified transportation fringe as compensation to an employee under chapter 1 and as wages to the employee for purposes of chapter 24; and
(
2
) Treats the proper amount as compensation to the employee under § 1.61-21.
(B)
Specified Individuals.
In accordance with section 274(e)(2)(B), in the case of a specified individual (as defined in section 274(e)(2)(B)(ii)), the disallowance of deductions provided for in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to an expense for a qualified transportation fringe of the specified individual to the extent that the amount of the expense does not exceed the sum of—
(
1
) The amount treated as compensation to the specified individual under chapter 1 and as wages to the specified individual for purposes of chapter 24; and
(
2
) Any amount the specified individual reimburses the taxpayer.
(C)
Expenses for which an amount is excluded from income or is less than the proper amount.
Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, in the case of an expense paid or incurred by a taxpayer for a qualified transportation fringe for which an amount is wholly or partially excluded from a recipient's income under subtitle A of the Code (other than because the amount is reimbursed by the recipient), or for which an amount included in compensation and wages to an employee is less than the amount required to be included under § 1.61-21, the disallowance of deductions provided for in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to the extent that the amount of the expense does not exceed the sum of—
(
1
) The amount treated as compensation to the recipient under chapter 1 and as wages to the recipient for purposes of chapter 24; and
(
2
) Any amount the recipient reimburses the taxpayer.
(ii)
Expenses for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit pass, or parking made available to the public.
Under section 274(e)(7) and this paragraph (e)(2)(ii), any expense paid or incurred by a taxpayer for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, a transit pass, or parking that otherwise qualifies as a qualified transportation fringe is not subject to the disallowance of deductions provided for in paragraph (a) of this section to the extent that such transportation, transit pass, or parking is made available to the general public. With respect to parking, this exception applies to the entire amount of the taxpayer's parking expense, less any expenses specifically attributable to employees (for example, expenses allocable to reserved employee spaces), if the primary use of
the parking is by the general public. If the primary use of the parking is not by the general public, this exception applies only to the costs attributable to the parking used by the general public.
(iii)
Expenses for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, transit pass, or parking sold to customers.
Under section 274(e)(8) and this paragraph (e)(2)(iii), any expense paid or incurred by a taxpayer for transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, a transit pass, or parking that otherwise qualifies as a qualified transportation fringe to the extent such transportation, transit pass, or parking is sold to customers in a bona fide transaction for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth, is not subject to the disallowance of deductions provided for in paragraph (a) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii), the term
customer
includes an employee of the taxpayer who purchases transportation in a commuter highway vehicle, a transit pass, or parking in a bona fide transaction for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth. If in a bona fide transaction, the adequate and full consideration for qualified parking is zero, the exception in this paragraph (e)(2)(iii) applies even though the taxpayer does not actually sell the parking to its employees. To apply the exception in this case, the taxpayer bears the burden of proving that the fair market value of the qualified parking is zero. However, solely for purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii), a taxpayer will be treated as satisfying this burden if the qualified parking is provided in a rural, industrial, or remote area in which no commercial parking is available and an individual other than an employee ordinarily would not pay to park in the parking facility.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section related to parking expenses for qualified transportation fringes. For each example, unless otherwise stated, assume the parking expenses are otherwise deductible expenses paid or incurred during the 2020 taxable year; all or some portion of the expenses relate to a qualified transportation fringe under section 132(f); the section 132(f)(2) monthly per employee limitation on an employee's exclusion is $270; the fair market value of the qualified parking is not $0; all taxpayers are calendar-year taxpayers; and the length of the 2020 taxable year is 12 months.
(1)
Example 1.
Taxpayer A pays B, a third party who owns a parking garage adjacent to A's place of business, $100 per month per parking space for each of A's 10 employees to park in B's garage, or $12,000 for parking in 2020 (($100 × 10) × 12 = $12,000). The $100 per month paid for each of A's 10 employees for parking is excludible from the employees' gross income under section 132(a)(5), and none of the exceptions in section 274(e) or paragraph (e) of this section are applicable. Thus, the entire $12,000 is subject to the section 274(a)(4) disallowance under paragraphs (a) and (d)(1) of this section.
(2)
Example 2.
(i) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (f)(1) of this section (
Example 1
), except A pays B $300 per month for each parking space, or $36,000 for parking for 2020 (($300 × 10) × 12 = $36,000). Of the $300 per month paid for parking for each of 10 employees, $270 is excludible under section 132(a)(5) for 2020 and none of the exceptions in section 274(e) or paragraph (e) of this section are applicable to this amount. A properly treats the excess amount of $30 ($300−$270) per employee per month as compensation and wages. Thus, $32,400 (($270 × 10) × 12 = $32,400) is subject to the section 274(a)(4) disallowance under paragraphs (a) and (d)(1) of this section.
(ii) The excess amount of $30 per employee per month is not excludible under section 132(a)(5). As a result, the exceptions in section 274(e)(2) and paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section are applicable to this amount. Thus, $3,600 ($36,000−$32,400 = $3,600) is not subject to the section 274(a)(4) disallowance and remains deductible.
(3)
Example 3.
(i) Taxpayer C leases from a third party a parking facility that includes 200 parking spaces at a rate of $500 per space, per month in 2020. C's annual lease payment for the parking spaces is $1,200,000 ((200 × $500) × 12 = $1,200,000). The number of available parking spaces used by C's employees during the peak demand period is 200.
(ii) C uses the qualified parking limit methodology described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section to determine the disallowance under section 274(a)(4). Under this methodology, the section 274(a)(4) disallowance is calculated by multiplying the number of available parking spaces used by employees during the peak demand period, 200, the section 132(f)(2) monthly per employee limitation on exclusion, $270, and 12, the number of months in the applicable taxable year. The amount subject to the section 274(a)(4) disallowance is $648,000 (200 × $270 × 12 = $648,000). This amount is excludible from C's employees' gross incomes under section 132(a)(5) and none of the exceptions in section 274(e) or paragraph (e) of this section are applicable to this amount. The excess $552,000 ($1,200,000−$648,000) for which C is not disallowed a deduction under 274(a)(4) is included in C's employees' gross incomes because it exceeds the section 132(f)(2) monthly per employee limitation on exclusion.
(4)
Example 4.
(i)
Facts.
Taxpayer D, a big box retailer, owns a surface parking facility adjacent to its store. D incurs $10,000 of total parking expenses for its store in the 2020 taxable year. D's parking facility has 510 spaces that are used by its customers, employees, and its fleet vehicles. None of D's parking spaces are reserved. The number of available parking spaces used by D's employees during the peak demand period is 50. Approximately 30 nonreserved parking spaces are empty during D's peak demand period. D's fleet vehicles occupy 10 parking spaces.
(ii)
Methodology.
D uses the primary use methodology in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section to determine the amount of parking expenses that are disallowed under section 274(a)(4).
(iii)
Step 1.
Because none of D's parking spaces are exclusively reserved for employees, there is no amount to be specifically allocated to reserved employee spaces under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section.
(iv)
Step 2.
D's number of available parking spaces is the total parking spaces reduced by the number of reserved employee spaces and inventory/unusable spaces or 500 (510−0−10 = 500). The number of available parking spaces used by D's employees during the peak demand period is 50. Of the 500 available parking spaces, 450 are used to provide parking to the general public, including the 30 empty nonreserved parking spaces that are treated as provided to the general public. The primary use of D's available parking spaces is to provide parking to the general public because 90% (450/500 = 90%) of the available parking spaces are used by the general public under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section. Because the primary use of the available parking spaces is to provide parking to the general public, the exception in section 274(e)(7) and paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section applies and none of the $10,000 of total parking expenses is subject to the section 274(a)(4) disallowance.
(5)
Example 5.
(i)
Facts.
Taxpayer E, a manufacturer, owns a surface parking facility adjacent to its plant. E incurs $10,000 of total parking expenses in 2020. E's parking facility has 500 spaces that are used by its visitors and employees. E reserves 25 of these spaces for nonemployee visitors. The number of available parking spaces used by E's employees during the peak demand period is 400.
(ii)
Methodology.
E uses the primary use methodology in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section to determine the amount of parking expenses that are disallowed under section 274(a)(4).
(iii)
Step 1.
Because none of E's parking spaces are exclusively reserved for employees, there is no amount to be specifically allocated to reserved employee spaces under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section.
(iv)
Step 2.
The primary use of E's parking facility is not to provide parking to the general public because 80% (400/500 = 80%) of the available parking spaces are used by its employees. Thus, expenses allocable to those spaces are not excepted from the section 274(a) disallowance by section 274(e)(7) and paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section under the primary use test in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section.
(v)
Step 3.
Because 5% (25/500 = 5%) of E's available parking spaces are reserved nonemployee spaces, up to $9,500 ($10,000 × 95% = $9,500) of E's total parking expenses are subject to the section
274(a)(4) disallowance under this step as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
3
) of this section. The remaining $500 ($10,000 × 5% = $500) of expenses allocable to reserved nonemployee spaces is excepted from the section 274(a) disallowance and continues to be deductible.
(vi)
Step 4.
E must reasonably determine the employee use of the remaining parking spaces by using the number of available parking spaces used by E's employees during the peak demand period and determine the expenses allocable to employee parking spaces under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
4
) of this section.
(6)
Example 6.
(i)
Facts.
Taxpayer F, a manufacturer, owns a surface parking facility adjacent to its plant. F incurs $10,000 of total parking expenses in 2020. F's parking facility has 500 spaces that are used by its visitors and employees. F reserves 50 spaces for management. All other employees park in nonreserved spaces in F's parking facility; the number of available parking spaces used by F's employees during the peak demand period is 400. Additionally, F reserves 10 spaces for nonemployee visitors.
(ii)
Methodology.
F uses the primary use methodology in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section to determine the amount of parking expenses that are disallowed under section 274(a)(4).
(iii)
Step 1.
Because F reserved 50 spaces for management, $1,000 ((50/500) × $10,000 = $1,000) is the amount of total parking expenses that is nondeductible for reserved employee spaces under section 274(a)(4) and paragraphs (a) and (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section. None of the exceptions in section 274(e) or paragraph (e) of this section are applicable to this amount.
(iv)
Step 2.
The primary use of the remainder of F's parking facility is not to provide parking to the general public because 89% (400/450 = 89%) of the available parking spaces in the facility are used by its employees. Thus, expenses allocable to these spaces are not excepted from the section 274(a)(4) disallowance by section 274(e)(7) and paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section under the primary use test in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section.
(v)
Step 3.
Because 2% (10/450 = 2.22%) of F's available parking spaces are reserved nonemployee spaces, the $180 allocable to those spaces (($10,000−$1,000) × 2%) is not subject to the section 274(a)(4) disallowance and continues to be deductible under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
3
) of this section.
(vi)
Step 4.
F must reasonably determine the employee use of the remaining parking spaces by using the number of available parking spaces used by F's employees during the peak demand period and determine the expenses allocable to employee parking spaces under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
4
) of this section.
(7)
Example 7.
(i)
Facts.
Taxpayer G, a financial services institution, owns a multi-level parking garage adjacent to its office building. G incurs $10,000 of total parking expenses in 2020. G's parking garage has 1,000 spaces that are used by its visitors and employees. However, one floor of the parking garage is segregated by an electronic barrier that can only be accessed with a card provided by G to its employees. The segregated parking floor contains 100 spaces. The other floors of the parking garage are not used by employees for parking during the peak demand period.
(ii)
Methodology.
G uses the primary use methodology in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section to determine the amount of parking expenses that are disallowed under section 274(a)(4).
(iii)
Step 1.
Because G has 100 reserved spaces for employees, $1,000 ((100/1,000) × $10,000 = $1,000) is the amount of total parking expenses that is nondeductible for reserved employee spaces under section 274(a)(4) and paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section. None of the exceptions in section 274(e) or paragraph (e) of this section are applicable to this amount.
(iv)
Step 2.
The primary use of the available parking spaces in G's parking facility is to provide parking to the general public because 100% (900/900 = 100%) of the available parking spaces are used by the public. Thus, expenses allocable to those spaces, $9,000, are excepted from the section 274(a)(4) disallowance by section 274(e)(7) and paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section under the
primary use test in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
).
(8)
Example 8.
(i)
Facts.
Taxpayer H, an accounting firm, leases a parking facility adjacent to its office building. H incurs $10,000 of total parking expenses related to the lease payments in 2020. H's leased parking facility has 100 spaces that are used by its clients and employees. None of the parking spaces are reserved. The number of available parking spaces used by H's employees during the peak demand period is 60.
(ii)
Methodology.
H uses the primary use methodology in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section to determine the amount of parking expenses that are disallowed under section 274(a)(4).
(iii)
Step 1.
Because none of H's leased parking spaces are exclusively reserved for employees, there is no amount to be specifically allocated to reserved employee spaces under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section.
(iv)
Step 2.
The primary use of H's leased parking facility under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section is not to provide parking to the general public because 60% (60/100 = 60%) of the lot is used by its employees. Thus, H may not utilize the general public exception from the section 274(a)(4) disallowance provided by section 274(e)(7) and paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.
(v)
Step 3.
Because none of H's parking spaces are exclusively reserved for nonemployees, there is no amount to be specifically allocated to reserved nonemployee spaces under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
3
) of this section.
(vi)
Step 4.
H must reasonably determine the use of the parking spaces and the related expenses allocable to employee parking. Because the number of available parking spaces used by H's employees during the peak demand period is 60, H reasonably determines that 60% (60/100 = 60%) of H's total parking expenses or $6,000 ($10,000 × 60% = $6,000) is subject to the section 274(a)(4) disallowance under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
4
) of this section.
(9)
Example 9.
(i)
Facts.
Taxpayer I, a large manufacturer, owns multiple parking facilities adjacent to its manufacturing plant, warehouse, and office building at its complex in the city of X. All of I's tracts or parcels of land at its complex in city X are located in a single geographic location. I owns parking facilities in other cities. I incurs $50,000 of total parking expenses related to the parking facilities at its complex in city X in 2020. I's parking facilities at its complex in city X have 10,000 total parking spaces that are used by its visitors and employees of which 500 are reserved for management. All other spaces at parking facilities in I's complex in city X are nonreserved. The number of nonreserved spaces used by I's employees other than management during the peak demand period at I's parking facilities in city X is 8,000.
(ii)
Methodology.
I uses the primary use methodology in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section to determine the amount of parking expenses that are disallowed under section 274(a)(4). I chooses to apply the aggregation rule in paragraph (c) of this section to aggregate all parking facilities in the geographic location that comprises its complex in city X. However, I may not aggregate parking facilities in other cities with its parking facilities in city X because they are in different geographic locations.
(iii)
Step 1.
Because 500 spaces are reserved for management, $2,500 ((500/10,000) × $50,000 = $2,500) is the amount of total parking expenses that is nondeductible for reserved employee spaces for I's parking facilities in city X under section 274(a)(4) and paragraphs (a) and (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section.
(iv)
Step 2.
The primary use of the remainder of I's parking facility is not to provide parking to the general public because 84% (8,000/9,500 = 84%) of the available parking spaces in the facility are used by its employees. Thus, expenses allocable to these spaces are not excepted from the section 274(a)(4) disallowance by section 274(e)(7) or paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section under the primary use test in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section.
(v)
Step 3.
Because none of I's parking spaces in its parking facilities in city X are exclusively reserved for nonemployees, there is no amount to be specifically allocated to reserved nonemployee spaces under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
3
) of this section.
(vi)
Step 4.
I must reasonably determine the use of the remaining parking
spaces and the related expenses allocable to employee parking for its parking facilities in city X. Because the number of available parking spaces used by I's employees during the peak demand period in city X during an average workday is 8,000, I reasonably determines that 84.2% (8,000/9,500 = 84.2%) of I's remaining parking expense or $39,900 (($50,000−$2,500) × 84% = $39,900) is subject to the section 274(a)(4) disallowance under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)(
4
) of this section.
(10)
Example 10.
(i) Taxpayer J, a manufacturer, owns a parking facility and incurs the following mixed parking expenses (along with other parking expenses): Property taxes, utilities, insurance, security expenses, and snow removal expenses. In accordance with paragraph (b)(12)(i) and (ii) of this section, J determines its total parking expenses by allocating 5% of its property tax, utilities, and insurance expenses to its parking facility. J uses a reasonable methodology to allocate to its parking facility an applicable portion of its security and snow removal expenses. J determines that it incurred $100,000 of total parking expenses in 2020. J's parking facility has 500 spaces that are used by its visitors and employees. The number of total parking spaces used by J's employees during the peak demand period is 475.
(ii) J uses the cost per space methodology described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section to determine the amount of parking expenses that are disallowed under section 274(a)(4). Under this methodology, J multiplies the cost per space by the number of total parking spaces used by J's employees during the peak demand period. J calculates the cost per space by dividing total parking expenses by the number of total parking spaces ($100,000/500 = $200). J determines that $95,000 ($200 × 475 = $95,000) of J's total parking expenses is subject to the section 274(a)(4) disallowance and none of the exceptions in section 274(e) or paragraph (e) of this section are applicable.
(11)
Example 11.
Taxpayer K operates an industrial plant with a parking facility in a rural area in which no commercial parking is available. K provides qualified parking at the plant to its employees free of charge. Further, an individual other than an employee ordinarily would not consider paying any amount to park in the plant's parking facility. Although K does not charge its employees for the qualified parking, the exception in section 274(e)(8) and this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) will apply to K's total parking expenses if in a bona fide transaction, the adequate and full consideration for the qualified parking is zero. In order to treat the adequate and full consideration as zero, K bears the burden of proving that the parking has no objective value. K is treated as satisfying this burden because the parking is provided in a rural area in which no commercial parking is available and in which an individual other than an employee ordinarily would not consider paying any amount to park in the parking facility. Therefore, the exception in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section applies to K's total parking expenses and a deduction for the expenses is not disallowed by reason of section 274(a)(4).
(g)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning on or after December 16, 2020. However, taxpayers may choose to apply § 1.274-13(b)(14)(ii) to taxable years ending after December 31, 2019.
[T.D. 9939, 85 FR 81402, Dec. 16, 2020, as amended by 86 FR 22345, Apr. 28, 2021]
§ 1.274-14
Disallowance of deductions for certain transportation and commuting benefit expenditures.
(a)
General rule.
Except as provided in this section, no deduction is allowed for any expense incurred for providing any transportation, or any payment or reimbursement, to an employee of the taxpayer in connection with travel between the employee's residence and place of employment. The disallowance is not subject to the exceptions provided in section 274(e). The disallowance applies regardless of whether the travel between the employee's residence and place of employment includes more than one mode of transportation, and regardless of whether the taxpayer provides, or pays or reimburses the employee for, all modes of transportation used during the trip. For example, the disallowance applies
if an employee drives a personal vehicle to a location where a different mode of transportation is used to complete the trip to the place of employment, even though the taxpayer may not incur any expense for the portion of travel in the employee's personal vehicle. The rules in section 274(l) and this section do not apply to business expenses under section 162(a)(2) paid or incurred while traveling away from home. The rules in section 274(l) and this section also do not apply to any expenditure for any qualified transportation fringe (as defined in section 132(f)) provided to an employee of the taxpayer. All qualified transportation fringe expenses are required to be analyzed under section 274(a)(4) and § 1.274-13.
(b)
Exception.
The disallowance for the deduction for expenses incurred for providing any transportation or commuting in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply if the transportation or commuting expense is necessary for ensuring the safety of the employee. The transportation or commuting expense is necessary for ensuring the safety of the employee if unsafe conditions, as described in § 1.61-21(k)(5), exist for the employee.
(c)

(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, no deduction shall be allowed for an expenditure for advertising in a convention program of a political party. For purposes of this subparagraph it is immaterial who publishes the convention program or to whose use the proceeds of the program inure (or are intended to inure). A convention program is any written publication (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) which is distributed or displayed in connection with or at a political convention, conclave, or meeting. Under certain conditions payments to a committee organized for the purpose of bringing a political convention to an area are deductible under paragraph (b) of § 1.162-15. This rule is not affected by the provisions of this section. For example, such payments may be deductible notwithstanding the fact that the committee purchases from a political party the right to publish a pamphlet in connection with a convention and that the deduction of costs of advertising in the pamphlet is prohibited under this section.
(ii) The application of the provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
M Corporation publishes the convention program of the Y political party for a convention not described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. The corporation makes no payment of any kind to or on behalf of the party or any of its candidates and no part of the proceeds of the publication and sale of the program inures directly or indirectly to the benefit of any political party or candidate. P Corporation purchases an advertisement in the program. P Corporation may not deduct the cost of such advertisement.
(2)
Amounts paid or incurred on or after January 1, 1968, for advertising in programs of certain national political conventions.
(i) Subject to the limitations in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, a deduction may be allowed for any amount paid or incurred on or after January 1, 1968, for advertising in a convention program of a political party distributed in connection with a convention held for the purpose of nominating candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of the United States, if the proceeds from the program are actually used solely to defray the costs of conducting the convention (or are set aside for such use at the next convention of the party held for such purpose) and if the amount paid or incurred for the advertising is reasonable. If such amount is not reasonable or if any part of the proceeds is used for a purpose other than that of defraying such convention costs, no part of the amount is deductible. Whether or not an amount is reasonable shall be determined in light of the business the taxpayer may expect to receive either directly as a result of the advertising or as a result of the convention being held in an area in which the taxpayer has a principal place of business. For these purposes, an amount paid or incurred for advertising will not be considered as reasonable if it is greater than the amount which would be paid for comparable advertising in a comparable convention program of a nonpolitical organization. Institutional advertising (e.g., advertising of a type not designed to sell specific goods or services to persons attending the convention) is not advertising which may be expected to result directly in business for the taxpayer sufficient to make the expenditures reasonable. Accordingly, an amount spent for institutional advertising in a convention program may be deductible only if the taxpayer has a principal place of business in the area where the convention is held. An official statement made by a political party after a convention as to the use made of the proceeds from its convention program shall constitute prima facie evidence of such use.
(ii) No deduction may be taken for any amount described in this subparagraph which is not otherwise allowable as a deduction under section 162, relating to trade or business expenses. Therefore, in order for any such amount to be deductible, it must first satisfy the requirements of section 162, and, in addition, it must also satisfy the more restrictive requirements of this subparagraph.
(c)
Advertising in publication other than convention program.
No deduction shall be allowed for an expenditure for advertising in any publication other than a convention program if any part of the proceeds of such publication directly or indirectly inures (or is intended to inure) to or for the use of a political party or a political candidate. For purposes of this paragraph, a publication includes a book, magazine, pamphlet, brochure, flier, almanac, newspaper, newsletter, handbill, billboard, menu, sign, scorecard, program, announcement, radio or television program or announcement, or any similar means of communication. For the definition of inurement of proceeds to a political party or a political candidate, see paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
(d)
Admission to dinner or program.
No deduction shall be allowed for an expenditure for admission to any dinner or program, if any part of the proceeds of such event directly or indirectly inures (or is intended to inure) to or for the use of a political party or a political candidate. For purposes of this paragraph, a dinner or program includes a gala, dance, ball, theatrical or film presentation, cocktail or other party, picnic, barbecue, sporting event, brunch, tea, supper, auction, bazaar, reading, speech, forum, lecture, fashion
show, concert, opening, meeting, gathering, or any similar event. For the definition of inurement of proceeds to a political party or a political candidate and of admission to a dinner or program, see paragraph (f) of this section.
(e)
Admission to inaugural event.
(1) No deduction shall be allowed for an expenditure for admission to an inaugural ball, inaugural gala, inaugural parade, or inaugural concert, or to any similar event (such as a dinner or program, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section), in connection with the inauguration or installation in office of any official, or any equivalent event for an unsuccessful candidate, if the event is identified with a political party or a political candidate. For purposes of this paragraph, the sponsorship of the event and the use to which the proceeds of the event are or may be put are irrelevant, except insofar as they may tend to identify the event with a political party or a political candidate. For the definition of admission to an inaugural event, see paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
(2) The application of the provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
An inaugural reception for A, a prominent member of Y party who has been recently elected judge of the municipal court of F city, is held with the proceeds going to the city treasury. The price of admission to such affair is not deductible.
(f)
Definitions
—(1)
Political party.
For purposes of this section the term
political party
has the same meaning as that provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.271-1.
(2)
Political candidate.
For purposes of this section, the term
political candidate
is to be construed in accordance with the purpose of section 276 to deny tax deductions for certain expenditures which may be used directly or indirectly to finance political campaigns. The term includes a person who, at the time of the event or publication with respect to which the deduction is being sought, has been selected or nominated by a political party for any elective office. It also includes an individual who is generally believed, under the facts and circumstances at the time of the event or publication, by the persons making expenditures in connection therewith to be an individual who is or who in the reasonably foreseeable future will be seeking selection, nomination, or election to any public office. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the facts and circumstances to be considered include, but are not limited to, the purpose of the event or publication and the disposition to be made of the proceeds. In the absence of evidence to the contrary it shall be presumed that persons making expenditures in connection with an event or publication generally believe that an incumbent of an elective public office will run for reelection to his office or for election to some other public office.
(3)
Inurement of proceeds to political party or political candidate
—(i)
In general.
Subject to the special rules presented in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph (relating to a political candidate), proceeds directly or indirectly inure to or for the use of a political party or a political candidate (
a
) if the party or candidate may order the disposition of any part of such proceeds, regardless of what use is actually made thereof, or (
b
) if any part of such proceeds is utilized by any person for the benefit of the party or candidate. These conditions are equally applicable in determining whether the proceeds are intended to inure. Accordingly, it is immaterial whether the event or publication operates at a loss if, had there been a profit, any part of the proceeds would have inured to or for the use of a political party or a political candidate. Moreover, it shall be presumed that where a dinner, program, or publication is sponsored by or identified with a political party or political candidate, the proceeds of such dinner, program, or publication directly or indirectly inure (or are intended to inure) to or for the use of the party or candidate. On the other hand, proceeds are not considered to directly or indirectly inure to the benefit of a political party or political candidate if the benefit derived is so remote as to be negligible or merely a coincidence of the relationship of a political candidate to a trade or business profiting from an expenditure of funds. For example, the proceeds of expenditures made by a taxpayer in the ordinary course of his
trade or business for advertising in a publication, such as a newspaper or magazine, are not considered as inuring to the benefit of a political party or political candidate merely because the publication endorses a particular political candidate or candidates of a particular political party, the publisher independently contributes to the support of a political party or candidate out of his own personal funds, or the principal stockholder of the publishing firm is a candidate for public office.
(ii)
Proceeds to political party.
If a political party may order the disposition of any part of the proceeds of a publication or event described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, such proceeds inure to the use of the party regardless of what the proceeds are to be used for or that their use is restricted to a particular purpose unrelated to the election of specific candidates for public office. Accordingly, where a political party holds a dinner for the purpose of raising funds to be used in a voter registration drive, voter education program, or nonprofit political research program, partisan or nonpartisan, the proceeds are considered to directly or indirectly inure to or for the use of the political party. Proceeds may inure to or for the use of a political party even though they are to be used for purposes which may not be directly related to any particular election (such as to pay office rent for its permanent quarters, salaries to permanent employees, or utilities charges, or to pay the cost of an event such as a dinner or program as defined in paragraph (d) of this section).
(iii)
Proceeds to political candidate.
Proceeds directly or indirectly inure (or are intended to inure) to or for the use of a political candidate if, in addition to meeting the conditions described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, (
a
) some part of the proceeds is or may be used directly or indirectly for the purpose of furthering his candidacy for selection, nomination, or election to any elective public office, and (
b
) they are not received by him in the ordinary course of a trade or business (other than the trade or business of holding public office). Proceeds may so inure whether or not the expenditure sought to be deducted was paid or incurred before the commencement of political activities with respect to the selection, nomination, or election referred to in (
a
) of this subdivision, or after such selection, nomination, or election has been made or has taken place. For example, proceeds of an event which may be used by an individual who, under the facts and circumstances at the time of the event, the persons making expenditures in connection therewith generally believe will in the reasonably foreseeable future run for a public office, and which may be used in furtherance of such individual's candidacy, generally will be deemed to inure (or to be intended to inure) to or for the use of a political candidate for the purpose of furthering such individual's candidacy. Or, as another example, proceeds of an event occurring after an election, which may be used by a candidate in that election to repay loans incurred in directly or indirectly furthering his candidacy, or in reimbursement of expenses incurred in directly or indirectly furthering his candidacy, will be deemed to directly or indirectly inure (or to be intended to inure) to or for the use of a political candidate for the purpose of furthering his candidacy. For purposes of this subdivision, if the proceeds received by a candidate exceed substantially the fair market value of the goods furnished or services rendered by him, the proceeds are not received by the candidate in the ordinary course of his trade or business.
(iv) The application of the provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation O pays the Y political party $100,000 per annum for the right to publish the Y News, and retains the entire proceeds from the sale of the publication. Amounts paid or incurred for advertising in the Y News are not deductible because a part of the proceeds thereof indirectly inures to or for the use of a political party.

# Example 2.
The X political party holds a highly publicized ball honoring one of its active party members and admission tickets are offered to all. The guest of honor is a prominent national figure and a former incumbent of a high public office. The price of admission is designed to cover merely the cost of entertainment, food, and the ballroom, and all proceeds are paid to the hotel where the function is held, with the political
party bearing the cost of any deficit. No deduction may be taken for the price of admission to the ball since the proceeds thereof inure to or for the use of a political party.

# Example 3.
Taxpayer A, engaged in a trade or business, purchases a number of tickets for admission to a fundraising affair held on behalf of political candidate B. The funds raised by this affair can be used by B for the purpose of furthering his candidacy. These expenditures are not deductible by A notwithstanding that B donates the proceeds of the affair to a charitable organization.

# Example 4.
A, an individual taxpayer who publishes a newspaper, is a candidate for elective public office. X Corporation advertises its products in A's newspaper, paying substantially more than the normal rate for such advertising. X Corporation may not deduct any portion of the cost of that advertising.
(4)
Admission to dinners, programs, inaugural events.
For purposes of this section, the cost of admission to a dinner, program, or inaugural event includes all charges, whether direct or indirect, for attendance and participation at such function. Thus, for example, amounts spent to be eligible for door prizes, for the privilege of sitting at the head table, or for transportation furnished as part of such an event, or any separate charges for food or drink, are amounts paid for admission.
[T.D. 6996, 34 FR 833, Jan. 18, 1969, as amended by T.D. 7010, 34 FR 7145, May 1, 1969]
§ 1.278-1
Capital expenditures incurred in planting and developing citrus and almond groves.
(a)
General rule.
(1)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph and paragraph (b) of this section, there shall be charged to capital account any amount (allowable as a deduction without regard to section 278 or this section) which is attributable to the planting, cultivation, maintenance, or development of any citrus or almond grove (or part thereof), and which is incurred before the close of the fourth taxable year beginning with the taxable year in which the trees were planted. For purposes of section 278 and this section, such an amount shall be considered as “incurred” in accordance with the taxpayer's regular tax accounting method used in reporting income and expenses connected with the citrus or almond grove operation. For purposes of this paragraph, the portion of a citrus or almond grove planted in 1 taxable year shall be treated separately from the portion of such grove planted in another taxable year. The provisions of section 278 and this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, in the case of a citrus grove, and to taxable years beginning after January 12, 1971, in the case of an almond grove.
(ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
T, a fiscal year taxpayer plants a citrus grove 5 weeks before the close of his taxable year ending in 1971. T is required to capitalize any amount (allowable as a deduction without regard to section 278 or this section) attributable to the planting, cultivation, maintenance, or development of such grove until the close of his taxable year ending in 1974.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that T plants one portion of such grove 5 weeks before the close of his taxable year ending in 1971 and another portion of such grove at the beginning of his taxable year ending in 1972. The required capitalization period for expenses attributable to the first portion of such grove shall run until the close of T's taxable year ending in 1974. The required capitalization period for expenses attributable to the second portion of such grove shall run until the close of T's taxable year ending in 1975.
(2)(i) For purposes of section 278 and this section a
citrus grove
is defined as one or more trees of the rue family, often thorny and bearing large fruit with hard, usually thick peel and pulpy flesh, such as the orange, grapefruit, lemon, lime, citron, tangelo, and tangerine.
(ii) For purposes of section 278 and this section, an
almond grove
is defined as one or more trees of the species
Prunus amygdalus.
(iii) An amount attributable to the cultivation, maintenance, or development of a citrus or almond grove (or part thereof) shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following developmental or cultural practices expenditures: Irrigation, cultivation, pruning, fertilizing, management fees, frost protection, spraying, and upkeep of the citrus or almond grove. The provisions of section 278(a) and this paragraph
shall apply to expenditures for fertilizer and related materials notwithstanding the provisions of section 180, but shall not apply to expenditures attributable to real estate taxes or interest, to soil and water conservation expenditures allowable as a deduction under section 175, or to expenditures for clearing land allowable as a deduction under section 182. Further, the provisions of section 278(a) and this paragraph apply only to expenditures allowable as deductions without regard to section 278 and have no application to expenditures otherwise chargeable to capital account, such as the cost of the land and preparatory expenditures incurred in connection with the citrus or almond grove.
(iv) For purposes of section 278 and this section, a citrus or almond tree shall be considered to be “planted” on the date on which the tree is placed in the permanent grove from which production is expected.
(3)(i) The period during which expenditures described in section 278(a) and this paragraph are required to be capitalized shall, once determined, be unaffected by a sale or other disposition of the citrus or almond grove. Such period shall, in all cases, be computed by reference to the taxable years of the owner of the grove at the time that the citrus or almond trees were planted. Therefore, if a citrus or almond grove subject to the provisions of section 278 or this paragraph is sold or otherwise transferred by the original owner of the grove before the close of his fourth taxable year beginning with the taxable year in which the trees were planted, expenditures described in section 278(a) or this paragraph made by the purchaser or other transferee of the citrus or almond grove from the date of his acquisition until the close of the original holder's fourth such taxable year are required to be capitalized.
(ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
T, a fiscal year taxpayer, plants a citrus grove at the beginning of his taxable year ending in 1971. At the beginning of his taxable year ending in 1972, T sells the grove to X. The required period during which expenditures described in section 278 (a) are required to be capitalized runs from the date on which T planted the grove until the end of T's taxable year ending in 1974. Therefore, X must capitalize any such expenditures incurred by him from the time he purchased the grove from T until the end of T's taxable year ending in 1974.
(b)
Exceptions.
(1) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to amounts allowable as deductions (without regard to section 278 or this section) and attributable to a citrus or almond grove (or part thereof) which is replanted by a taxpayer after having been lost or damaged (while in the hands of such taxpayer) by reason of freeze, disease, drought, pests, or casualty.
(2)(i) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to amounts allowable as deductions (without regard to section 278 or this section), and attributable to a citrus grove (or part thereof) which was planted or replanted prior to December 30, 1969, or to an almond grove (or part thereof) which was planted or replanted prior to December 30, 1970.
(ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
T, a fiscal year taxpayer with a taxable year of July 1, 1969, through v June 30, 1970, plants a citrus grove on August 1, 1969. Since the grove was planted prior to December 30, 1969, no expenses incurred with respect to the grove shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (a).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that T plants the grove on March 1, 1970. Since the grove was planted after December 30, 1969, all amounts allowable as deductions (without regard to section 278 or this section) and attributable to the grove shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (a). However, since paragraph (a) applies only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, T must capitalize only those amounts incurred during his taxable years ending in 1971, 1972, and 1973.
[T.D. 7098, 36 FR 5214, Mar. 18, 1971, as amended by T.D. 7136, 36 FR 14731, Aug. 11, 1971]
§ 1.279-1
General rule; purpose.
An obligation issued to provide a consideration directly or indirectly for a corporate acquisition, although constituting a debt under section 385, may have characteristics which make it
more appropriate that the participation in the corporation which the obligation represents be treated for purposes of the deduction of interest as if it were a stockholder interest rather than a creditors interest. To deal with such cases, section 279 imposes certain limitations on the deductibility of interest paid or incurred on obligations which have certain equity characteristics and are classified as corporate acquisition indebtedness. Generally, section 279 provides that no deduction will be allowed for any interest paid or incurred by a corporation during the taxable year with respect to its corporate acquisition indebtedness to the extent such interest exceeds $5 million. However, the $5 million limitation is reduced by the amount of interest paid or incurred on obligations issued under the circumstances described in section 279(a)(2) but which are not corporate acquisition indebtedness. Section 279(b) provides that an obligation will be corporate acquisition indebtedness if it was issued under certain circumstances and meets the four tests enumerated therein. Although an obligation may satisfy the conditions referred to in the preceding sentence, it may still escape classification as corporate acquisition indebtedness if the conditions as described in sections 279(d) (3), (4), and (5), 279(f), or 279(i) are present. However, no inference should be drawn from the rules of section 279 as to whether a particular instrument labeled a bond, debenture, note, or other evidence of indebtedness is in fact a debt. Before the determination as to whether the deduction for payments pursuant to an obligation as described in this section is to be disallowed, the obligation must first qualify as debt in accordance with section 385. If the obligation is not debt under section 385, it will be unnecessary to apply section 279 to any payments pursuant to such obligation.
[T.D. 7262, 38 FR 5844, Mar. 5, 1973]
§ 1.279-2
Amount of disallowance of interest on corporate acquisition indebtedness.
(a)
In general.
Under section 279(a), no deduction is allowed for any interest paid or incurred by a corporation during the taxable year with respect to its corporate acquisition indebtedness to the extent that such interest exceeds:
(1) $5 million, reduced by
(2) The amount of interest paid or incurred by such corporation during such year on any obligation issued after December 31, 1967, to provide consideration directly or indirectly for an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1) but which is not corporate acquisition indebtedness. Such an obligation is not corporate acquisition indebtedness if it:
(i) Was issued prior to October 10, 1969, or
(ii) Was issued after October 9, 1969, but does not meet any one or more of the tests of section 279(b) (2), (3), or (4), or
(iii) Was originally deemed to be corporate acquisition indebtedness but is no longer so treated by virtue of the application of paragraphs (3) or (4) of section 279(d) or
(iv) Is specifically excluded from treatment as corporate acquisition indebtedness by virtue of sections 279(d)(5), (f), or (i).
The computation of the amount by which the $5 million limitation described in this paragraph is to be reduced with respect to any taxable year is to be made as of the last day of the taxable year in which an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1) occurs. In no case shall the $5 million limitation be reduced below zero.
(b)
Certain terms defined.
When used in section 279 and the regulations thereunder:
(1) The term
issued
includes the giving of a note or other evidence of indebtedness to a bank or other lender as well as an issuance of a bond or debenture. In the case of obligations which are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the date of issue is the date on which the issue is first offered to the public. In the case of obligations which are not so registered, the date of issue is the date on which the obligation is sold to the first purchaser.
(2) The term
interest
includes both stated interest and unstated interest (such as original issue discount as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.163-4 and amounts treated as interest under section 483).
(3) The term
money
means cash and its equivalent.
(4) The term
control
shall have the meaning assigned to such term by section 368(c).
(5) The term
affiliated group
shall have the meaning assigned to such term by section 1504(a), except that all corporations other than the acquired corporation shall be treated as includible corporations (without any exclusion under section 1504(b)) and the acquired corporation shall not be treated as an includible corporation. This definition shall apply whether or not some or all of the members of the affiliated group file a consolidated return.
(c)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On March 4, 1973, X Corporation, a calendar year taxpayer, issues an obligation which satisfies the test of section 279(b)(1) but fails to satisfy either of the tests of section 279(b) (2) or (3). Since at least one of the tests of section 279(b) is not satisfied the obligation is not corporate acquisition indebtedness. However, since the test of section 279(b)(1) is satisfied, the interest on the obligation will reduce the $5 million limitation provided by section 279 (a)(1).

# Example 2.
On January 1, 1969, X Corporation, a calendar year taxpayer, issues an obligation, which satisfies all the tests of section 279(b), requiring it to pay $3.5 million of interest each year. Since the obligation was issued before October 10, 1969, the obligation cannot be corporate acquisition indebtedness, and a deduction for the $3.5 million of interest attributable to such obligation is not subject to disallowance under section 279(a). However, since the obligation was issued after December 31, 1967, in an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1), under section 279(a)(2) the $3.5 million of interest attributable to such obligation reduces the $5 million limitation provided by section 279(a)(1) to $1.5 million.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2.
Assume further that on January 1, 1970, X Corporation issues more obligations which are classified as corporate acquisition indebtedness and which require X Corporation to pay $4 million of interest each year. For 1970 the amount of interest paid or accrued on corporate acquisition indebtedness, which may be deducted is $1.5 million ($5 million maximum provided by section 279(a)(1) less $3.5 million, the reduction required under section 279(a)(2)). Thus, $2.5 million of the $4 million interest incurred on a corporate acquisition indebtedness is subject to disallowance under section 279(a) for the taxable year 1970.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3.
Assume further that on the last day of each of the taxable years 1971, 1972, and 1973 of X Corporation neither of the conditions described in section 279(b)(4) was present.
Under these circumstances, such obligations for all taxable years after 1973 are not corporate acquisition indebtedness under section 279(d)(4). Therefore, the $2.5 million of interest previously not deductible is not deductible for all taxable years after 1973. Although such obligations are no longer treated as corporate acquisition indebtedness, the interest attributable thereto must be applied in further reduction of the $5 million limitation. The $5 million limitation of section 279(a)(1) is therefore reduced to zero. While the limitation is at the zero level any interest paid or incurred on corporate acquisition indebtedness will be disallowed.
[T.D. 7262, 38 FR 5844, Mar. 5, 1973]
§ 1.279-3
Corporate acquisition indebtedness.
(a)
Corporate acquisition indebtedness.
For purposes of section 279, the term
corporate acquisition indebtedness
means any obligation evidenced by a bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness issued after October 9, 1969, by a corporation (referred to in section 279 and the regulations thereunder as “issuing corporation”) if the obligation is issued to provide consideration directly or indirectly for the acquisition of stock in, or certain assets of, another corporation (as described in paragraph (b) of this § 1.279-3), is “subordinated” (as described in paragraph (c) of this § 1.279-3), is “convertible” (as described in paragraph (d) of this § 1.279-3), and satisfies either the ratio of debt to equity test (as described in paragraph (f) of § 1.279-5) or the projected earnings test (as described in paragraph (d) of § 1.279-5).
(b)
Acquisition of stock or assets.
(1) Section 279(b)(1) describes one of the tests to be satisfied if an obligation is to be classified as corporate acquisition indebtedness. Under section 279(b)(1), the obligation must be issued to provide consideration directly or indirectly for the acquisition of:
(i) Stock (whether voting or nonvoting) in another corporation (referred to in section 279 and the regulations thereunder as “acquired corporation”), or
(ii) Assets of another corporation (referred to in section 279 and the regulations thereunder as “acquired corporation”) pursuant to a plan under which at least two-thirds (in value) of all the assets (excluding money) used in trades or businesses carried on by such corporation are acquired.
The fact that the corporation that issues the obligation is not the same corporation that acquires the acquired corporation does not prevent the application of section 279. For example, if X Corporation acquires all the stock of Y Corporation through the utilization of an obligation of Z Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of X Corporation, this section will apply.
(2)
Direct or indirect consideration.
Obligations are issued to provide direct consideration for an acquisition within the meaning of section 279(b)(1) where the obligations are issued to the shareholders of an acquired corporation in exchange for stock in such acquired corporation or where the obligations are issued to the acquired corporation in exchange for its assets. The application of the provisions of this subsection relating to indirect consideration for an acquisition of stock or assets depends upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the acquisition and the issuance of the obligations. Obligations are issued to provide indirect consideration for an acquisition of stock or assets within the meaning of section 279(b)(1) where (i) at the time of the issuance of the obligations the issuing corporation anticipated the acquisition of such stock or assets and the obligations would not have been issued if the issuing corporation had not so anticipated such acquisition, or where (ii) at the time of the acquisition the issuing corporation foresaw or reasonably should have foreseen that it would be required to issue obligations, which it would not have otherwise been required to issue if the acquisition had not occurred, in order to meet its future economic needs.
(3)
Stock acquisition.
(i) For purposes of section 279, an acquisition in which the issuing corporation issues an obligation to provide consideration directly or indirectly for the acquisition of stock in the acquired corporation shall be treated as a stock acquisition within the meaning of section 279(b)(1)(A). Where the stock of one corporation is acquired from another corporation and such stock constitutes at least two-thirds (in value) of all the assets (excluding money) of the latter corporation, such acquisition shall be deemed an asset acquisition as described in section 279(b)(1)(B) and subparagraph (4) of this section. If the issuing corporation acquires less than two-thirds (in value) of all the assets (excluding money) used in trades or businesses carried on by the acquired corporation within the meaning of section 279(b)(1)(B) and subparagraph (4) of this paragraph and such assets include stock of another corporation, the acquisition of such stock is a stock acquisition within the meaning of section 279(b)(1)(A) and of this subparagraph. In such a case the amount of the obligation which is characterized as corporate acquisition indebtedness shall bear the same relationship to the total amount of the obligation issued as the fair market value of the stock acquired bears to the total of the fair market value of the assets acquired and stock acquired, as of the date of acquisition. For rules with respect to acquisitions of stock, where the total amount of stock of the acquired corporation held by the issuing corporation never exceeded 5 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the acquired corporation entitled to vote, see § 1.279-4(b)(1).
(ii) If the issuing corporation acquired stock of an acquired corporation in an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1)(A), and liquidated the acquired corporation under section 334(b)(2) and the regulations thereunder before the last day of the taxable year in which such stock acquisition is made, such obligation issued to provide consideration directly or indirectly to acquire such stock of the acquired corporation shall be considered as issued in an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1)(B).
(4)
Asset acquisition.
(i) For purposes of section 279, an acquisition in which the issuing corporation issues an obligation to provide consideration directly or indirectly for the acquisition of assets of an acquired corporation pursuant to a plan under which at least
two-thirds of the gross value of all the assets (excluding money) used in trades and businesses carried on by such acquired corporation are acquired shall be treated as an asset acquisition within the meaning of section 279(b)(1)(B). For purposes of section 279(b)(1)(B), the gross value of any acquired asset shall be its fair market value as of the day of its acquisition. In determining the fair market value of an asset, no reduction shall be made for any liabilities, mortgages, liens, or other encumbrances to which the asset or any part thereof may be subjected. For purposes of this subparagraph, an asset which has been actually used in the trades and businesses of a corporation but which is temporarily not being used in such trades and businesses shall be treated as if it is being used in such manner. For purposes of this paragraph, the day of acquisition will be determined by reference to the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction.
(ii) For purposes of the two-thirds test described in section 279(b)(1)(B), the stock of any corporation which is controlled by the acquired corporation shall be considered as an asset used in the trades and businesses of such acquired corporation.
(5)
Certain nontaxable transactions.
(i) Under section 279(e), an acquisition of stock of a corporation of which the issuing corporation is in control in a transaction in which gain or loss is not recognized shall be deemed an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1)(A) only if immediately before such transaction the acquired corporation was in existence, and the issuing corporation was not in control of such corporation. If the issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated group, then in accordance with section 279(g), the affiliated group shall be treated as the issuing corporation. Thus, any stock of the acquired corporation, owned by members of the affiliated group, shall be aggregated in determining whether the issuing corporation was in control of the acquired corporation.
(ii) The $5 million limitation provided by section 279(a)(1) is not reduced by the interest on an obligation issued in a transaction which, under section 279 (e), is deemed not to be an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1).
(iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On January 1, 1973, W Corporation, a calendar year taxpayer, issues to the public 10,000 10 year convertible bonds each with a principal of $1,000 for $9 million. On June 6, 1973, W Corporation transfers the $9 million proceeds of such bond issue to X Corporation in exchange for X Corporation's common stock in a transaction that satisfies the provisions of section 351(a). On December 31, 1973, W Corporation's ratio of debt to equity is 1
1/2
to 1 and its project earnings exceed three times the annual interest to be paid or incurred. Immediately prior to the transaction between the two corporations W Corporation owned no stock in X Corporation which had been in existence for several years. However, immediately after this transaction W Corporation is in control of X Corporation. Since X Corporation, the acquired corporation, was in existence and W Corporation, the issuing corporation, was not in control of X Corporation immediately before the section 351 transaction (a transaction in which gain or loss is not recognized) and since W Corporation is now in control of X Corporation, the acquisition of X Corporation's common stock by W Corporation is not protected from treatment as an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1)(A). However, the obligation will not be deemed to be corporate acquisition indebtedness since the test of section 279(b)(4) is not met. The interest on the obligation will reduce the $5 million limitation of section 279(a).

# Example 2.
Assume the facts are the same as described in
Example 1,
except that X Corporation was not in existence prior to June 6, 1973, but rather is newly created by W Corporation on such date. Since X Corporation, the acquired corporation, was not in existence before June 6, 1973, the date on which W Corporation, the issuing corporation, acquired control of X Corporation in a transaction on which gain or loss is not recognized, the acquisition is not deemed to be an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1)(A). Thus, under the provisions of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the $5 million limitation provided by section 279(a)(1) will not be reduced by the yearly interest incurred on the convertible bonds issued by W Corporation.

# Example 3.
Assume that the facts are the same as described in
Example 1,
except that W Corporation was in control of X Corporation immediately before the transaction. Since W Corporation was in control of X Corporation immediately before the section
351(a) transaction and is in control of X Corporation after such transaction, the result will be the same as in
Example 2.
(c)
Subordinated obligation
—(1)
In general.
An obligation which is issued to provide consideration for an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1) is subordinated within the meaning of section 279(b)(2) if it is either:
(i) Subordinated to the claims of trade creditors of the issuing corporation generally, or
(ii) Expressly subordinated in right of payment to the payment of any substantial amount of unsecured indebtedness, whether outstanding or subsequently issued, of the issuing corporation, irrespective of whether such subordination relates to payment of interest, or principal, or both. In applying section 279 (b)(2) and this paragraph in any case where the issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated group of corporations, the affiliated group shall be treated as the issuing corporation.
(2)
Expressly subordinated obligation.
In applying subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, an obligation is considered expressly subordinated whether the terms of the subordination are provided in the evidence of indebtedness itself, or in another agreement between the parties to such obligation. An obligation shall be considered to be expressly subordinated within the meaning of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph if such obligation by its terms can become subordinated in right of payment to the payment of any substantial amount of unsecured indebtedness which is outstanding or which may be issued subsequently. However, an obligation shall not be considered expressly subordinated if such subordination occurs solely by operation of law, such as in the case of bankruptcy laws. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
substantial amount of unsecured indebtedness
means an amount of unsecured indebtedness equal to 5 percent or more of the face amount of the obligations issued within the meaning of section 279(b)(1).
(d)
Convertible obligation.
An obligation which is issued to provide consideration directly or indirectly for an acquisition described in section 279 (b)(1) is convertible within the meaning of section 279(b)(3) if it is either—(1) Convertible directly or indirectly into stock of the issuing corporation, or (2) Part of an investment unit or other arrangement which includes, in addition to such bond or other evidence of indebtedness, an option to acquire directly or indirectly stock in the issuing corporation. Stock warrants or convertible preferred stock included as part of an investment unit constitute options within the meaning of the preceding sentence. Indebtedness is indirectly convertible if the conversion feature gives the holder the right to convert into another bond of the issuing corporation which is then convertible into the stock of the issuing corporation. In any case where the corporation which in fact issues an obligation to provide consideration for an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1) is a member of an affiliated group, the provisions of section 279(b)(3) and this paragraph are deemed satisfied if the stock into which either the obligation or option which is part of an investment unit or other arrangement is convertible, directly or indirectly, is stock of any member of the affiliated group.
(e)
Ratio of debt to equity and projected earnings test.
For rules with respect to the application of section 279(b)(4) (relating to the ratio of debt to equity and the ratio of projected earnings to annual interest to be paid or incurred), see paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of § 1.279-5.
(f)
Certain obligations issued after October 9, 1969
—(1)
In general.
Under section 279(i), an obligation shall not be corporate acquisition indebtedness if such obligation is issued after October 9, 1969, to provide consideration for the acquisition of:
(i) Stock or assets pursuant to a binding written contract which was in effect on October 9, 1969, and at all times thereafter before such acquisition, or
(ii) Stock in any corporation where the issuing corporation, on October 9, 1969, and at all times thereafter before such acquisition, owned at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the acquired corporation.
Subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall cease to apply when (at any time on or after October 9, 1969) the issuing
corporation has acquired control of the acquired corporation. The interest attributable to any obligation which satisfies the conditions stated in the first sentence of this subparagraph shall reduce the $5 million limitation of section 279(a)(1).
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On September 5, 1969, M Corporation, a calendar year taxpayer, entered into a binding written contract with N Corporation to purchase 20 percent of the voting stock of N Corporation. The contract was in effect on October 9, 1969, and at all times thereafter before the acquisition of the stock on January 1, 1970. Pursuant to such contract M Corporation issued on January 1, 1970, to N Corporation an obligation which satisfies the tests of section 279(b) requiring it to pay $1 million of interest each year. However, under the provisions of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, such obligation is not corporate acquisition indebtedness since it was issued to provide consideration for the acquisition of stock pursuant to a binding written contract which was in effect on October 9, 1969, and at all times thereafter before such acquisition. The $1 million of yearly interest on the obligation reduces the $5 million limitation provided for in section 279(a)(1) to $4 million since such interest is attributable to an obligation which was issued to provide consideration for the acquisition of stock in an acquired corporation.

# Example 2.
On October 9, 1969, O Corporation, a calendar year taxpayer, owned 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of P Corporation. P Corporation has no other class of stock. On January 1, 1970, while still owning such voting stock O Corporation issued to the shareholders of P Corporation to provide consideration for an additional 40 percent of P Corporation's voting stock an obligation which satisfied the tests of section 279(b) requiring it to pay $4 million of interest each year. Hence, O Corporation acquired control of P Corporation, and the provisions of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph ceased to apply to O Corporation. Thus, 75 percent of the obligation issued by O Corporation to provide consideration for the stock of P Corporation is not corporate acquisition indebtedness (that is, of the 40 percent of the voting stock of P Corporation which was acquired, only 30 percent was needed to give O Corporation control). Since 25 percent of the obligation is corporate acquisition indebtedness, $1 million of interest attributable to such obligation is subject to disallowance under section 279(a) for the taxable year 1970. The remaining $3 million of interest attributable to the obligation will reduce the $5 million limitation provided by in section 279(a)(1).
(g)
Exemptions for certain acquisitions of foreign corporations
—(1)
In general.
Under section 279(f), the term
corporate acquisition indebtedness
does not include any indebtedness issued to any person to provide consideration directly or indirectly for the acquisition of stock in, or assets of, any foreign corporation substantially all the income of which, for the 3-year period ending with the date of such acquisition or for such part of such period as the foreign corporation was in existence, is from sources without the United States. The interest attributable to any obligation excluded from treatment as corporate acquisition indebtedness by reason of this paragraph shall reduce the $5 million limitation of 279(a)(1).
(2)
Foreign corporation.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term
foreign corporation
shall have the same meaning as in section 7701(a)(5).
(3)
Income from sources without the United States.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term
income from sources without the United States
shall be determined in accordance with sections 862 and 863. If more than 80 percent of a foreign corporation's gross income is derived from sources without the United States, such corporation shall be considered to be deriving substantially all of its income from sources without the United States.
[T.D. 7262, 38 FR 5845, Mar. 5, 1973]
§ 1.279-4
Special rules.
(a)
Special 3-year rule.
Under section 279(d)(4), if an obligation which has been deemed to be corporate acquisition indebtedness for any taxable year would not be such indebtedness for each of any 3 consecutive taxable years thereafter if the ratio of debt to equity and the ratio of projected earnings to annual interest to be paid or incurred of section 279 (b)(4) were applied as of the close of each of such 3 years, then such obligation shall not be corporate acquisition indebtedness for any taxable years after such 3 consecutive taxable years. The test prescribed by section 279(b)(4) shall be applied as of the close of any taxable year whether or not the issuing corporation issues any
obligation to provide consideration for an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1) in such taxable year. Thus, for example, if a corporation, reporting income on a calendar year basis, has an obligation outstanding as of December 31, 1975, which was classified as a corporate acquisition indebtedness as of the close of 1972 and such obligation would not have been classified as corporate acquisition indebtedness as of the close of 1973, 1974, and 1975 because neither of the conditions of section 279(b)(4) were present as of such dates, then such obligation shall not be corporate acquisition indebtedness for 1976 and all taxable years thereafter. Such obligation shall not be reclassified as corporate acquisition indebtedness in any taxable year following 1975, even if the issuing corporation issues more obligations (whether or not found to be corporate acquisition indebtedness) in such later years to provide consideration for the acquisition of additional stock in, or assets of, the same acquired corporation with respect to which the original obligation was issued. The interest attributable to such obligation shall reduce the $5 million limitation provided by section 279(a)(1) for 1976 and all taxable years thereafter.
(b)
Five percent stock rule
—(1)
In general.
Under section 279(d)(5), if an obligation issued to provide consideration for an acquisition of stock in another corporation meets the tests of section 279(b), such obligation shall be corporate acquisition indebtedness for a taxable year only if at sometime after October 9, 1969, and before the close of such year the issuing corporation owns or has owned 5 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in the acquired corporation. If the issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated group, then in accordance with section 279(g) the affiliated group shall be treated as the issuing corporation. Thus, any stock of the acquired corporation owned by members of the affiliated group shall be aggregated to determine if the percentage limitation provided by this subparagraph is exceeded. Once an obligation is deemed to be corporate acquisition indebtedness such obligation will continue to be deemed corporate acquisition indebtedness for all taxable years thereafter unless the provisions of section 279(d) (3) or (4) apply, notwithstanding the fact that the issuing corporation owns less than 5 percent of the combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the acquired corporation in any or all taxable years thereafter.
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation Y uses the calendar year as its taxable year and has only one class of stock outstanding. On June 1, 1972, X Corporation which is also a calendar year taxpayer and which has never been a shareholder of Y Corporation acquires from the shareholders of Y Corporation 4 percent of the stock of Y Corporation in exchange for obligations which satisfy the conditions of section 279(b). At no time during 1972 does X Corporation own 5 percent or more of the stock of Y Corporation. Accordingly, under the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, for 1972 the obligations issued by X Corporation to provide consideration for the acquisition of Y Corporation's stock do not constitute corporate acquisition indebtedness.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1.
Assume further that on February 24, 1973, X Corporation acquires from the shareholders of Y Corporation an additional 7 percent of the stock of Y Corporation in exchange for obligations which satisfy all of the tests of section 279(b). On December 28, 1973, X Corporation sells all of its stock in Y Corporation. For 1973, the obligations issued by X Corporation in 1972 and in 1973 constitute corporate acquisition indebtedness since X Corporation at some time after October 9, 1969, and before the close of 1973 owned 5 percent or more of the voting stock of Y Corporation. Furthermore, such obligations shall be corporate acquisition indebtedness for all taxable years thereafter unless the special provisions of section 279(d) (3) or (4) could apply.
(c)
Changes in obligation
—(1)
In general.
Under section 279(h), for purposes of section 279:
(i) Any extension, renewal, or refinancing of an obligation evidencing a preexisting indebtedness shall not be deemed to be the issuance of a new obligation, and
(ii) Any obligation which is corporate acquisition indebtedness of the issuing corporation is also corporate acquisition indebtedness of any corporation
which in any transaction or by operation of law assumes liability for such obligation or becomes liable for such obligation as guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor.
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On January 1, 1971, X Corporation, which files its return on the basis of a calendar year, issues an obligation, which satisfies the tests of section 279(b), and is deemed to be corporate acquisition indebtedness. On January 1, 1973, an agreement is concluded between X Corporation and the holder of the obligation whereby the maturity date of such obligation is extended until December 31, 1979. Under the provisions of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph such extended obligation is not deemed to be a new obligation, and still constitutes corporate acquisition indebtedness.

# Example 2.
On June 12, 1971, X Corporation, a calendar year taxpayer, issued convertible and subordinated obligations to acquire the stock of Z Corporation. The obligations were deemed corporate acquisition indebtedness on December 31, 1971. On March 4, 1973, X Corporation and Y Corporation consolidated to form XY Corporation in accordance with State law. Corporation XY is liable for the obligations issued by X Corporation by operation of law and the obligations continue to be corporate acquisition indebtedness. In 1975 XY Corporation exchanges its own nonconvertible obligations for the obligations X Corporation issued. The obligations of XY Corporation issued in exchange for those of X Corporation will be deemed to be corporate acquisition indebtedness.
[T.D. 7262, 38 FR 5847, Mar. 5, 1973; 38 FR 6893, Mar. 14, 1973]
§ 1.279-5
Rules for application of section 279(b).
(a)
Taxable years to which applicable
—(1)
First year of disallowance.
Under section 279(d)(1), the deduction of interest on any obligation shall not be disallowed under section 279(a) before the first taxable year of the issuing corporation as of the last day of which the application of either section 279(b)(4) (A) or (B) results in such obligation being classified as corporate acquisition indebtedness. See section 279(c)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the time when an obligation is subjected to the test of section 279(b)(4).
(2)
General rule for succeeding years.
Under section 279(d)(2), except as provided in paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of section 279(d), if an obligation is determined to be corporate acquisition indebtedness as of the last day of any taxable year of the issuing corporation, such obligation shall be corporate acquisition indebtedness for such taxable year and all subsequent taxable years.
(b)
Time of determination
—(1)
In general.
The determination of whether an obligation meets the conditions of section 279(b) (1), (2), and (3) shall be made as of the day on which the obligation is issued.
(2)
Ratio of debt to equity, projected earnings, and annual interest to be paid or incurred.
(i) Under section 279(c)(1), the determination of whether an obligation meets the conditions of section 279(b)(4) is first to be made as of the last day of the taxable year of the issuing corporation in which it issues the obligation to provide consideration directly or indirectly for an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1) of stock in, or assets of, the acquired corporation. An obligation which is not corporate acquisition indebtedness only because it does not satisfy the test of section 279(b)(4) in the taxable year of the issuing corporation in which the obligation is issued for stock in, or assets of, the acquired corporation may be subjected to the test of section 279(b)(4) again. A retesting will occur in any subsequent taxable year of the issuing corporation in which the issuing corporation issues any obligation to provide consideration directly or indirectly for an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1) with respect to the same acquired corporation, irrespective of whether such subsequent obligation is itself classified as corporate acquisition indebtedness. If the issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated group, then in accordance with section 279(g) the affiliated group shall be treated as the issuing corporation. Thus, if any member of the affiliated group issues an obligation to acquire additional stock in, or assets of, the acquired corporation, this paragraph shall apply.
(ii) For purposes of section 279(b)(4) and this paragraph, in any case where the issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated group (see section 279(g) and § 1.279-6 for rules regarding application of section 279 to certain affiliated
groups) which does not file a consolidated return and all the members of which do not have the same taxable year, determinations with respect to the ratio of debt to equity of, and projected earnings of, and annual interest to be paid or incurred by, any member of the affiliated group shall be made as of the last day of the taxable year of the corporation which in fact issues the obligation to provide consideration for an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1).
(3)
Redetermination where control or substantially all the properties have been acquired.
Under section 279(d)(3), if an obligation is determined to be corporate acquisition indebtedness as of the close of a taxable year of the issuing corporation in which section 279(c)(3)(A)(i) (relating to the projected earnings of the issuing corporation only) applied, but would not be corporate acquisition indebtedness if the determination were made as of the close of the first taxable year of such corporation thereafter in which section 279(c)(3)(A)(ii) (relating to the projected earnings of both the issuing corporation and the acquired corporation) could apply, such obligation shall be considered not to be corporate acquisition indebtedness for such later taxable year and all taxable years thereafter. Where an obligation ceases to be corporate acquisition indebtedness as a result of the application of this paragraph, the interest on such obligation shall not be disallowed under section 279(a) as a deduction for the taxable year in which the obligation ceases to be corporate acquisition indebtedness and all taxable years thereafter. However, under section 279(a)(2) the interest paid or incurred on such obligation which is allowed as a deduction will reduce the $5 million limitation provided by section 279(a)(1).
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 1971, X Corporation, which files its Federal income tax return on the basis of a calendar year, issues its obligations to provide consideration for the acquisition of 15 percent of the voting stock of both Y Corporation and Z Corporation. Y Corporation and Z Corporation each have only one class of stock. When issued, such obligations satisfied the tests prescribed in section 279(b) (1), (2), and (3) and would have constituted corporate acquisition indebtedness but for the test prescribed in section 279(b)(4). On December 31, 1971, the application of section 279(b)(4) results in X Corporation's obligations issued in 1971 not being treated as corporate acquisition indebtedness for that year.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that in 1972, X Corporation issues more obligations which come within the tests of section 279(b) (1), (2), and (3) to acquire an additional 10 percent of the voting stock of Y Corporation. No stock of Z Corporation is acquired after 1971. The application of section 279(b)(4)(B) (relating to the projected earnings of X Corporation) as of the end of 1972 results in the obligations issued in 1972 to provide consideration for the acquisition of the stock of Y Corporation being treated as corporate acquisition indebtedness. Since X Corporation during 1972 did issue obligations to acquire more stock of Y Corporation, under the provisions of section 279(c)(1) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph the obligations issued by X Corporation in 1971 to acquire stock in Y Corporation are again tested to determine whether the test of section 279(b)(4) with respect to such obligations is satisfied for 1972. Thus, since such obligations issued by X Corporation to acquire Y Corporation's stock in 1971 previously came within the provisions of section 279(b) (1), (2), and (3) and the projected earnings test of section 279(b)(4)(B) is satisfied for 1972, all of such obligations are to be deemed to constitute corporate acquisition indebtedness for 1972 and subsequent taxable years. The obligations issued in 1971 to acquire stock in Z Corporation continue not to constitute corporate acquisition indebtedness.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Examples 1
and
2.
In 1973, X Corporation issues more obligations which come within the tests of section 279(b) (1), (2), and (3) to acquire more stock (but not control) in Y Corporation. On December 31, 1973, it is determined with respect to X Corporation that neither of the conditions described in section 279(b)(4) are present. Thus, the obligations issued in 1973 do not constitute corporate acquisition indebtedness. However, the obligations issued in 1971 and 1972 by X Corporation to acquire stock in Y Corporation continue to be treated as corporate acquisition indebtedness.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3,
except that X Corporation acquires control of Y Corporation in 1973. Since X Corporation has acquired control of Y Corporation, the average annual earnings (as defined in section 279(c)(3)(B) and the annual interest to be paid or incurred (as provided by section 279(c)(4)) of both X Corporation and Y Corporation under section 279(c)(3)(A)(ii) are taken into account in
computing for 1973 the ratio of projected earnings to annual interest to be paid or incurred described in section 279(b)(4)(B). Assume further that after applying section 279(b)(4)(B) the obligations issued in 1973 escape treatment as corporate acquisition indebtedness for 1973. Under section 279(d)(3), all of the obligations issued by X Corporation to acquire stock in Y Corporation in 1971 and 1972 are removed from classification as corporate acquisition indebtedness for 1973 and all subsequent taxable years.

# Example 5.
In 1975, M Corporation, which files its Federal income tax return on the basis of a calendar year, issues its obligations to acquire 30 percent of the voting stock of N Corporation. N Corporation has only one class of stock. Such obligations satisfy the tests prescribed in section 279(b) (1), (2), and (3). Additionally, as of the close of 1975, M Corporation's ratio of debt to equity exceeds the ratio of 2 to 1 and its projected earnings do not exceed three times the annual interest to be paid or incurred. The obligations issued by M Corporation are corporate acquisition indebtedness for 1975 since all the provisions of section 279(b) are satisfied. In 1976 M Corporation issues its obligations to acquire from the shareholders of N Corporation an additional 60 percent of the voting stock of N Corporation, thereby acquiring control of N Corporation. However, with respect to the obligations issued by M Corporation in 1975, there is no redetermination under section 279(d)(3) and subparagraph (3) of this paragraph as to whether such obligations may escape classification as corporate acquisition indebtedness because in 1975 it was the ratio of debt to equity test which caused such obligations to be corporate acquisition indebtedness. If in 1975, M Corporation met the conditions of section 279(b)(4) solely because of the ratio of projected earnings to annual interest to be paid or incurred described in section 279(b)(4)(B), its obligation issued in 1975 could be retested in 1976.
(c)
Acquisition of stock or assets of several corporations.
An issuing corporation which acquires stock in, or assets of, more than one corporation during any taxable year must apply the tests described in section 279(b) (1), (2), and (3) separately with respect to each obligation issued to provide consideration for the acquisition of the stock in, or assets of, each such acquired corporation. Thus, if an acquisition is made with obligations of the issuing corporation that satisfy the tests described in section 279(b) (2) and (3) and obligations that fail to satisfy such tests, only those obligations satisfying such tests need be further considered to determine whether they constitute corporate acquisition indebtedness. Those obligations which meet the test of section 279(b)(1) but which are not deemed corporate acquisition indebtedness shall be taken into account for purposes of determining the reduction in the $5 million limitation of section 279(a)(1).
(d)
Ratio of debt to equity and projected earnings
—(1)
In general.
One of the four tests to determine whether an obligation constitutes corporate acquisition indebtedness is contained in section 279(b)(4). An obligation will meet the test of section 279(b)(4) if, as of a day determined under section 279(c)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, either:
(i) The ratio of debt to equity (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section) of the issuing corporation exceeds 2 to 1, or
(ii) The projected earnings (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) of the issuing corporation, or of both the issuing corporation and acquired corporation in any case where subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph is applicable, do not exceed three times the annual interest to be paid or incurred (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section) by such issuing corporation, or, where applicable, by such issuing corporation and acquired corporation. Where paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (e)(1)(ii) of this section are applicable in computing projected earnings and annual interest to be paid or incurred, 100 percent of the acquired corporation's projected earnings and annual interest to be paid or incurred shall be included in such computation, even though less than all of the stock or assets of the acquired corporation have been acquired.
(2)
Projected earnings.
The term
projected earnings
means the “average annual earnings” (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) of:
(i) The issuing corporation only, if subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, does not apply, or
(ii) Both the issuing corporation and the acquired corporation, in any case where the issuing corporation as of the close of its taxable year has acquired control, or has acquired substantially all of the properties, of the acquired corporation.
For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, an acquisition of “substantially all of the properties” of the acquired corporation means the acquisition of assets representing at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by the acquired corporation immediately prior to the acquisition.
(3)
Average annual earnings.
(i) The term
average annual earnings
referred to in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is, for any corporation, the amount of its earnings and profits for any 3-year period ending with the last day of a taxable year of the issuing corporation in which it issues any obligation to provide consideration for an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1), computed without reduction for:
(
a
) Interest paid or incurred,
(
b
) Depreciation or amortization allowed under Chapter 1 of the Code,
(
c
) Liability for tax under Chapter 1 of the Code, and
(
d
) Distributions to which section 301(c)(1) apply (other than such distributions from the acquired corporation to the issuing corporation), and reduced to an annual average for such 3-year period. For the rules to determine the amount of earnings and profits of any corporation, see section 312 and the regulations thereunder.
(ii) Except as provided for in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, for purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph in the case of any corporation, the earnings and profits for such 3-year period shall be reduced to an annual average by dividing such earnings and profits by 36 and multiplying the quotient by 12. If a corporation was not in existence during the entire 36-month period as of the close of the taxable year referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, its average annual earnings shall be determined by dividing its earnings and profits for the period of its existence by the number of whole calendar months in such period and multiplying the quotient by 12.
(iii) Where the issuing corporation acquires substantially all of the properties of an acquired corporation, the computation of earnings and profits of such acquired corporation shall be made for the period of such corporation beginning with the first day of the 3-year period of the issuing corporation and ending with the last day prior to the date on which substantially all of the properties were acquired. In determining the number of whole calendar months for such acquired corporation where the period for determining its earnings and profits includes 2 months which are not whole calendar months and the total number of days in such 2 fractional months exceeds 30 days, the number of whole calendar months for such period shall be increased by one. Where the number of days in the 2 fractional months total 30 days or less such fractional months shall be disregarded. After the number of whole calendar months is determined, the calculation for average annual earnings shall be made in the same manner as described in the last sentence of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.
(e)
Annual interest to be paid or incurred
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 279(b)(4)(B), the term
annual interest to be paid or incurred
means:
(i) If subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph does not apply, the annual interest to be paid or incurred by the issuing corporation only, for the taxable year beginning immediately after the day described in section 279(c)(1), determined by reference to its total indebtedness outstanding as of such day, or
(ii) If projected earnings are determined under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the annual interest to be paid or incurred by both the issuing corporation and the acquired corporation for 1 year beginning immediately after the day described in section 279(c)(1), determined by reference to their combined total indebtedness outstanding as of such day. However, where the issuing corporation acquires substantially all of the properties of the acquired corporation, the annual interest to be paid or incurred will be determined by reference to the total indebtedness outstanding of the issuing corporation only (including any indebtedness it assumed in the acquisition) as of the day described in section 279(c)(1).
The term
annual interest to be paid or incurred
refers to both actual interest and unstated interest. Such unstated
interest includes original issue discount as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.163-4 and amounts treated as interest under section 483. For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (f) of this section (relating to the ratio of debt to equity), the indebtedness of any corporation shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Thus, for example, the indebtedness of a corporation includes short-term liabilities, such as accounts payable to suppliers, as well as long-term indebtedness. Contingent liabilities, such as those arising out of discounted notes, the assignment of accounts receivable, or the guarantee of the liability of another, shall be included in the determination of the indebtedness of a corporation if the contingency is likely to become a reality. In addition, the indebtedness of a corporation includes obligations issued by the corporation, secured only by property of the corporation, and with respect to which the corporation is not personally liable. See section 279(g) and § 1.279-6 for rules with respect to the computation of annual interest to be paid or incurred in regard to members of an affiliated group of corporations.
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of these paragraphs may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X's earnings and profits calculated in accordance with section 279(c)(3)(B) for 1972, 1971, and 1970 respectively were $29 million, $23 million, and $20 million. The interest to be paid or incurred during the calendar year of 1973 as determined by reference to the issuing corporation's total outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 1972, was $10 million. By dividing the sum of the earnings and profits for the 3 years by 36 (the number of whole calendar months in the 3-year period) and multiplying the quotient by 12, the average annual earnings for X Corporation is $24 million. Since the projected earnings of X Corporation do not exceed by three times the annual interest to be paid or incurred (they exceed by only 2.4 times), one of the circumstances described in section 279(b)(4) is present.

# Example 2.
On March 1, 1972, W Corporation acquires substantially all of the properties of Z Corporation in exchange for W Corporation's bonds which satisfy the tests of section 279(b) (2) and (3). W Corporation files its income tax returns on the basis of fiscal years ending June 30. Z Corporation, which was formed on September 1, 1969, is a calendar year taxpayer. The earnings and profits of W Corporation for the last 3 fiscal years ending June 30, 1972, calculated in accordance with the provisions of section 279(c)(3)(B) were $300 million, $400 million, and $380 million, respectively. The average annual earnings of W Corporation is $360 million ($1,080 million ÷ 36 × 12). The earnings and profits of Z Corporation calculated in accordance with the provisions of section 279(c)(3)(B) were $4 million for the period of September 1, 1969 to December 31, 1969, $10 million and $14 million for the calendar years of 1970 and 1971, respectively, and $2 million for the period of January 1, 1972, through February 29, 1972, or a total of $30 million. To arrive at the average annual earnings, the sum of the earnings and profits, $30 million, must be divided by 30 (the number of whole calendar months that Z Corporation was in existence during W Corporation's 3-year period ending with the day prior to the date substantially all the assets were acquired) and the quotient is multiplied by 12, which results in an average annual earnings of $12 million ($30 million ÷ 30 × 12) for Z Corporation. The combined average annual earnings of W Corporation and Z Corporation is $372 million. The interest for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, to be paid or incurred by W Corporation on its outstanding indebtedness as of June 30, 1972, is $110 million. Since the projected earnings exceed the annual interest to be paid or incurred by more than three times, the obligation will not be corporate acquisition indebtedness, unless the issuing corporation's debt to equity ratio exceeds 2 to 1.
(f)
Ratio of debt to equity
—(1)
In general.
The condition described in section 279(b)(4)(A) is present if the ratio of debt to equity of the issuing corporation exceeds 2 to 1. Under section 279(c)(2), the term
ratio of debt to equity
means the ratio which the total indebtedness of the issuing corporation bears to the sum of its money and all its other assets (in an amount equal to adjusted basis for determining gain) less such total indebtedness. For the meaning of the term
indebtedness,
see paragraph (e)(1) of this section. See section 279(g) and § 1.279-6 for rules with respect to the computation of the ratio of debt to equity in regard to an affiliated group of corporations.
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of section 279(b)(4)(A) and this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:
[$5 million interest to be paid or incurred × $80 million owed to X Bank
by its customers/$100 million total indebtedness]

# Example 1.
On June 1, 1971, X Corporation, which files its federal income tax returns on a calendar year basis, issues an obligation for $45 million to the shareholders of Y Corporation to provide consideration for the acquisition of all of the stock of Y Corporation. Such obligation has the characteristics of corporate acquisition indebtedness described in section 279(b) (2) and (3). The projected earnings of X Corporation and Y Corporation exceed 3 times the annual interest to be paid or incurred by those corporations and, accordingly, the condition described in section 279(b)(4)(B) is not present. Also, on December 31, 1971, X Corporation has total assets with an adjusted basis of $150 million (including the newly acquired stock of Y Corporation having a basis of $45 million) and total indebtedness of $90 million. Hence, X Corporation's equity is $60 million computed by subtracting its $90 million of total indebtedness from its $150 million of total assets. Since X Corporation's ratio of debt to equity of 1.5 to 1 ($90 million of total indebtedness over $60 million equity) does not exceed 2 to 1, the condition described in section 279(b)(4)(A) is not present. Therefore, X Corporation's obligation for $45 million is not corporate acquisition indebtedness because on December 31, 1971, neither of the conditions specified in section 279(b)(4) existed.
(g)
Special rules for banks and lending or finance companies
—(1)
Debt to equity and projected earnings.
Under section 279(c)(5), with respect to any corporation which is a bank (as defined in section 581) or is primarily engaged in a lending or finance business, the following rules are to be applied:
(i) In determining under paragraph (f) of this section the ratio of debt to equity of such corporation (or of the affiliated group of which such corporation is a member), the total indebtedness of such corporation (and the assets of such corporation) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the total indebtedness owed to such corporation which arises out of the banking business of such corporation, or out of the lending or finance business of such corporation, as the case may be;
(ii) In determining under paragraph (e) of this section the annual interest to be paid or incurred by such corporation (or by the issuing corporation and acquired corporation referred to in section 279(c)(4)(B) or by the affiliated group of corporations of which such corporation is a member), the amount of such interest (determined without regard to this subparagraph) shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of such interest as the amount of the reduction for the taxable year under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph bears to the total indebtedness of such corporation; and
(iii) In determining under section 279(c)(3)(B) the average annual earnings, the amount of the earnings and profits for the 3-year period shall be reduced by the sum of the reductions under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph for such period.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term
lending or finance business
means a business of making loans or purchasing or discounting accounts receivable, notes, or installment obligations. Additionally, the rules stated in this paragraph regarding the application of the ratio of debt to equity, the determination of the annual interest to be paid or incurred, and the determination of the average annual earnings also apply if the bank or lending or finance company is a member of an affiliated group of corporations. However, the rules are to be applied only for purposes of determining the debt, equity, projected earnings and annual interest of the bank or lending or finance company which then are taken into account in determining the debt to equity ratio and ratio of projected earnings to annual interest to be paid or incurred by the affiliated group as a whole. Thus, these rules are to be applied to reduce the bank's or lending or finance corporation's indebtedness, annual interest to be paid or incurred, and average annual earnings which are taken into account with respect to the group, but are not to reduce the indebtedness of, annual interest to be paid or incurred by, and average annual earnings of, any corporation in the affiliated group which is not a bank or a lending or finance company. In determining whether any corporation which is a member of an affiliated group is primarily engaged in a lending or finance business, only the activities of such corporation, and not those of the whole group, are to be taken into account. See § 1.279-6 for the application of section 279 to certain affiliated groups of corporations.
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
As of the close of the taxable year, X Bank has a total indebtedness of $100 million, total assets of $115 million, and $80 million is owed to X Bank by its customers. Bank X's indebtedness is $20 million ($100 million total indebtedness less $80 million owed to the X Bank by its customers) and its assets are $35 million ($115 million total assets less $80 million owed to the bank by its customers). If its annual interest to be paid or incurred is $5 million, such amount is reduced by $4 million. Thus, X Bank's annual interest to be paid or incurred is $1 million.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1.
X Bank has earnings and profits of $23 million for the 3-year period used to determine projected earnings. In computing the average annual earnings, the $23 million amount will be reduced by $12 million (three times the $4 million reduction of interest in
Example 1,
assuming that the reduction was the same for each year). Thus X Bank's earnings and profits for such 3-year period are $11 million ($23 million total earnings and profits less $12 million reduction).
[T.D. 7262, 38 FR 5847, Mar. 7, 1973, as amended by T.D. 9264, 71 FR 30593, May 30, 2006]
§ 1.279-6
Application of section 279 to certain affiliated groups.
(a)
In general.
Under section 279(g), in any case in which the issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated group, the application of section 279 shall be determined by treating all of the members of the affiliated group in the aggregate as the issuing corporation, except that the ratio of debt to equity of, projected earnings of, and the annual interest to be paid or incurred by any corporation (other than the issuing corporation determined without regard to this paragraph) shall be included in the determinations required under section 279(b)(4) as of any day only if such corporation is a member of the affiliated group on such day, and, in determining projected earnings of such corporation under section 279(c)(3), there shall be taken into account only the earnings and profits of such corporation for the period during which it was a member of the affiliated group. The total amount of an affiliated member's assets, indebtedness, projected earnings, and interest to be paid or incurred will enter into the computation required by this section, irrespective of any minority ownership in such member.
(b)
Aggregate money and other assets.
In determining the aggregate money and all the other assets of the affiliated group, the money and all the other assets of each member of such group shall be separately computed and such separately computed amounts shall be added together, except that adjustments shall be made, as follows:
(1) There shall be eliminated from the aggregate money and all the other assets of the affiliated group intercompany receivables as of the date described in section 279(c)(1);
(2) There shall be eliminated from the total assets of the affiliated group any amount which represents stock ownership in any member of such group;
(3) In any case where gain or loss is not recognized on transactions between members of an affiliated group under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the basis of any asset involved in such transaction shall be the transferor's basis;
(4) The basis of property in a transaction to which § 1.1502-13 applies is the basis of the property determined under that section; and
(5) There shall be eliminated from the money and all the other assets of the affiliated group any other amount which, if included, would result in a duplication of amounts in the aggregate money and all the other assets of the affiliated group.
(c)
Aggregate indebtedness.
For purposes of applying section 279(c), in determining the aggregate indebtedness of an affiliated group of corporations the total indebtedness of each member of such group shall be separately determined, and such separately determined amounts shall be added together, except that there shall be eliminated from such total indebtedness as of the date described in section 279(c)(1):
(1) The amount of intercompany accounts payable,
(2) The amount of intercompany bonds or other evidences of indebtedness, and
(3) The amount of any other indebtedness which, if included, would result
in a duplication of amounts in the aggregate indebtedness of such affiliated group.
(d)
Aggregate projected earnings.
In the case of an affiliated group of corporations (whether or not such group files a consolidated return under section 1501), the aggregate projected earnings of such group is computed by separately determining the projected earnings of each member of such group under paragraph (d) of § 1.279-5, and then adding together such separately determined amounts, except that—
(1) A dividend (a distribution which is described in section 301(c)(1) other than a distribution described in section 243(c)(1)) distributed by one member to another member is eliminated;
(2) In determining the earnings and profits of any member of an affiliated group, there is eliminated any amount of interest income received or accrued, and of interest expense paid or incurred, which is attributable to intercompany indebtedness; and
(3) No gain or loss is recognized in any transaction between members of the affiliated group.
(e)
Aggregate interest to be paid or incurred.
For purposes of section 279(c)(4), in determining the aggregate annual interest to be paid or incurred by an affiliated group of corporations, the annual interest to be paid or incurred by each member of such affiliated group shall be separately calculated under paragraph (e) of § 1.279-5, and such separately calculated amounts shall be added together, except that any amount of annual interest to be paid or incurred on any intercompany indebtedness shall be eliminated from such aggregate interest.
[T.D. 7262, 38 FR 5850, Mar. 5, 1973, as amended by T.D. 8560, 59 FR 41675, Aug. 15, 1994; T.D. 8597, 60 FR 36679, July 18, 1995; T.D. 10018, 89 FR 106851, Dec. 30, 2024]
§ 1.279-7
Effect on other provisions.
Under section 279(j), no inference is to be drawn from any provision in section 279 and the regulations thereunder that any instrument designated as a bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness by its issuer represents an obligation or indebtedness of such issuer in applying any other provision of this title. Thus, for example, an instrument, the interest on which is not subject to disallowance under section 279 could, under section 385 and the regulations thereunder, be found to constitute a stock interest, so that any amounts paid or payable thereon would not be deductible.

§ 1.280B-1
Demolition of structures.
(a)
In general.
Section 280B provides that, in the case of the demolition of any structure, no deduction otherwise allowable under chapter 1 of subtitle A shall be allowed to the owner or lessee of such structure for any amount expended for the demolition or any loss sustained on account of the demolition, and that the expenditure or loss shall be treated as properly chargeable to the capital account with respect to the land on which the demolished structure was located.
(b)
Definition of structure.
For purposes of section 280B, the term
structure
means a building, as defined in § 1.48-1(e)(1), including the structural components of that building, as defined in § 1.48-1(e)(2).
(c)
Effective date.
This section is effective for demolitions commencing on or after December 30, 1997.
[T.D. 8745, 62 FR 67726, Dec. 30, 1997]
§ 1.280C-1
Disallowance of certain deductions for wage or salary expenses.
If an employer elects to claim the targeted jobs credit under section 44B (as amended by the Revenue Act of 1978), or elects to claim the new jobs credit under section 44B (as in effect prior to enactment of the Revenue Act of 1978), the employer must reduce its deduction for wage or salary expenses paid or incurred in the year the credit is earned by the amount allowable as credit (determined without regard to the provisions of section 53). In the case in which wages and salaries are capitalized the amount subject to depreciation must be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of the credit (determined without regard to the provisions of section 53) in determining the depreciation deduction. In the case of an employer who uses the
full absorption method of inventory costing under § 1.471-11, the portion of the basis of the inventory attributable to the wage or salary expenses giving rise to the credit and paid or incurred in the year the credit is earned must be reduced by the amount of the credit allowable (determined without regard to the provisions of section 53). If the employer is an organization that is under common control (as described in § 1.52-1), it must reduce its deduction for wage or salary expenses by the amount of the credit apportioned to it under § 1.52-1 (a) or (b). The deduction for wage and salary expenses must be reduced in the year the credit is earned, even if the employer is unable to use the credit in that year because of the limitations imposed by section 53.

[T.D. 7921, 48 FR 52908, Nov. 23, 1983]
§ 1.280C-3
Disallowance of certain deductions for qualified clinical testing expenses when section 28 credit is allowable.
(a)
In general.
If a taxpayer is entitled to a credit under section 28 for qualified clinical testing expenses (as defined in section 28(b)), it must reduce the amount of any deduction for qualified clinical testing expenses paid or incurred in the year the credit is earned by the amount allowable as credit for such expenses (determined without regard to section 28(d)(2)).
(b)
Capitalization of qualified clinical testing expenses.
In a case in which qualified clinical testing expenses are capitalized, the amount chargeable to the capital account for a taxable year must be reduced by the excess of the amount of the credit allowable for the taxable year under section 28 (determined without regard to section 28(d)(2)) over the amount allowable as a deduction for qualified clinical testing expenses (determined without regard to paragraph (a) of this section) for the taxable year. See section 174 and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Controlled group of corporations; organizations under common control.
In the case of a taxpayer described in paragraph (d)(5) of § 1.28-1 of this chapter (relating to controlled groups of corporations and organizations under common control), paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be applied in accordance with the rules prescribed for aggregation of expenditures under that paragraph.
(d)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:

# Example.
A incurs $1,000 in clinical testing expenses for which a $500 credit is allowable under section 28. A also elects under section 174 of the Code to amortize these expenses over a 5-year period beginning in the year the credit is claimed. Under paragraph (a), the current year amortization deduction of $200 ($1,000 ÷ 5) is disallowed. Moreover, the amount which would otherwise be capitalized, $800, is reduced by the excess of the amount of the section 28 credit claimed for the taxable year over the amount of the allowable section 174 amortization deduction for the taxable year, or $300 ($500-$200). Thus, the amount chargeable to the capital account for the taxable year is $500 ($800-$300). A is entitled to amortize $500 over the remaining amortization period resulting in a deduction of $125 for each of the remaining four years.
[T.D. 8232, 53 FR 38715, Oct. 3, 1988]
§ 1.280C-4
Credit for increasing research activities.
(a)
In general.
An election under section 280C(c)(3) to have the provisions of section 280C(c)(1) and (c)(2) not apply and elect the reduced research credit under section 280C(c)(3)(B) shall be made on Form 6765, “Credit for Increasing Research Activities” (or any successor form). In order for the election to be effective, the Form 6765 must clearly indicate the taxpayer's intent to make the section 280C(c)(3) election, and must be filed with an original return for the taxable year filed on or before the due date (including extensions) for filing the income tax return for such year, regardless of whether any research credits are claimed on the original return. An election, once made for any taxable year, is irrevocable for that taxable year.
(b)
Controlled groups of corporations; trades or businesses under common control
—(1)
In general.
A member of a controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 41(f)(5)), or a trade or business which is treated as being under common control with
other trades or businesses (within the meaning of section 41(f)(1)(B)), may make the election under section 280C(c)(3). However, only the common parent (within the meaning of § 1.1502-77(a)(1)(i)) of a consolidated group may make the election on behalf of the members of a consolidated group. A member or trade or business shall make the election on Form 6765 and by the time prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates an application of paragraph (b) of this section: A, B, and C, all of which are calendar year taxpayers, are members of a controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 41(f)(5)). A, B, and C each attach a statement to the 2012 Form 6765, “Credit for Increasing Research Activities,” showing A and C were the only members of the controlled group to have qualified research expenses when calculating the group credit. A and C report their allocated portions of the group credit on the 2012 Form 6765 and B reports no research credit on Form 6765. Pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, A and B, but not C, each make an election for the reduced credit under section 280C(c)(3)(B) on the 2012 Form 6765. In December 2013, B determines it had qualified research expenses in 2012 resulting in an increased group credit. On an amended 2012 Form 6765, A, B, and C each report their allocated portions of the group credit. B reports its credit as a regular credit under section 41(a) and reduces the credit under section 280C(c)(3)(B). C may not reduce its credit under section 280C(c)(3)(B) because C did not make an election for the reduced credit with its original return.

§ 1.280F-1T
Limitations on investment tax credit and recovery deductions under section 168 for passenger automobiles and certain other listed property; overview of regulations (temporary).
(a)
In general.
Section 280F(a) limits the amount of investment tax credit determined under section 46(a) and recovery deductions under section 168 for passenger automobiles. Section 280F(b) denies the investment tax credit and requires use of the straight line method of recovery for listed property that is not predominantly used in a qualified business use. In certain circumstances, section 280F(b) requires the recapture of an amount of cost recovery deductions previously claimed by the taxpayer. Section 280F(c) provides that lessees are to be subject to restrictions substantially equivalent to those imposed on owners of such property under section 280F (a) and (b). Section 280F(d) provides definitions and special rules; note that section 280F(d) (2) and (3) apply with respect to all listed property, even if the other provisions of section 280F do not affect the treatment of the property.

§ 1.280F-2T
Limitations on recovery deductions and the investment tax credit for certain passenger automobiles (temporary).
(a)
Limitation on amount of investment tax credit
—(1)
General rule.
The amount of the investment tax credit determined under section 46(a) for any passenger automobile shall not exceed $1,000. For a passenger automobile placed in service after December 31, 1984, the $1,000 amount shall be increased by the automobile price inflation adjustment (as defined in section 280F(d)(7)) for the calendar year in which the automobile is placed in service.
(2)
Election of reduced investment tax credit.
If the taxpayer elects under section 48(q)(4) to reduce the amount of the investment tax credit in lieu of adjusting the basis of the passenger automobile under section 48(q)(1), the amount of the investment tax credit for any passenger automobile shall not exceed two-thirds of the amount determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(b)
Limitations on allowable recovery deductions
—(1)
Recovery deduction for year passenger automobile is placed in service.
For the taxable year that a taxpayer places a passenger automobile in service, the allowable recovery deduction under section 168(a) shall not exceed $4,000. See paragraph (b)(3) of this section for the adjustment to this limitation.
(2)
Recovery deduction for remaining taxable years during the recovery period.
For any taxable year during the recovery period remaining after the year that the property is placed in service, the allowable recovery deduction under section 168(a) shall not exceed $6,000. See paragraph (b)(3) of this section for the adjustment to this limitation.
(3)
Adjustment to limitation by reason of automobile price inflation adjustment.
The limitations on the allowable recovery deductions prescribed in paragraph (b) (1) and (2) of this section are increased by the automobile price inflation adjustment (as defined in section 280F(d)(7)) for the calendar year in which the automobile is placed in service.
(4)
Coordination with section 179.
For purposes of section 280F(a) and this section, any deduction allowable under section 179 (relating to the election to expense certain depreciable trade or business assets) is treated as if that deduction were a recovery deduction under section 168. Thus, the amount of the section 179 deduction is subject to
the limitations described in paragraph (b) (1) and (2) of this section.
(c)
Disallowed recovery deductions allowed for years subsequent to the recovery period
—(1)
In general.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), the “unrecovered basis” (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) of any passenger automobile is treated as a deductible expense in the first taxable year succeeding the end of the recovery period.
(ii) The term
unrecovered basis
means the excess (if any) of:
(A) The unadjusted basis (as defined in section 168(d)(1)(A), except that there is no reduction by reason of an election to expense a portion of the basis under section 179) of the passenger automobile, over
(B) The amount of the recovery deductions (including any section 179 deduction elected by the taxpayer) which would have been allowable for taxable years in the recovery period (determined after the application of section 280F (a) and paragraph (b) of this section and as if all use during the recovery period were used described in section 168(c)(1)).
(2)
Special rule when taxpayer elects to use the section 168(b)(3) optional recovery percentages.
If the taxpayer elects to use the optional recovery percentages under section 168(b)(3) or must use the straight line method over the earnings and profits life (as defined and described in § 1.280F-3T(f)), the second succeeding taxable year after the end of the recovery period is treated as the first succeeding taxable year after the end of the recovery period for purposes of this paragraph (c) because of the half-year convention. For example, assume a calendar-year taxpayer places in service on July 1, 1984, a passenger automobile (
i.e.,
3-year recovery property) and elects under section 168(b)(3) to recover its cost over 5 years using the straight line optional percentages. Based on these facts, calendar year 1990 is treated as the first succeeding taxable year after the end of the recovery period.
(3)
Deduction limited to $6,000 for any taxable year.
The amount that may be treated as a deductible expense under this paragraph (c) in the first taxable year succeeding the recovery period shall not exceed $6,000. Any excess shall be treated as an expense for the succeeding taxable years. However, in no event may any deduction in a succeeding taxable year exceed $6,000. The limitation on amounts deductible as an expense under this paragraph (c) with respect to any passenger automobile is increased by the automobile price inflation adjustment (as defined in section 280F(d)(7)) for the calendar year in which such automobile is placed in service.
(4)
Deduction treated as a section 168 recovery deduction.
Any amount allowable as an expense in a taxable year after the recovery period by reason of this paragraph (c) shall be treated as a recovery deduction allowable under section 168. However, a deduction is allowable by reason of this paragraph (c) with respect to any passenger automobile for a taxable year only to the extent that a deduction under section 168 would be allowable with respect to the automobile for that year. For example, no recovery deduction is allowable for a year during which a passenger automobile is disposed of or is used exclusively for personal purposes.
(d)
Additional reduction in limitations by reason of personal use of passenger automobile or by reason of a short taxable year.
See paragraph (i) of this section for rules regarding the additional reduction in the limitations prescribed by paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section by reason of the personal use of a passenger automobile or by reason of a short taxable year.
(e)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. For purposes of these examples, assume that all taxpayers use the calendar year and that no short taxable years are involved.

# Example 1.
(i) On July 1, 1984, B purchases for $45,000 and places in service a passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property under section 168. In 1984, B does not elect under section 179 to expense a portion of the cost of the automobile. The automobile is used exclusively in B's business during taxable years 1984 through 1990.
(ii) The maximum amount of B's investment tax credit is $1,000 (
i.e.,
the lesser of $1,000 or .06 × $45,000). B's unadjusted basis for purposes of section 168 is $44,500 (
i.e.,
$45,000 reduced under section 48(q)(1) by $500).
B selects the use of the accelerated recovery percentages under section 168(b)(1).
(iii) The maximum amount of B's recovery deduction for 1984 is $4,000 (
i.e,
the lesser of $4,000 or .25 × $44,500); for 1985, $6,000 (
i.e.,
the lesser of $6,000 or .38 × $44,500); and for 1986, $6,000 (
i.e.,
the lesser of $6,000 or .37 × $44,500).
(iv) At the beginning of taxable year 1987, B's unrecovered basis in the automobile is $28,500 (
i.e.,
$44,500−$16,000). Under paragraph (c) of this section, B may expense $6,000 of the unrecovered basis in the automobile in 1987. This expense is treated as a recovery deduction under section 168. For taxable years 1988 through 1990, B may deduct $6,000 of the unrecovered basis per year. At the beginning of 1991, B's unrecovered basis in the automobile is $4,500. During that year, B disposes of the automobile. B is not allowed a deduction for 1991 because no deduction would be allowable under section 168 based on these facts.

# Example 2.
(i) On July 1, 1984, C purchases for $50,000 and places in service a passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property under section 168. The automobile is used exclusively in C's business during taxable years 1984 through 1992. In 1984, C does not elect under section 179 to expense a portion of the automobile's cost. C elects under section 48(q)(4) to take a reduced investment tax credit in lieu of the section 48(q)(1) basis adjustment.
(ii) The maximum amount of C's investment tax credit is $666.67 (
i.e.,
the lesser of
2/3
of $1,000 or .04 × $50,000). C's unadjusted basis for purposes of section 168 is $50,000. C elects to use the optional recovery percentages under section 168(b)(3) based on a 5-year recovery period.
(iii) The maximum amount of C's recovery deduction for 1984 is $4,000 (
i.e.,
the lesser of $4,000 or .10 × $50,000); for taxable years 1985 through 1988, $6,000 per year (
i.e.,
the lesser of $6,000 or .20 of $50,000). C's recovery deduction for 1989 is $5,000 (
i.e.,
the lesser of .10 × $50,000 or $6,000).
(iv) At the beginning of taxable year 1990, C's unrecovered basis in the automobile is $17,000. Under paragraph (c) of this section, C may expense $6,000 of the unrecovered basis in the automobile in 1990. this expense is treated as a recovery deduction under section 168. For taxable years 1991 and 1992, C may deduct $6,000, and $5,000, respectively of the unrecovered basis per year.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2,
except that C disposes of the passenger automobile on July 1, 1990. Under paragraph (c) of this section, C is not allowed a deduction for 1990 or for any succeeding taxable year because no deduction would be allowable under section 168 based on these facts.

# Example 4.
(i) On July 1, 1984, G purchases for $15,000 and places in service a passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property under section 168. The automobile is used exclusively in G's business during taxable years 1984 through 1987. In 1984, G elects under section 179 to expense $5,000 of the cost of the property.
(ii) The maximum amount of G's investment tax credit is $600 (
i.e.,
the lesser of .06 × $10,000 or $1,000).
(iii) G's unadjusted basis for purposes of section 168 is $9,700 (
i.e.,
$15,000 minus the sum of $5,000 (the amount of the expense elected under section 179) and $300 (one-half of the investment tax credit under section 48(q)(1))). Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the allowable deduction under section 179 is treated as a recovery deduction under section 168 for purposes of this section. Thus, the maximum amount of G's section 179 deduction is $4,000 (
i.e.,
the lesser of $4,000 or $5,000 + .25 × $9,700). G is entitled to no further recovery deduction under section 168 for 1984. The amount of G's 1985 and 1986 recovery deductions are $3,686 (
i.e.,
the lesser of .38 × $9,700 or $6,000) and $3,589 (
i.e.,
the lesser of .37 × $9,700 or $6,000), respectively. At the beginning of 1987, G's unrecovered basis in the automobile is $3,425 (
i.e.,
$14,700 − $11,275). Under paragraph (c) of this section, G may expense the remaining $3,425 in 1987.

# Example 5.
(i) On July 1, 1984, D purchases for $55,000 and places in service a passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property under section 168. The automobile is used exclusvely in D's business during taxable years 1984 through 1993. In 1984, D elects under section 179 to expense $5,000 of the cost of the property.
(ii) The maximum amount of D's investment tax credit is $1,000 (
i.e.,
the lesser of $1,000 or .06 × $50,000).
(iii) D's unadjusted basis for purposes of section 168 is $49,500 (
i.e.,
$55,000 minus the sum of $5,000 (the amount of the expense elected under section 179) and $500 (one-half of the investment tax credit under section 48 (q)(1))). Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the allowable deduction under section 179 is treated as a recovery deduction under section 168 for purposes of this section. Thus, the maximum amount of D's section 179 deduction is $4,000 (
i.e.,
the lesser of $4,000 or $5,000 + .25 × $49,500). D is entitled to no further recovery deduction under section 168 for 1984. The maximum amount of D's 1985 recovery deduction is $6,000 (
i.e.,
the lesser of $6,000 or .38 × $49,500); and for 1986, $6,000 (
i.e.,
the lesser of $6,000 or .37 of $49,500).
(iv) At the beginning of 1987, D's unrecovered basis is $38,500. D may expense the remaining unrecovered basis at the rate of $6,000 per year through 1992 and $2,500 in 1993.

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 5,
except that in 1993, D uses the automobile only 60 percent in his business. Under paragraph (c)(4) of this section for 1993, D
may expense $1,500 (
i.e.,
.60 × $2,500). D is entitled to no further deductions with respect to the automobile in any later year.

# Example 7.
(i) On July 1, 1984, F purchases for $44,500 and places in service a passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property under section 168. The automobile is used exclusively in F's business during taxable years 1984 through 1992. In 1984, F elects under section 179 to expense $5,000 of the cost of the property.
(ii) F elects under section 48(q)(4) to take a reduced investment tax credit in lieu of the section 48(q)(1) basis adjustment. The maximum amount of F's investment tax credit is $666.67 (
i.e.,
the lesser of
2/3
of $1,000 or .04 × $39,500).
(iii) F's unadjusted basis for purposes of section 168 is $39,500 (
i.e.,
$44,500 − $5,000 (the amount of the expense elected under section 179)). F elects to use the optional recovery percentage under section 168(b)(3) based on a 5-year recovery period. Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the allowable section 179 deduction is treated as a recovery deduction under section 168 for purposes of this section. Thus, the maximum amount of F's section 179 deduction is $4,000 (
i.e.,
the lesser of $4,000 or $5,000 + .10 × $39,500). F is entitled to no further recovery deduction under section 168 for 1984. The maximum amounts of F's recovery deductions for 1985 through 1988 are $6,000 per year (
i.e.,
the lesser of $6,000 or .20 × $39,500). F's recovery deduction for 1989 (the first taxable year after the 5-year recovery period but the sixth recovery year for purposes of section 168) is $3,950 (
i.e.,
the lesser of .10 × $39,500 or $6,000).
(iv) Under paragraph (c), taxable year 1990 is considered to be the first taxable year succeeding the end of the recovery period. At the beginning of taxable year 1990, F's unrecovered basis in the automobile is $12,550 (
i.e.,
$44,500 − $31,950). Under paragraph (c), F may expense $6,000 of his unrecovered basis in the automobile in 1990 and in 1991. This expense is treated as a recovery deduction under section 168. For taxable year 1992, F may expense the remaining $550 of his unrecovered basis in the automobile.
(f)
Treatment of improvements that qualify as capital expenditures.
An improvement to a passenger automobile that qualifies as a capital expenditure under section 263 is treated as a new item of recovery property placed in service in the year the improvement is made. However, the limitations in paragraph (b) of this section on the amount of recovery deductions allowable are determined by taking into account as a whole both the improvement and the property of which the improvement is a part. If that improvement also qualifies as an investment in new section 38 property under section 48(b) and § 1.48-2(b)(2), the limitation in paragraph (a)(1) of this section on the amount of the investment tax credit for that improvement is determined by taking into account any investment tax credit previously allowed for the passenger automobile (including any prior improvement considered part of the passenger automobile). Thus, the maximum credit allowable for the automobile (including the improvement) will be $1,000 (or
2/3
of $1,000, in the case of an election to take a reduced credit under section 48(q)(4)) (adjusted under section 280F(d)(7) to reflect the automobile price inflation adjustment for the year the property of which the improvement is a part is placed in service).
(g)
Treatment of section 1031 or section 1033 transactions
—(1)
Treatment of exchanged passenger automobile.
For a taxable year in which a transaction described in section 1031 or section 1033 occurs, the unadjusted basis of an exchanged or converted passenger automobile shall cease to be taken into account in determining any recovery deductions allowable under section 168 as of the beginning of the taxable year in which the exchange or conversion occurs. Thus, no recovery deduction is allowable for the exchanged or converted automobile in the year of the exchange or conversion.
(2)
Treatment of acquired passenger automobile
—(i)
In general.
The acquired automobile is treated as new property placed in service in the year of the exchange (or in the replacement year) and that year is its first recovery year.
(ii)
Limitations on recovery deductions.
If the exchanged (or converted) automobile was acquired after the effective date of section 280F (as set out in § 1.280F-1(c)), the basis of that automobile as determined under section 1031(d) or section 1033(b) (whichever is applicable) must be reduced for purposes of computing recovery deductions with respect to the acquired automobile (but not for purposes of determining the amount of the investment tax credit and gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of the property) by the excess (if any) of:
(A) The sum of the amounts that would have been allowable as recovery deductions with respect to the exchanged (or converted) automobile during taxable years preceding the year of the exchange (or conversion) if all of the use of the automobile during those years was use described in section 168(c), over
(B) The sum of the amounts allowable as recovery deductions during those years.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (g) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(i) In 1982, F purchases and places in service a passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property under section 168. The automobile is used exclusively in F's business.
(ii) On July 1, 1984, F exchanges the passenger automobile and $1,000 cash for a new passenger automobile (“like kind” property). Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, no recovery deduction is allowed in 1984 for the exchanged automobile. Any investment tax credit claimed with respect to that automobile is subject to recapture under section 47.
(iii) F's basis in the acquired property (as determined under section 1031(d) and F's qualified investment are $20,000. Under the provisions of paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, the acquired property is treated as new recovery property placed in service in 1984 to the extent of the full $20,000 of basis. The maximum amount of F's investment tax credit is limited to $1,000 (
i.e.,
the lesser of $1,000 or .06 × $20,000). Cost recovery deductions are computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

# Example 2.
(i) On July 1, 1984, E purchases for $30,000 and places in service a passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property under section 168. In 1984, E's business use percentage is 80 percent and such use constitutes his total business/investment use.
(ii) E elects under section 48(q)(4) to take a reduced investment tax credit in lieu of the section 48 (q)(1) basis adjustment. The maximum amount of E's investment tax credit is $533.33 (
i.e.,
the lesser of
2/3
of $1,000 × .80 or .80 × .04 × $30,000).
(iii) E's unadjusted basis for purposes of section 168 is $30,000. E selects the use of the accelerated recovery percentages under section 168(b)(1). The maximum amount of E's recovery deduction for 1984 is $3,200 (
i.e.,
the lesser of .80 × $4,000 or .80 × .25 × $30,000).
(iv) On June 10, 1985, E exchanges the passenger automobile and $1,000 cash for a new passenger automobile (“like kind” property). Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, no recovery deduction is allowable in 1985 for the exchanged automobile. The investment tax credit claimed is subject to recapture under section 47. Under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, E's basis in the acquired property for purposes of computing recovery deductions under section 280F is $27,000 (
i.e.,
$27,800 (section 1031(d) basis) − $800). The acquired automobile is used exclusively in F's business during taxable years 1985 through 1988. Under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the acquired property is treated as new recovery property placed in service in 1985. Assume that the automobile price inflation adjustment (as described under section 280F(d)(7)) is zero. E's qualified investment in the property, as determined under § 1.46-3(c)(1), is $27,800. The maximum amount of E's investment tax credit is $1,000 (
i.e.,
the lesser of $1,000 or .06 × $27,800). E's unadjusted basis for purposes of section 168 is $26,500 (
i.e.,
$27,000 reduced under section 48(q)(1) by $500). Cost recovery deductions are computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
(h)
Other nonrecognition transactions.
[Reserved]
(i)
Limitation under this section applies before other limitations
—(1)
Personal use.
The limitations imposed upon the maximum amount of the allowable investment tax credit and the allowable recovery deductions (as described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section) must be adjusted during any taxable year in which a taxpayer makes any use of a passenger automobile other than for business/investment use (as defined in § 1.280F-6(d)(3)). The limitations on the amount of the allowable investment tax credit (as described in paragraph (a) of this section) and the allowable cost recovery deductions (as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section) are redetermined by multiplying the limitations by the percentage of business/investment use (determined on an annual basis) during the taxable year.
(2)
Short taxable year.
The limitations imposed upon the maximum amount of the allowable recovery deductions (as described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section) must be adjusted during any taxable year in which a taxpayer has a short taxable year. In this case, the limitation is adjusted by multiplying the limitation that would have been applied if the taxable year were not a short taxable year by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months and part-months in the short
taxable year and the denominator of which is 12.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (i) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On July 1, 1984, A purchases and places in service a passenger automobile and uses it 80 percent for business/investment use during 1984. Under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the maximum amount of the investment tax credit that A may claim for the automobile is $800 (
i.e.,
.80 × $1,000).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that A elects under section 48(q)(4) to take a reduced investment tax credit in lieu of the section 48(q)(1) basis adjustment. Under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the maximum amount of the investment tax credit that A may claim for the automobile is $533.33 (
i.e.,
.80 ×
2/3
× $1,000).

# Example 3.
On July 1, 1984, B purchases and places in service a passenger automobile and uses it 60 percent for business/investment use during 1984. Under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the maximum amount of the investment tax credit that B may claim for the automobile is $600 (
i.e.,
.60 × $1,000). B uses the car 70 percent for business/investment use during 1985 and 80 percent during 1986. Under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the maximum amount of recovery deductions that B may claim for 1984, 1985, and 1986 are $2,400 (
i.e.,
.60 × $4,000), $4,200 (
i.e.,
.70 × $6,000), and $4,800 (
i.e.,
.80 × $6,000), respectively.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3
with the added facts that B's unrecovered basis at the beginning of 1987 is $6,000 and that B uses the automobile 85 percent for business/investment use during 1987. Under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the maximum amount that B may claim as an expense for 1987 is $5,000 (
i.e.,
.85 × $6,000).

# Example 5.
On August 1, 1984, C purchases and places in service a passenger automobile and uses it exclusively for business. Taxable year 1984 for C is a short taxable year which consists of 6 months. Under paragraph (i)(2) of this section, the maximum amount that C may claim as a recovery deduction for 1984 is $2,000 (
i.e.,
6/12
× $4,000).

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 5,
except that C uses the passenger automobile 70 percent for business/investment use during 1984. Under paragraph (i) (1) and (2) of this section, the maximum amount that C may claim as a recovery deduction for 1984 is $1,400 (
i.e.,
.70 ×
6/12
× $4,000).
(98 Stat. 494, 26 U.S.C. 280F; 68A Stat. 917, 26 U.S.C. 7805)
[T.D. 7986, 49 FR 42704, Oct. 24, 1984, as amended by T.D. 9133, 69 FR 35514, June 25, 2004]
§ 1.280F-3T
Limitations on recovery deductions and the investment tax credit when the business use percentage of listed property is not greater than 50 percent (temporary).
(a)
In general.
Section 280F(b), generally, imposes limitations with respect to the amount allowable as an investment tax credit under section 46(a) and the amount allowable as a recovery deduction under section 168 in the case of listed property (as defined in § 1.280F-6(b)) if certain business use of the property (referred to as “qualified business use”) does not exceed 50 percent during a taxable year.
Qualified business use
generally means use in a trade or business, rather than use in an investment or other activity conducted for the production of income within the meaning of section 212. See § 1.280F-6(d) for the distinction between “business/ investment use” and “qualified business use.”
(b)
Limitation on the amount of investment tax credit
—(1)
Denial of investment tax credit when business use percentage not greater than 50 percent.
Listed property is not treated as section 38 property to any extent unless the business use percentage (as defined in section 280F(d)(6) and § 1.280F-6(d)(1)) is greater than 50 percent. For example, if a taxpayer uses listed property in a trade or business in the taxable year in which it is placed in service, but the business use percentage is not greater than 50 percent, no investment tax credit is allowed for that listed property. If, in the taxable year in which listed property is placed in service, the only business/investment use (as defined in § 1.280F-6(d)(3)) of that property is qualified business use (as defined in § 1.280F-6(d)(2)(i)), and the business use percentage is 55 percent, the investment tax credit is allowed for the 55 percent of the listed property that is treated as section 38 property. The credit allowed is unaffected by any increase in the business use percentage in a subsequent taxable year.
(2)
Recapture of investment tax credit.
Listed property ceases to be section 38 property to the extent that the business/investment use (as defined in § 1.280F-6(d)(3)) for any taxable year is less than the business/investment use
for the taxable year in which the property is placed in service.
See
§ 1.47-2(c). If the business use percentage (as defined in § 1.280F-6(d)(1)) of listed property is greater than 50 percent for the taxable year in which the property is placed in service, and less than or equal to 50 percent for any subsequent taxable year, that property ceases to be section 38 property in its entirety in that subsequent taxable year. Under § 1.47-1(c)(1)(ii)(
b
), the property (or a portion thereof) is treated as ceasing to be section 38 property on the first day of the taxable year in which the cessation occurs.
(c)
Limitation on the method of cost recovery under section 168 when business use of property not greater than 50 percent
—(1)
Year of acquisition.
If any listed property (as defined in § 1.280F-6(b)) is not predominantly used in a qualified business use (as defined in § 1.280F-6(d)(4)) in the year it is acquired, the recovery deductions allowed under section 168 for the property for that taxable year and for succeeding taxable years are to be determined using the straight line method over its earnings and profits life (as defined in paragraph (f) of this section). Additionally, the taxpayer is not entitled to make any election under section 179 with respect to the property for that year.
(2)
Subsequent years.
If any listed property is not subject to paragraph (c)(1) of this section because such property is predominantly used in a qualified business use (as defined in § 1.280F-6(d)(4)) during the year it is acquired but is not predominantly used in a qualified business use during a subsequent taxable year, the rules of this paragraph (c)(2) apply. In such a case, the taxpayer must determine the recovery deductions allowed under section 168 for the taxable year that the listed property is not predominantly used in a qualified business use and for any subsequent taxable year as if such property was not predominantly used in a qualified business use in the year in which it was acquired and there had been no section 179 election with respect to the property. Thus, the recovery deductions allowable under section 168 for the remaining taxable years are computed by determining the applicable recovery percentage that would apply if the taxpayer had used the straight line method over the property's earnings and profits life beginning with the year the property was placed in service.
(3)
Effect of rule on recovery property that is not listed property.
The mandatory use of the straight line method over the property's earnings and profits life under paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section does not have any effect on the proper method of cost recovery for other recovery property of that same class placed in service in the same taxable year by the taxpayer and does not constitute an election to use an optional recovery period under section 168(b)(3).
(d)
Recapture of excess recovery deductions claimed
—(1)
In general.
If paragraph (c)(2) of this section is applicable, any excess depreciation (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) must be included in the taxpayer's gross income and added to the property's adjusted basis for the first taxable year in which the property is not predominantly used in a qualified business use (as defined in § 1.280F-6(d)(4)).
(2)
Definition of excess depreciation.
For purposes of this section, the term
excess depreciation
means the excess (if any) of:
(i) The amount of the recovery deductions allowable with respect to the property for taxable years before the first taxable year in which the property was not predominantly used in a qualified business use, over
(ii) The amount of the recovery deductions which would have been allowable for those years if the property had not been predominantly used in a qualified business use for the year it was acquired and there had been no section 179 election with respect to the property.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(i), any deduction allowable under section 179 (relating to the election to expense certain depreciable trade or business assets) is treated as if that deduction was a recovery deduction under section 168.
(3)
Recordkeeping requirement.
A taxpayer must be able to substantiate the use of any listed property, as prescribed in section 274(d)(4) and § 1.274-5T or § 1.274-6T, for any taxable year for which recapture under section
280F(b)(3) and paragraph (d) (1) and (2) of this section may occur even if the taxpayer has fully depreciated (or expensed) the listed property in a prior year. For example, in the case of 3-year recovery property, the taxpayer shall maintain a log, journal, etc. for six years even though the taxpayer fully depreciated the property in the first three years.
(e)
Earnings and profits life
—(1)
Definition.
The earnings and profits life with respect to any listed property is generally the following:
In the case of—
The applicable recovery period is—
3-year property
5 years.
5-year property
12 years.
10-year property
25 years.
18-year real property and low-income housing
40 years.
15-year public utility property
35 years.
However, if the recovery period applicable to any recovery property under section 168 is longer than the above assigned recovery period, such longer recovery period shall be used. For example, generally, the recovery period for recovery property used predominantly outside the United States is the property's present class life (as defined in section 168(g)(2)). In many cases, a property's present class life is longer than the recovery period assigned to the property under the above table. Pursuant to this paragraph (e)(1), the property's recovery period is its present class life.
(2)
Applicable recovery percentages.
If the applicable recovery period is determined pursuant to the table prescribed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the applicable recovery percentage is:
(i) For property other than 18-year real property or low-income housing:
If the recovery year is—
And the recovery period is—

(f)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. For purposes of these examples, assume that all taxpayers use the calendar year and that no short taxable years are involved.

# Example 1.
On July 1, 1984, B purchases for $50,000 and places in service an item of listed property (other than a passenger automobile) which is 3-year recovery property under section 168. For the first taxable year that the property is in service, B used the property 40 percent in a trade or business, 40 percent for the production of income, and 20 percent for personal purposes. Although B's total business/investment use is greater than 50 percent, the business use percentage for that taxable year is only 40 percent. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, no investment tax credit is allowed for the property.

# Example 2.
(i) On January 1, 1985, C purchases for $40,000 and places in service an item of listed property (other than a passenger automobile) that is 3-year recovery property under section 168. Seventy percent of the use of the property is in C's trade or business and 30 percent of the use is for personal purposes. C does not elect a reduced investment tax credit under section 48(q)(4). The amount of C's investment tax credit is $1,680 (
i.e.,
$40,000 × .60 × .10 × .70).
(ii) In addition, in 1986, only 55 percent of the use of the property is in C's trade or business and 45 percent of the use is for personal purposes. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the property ceases to be section 38 property to the extent that the use in a trade
or business decreased below 70 percent. As a result, a portion of the investment tax credit must be recaptured as an increase in tax liability for 1986 under the rules of section 47 (relating to the recapture of investment tax credit).
See
section 47(a)(5) and § 1.47-2(e) for rules relating to the computation of the recapture amount.

# Example 3.
On July 1, 1984, B purchases and places in service an item of listed property (other than a passenger automobile) that is 3-year recovery property. B elects to take a reduced investment tax credit under section 48(q)(4). In 1984, B uses the property exclusively in his business. Assume that B's 1984 allowable recovery deduction is $12,500. In 1985 and 1986, the property is not predominantly used in a qualified business use. The investment tax credit claimed is subject to recapture in full under section 47 in 1985 since the property ceases to be section 38 property in its entirety on January 1, 1985. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, B must treat the property for 1985 and subsequent taxable years as if he recovered its cost over a 5-year recovery period (
i.e.,
its earnings and profits life) using the straight line method (with the half-year convention) from the time it was placed in service. Therefore, taxable year 1985 is treated as the property's second recovery year (of its 5-year recovery period) and the applicable recovery deduction using the straight line method must be used to determine the recovery deduction. Under paragraph (d) of this section, B must recapture any excess depreciation claimed for taxable year 1984. If B had used the straight line method over a 5-year recovery period his recovery deduction for 1984 would have been $5,000. Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, B's excess depreciation is $7,500 (
i.e.,
$12,500 − $5,000) and that amount must be included in B's 1985 gross income and added to the property's basis. The taxable years 1986 through 1989 are the property's second through sixth recovery years, respectively, of such property's 5-year recovery period.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3,
except that in 1986 B used the property exclusively in his business. B is entitled to no investment tax credit with respect to the property in 1986 and must continue to recover the property's cost over a 5-year recovery period using the straight line method.

# Example 5.
On July 1, 1984, H purchases and places in service listed property (other than a passenger automobile) which is 3-year recovery property under section 168. H selects the use of the accelerated recovery percentages under section 168. In 1984 through 1986, H uses the property exclusively for business. In 1987, the property is not predominantly used in a qualified business use. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, H must compute his 1987 and subsequent taxable year's recovery deductions using the straight line method over a 5-year recovery period with 1987 treated as the fourth recovery year. Under paragraph (d) of this section, H must recapture any excess depreciation claimed for taxable years 1984 through 1986 even though by 1987 the full cost of the property had already been recovered.

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 5,
except that H uses the property exclusively for personal purposes in 1987. Under paragraph (d) of this section, H must recapture any excess depreciation claimed for taxable years 1984 through 1986. H is entitled to no cost recovery deduction under the 5-year straight line method for 1987. Assume further that in 1988 H uses the property 70 percent in his business. Thus, H's business use percentage for that year is 70 percent. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, H must compute his 1988 cost recovery deduction using the straight line method over a 5-year recovery period with 1988 treated as the fifth recovery year.

# Example 7.
(i) On July 1, 1984, F purchases for $70,000 and places in service listed property (other than a passenger automobile) which is 3-year recovery property under section 168. F's business use percentage for 1984 through 1986 is 60 percent. F elects under section 179 to expense $5,000 of the cost of the property.
(ii) F elects a reduced investment tax credit under section 48(q)(4). The maximum amount of F's investment tax credit is $1,560 (
i.e.,
$65,000 × .04 × .60).
(iii) F's unadjusted basis for purposes of section 168 is $65,000 (
i.e.,
$70,000 reduced by the $5,000 section 179 expense). F selects the use of the accelerated recovery percentages under section 168(b)(1). F's recovery deduction for 1984 is $9,750 (
i.e.,
$65,000 × .25 × .60).
(iv) In 1985, the property is not predominantly used in a qualified business use. The investment tax credit claimed is subject to recapture in full under section 47 in 1985 since the property ceases to be section 38 property in its entirety on January 1, 1985. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, F must treat the property for 1985 and subsequent taxable years as if he recovered its cost over a 5-year recovery period (
i.e.,
its earnings and profits life) using the straight line method (with the half year convention) from the time it was placed in service. Under paragraph (d) of this section, F must recapture any excess depreciation claimed for taxable year 1984. F's excess depreciation is $10,550 [
i.e.,
($65,000 × .25 × .60 + $5,000)−($70,000 × .10 × .60)]. This amount must be included in F's 1985 gross income and added to the property's adjusted basis.

# Example 8.
(i) On July 1, 1984, G purchases for $60,000 and places in service a passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property under section 168.
(ii) In 1984, G's business use percentage is 80 percent and such use constitutes his total
business/investment use. G elects under section 48(q)(4) to take a reduced investment tax credit in lieu of the basis adjustment under section 48(q)(1). The maximum amount of G's investment tax credit is $533.33 (
i.e.,
the lesser of .80 ×
2/3
× $1,000 or $60,000 × .80 × .04).
(iii) In 1984, G does not elect under section 179 to expense a portion of the automobile's cost. G selects the use of the accelerated recovery percentages under section 168. G's unadjusted basis for purposes of section 168 is $60,000. The maximum amount of G's 1984 recovery deduction is $3,200 (
i.e.,
the lesser of .80 × $4,000 or .80 × .25 × $60,000).
(iv) In 1985, G's business use percentage is 80 percent and such use constitutes his total business/investment use. The maximum amount of G's 1985 recovery deduction is $4,800 (
i.e.,
the lesser of .80 × $6,000 or .80 × .38 × $60,000).
(v) In 1986, G's business use percentage is 45 percent and such use constitutes his total business/investment use. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, as a result of the decline in the business use percentage to 50 percent or less, the automobile ceases to be section 38 property in its entirety and G must recapture (pursuant to §§ 1.47-1(c) and 1.47-2(e)) the investment tax credit previously claimed. Since G's business use percentage in 1986 is not greater than 50 percent, under the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, G must recompute (for recapture purposes) his recovery deductions for 1984 and 1985 using the straight line method over a 5-year recovery period (
i.e.,
earnings and profits life for 3-year recovery property using the half-year convention) to determine if any excess depreciation must be included in his 1986 taxable income. G's recomputed recovery deductions for 1984 and 1985 are $3,200 (
i.e.,
the lesser of .80 × $4,000 or .80 × .10 × $60,000), and $4,800 (
i.e.,
the lesser of .80 × $6,000 or .80 × .20 × $60,000), respectively. G does not have to recapture any excess depreciation since his recovery deductions for 1984 and 1985 computed using the straight line method over a 5-year recovery period are the same as the amounts actually claimed during those years.
(vi) Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for 1986 and succeeding taxable years G must compute his remaining recovery deductions using the straight line method over a 5-year recovery period beginning with the third recovery year. The maximum amount of G's 1986 recovery deduction is $2,700 (
i.e.,
the lesser of .45 × $6,000 or .45 × .20 × $60,000). For taxable years 1987 through 1993, G's business use percentage is 55 percent and such use constitutes his total business/investment use. G's 1987 and 1988 recovery deductions are $3,300 per year (
i.e.,
the lesser of .55 × $6,000 or .55 × .20 × $60,000). For taxable year 1989 (the last recovery year), G's recovery deduction is $3,300 (
i.e.,
.55 × .10 × $60,000 or .55 × $6,000).
(vii) As of the beginning of 1990, G will have claimed a total of $20,600 of recovery deductions. Under § 1.280F-2T(c), G may expense his remaining unrecovered basis (up to a certain amount per year) in the first succeeding taxable year after the end of the recovery period and in taxable years thereafter. If G had used his automobile for 100 percent business use in taxable years 1984 through 1989, G could have claimed a recovery deduction of $4,000 in 1984 and a recovery deduction of $6,000 in each of those remaining years. At the beginning of 1990, therefore, G's unrecovered basis (as defined in section 280F(d)(8)) is $26,000 (
i.e.,
$60,000−$34,000). The maximum amount of G's 1990 recovery deduction is $3,300 (
i.e.,
.55 × $6,000). At the beginning of 1991, G's unrecovered basis is $20,000 (
i.e.,
$26,000 adjusted under section 280F(d)(2) and § 1.280F-4T(a) to account for the amount that would have been claimed in 1990 for 100 percent business/investment use during that year). The maximum amount of G's 1991 recovery deduction is $3,300 (
i.e.,
.55 × $6,000) and his unrecovered basis as of the beginning of 1992 is $14,000 (
i.e.,
$20,000−$6,000). In 1992, G disposes of the automobile. G is not allowed a recovery deduction for 1992.

§ 1.280F-4T
Special rules for listed property (temporary).
(a)
Limitations on allowable recovery deductions in subsequent taxable years
—(1)
Subsequent taxable years affected by reason of personal use in prior years.
For purposes of computing the amount of the recovery deduction for “listed property” for a subsequent taxable year, the amount that would have been allowable as a recovery deduction during an earlier taxable year if all of the use of the property was use described in section 168(c) is treated as the amount of the recovery deduction allowable during that earlier taxable year. The preceding sentence applies with respect to all earlier taxable years, beginning with the first taxable year in which some or all use of the “listed property” is use described in section 168(c). For example, on July 1, 1984, B purchases and places in service listed property (other than a passenger automobile) which is 5-year recovery property under section 168. B selects the use of the accelerated percentages
under section 168. B's business/investment use of the property (all of which is qualified business use as defined in section 280F(d)(6)(B) and § 1.280F-6(d)(2)) in 1984 through 1988 is 80 percent, 70 percent, 60 percent, and 55 percent, respectively, and B claims recovery deductions for those years based on those percentages. B's qualified business use for the property for 1989 and taxable years thereafter increases to 100 percent. Pursuant to this rule, B may not claim a recovery deduction in 1989 (or for any subsequent taxable year) for the increase in business use because there is no adjusted basis remaining to be recovered for cost recovery purposes after 1988.
(2)
Special rule for passenger automobiles.
In the case of a passenger automobile that is subject to the limitations of § 1.280F-2T, the amount treated as the amount that would have been allowable as a recovery deduction if all of the use of the automobile was use described in section 168(c) shall not exceed $4,000 for the year the passenger automobile is placed in service and $6,000 for each succeeding taxable year (adjusted to account for the automobile price inflation adjustment, if any, under section 280F(d)(7) and for short taxable year under § 1.280F-2T(i)(2)).
See.
§ 1.280F-3T(g).
Example 8.
(b)
Treatment of improvements that qualify as capital expenditures
—(1)
In general.
In the case of any improvement that qualifies as a capital expenditure under section 263 made to any listed property other than a passenger automobile, the rules of this paragraph (b) apply. See § 1.280F-2T(f) for the treatment of an improvement made to a passenger automobile.
(2)
Investment tax credit allowed for the improvement.
If the improvement qualifies as an investment in new section 38 property under section 48(b) and § 1.48-2(b), the investment tax credit for that improvement is limited by paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.280F-3T, as applied to the item of listed property as a whole.
(3)
Cost recovery of the improvement.
The improvement is treated as a new item of recovery property. The method of cost recovery with respect to that improvement is limited by § 1.280F-3T(c), as applied to the item of listed property as a whole.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, the limitation on cost recovery deductions and the investment tax credit provided in section 280F (a) and (b) and §§ 1.280F-2T and 1.280F-3T do not apply to any listed property leased or held for leasing by any person regularly engaged in the business of leasing listed property. If a person is not regularly engaged in the business of leasing listed property, the limitations on cost recovery deductions and the investment tax credit provided in section 280F and §§ 1.280F-2T and 1.280F-3T apply to such property leased or held for leasing by such person. The special rules for lessees set out in this section apply with respect to all lessees of listed property, even those whose lessors are not regularly engaged in the business of leasing listed property. For rules on determining inclusion amounts with respect to passenger automobiles, see paragraphs (d), (e) and (g) of this section, and see § 1.280F-7(a). For rules on determining inclusion amounts with respect to other listed property, see paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, and see § 1.280F-7(b).
(b)
Section 48(d) election.
If a lessor elects under section 48(d) with respect to any listed property to treat the lessee as having acquired such property, the amount of the investment tax credit allowed to the lessee is subject to the limitation prescribed in § 1.280F-3T(b) (1) and (2). If a lessor elects under section 48(d) with respect to any passenger automobile to treat the lessee as having acquired such automobile, the amount of the investment tax credit allowed to the lessee is also subject to the limitations prescribed in § 1.280F-2T (a) and (i).
(c)
Regularly engaged in the business of leasing.
For purposes of paragraph (a)
of this section, a person shall be considered regularly engaged in the business of leasing listed property only if contracts to lease such property are entered into with some frequency over a continuous period of time. The determination shall be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances in each case, taking into account the nature of the person's business in its entirety. Occasional or incidental leasing activity is insufficient. For example, a person leasing only one passenger automobile during a taxable year is not regularly engaged in the business of leasing automobiles. In addition, an employer that allows an employee to use the employer's property for personal purposes and charges such employee for the use of the property is not regularly engaged in the business of leasing with respect to the property used by the employee.
(d)
Inclusions in income of lessees of passenger automobiles leased after June 18, 1984, and before April 3, 1985
—(1)
In general.
If a taxpayer leases a passenger automobile after June 18, 1984, but before April 3, 1985, for each taxable year (except the last taxable year) during which the taxpayer leases the automobile, the taxpayer must include in gross income an inclusion amount (prorated for the number of days of the lease term included in that taxable year), determined under this paragraph (d)(1), and multiplied by the business/investment use (as defined in § 1.280F-6(d)(3)(i)) for the particular taxable year. The inclusion amount:
(i) Is 7.5 percent of the excess (if any) of the automobile's fair market value over $16,500 for each of the first three taxable years during which a passenger automobile is leased.
(ii) Is 6 percent of the excess (if any) of the automobile's fair market value over $22,500 for the fourth taxable year during which a passenger automobile is leased.
(iii) Is 6 percent of the excess (if any) of the automobile's fair market value over $28,500 for the fifth taxable year during which a passenger automobile is leased.
(iv) Is 6 percent of the excess (if any) of the automobile's fair market value over $34,500 for the sixth taxable year during which a passenger automobile is leased.
For the seventh and subsequent taxable years during which a passenger automobile is leased, the inclusion amount is 6 percent of the excess (if any) of the automobile's fair market value over the sum of (A) $16,500 and (B) $6,000 multiplied by the number of such taxable years in excess of three years.
See
paragraph (g)(2) of this section for the definition of fair market value.
(2)
Additional inclusion amount when less than predominant use in a qualified business use.
(i) If a passenger automobile, which is leased after June 18, 1984, and before April 3, 1985, is not used predominantly in a qualified business use during a taxable year, the lessee must add to gross income in the first taxable year that the automobile is not so used (and only in that year) an inclusion amount determined under this paragraph (d)(2). This inclusion amount is in addition to the amount required to be included in gross income under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(ii) If the fair market value (as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section) of the automobile is greater than $16,500, the inclusion amount is determined by multiplying the average of the business/investment use (as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section) by the appropriate dollar amount from the table in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section. If the fair market value (as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section) of the automobile is $16,500 or less, the inclusion amount is the product of the fair market value of the automobile, the average business/investment use, and the applicable percentage from the table in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section.

—(1)
In general.
For any passenger automobile that is leased after April 2, 1985, and before January 1, 1987, for each taxable year (except the last taxable year) during which the taxpayer leases the automobile, the taxpayer must include in gross income an inclusion amount determined under subparagraphs (2) through (5) of this paragraph (e). Additional inclusion amounts when a passenger automobile is not used predominantly in a qualified business use during a taxable year are determined under paragraph (e)(6) of this section.
See
paragraph (h)(2) of this section for the definition of fair market value.
(2)
Fair market value not greater than $50,000: years one through three.
For any passenger automobile that has a fair market value not greater than $50,000, the inclusion amount for each of the first three taxable years during which the automobile is leased is determined as follows:
(i) For the appropriate range of fair market values in the table in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section, select the dollar amount from the column for the quarter of the taxable year in which the automobile is first used under the lease,
(ii) Prorate the dollar amount for the number of days of the lease term included in the taxable year, and
(iii) Multiply the prorated dollar amount by the business/investment use for the taxable year.

Fair market value greater than $50,000: years one through six.
(i) For any passenger automobile that has a fair market value greater than $50,000, the inclusion amount for the first six taxable years during which the automobile is leased is determined as follows:
(A) Determine the dollar amount by using the appropriate formula in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section,
(B) Prorate the dollar amount for the number of days of the lease term included in the taxable year, and
(C) Multiply this dollar amount by the business/investment use for the taxable year.
(ii) The dollar amount is computed as follows:
(A) If the automobile is first used under the lease in the fourth quarter of a taxable year, the dollar amount for each of the first three taxable years during which the automobile is leased is the sum of—
(
1
) $124, and
(
2
) 11 percent of the excess of the automobile's fair market value over $13,200.
(B) If the automobile is first used under the lease in the third quarter of a taxable year, the dollar amount for each of the first three taxable years during which the automobile is leased is the sum of—
(
1
) $110, and
(
2
) 10 percent of the excess of the automobile's fair market value over $13,200.
(C) If the automobile is first used under the lease in the second quarter of a taxable year, the dollar amount for each of the first three taxable years during which the automobile is leased is the sum of—
(
1
) $100, and
(
2
) 9 percent of the excess of the automobile's fair market value over $13,200.
(D) If the automobile is first used under the lease in the first quarter of a taxable year, the dollar amount for each of the first three taxable years during which the automobile is leased is the sum of—
(
1
) $90, and
(
2
) 8 percent of the excess of the automobile's fair market value over $13,200.
(E) For the fourth taxable year during which the automobile is leased, the dollar amount is 6 percent of the excess of the automobile's fair market value over $18,000.
(F) For the fifth taxable year during which the automobile is leased, the dollar amount is 6 percent of the excess of the automobile's fair market value over $22,800.
(G) For the sixth taxable year during which the automobile is leased, the dollar amount is 6 percent of the excess of the automobile's fair market value over $27,600.
(5)
Seventh and subsequent taxable years.
(i) For any passenger automobile that has a fair market value less than or equal to $32,400, the inclusion amount for the seventh and subsequent taxable years during which the automobile is leased is zero.
(ii) For any passenger automobile that has a fair market value greater than $32,400, the inclusion amount for the seventh and subsequent taxable years during which the automobile is leased is 6 percent of—
(A) The excess (if any) of the automobile's fair market value, over
(B) The sum of—
(
1
) $13,200 and
(
2
) $4,800 multiplied by the number of taxable years in excess of three years.

Additional inclusion amount when less than predominant use in a qualified business use.
(i) If a passenger automobile, which is leased after April 2, 1985, and before January 1, 1987, is not predominantly used in a qualified business use during a taxable year, the lessee must add to gross income in the first taxable year that the automobile is not so used (and only in that year) an inclusion amount determined under this paragraph (e)(6). This inclusion amount is in addition to the amount required to be included in gross income under paragraph (e) (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section.
(ii) If the fair market value (as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section) of the automobile is greater than $11,250, the inclusion amount is determined by multiplying the average of the business/investment use (as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section) by the appropriate dollar amount from the table in paragraph (e)(6)(iii) of this section. If the fair market value of the automobile is $11,250 or less, the inclusion amount is the product of the fair market value of the automobile, the average business/investment use, and the applicable percentage from the table in paragraph (e)(6)(iv) of this section.

(g)
Special rules applicable to inclusions in income of lessees.
This paragraph (g) applies to the inclusions in gross income of lessees prescribed under paragraphs (d)(2), (e)(6), or (f) of this section, or prescribed under § 1.280F-7(b).
(1)
Lease term commences within 9 months of the end of lessee's taxable year.
If:
(i) The lease term commences within 9 months before the close of the lessee's taxable year,
(ii) The property is not predominantly used in a qualified business use during that portion of the taxable year, and
(iii) The lease term continues into the lessee's subsequent taxable year, then the inclusion amount is added to gross income in the lessee's subsequent taxable year and the amount is determined by taking into account the average of the business/investment use for both taxable years and the applicable percentage for the taxable year in which the lease term begins (or, in the case of a passenger automobile with a fair market value greater than $16,500, the appropriate dollar amount for the taxable year in which the lease term begins).
(2)
Lease term less than one year.
If the lease term is less than one year, the amount which must be added to gross income is an amount that bears the same ratio to the inclusion amount determined before the application of this paragraph (g)(2) as the number of days in the lease term bears to 365.
(3)
Maximum inclusion amount.
The inclusion amount shall not exceed the sum of all deductible amounts in connection with the use of the listed property properly allocable to the lessee's taxable year in which the inclusion amount must be added to gross income.
(h)
Definitions
—(1)
Lease term.
In determining the term of any lease for purposes of this section, the rules of section 168(i)(3)(A) shall apply.
(2)
Fair market value.
For purposes of this section, the fair market value of listed property is such value on the first day of the lease term. If the capitalized cost of listed property is specified in the lease agreement, the lessee shall treat such amount as the fair market value of the property.
(3)
Average business/investment use.
For purposes of this section, the average business/investment use of any listed property is the average of the business/investment use for the first taxable year in which the business use percentage is 50 percent or less and all preceding taxable years in which such property is leased. See paragraph (g)(1) of this section for special rule when lease term commences within 9 months before the end of the lessee's taxable year.
(i)
Examples.
This section may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
On January 1, 1985, A, a calendar year taxpayer, leases and places in service a passenger automobile with a fair market value of $55,000. The lease is to be for a period of four years. During taxable years 1985
and 1986, A uses the automobile exclusively in a trade or business. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, A must include in gross income in both 1985 and 1986, $2,887.50 (
i.e.,
($55,000−$16,500) × 7.5%).

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
and in addition, A uses the automobile only 45 percent in a trade or business during 1987. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section for 1987, A must include in gross income $1,299.38 (
i.e.,
($55,000−$16,500) × 7.5% × 45%). In addition, under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, A must also include in gross income in 1987, $530.85 (
i.e.,
$650 × 81.67%, average business/investment use).

# Example 3.
On August 1, 1985, B, a calendar year taxpayer, leases and places in service an item of listed property which is 5-year recovery property, with a fair market value of $10,000. The lease is to be for a period of 5 years. B's qualified business use of the property is 40 percent in 1985, 100 percent in 1986, and 90 percent in 1987. Under paragraphs (f)(1) and (g)(1) of this section, before the application of paragraph (g)(3) of this section, B must include in gross income in 1986, $1,288.00 (
i.e.,
$10,000 × 70% × 18.4%, the product of the fair market value, the average business use for both taxable years, and the applicable percentage for year one from the table in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section).

# Example 4.
On October 1, 1985, C, a calendar year taxpayer, leases and places in service an item of listed property which is 3-year recovery property with a fair market value of $15,000. The lease term is 6 months (ending March 31, 1986) during which C uses the property 45 percent in a trade or business, the only business/investment use. Under paragraphs (f)(1) and (g) (1) and (2) of this section, before the application of paragraph (g)(3) of this section, C must include in gross income in 1986, $100.97 (
i.e.,
$15,000 × 45% × 3% × 182/365, the product of the fair market value, the average business use for both taxable years, and the applicable percentage for year one from the table in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, prorated for the length of the lease term).

# Example 5.
On July 15, 1985, A, a calendar year taxpayer, leases and places in service a passenger automobile with a fair market value of $45,300. The lease is for a period of 5 years, during which A uses the automobile exclusively in a trade or business. Under paragraph (e) (2) and (3) of this section, for taxable years 1985 through 1989, A must include the following amounts in gross income:
Taxable year
Dollar amount
Proration
Business use (percent)

The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that A uses the automobile only 45 percent in a trade or business during 1987 through 1990. Under § 1.280F-5T(e)(6), A must include in gross income for taxable year 1987, the first taxable year in which the automobile is not used predominantly in a trade or business, an additional amount based on the average business/investment use for taxable years 1985 through 1987. For taxable years 1985 through 1989, A must include the following amounts in gross income:

§ 1.280F-6
Special rules and definitions.
(a)
Deductions of employee
—(1)
In general.
Employee use of listed property shall not be treated as business/investment use (as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section) for purposes of determining the amount of any recovery deduction allowable (including any deduction under section 179) to the employee unless that use is for the convenience of the employer and required as a condition of employment.
(2)
“Convenience of the employer” and “condition of employment” requirements
—(i)
In general.
The terms
convenience of the employer
and
condition of employment
generally have the same meaning for purposes of section 280F as they have for purposes of section 119 (relating to the exclusion from gross income for meals or lodging furnished for the convenience of the employer).
(ii)
“Condition of employment.”
In order to satisfy the “condition of employment” requirement, the use of the property must be required in order for the employee to perform the duties of his or her employment properly. Whether the use of the property is so required depends on all the facts and circumstances. Thus, the employer need not explicitly require the employee to use the property. Similarly, a mere statement by the employer that the use of the property is a condition of employment is not sufficient.
(iii)
“Convenience of employer”.
[Reserved]
(3)
Employee use.
For purposes of this section, the term
employee use
means any use in connection with the performance of services by the employee as an employee.
(4)
Examples.
The principles of this paragraph are illustrated in the following examples:

# Example 1.
A is employed as a courier with W, which provides local courier services. A owns and uses a motorcycle to deliver packages to downtown offices for W. W does not provide delivery vehicles and explicitly requires all of its couriers to own a car or motorcycle for use in their employment with the company. A's use of the motorcycle for delivery purposes is for the convenience of W and is required as a condition of employment.

# Example 2.
B is an inspector for X, a construction company with many construction sites in the local area. B is required to travel to the various construction sites on a regular basis; B uses her automobile to make these trips. Although X does not furnish B an automobile, X does not explicitly require B to use here own automobile. However, X reimburses B for any costs she incurs in traveling to the various job sites. B's use of here automobile in here employment is for the convenience of X and is required as a condition of employment.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2,
except that X makes an automobile available to B who chooses to use her own automobile and receive reimbursement. B's use of her own automobile is not for the convenience of X and is not required as a condition of employment.

# Example 4.
C is a pilot for Y, a small charter airline. Y requires its pilots to obtain x hours of flight time annually in addition to the number of hours of flight time spent with the airline. Pilots can usually obtain these hours by flying with a military reserve unit or by flying part-time with another airline. C owns his own airplane. C's use of his airplane to obtain the required flight hours is not for the convenience of the employer and is not required as a condition of employment.

# Example 5.
D is employed as an engineer with Z, an engineering contracting firm. D occasionally takes work home at night rather than working late in the office. D owns and uses a computer which is virtually identical to the one she uses at the office to complete her work at home. D's use of the computer is not for the convenience of here employer and is not required as a condition of employment.
(b)
Listed property
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the term
listed property
means:

does not include any photographic, phonographic, communication, or video recording equipment of a taxpayer if the equipment is use either exclusively at the taxpayer's regular business establishment or in connection with the taxpayer's principal trade or business.
(iii)
Regular business establishment.
The regular business establishment of an employee is the regular business establishment of the employer of the employee. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), a portion of a dwelling unit is treated as a regular business establishment if the requirements of section 280A(c)(1) are met with respect to that portion.
(4)
Other property.
[Reserved]
(5)
Exception for computers.
The term
listed property
shall not include any computer (including peripheral equipment) used exclusively at a regular business establishment.

(2)
Parts, etc. of automobile.

§ 1.280F-3T.
(ii)
Exception for certain use by 5-percent owners and related persons

—(i)
In general.
The term
business/investment use
means the total business or investment use of listed property that may be taken into account for purposes of computing (without regard to section 280F(b)) the percentage of cost recovery deduction for a passenger automobile or other listed property for the taxable year. Whether the accelerated percentages under section 168 (as opposed to use of the straight line method of cost recovery) are available with respect to listed property or must be recaptured is determined, however, by reference to qualified business use (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) rather than by reference to business/investment use. Whether a particular use of property is a business or investment use shall generally be determined under the rules of section 162 or 212.
(ii)
Entertainment use.
The use of listed property for entertainment, recreation, or amusement purposes shall be treated as business use to the extent that expenses (other than interest and property tax expenses) attributable to that use are deductible after application of section 274.
(iii)
Employee use.
See paragraph (a) of this section for requirements to be satisfied for employee use of listed property to be considered business/investment use of the property.
(iv)
Use of taxpayer's automobile by another person.
Any use of the taxpayer's automobile by another person shall not be treated, for purposes of section 280F, as use in a trade or business under section 162 unless that use:
(A) Is directly connected with the business of the taxpayer,
(B) Is properly reported by the taxpayer as income to the other person and, where required, there was withholding under chapter 24, or
(C) Results in a payment of fair market rent.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(C), payment to the owner of the automobile in connection with such use is treated as the payment of rent.
(4)
Predominantly used in qualified business use
—(i)
Definition.
Property is predominantly used in a qualified business use for any taxable year if the business use percentage (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) is greater than 50 percent.
(ii)
Special rule for transfers at death.
Property does not cease to be used predominantly in a qualified business use by reason of a transfer at death.
(iii)
Other dispositions of property.
[Reserved]
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles set forth in this paragraph.

# Example 1.
E uses a home computer 50 percent of the time to manage her investments. The computer is listed property within the meaning of section 280F(d)(4). E also uses the computer 40 percent of the time in her part-time consumer research business. Because E's business use percentage for the computer does not exceed 50 percent, the computer is not predominantly used in a qualified business use for the taxable year. Her aggregate business/investment use for purposes of determining the percent of the total allowable straight line depreciation that she can claim is 90 percent.

# Example 2.
Assume that E in
Example 1
uses the computer 30 percent of the time to manage her investments and 60 percent of the time in her consumer research business. E's business use percentage exceeds 50 percent. Her aggregrate business/investment use for purposes of determining her allowable investment tax credit and cost recovery deductions is 90 percent.

# Example 3.
F is the proprietor of a plumbing contracting business. F's brother is employed with F's company. As part of his compensation, F's brother is allowed to use one of the company automobiles for personal use. The use of the company automobiles by F's brother is not a qualified business use because F and F's brother are related parties within the meaning of section 267(b).

# Example 4.
F, in
Example 3,
allows employees unrelated to him to use company automobiles as part of their compensation. F, however, does not include the value of these automobiles in the employees' gross income and F does not withhold with respect to the use of these automobiles. The use of the company automobiles by the employees in this case is not business/investment use.

# Example 5.
X Corporation owns several automobiles which its employees use for business purposes. The employees are also allowed to take the automobiles home at night. However, the fair market value of the use of the automobile for any personal purpose,
e.g.,
commuting to work, is reported by X as income to the employee and is withheld upon by X. The use of the automobile by the employee, even for personal purposes, is a qualified business use the respect to X.
(e)
Method of allocating use of property
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 280F, the taxpayer shall allocate the use of any listed property that is used for more than one purpose during the taxable year to the various uses in the manner prescribed in paragraph (e) (2) and (3) of this section.
(2)
Passenger automobiles and other means of transportation.
In the case of a passenger automobile or any other means of transportation, the taxpayer shall allocate the use of the property on the basis of mileage. Thus, the percentage of use in a trade or business for the year shall be determined by dividing the number of miles the vehicle is driven for purposes of that trade or business during the year by the total number of miles the vehicle is driven during the year for any purpose.
(3)
Other listed property.
In the case of other listed property, the taxpayer shall allocate the use of that property on the basis of the most appropriate unit of time the property is actually used (rather than merely being available for use). For example, the percentage of use of a computer in a trade or business for a taxable year is determined by dividing the number of hours the computer is used for business purposes during the year by the total number of hours the computer is used for any purpose during the year.
(f)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, this section applies to property placed in service by a taxpayer on or after July 7, 2003. For regulations applicable to property placed in service before July 7, 2003, see § 1.280F-6T as in effect prior to July 7, 2003 (§ 1.280F-6T as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2003).
(2)
Property placed in service before July 7, 2003.
The following rules apply to property that is described in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, was placed in service by the taxpayer before July 7, 2003, and was treated by the taxpayer as a passenger automobile under § 1.280F-6T as in effect prior to July 7, 2003 (pre-effective date vehicle):
(i) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(2)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section, a pre-effective date vehicle will be treated as a passenger automobile to which section 280F(a) applies.
(ii) A pre-effective date vehicle will be treated as property to which section 280F(a) does not apply if the taxpayer adopts that treatment in determining depreciation deductions on the taxpayer's original return for the year in which the vehicle is placed in service.
(iii) A pre-effective date vehicle will be treated, to the extent provided in this paragraph (f)(2)(iii), as property to which section 280F(a) does not apply if the taxpayer adopts that treatment on an amended Federal tax return in accordance with this paragraph (f)(2)(iii). This paragraph (f)(2)(iii) applies only if, on or before December 31, 2004, the taxpayer files, for all applicable taxable years, amended Federal tax returns (or qualified amended returns, if applicable (for further guidance, see Rev. Proc. 94-69 (1994-2 C.B. 804) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter)) treating the vehicle as property to which section 280F(a) does not apply. The applicable taxable years for this purpose are the taxable year in which the vehicle was placed in service by the taxpayer (or, if the period of limitation for assessment under section 6501 has expired for such year or any subsequent year (a closed year), the first taxable year following the most recent closed year) and all subsequent taxable years in which the vehicle was treated on the taxpayer's return as property to which section 280F(a) applies. If the earliest applicable taxable year is not the year in which the vehicle was placed in service, the adjusted depreciable basis of the property as of the beginning of the first applicable taxable year is recovered over the remaining recovery period. If the remaining recovery period as of the beginning of the first applicable taxable year is less than 12 months, the entire adjusted depreciable basis of the property as of the beginning of the first applicable taxable year is recovered in that year.
(iv) A pre-effective date vehicle will be treated, to the extent provided in this paragraph (f)(2)(iv), as property to which section 280F(a) does not apply if the taxpayer adopts that treatment on Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method, in accordance with this paragraph (f)(2)(iv). The taxpayer must follow the applicable administrative procedures issued under
§ 1.446-1(e)(3)(ii) for obtaining the Commissioner's automatic consent to a change in method of accounting (for further guidance, for example, see Rev. Proc. 2002-9 (2002-1 C.B. 327) and § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter). If the taxpayer files a Form 3115 treating the vehicle as property to which section 280F(a) does not apply, the taxpayer will be permitted to treat the change as a change in method of accounting under section 446(e) of the Internal Revenue Code and to take into account the section 481 adjustment resulting from the method change. For purposes of Form 3115, the designated number for the automatic accounting method change authorized for this paragraph (f)(2)(iv) is 89.

§ 1.280F-7
Property leased after December 31, 1986.
(a)
Inclusions in income of lessees of passenger automobiles leased after December 31, 1986
—(1)
In general.
If a taxpayer leases a passenger automobile after December 31, 1986, the taxpayer must include in gross income an inclusion amount determined under this paragraph (a), for each taxable year during which the taxpayer leases the automobile. This paragraph (a) applies only to passenger automobiles for which the taxpayer's lease term begins after December 31, 1986. See §§ 1.280F-5T(d) and 1.280F-5T(e) for rules on determining inclusion amounts for passenger automobiles for which the taxpayer's lease term begins before January 1, 1987. See § 1.280F-5T(h)(2) for the definition of fair market value.
(2)
Inclusion Amount.
For any passenger automobile leased after December 31, 1986, the inclusion amount for each taxable year during which the automobile is leased is determined as follows:
(i) For the appropriate range of fair market values in the applicable table, select the dollar amount from the column for the taxable year in which the automobile is used under the lease (but for the last taxable year during any lease that does not begin and end in the same taxable year, use the dollar amount for the preceding taxable year).
(ii) Prorate the dollar amount for the number of days of the lease term included in the taxable year.
(iii) Multiply the prorated dollar amount by the business/investment use (as defined in § 1.280F-6(d)(3)(i)) for the taxable year.
(iv) The following table is the applicable table in the case of a passenger automobile leased after December 31, 1986, and before January 1, 1989:

(v) The applicable table in the case of a passenger automobile first leased after December 31, 1988, will be contained in a revenue ruling or revenue procedure published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
(3)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (a):

# Example.
On April 1, 1987, A, a calendar year taxpayer, leases and places in service a passenger automobile with a fair market value of $31,500. The lease is to be for a period of three years. During taxable years 1987 and 1988, A uses the automobile exclusively in a trade or business. During 1989 and 1990, A's business/investment use is 45 percent. The appropriate dollar amounts from the table in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section are $260 for 1987 (first taxable year during the lease), $568 for 1988 (second taxable year during the lease), $842 for 1989 (third taxable year during the lease), and $842 for 1990. Since 1990 is the last taxable year during the lease, the dollar amount for the preceding year (the third year) is used, rather than the dollar amount for the fourth year. For taxable years 1987 through 1990, A's inclusion amounts are determined as follows:
Tax year
Dollar amount
Proration
Business use (percent)

(b)
Inclusions in income of lessees of listed property (other than passenger automobiles) leased after December 31, 1986
—(1)
In general.
If listed property other than a passenger automobile is not used predominantly in a qualified business use in any taxable year in which such property is leased, the lessee must add an inclusion amount to gross income in the first taxable year in which such property is not so predominantly used (and only in that year). This year is the first taxable year in which the business use percentage (as defined in § 1.280F-6(d)(1)) of the property is 50 percent or less. This inclusion amount is determined under this paragraph (b) for property for which the taxpayer's lease term begins after December 31, 1986 (and under § 1.280F-5T(f) for property for which the taxpayer's lease term begins before January 1, 1987). See also § 1.280F-5T(g).
(2)
Inclusion amount.
The inclusion amount for any listed property (other than a passenger automobile) leased after December 31, 1986, is the sum of the amounts determined under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph (2).
(i) The amount determined under this subdivision (i) is the product of the following amounts:
(A) The fair market value (as defined in § 1.280F-5T(h)(2)) of the property,
(B) The business/investment use (as defined in § 1.280F-6(d)(3)(i)) for the first taxable year in which the business use percentage (as defined in § 1.280F-6(d)(1)) is 50 percent or less, and

Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (b):

# Example.
On February 1, 1987, B, a calendar year taxpayer, leases and places in service a computer with a fair market value of $3,000. The lease is to be for a period of two years. B's qualified business use of the property, which is the only business/investment use, is 80 percent in taxable year 1987, 40 percent in taxable year 1988, and 35 percent in taxable year 1989. B must add an inclusion amount to gross income for taxable year 1988, the first taxable year in which B does not use the computer predominantly for business (
i.e.,
the first taxable year in which B's business use percentage is 50 percent or less). Since 1988 is the second taxable year during the lease, and since the computer has a 5-year recovery period under the General and Alternative Depreciation Systems, the applicable percentage from the table in subdivision (i) of paragraph (b)(2) is −7.2%, and the applicable percentage from the table in subdivision (ii) is 10%. B's inclusion amount is $154, which is the sum of the amounts determined under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (b)(2) of this paragraph. The amount determined under subdivision (i) is −$86 [$3,000 × 40% × (−7.2%)], and the amount determined under subdivision (ii) is $240 [$3,000 × 80% × 10%].

# Overview
Q-1: What is the effect of Internal Revenue Code section 280G?
A-1: (a) Section 280G disallows a deduction for any excess parachute payment paid or accrued. For rules relating to the imposition of a nondeductible 20-percent excise tax on the recipient of any excess parachute payment, see Internal Revenue Code sections 4999, 275(a)(6), and 3121(v)(2)(A).
(b) The disallowance of a deduction under section 280G is not contingent on the imposition of the excise tax under section 4999. The imposition of the excise tax under section 4999 is not contingent on the disallowance of a deduction under section 280G. Thus, for example, because the imposition of the excise tax under section 4999 is not contingent on the disallowance of a deduction under section 280G, a payee may be subject to the 20-percent excise tax under section 4999 even though the disallowance of the deduction for the excess parachute payment may not directly affect the federal taxable income of the payor.
Q-2: What is a parachute payment for purposes of section 280G?
A-2: (a) The term
parachute payment
means any payment (other than an exempt payment described in Q/A-5) that—
(1) Is in the nature of compensation;
(2) Is made or is to be made to (or for the benefit of) a disqualified individual;
(3) Is contingent on a change—
(i) In the ownership of a corporation;
(ii) In the effective control of a corporation; or
(iii) In the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation; and
(4) Has (together with other payments described in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this A-2 with respect to the same disqualified individual) an aggregate present value of at least 3 times the individual's base amount.
(b) Hereinafter, a change referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this A-2 is generally referred to as a change in ownership or control. For a discussion of the application of paragraph (a)(1),
see
Q/A-11 through Q/A-14; paragraph (a)(2), Q/A-15 through Q/A-21; paragraph (a)(3), Q/A-22 through Q/A-29; and paragraph (a)(4), Q/A-30 through Q/A-36.
(c) The term
parachute payment
also includes any payment in the nature of compensation to (or for the benefit of) a disqualified individual that is pursuant to an agreement that violates a generally enforced securities law or regulation. This type of parachute payment is referred to in this section as a securities violation parachute payment.
See
Q/A-37 for the definition and treatment of securities violation parachute payments.
Q-3: What is an excess parachute payment for purposes of section 280G?
A-3: The term
excess parachute payment
means an amount equal to the excess of any parachute payment over the portion of the base amount allocated to such payment. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, an excess parachute payment is reduced by any portion of the payment which the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidence is reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered by the disqualified individual before the date of the change in ownership or control. For a discussion of the nonreduction of a securities violation parachute payment by reasonable compensation,
see
Q/A-37. For a discussion of the computation of excess parachute payments and their reduction by reasonable compensation,
see
Q/A-38 through Q/A-44.
Q-4: What is the effective date of section 280G and this section?
A-4: In general, section 280G applies to payments under agreements entered into or renewed after June 14, 1984. Section 280G also applies to certain payments under agreements entered into on or before June 14, 1984, and amended or supplemented in significant relevant respect after that date. This section applies to any payment that is contingent on a change in ownership or control and the change in ownership or control occurs on or after January 1, 2004. For a discussion of the application of the effective date,
see
Q/A-47 and Q/A-48.

# Exempt Payments
Q-5: Are some types of payments exempt from the definition of the term
parachute payment?
A-5: (a) Yes, the following five types of payments are exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
—
(1) Payments with respect to a small business corporation (described in Q/A-6 of this section);
(2) Certain payments with respect to a corporation no stock in which is readily tradeable on an established securities market (or otherwise) (described in Q/A-6 of this section);
(3) Payments to or from a qualified plan (described in Q/A-8 of this section);
(4) Certain payments made by a corporation undergoing a change in ownership or control that is described in any of the following sections of the Internal Revenue Code: section 501(c) (but only if such organization is subject to an express statutory prohibition against inurement of net earnings to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual, or if the organization is described in section 501(c)(1) or section 501(c)(21)), section 501(d), or section 529, collectively referred to as
tax-exempt organizations
(described in Q/A-6 of this section); and
(5) Certain payments of reasonable compensation for services to be rendered on or after the change in ownership or control (described in Q/A-9 of this section).
(b) Deductions for payments exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
are not disallowed by section 280G, and such exempt payments are not subject to the 20-percent excise tax of section 4999. In addition, such exempt payments are not taken into account in applying the 3-times-base-amount test of Q/A-30 of this section.
Q-6: Which payments with respect to a corporation referred to in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(4) of Q/A-5 of this section are exempt from the definition of
parachute payment?
A-6: (a) The term
parachute payment
does not include—
(1) Any payment to a disqualified individual with respect to a corporation which (immediately before the change in ownership or control) would qualify as a small business corporation (as defined in section 1361(b) but without regard to section 1361(b)(1)(C) thereof), without regard to whether the corporation had an election to be treated as a corporation under section 1361 in effect on the date of the change in ownership or control;
(2) Any payment to a disqualified individual with respect to a corporation (other than a small business corporation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this A-6) if—
(i) Immediately before the change in ownership or control, no stock in such corporation was readily tradeable on an established securities market or otherwise; and
(ii) The shareholder approval requirements described in Q/A-7 of this section are met with respect to such payment; or
(3) Any payment to a disqualified individual made by a corporation which is a tax-exempt organization (as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of Q/A-5 of this section), but only if the corporation meets the definition of a tax-exempt organization both immediately before and immediately after the change in ownership or control.
(b) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this A-6, the members of an affiliated group are not treated as one corporation.
(c) The requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this A-6 are not met with respect to a corporation if a substantial portion of the assets of any entity consists (directly or indirectly) of stock in such corporation and any ownership interest in such entity is readily tradeable on an established securities market or otherwise. For this purpose, such stock constitutes a substantial portion of the assets of an entity if the total fair market value of the stock is equal to or exceeds one third of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the entity. For this purpose,
gross fair market value
means the value of the assets of the entity, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets. If a corporation is a member of an affiliated group (which group is
treated as one corporation under A-46 of this section), the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this A-6 are not met if any stock in any member of such group is readily tradeable on an established securities market or otherwise.
(d) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this A-6, the term
stock
does not include stock described in section 1504(a)(4) if the payment does not adversely affect the redemption and liquidation rights of any shareholder owning such stock.
(e) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this A-6, stock is treated as readily tradeable if it is regularly quoted by brokers or dealers making a market in such stock.
(f) For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this A-6, the term
established securities market
means an established securities market as defined in § 1.897-1(m).
(g) The following examples illustrate the application of this exemption:

# Example 1.
A small business corporation (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this A-6) operates two businesses. The corporation sells the assets of one of its businesses, and these assets represent a substantial portion of the assets of the corporation. Because of the sale, the corporation terminates its employment relationship with persons employed in the business the assets of which are sold. Several of these employees are highly-compensated individuals to whom the owners of the corporation make severance payments in excess of 3 times each employee's base amount. Since the corporation is a small business corporation immediately before the change in ownership or control, the payments are not parachute payments.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the corporation is not a small business corporation within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this A-6. If no stock in the corporation is readily tradeable on an established securities market (or otherwise) immediately before the change in ownership or control and the shareholder approval requirements described in Q/A-7 of this section are met, the payments are not parachute payments.

# Example 3.
Stock of Corporation S is owned by Corporation P, stock in which is readily tradeable on an established securities market. The Corporation S stock equals or exceeds one third of the total gross fair market value of the assets of Corporation P, and thus, represents a substantial portion of the assets of Corporation P. Corporation S makes severance payments to several of its highly-compensated individuals that are parachute payments under section 280G and Q/A-2 of this section. Because stock in Corporation P is readily tradeable on an established securities market, the payments are not exempt from the definition of
parachute payments
under this A-6.

# Example 4.
A is a corporation described in section 501(c)(3), and accordingly, its net earnings are prohibited from inuring to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. A transfers substantially all of its assets to another corporation resulting in a change in ownership or control. Contingent on the change in ownership or control, A makes a payment that, but for the potential application of the exemption described in A-5(a)(4), would constitute a
parachute payment.
However, one or more aspects of the transaction that constitutes the change in ownership or control causes A to fail to be described in section 501(c)(3). Accordingly, A fails to meet the definition of a
tax-exempt organization
both immediately before and immediately after the change in ownership or control, as required by this A-6. As a result, the payment made by A that was contingent on the change in ownership or control is not exempt from the definition of parachute payment under this A-6.

# Example 5.
B is a corporation described in section 501(c)(15). B does not meet the definition of a
tax-exempt organization
because section 501(c)(15) does not expressly prohibit inurement of B's net earnings to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. Accordingly, if B has a change in ownership or control and makes a payment that would otherwise meet the definition of a
parachute payment,
such payment is not exempt from the definition of the term
parachute payment
for purposes of this A-6.
Q-7: How are the shareholder approval requirements referred to in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of Q/A-6 of this section met?
A-7: (a)
General rule.
The shareholder approval requirements referred to in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of Q/A-6 of this section are met with respect to any payment if—
(1) Such payment is approved by more than 75 percent of the voting power of all outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote (as described in this A-7) immediately before the change in ownership or control; and
(2) Before the vote, there was adequate disclosure to all persons entitled to vote (as described in this A-7) of all material facts concerning all material payments which (but for Q/A-6 of this section) would be parachute payments with respect to a disqualified individual.
(b)
Voting requirements
—(1)
General rule.
The vote described in paragraph (a)(1) of this A-7 must determine the right of the disqualified individual to receive the payment, or, in the case of a payment made before the vote, the right of the disqualified individual to retain the payment. Except as otherwise provided in this A-7, the normal voting rules of the corporation are applicable. Thus, for example, an optionholder is generally not permitted to vote for purposes of this A-7. For
purposes of this A-7, the vote can be on less than the full amount of the payment(s) to be made. Shareholder approval can be a single vote on all payments to any one disqualified individual, or on all payments to more than one disqualified individual. The total payment(s) submitted for shareholder approval, however, must be separately approved by the shareholders. The requirements of this paragraph (b)(1) are not satisfied if approval of the change in ownership or control is contingent, or otherwise conditioned, on the approval of any payment to a disqualified individual that would be a parachute payment but for Q/A-6 of this section.
(2)
Special rule.
A vote to approve the payment does not fail to be a vote of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote immediately before the change in ownership or control merely because the determination of the shareholders entitled to vote on the payment is based on the shareholders of record as of any day within the six-month period immediately prior to and ending on date of the change in ownership or control, provided the disclosure requirements described in paragraph (c) of this A-7 are met.
(3)
Entity shareholder.
(i) Approval of a payment by any shareholder that is not an individual (an entity shareholder) generally must be made by the person authorized by the entity shareholder to approve the payment. See paragraph (b)(4) of this A-7 if the person so authorized by the entity shareholder is a disqualified individual who would receive a parachute payment if the shareholder approval requirements of this A-7 are not met.
(ii) However, if a substantial portion of the assets of an entity shareholder consists (directly or indirectly) of stock in the corporation undergoing the change in ownership or control, approval of the payment by that entity shareholder must be made by a separate vote of the persons who hold, immediately before the change in ownership or control, more than 75 percent of the voting power of the entity shareholder entitled to vote. The preceding sentence does not apply if the value of the stock of the corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by or for the entity shareholder does not exceed 1 percent of the total value of the outstanding stock of the corporation undergoing a change in ownership or control. Where approval of a payment by an entity shareholder must be made by a separate vote of the owners of the entity shareholder, the normal voting rights of the entity shareholder determine which owners shall vote. For purposes of this (b)(3)(ii), stock represents a substantial portion of the assets of an entity shareholder if the total fair market value of the stock held by the entity shareholder in the corporation undergoing the change in ownership or control is equal to or exceeds one third of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the entity shareholder. For this purpose,
gross fair market value
means the value of the assets of the entity, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.
(4)
Disqualified individuals and attribution of stock ownership.
In determining the persons entitled to vote referred to in paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(3) of this A-7, stock that would otherwise be entitled to vote is not counted as outstanding stock and is not considered in determining whether the more than 75 percent vote has been obtained under this A-7 if the stock is actually owned or constructively owned under section 318(a) by or for a disqualified individual who receives (or is to receive) payments that would be parachute payments if the shareholder approval requirements described in paragraph (a) of this A-7 are not met. Likewise, stock is not counted as outstanding stock if the owner is considered under section 318(a) to own any part of the stock owned directly or indirectly by or for a disqualified individual described in the preceding sentence. In addition, if the person authorized to vote the stock of an entity shareholder is a disqualified individual who would receive a parachute payment if the shareholder approval requirements described in this A-7 are not met, such person is not permitted to vote such shares, but the entity shareholder is permitted to appoint an equity interest holder in the entity shareholder, or in the case of a trust another person eligible to vote on behalf of the trust, to vote the otherwise eligible shares. However, if all persons who hold voting power in the corporation undergoing the change in ownership or control are disqualified individuals or related persons described in this paragraph (b)(4), then such stock is counted as outstanding stock and votes by such persons are considered in determining whether the more than 75 percent vote has been obtained.
(c)
Adequate disclosure.
To be adequate disclosure for purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this A-7, disclosure must be full and truthful disclosure of the material facts and such additional information as is necessary to make the disclosure not materially misleading at the time the disclosure is made. Disclosure of such information must be made to every shareholder of the corporation entitled to vote under this A-7. For each disqualified individual, material facts that must be disclosed include, but are not limited to, the event triggering the payment or payments, the total amount of the payments that would be parachute payments if the shareholder approval requirements described in paragraph (a) of this A-7 are not met, and a brief description of each payment (
e.g.,
accelerated vesting of options, bonus, or salary). An omitted fact is considered a material fact if there is a substantial likelihood that a
reasonable shareholder would consider it important.
(d)
Corporation without shareholders.
If a corporation does not have shareholders, the exemption described in Q/A-6(a)(2) of this section and the shareholder approval requirements described in this A-7 do not apply. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (d), a shareholder does not include a member in an association, joint stock company, or insurance company.
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this A-7:

# Example 1.
Corporation S has two shareholders—Corporation P, which owns 76 percent of the stock of Corporation S, and A, a disqualified individual who would receive a parachute payment if the shareholder approval requirements of this A-7 are not met. No stock of Corporation P or S is readily tradeable on an established securities market (or otherwise). The value of the stock of Corporation S equals or exceeds one third of the gross fair market value of the assets of Corporation P, and thus, represents a substantial portion of the assets of Corporation P. All of the stock of Corporation S is sold to Corporation M. Contingent on the change in ownership of Corporation S, severance payments are made to certain officers of Corporation S in excess of 3 times each officer's base amount. If the payments are approved by a separate vote of the persons who hold, immediately before the sale, more than 75 percent of the voting power of the outstanding stock entitled to vote of Corporation P and the disclosure rules of paragraph (a)(2) of this A-7 are complied with, the shareholder approval requirements of this A-7 are met, and the payments are exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
pursuant to A-6 of this section.

# Example 2.
(i) Stock of Corporation X, none of which is traded on an established market, is acquired by Corporation Y. In the voting ballot concerning the sale, the Corporation X shareholders are asked to vote either “yes” on the sale and “yes” to paying parachute payments to A, a disqualified individual with respect to Corporation A, or “no” on the sale and “no” to paying parachute payments to A.
(ii) Because the approval of the change in ownership or control is conditioned on the approval of the payments to A, the shareholder approval requirements of this A-7 are not satisfied. If the payments are made to A, the payments are not exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
pursuant to Q/A-6 of this section.
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 2,
except that the acquisition agreement between Corporation X and Corporation Y states that the acquisition is approved only if there are no parachute payments made to A. If the shareholder approval and the disclosure requirements described in this A-7 are met, the payments will not be parachute payments. Alternatively, if the shareholders do not approve the payments, the payments cannot be made (or retained). Thus, the transaction is not conditioned on the approval of the parachute payments. If the payments are made and the requirements of this A-7 are met, the payments are exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
pursuant to Q/A-6 of this section.

# Example 3.
Corporation M is wholly owned by Partnership P. No interest in either M or P is readily tradeable on an established securities market (or otherwise). The value of the stock of Corporation M equals or exceeds one third of the gross fair market value of the assets of Partnership P, and thus, represents a substantial portion of the assets of Partnership P. Corporation M undergoes a change in ownership or control. Partnership P has one general partner and 200 limited partners. The general partner is not a disqualified individual. None of the limited partners are entitled to vote on issues involving the management of the partnership investments. If the payments that would be parachute payments if the shareholder approval requirements of this A-7 are not met are approved by the general partner and the disclosure rules of paragraph (a)(2) of this A-7 are complied with, the shareholder approval requirements of this A-7 are met, and the payments are exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
pursuant to A-6 of this section.

# Example 4.
Corporation A has several shareholders including X and Y, who are disqualified individuals with respect to Corporation A and would receive parachute payments if the shareholder approval requirements of this A-7 are not met. No stock of Corporation A is readily tradeable on an established securities market (or otherwise). Corporation A undergoes a change in ownership or control. Contingent on the change in ownership or control, severance payments are payable to X and Y that are in excess of 3 times each individual's base amount. To determine whether the shareholder approval requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this A-7 are satisfied regarding the payments to X and Y, the stock of X and Y is not considered outstanding, and X and Y are not entitled to vote.

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 4,
except that after adequate disclosure of all material facts (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this A-7) to all shareholders entitled to vote, 60 percent of the shareholders who are entitled to vote approve the payments to X and Y. Because more than 75 percent of the shareholders holding outstanding stock who were entitled to vote did not approve the payments to X and Y, the payments cannot be made.

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 4
except that disclosure of all the material facts (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this A-7) regarding the payments to X and Y is made to two of Corporation A's shareholders, who collectively own 80 percent of Corporation A's stock entitled to vote and approve the payment. Both shareholders approve the payments. Assume further that no adequate disclosure of the material facts regarding the payments to X and Y is made to other Corporation A shareholders who are entitled to vote within the meaning of this A-7. Notwithstanding that 80 percent of the shareholders entitled to vote approve the payments, because disclosure regarding the payments to X and Y is not made to all of Corporation A's shareholders who were entitled to vote, the disclosure requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this A-7 are not met, and the payments are not exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
pursuant to Q/A-6.

# Example 7.
Corporation C has three shareholders—Partnership, which owns 20 percent of the stock of Corporation C; A, an individual who owns 60 percent of the stock of Corporation C; and B, an individual who owns 20 percent of Corporation C. Stock of Corporation C does not represent a substantial portion of the assets of Partnership. No interest in either Partnership or Corporation C is readily tradeable on an established securities market (or otherwise). P, a one-third partner in Partnership, is a disqualified individual with respect to Corporation C. Corporation C undergoes a change in ownership or control. Contingent on the change, a severance payment is payable to P in excess of 3 times P's base amount. To determine the persons who are entitled to vote referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this A-7, one-third of the stock held by Partnership is not considered outstanding stock. If P is the person authorized by Partnership to approve the payment, none of the shares of Partnership are considered outstanding stock. However, Partnership is permitted to appoint an equity interest holder in Partnership (who is not a disqualified individual who would receive a parachute payment if the requirements of this A-7 are not met), to vote the two-thirds of the shares held by Partnership that are otherwise entitled to be voted.

# Example 8.
X, Y, and Z are all employees and disqualified individuals with respect to Corporation E. No stock in Corporation E is readily tradeable on an established securities market (or otherwise). Each individual has a base amount of $100,000. Corporation E undergoes a change in ownership or control. Contingent on the change, a severance payment of $400,000 is payable to X; $600,000 is payable to Y; and $1,000,000 is payable to Z. Corporation E provides each Corporation E shareholder entitled to vote (as determined under this A-7) with a ballot listing and describing the payments of $400,000 to X; $600,000 to Y; and $1,000,000 to Z and the triggering event that generated the payments. Next to each name and corresponding amount on the ballot, Corporation E requests approval (with a “yes” and “no” box) of each total payment to be made to each individual and states that if the payment is not approved the payment will not be made. Adequate disclosure, within the meaning of this A-7 is made to each shareholder entitled to vote under this A-7. More than 75 percent of the Corporation E shareholders who are entitled to vote under paragraph (a)(1) of this A-7 approve each payment to each individual. The shareholder approval requirements of this A-7 are met, and the payments are exempt from the definition of
parachute
payment pursuant to A-6 of this section.

# Example 9.
Assume the same facts as in Example 8 except that the ballot does not request approval of each total payment to each individual separately. Instead, the ballot states that $2,000,000 in payments will be made to X, Y, and Z and requests approval of the $2,000,000 payments. Assuming the triggering event and amount of the payments to X, Y, and Z are separately described to the shareholders entitled to vote under this A-7, the shareholder approval requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this A-7 are met, and the payments are exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
pursuant to A-6 of this section.

# Example 10.
B, an employee of Corporation X, is a disqualified individual with respect to Corporation X. Stock of Corporation X is not readily tradeable on an established securities market (or otherwise). Corporation X undergoes a change in ownership or control. B's base amount is $205,000. Under B's employment agreement with Corporation X, in the event of a change in ownership or control, B's stock options will vest and B will receive severance and bonus payments. Contingent on the change in ownership or control, B's stock options with a fair market value of $500,000 immediately vest, $200,000 of which is contingent on the change, and B will receive a $200,000 bonus payment and a $400,000 severance payment. Corporation X distributes a ballot to every shareholder of Corporation X who immediately before the change is entitled to vote as described in this A-7. The ballot contains adequate disclosure of all material facts and lists the following payments to be made to B: The contingent payment of $200,000 attributable to options, a $200,000 bonus payment, and a $400,000 severance payment. The ballot requests shareholder approval of the $200,000 bonus payment to B and states that whether or not the $200,000 bonus payment is approved, B will receive $200,000 attributable to options and a $400,000 severance payment. More than 75 percent of the shareholders entitled to vote as described by this A-7 approve the $200,000
bonus payment to B. The shareholder approval requirements of this A-7 are met, and the $200,000 payment is exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
pursuant to A-6 of this section.
Q-8: Which payments under a qualified plan are exempt from the definition of
parachute payment?
A-8: The term
parachute payment
does not include any payment to or from—
(a) A plan described in section 401(a) which includes a trust exempt from tax under section 501(a);
(b) An annuity plan described in section 403(a);
(c) A simplified employee pension (as defined in section 408(k)); or
(d) A simple retirement account (as defined in section 408(p)).
Q-9: Which payments of reasonable compensation are exempt from the definition of
parachute payment?
A-9: Except in the case of securities violation
parachute payment
s, the term parachute payment does not include any payment (or portion thereof) which the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidence is reasonable compensation for personal services to be rendered by the disqualified individual on or after the date of the change in ownership or control. See Q/A-37 of this section for the definition and treatment of securities violation parachute payments. See Q/A-40 through Q/A-44 of this section for rules on determining amounts of reasonable compensation.

# Payor of Parachute Payments
Q-10: Who may be the payor of parachute payments?
A-10: Parachute payments within the meaning of Q/A-2 of this section may be paid, directly or indirectly, by—
(i) The corporation referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of Q/A-2 of this section;
(ii) A person acquiring ownership or effective control of that corporation or ownership of a substantial portion of that corporation's assets; or
(iii) Any person whose relationship to such corporation or other person is such as to require attribution of stock ownership between the parties under section 318(a).

# Payments in the Nature of Compensation
Q-11: What types of payments are in the nature of compensation?
A-11: (a)
General rule.
For purposes of this section, all payments—in whatever form—are payments in the nature of compensation if they arise out of an employment relationship or are associated with the performance of services. For this purpose, the performance of services includes holding oneself out as available to perform services and refraining from performing services (such as under a covenant not to compete or similar arrangement). Payments in the nature of compensation include (but are not limited to) wages and salary, bonuses, severance pay, fringe benefits, life insurance, pension benefits, and other deferred compensation (including any amount characterized by the parties as interest thereon). A payment in the nature of compensation also includes cash when paid, the value of the right to receive cash, (including the value of accelerated vesting under Q/A-24(c), or a transfer of property. However, payments in the nature of compensation do not include attorney's fees or court costs paid or incurred in connection with the payment of any amount described in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of Q/A-2 of this section or a reasonable rate of interest accrued on any amount during the period the parties contest whether a payment will be made.
(b)
When payment is considered to be made.
Except as otherwise provided in A-11 through Q/A-13 of this section, a payment in the nature of compensation is considered made (and is subject to the excise tax under section 4999) in the taxable year in which it is includible in the disqualified individual's gross income or, in the case of fringe benefits and other benefits excludible from income, in the taxable year the benefits are received.
(c)
Prepayment rule.
Notwithstanding the general rule described in paragraph (b) of this A-11, a disqualified individual may, in the year of the change in ownership or control, or any later year, prepay the excise tax under section 4999, provided that the payor and disqualified individual treat the payment of the excise tax consistently and the payor satisfies its obligations under section 4999(c) in the year of prepayment. The prepayment of the excise tax for purposes of section 4999 must be based on the present value of the excise tax that would be due in the year the excess parachute payment would actually be paid (calculated using the discount rate equal to 120 percent of the applicable Federal rate (determined under section 1274(d) and regulations thereunder;
see
Q/A-32)). For purposes of projecting the future value of a payment that provides for interest to be credited at a variable interest rate, it is permissible to make a reasonable assumption regarding this variable rate. A disqualified individual is not required to adjust the excise tax paid under this paragraph (c) merely because the interest rates in the future are not the same as the rate used for purposes of projecting the future value of the payment. However, a disqualified individual may not apply this paragraph (c) of this A-11 to a payment to be made in cash if the present value of the payment would be considered not reasonably ascertainable under section 3121(v) and § 31.3121(v)(2)-1(e)(4) of this Chapter or to a payment related to
health benefits or coverage. The Commissioner may provide additional guidance regarding the applicability of this paragraph (c) to certain payments in published guidance of general applicability under § 601.601(d)(2) of this Chapter.
(d)
Transfers of property.
Transfers of property are treated as payments for purposes of this A-11. See Q/A-12 of this section for rules on determining when such payments are considered made and the amount of such payments.
See
Q/A-13 of this section for special rules on transfers of stock options.
(e) The following example illustrates the principles of this A-11:

# Example.
D is a disqualified individual with respect to Corporation X. D has a base amount of $100,000 and is entitled to receive two parachute payments, one of $200,000 and the other of $400,000. A change in ownership or control of Corporation X occurs on May 1, 2005, and the $200,000 payment is made to D at the time of the change in ownership or control. The $400,000 payment is to be made on October 1, 2010. Corporation X and D agree that D will prepay the excise tax and X will satisfy its obligations under section 4999(c) with respect to the $400,000 payment. Using discount rate determined under Q/A-32, Corporation X and D determine that the present value of the $400,000 payment is $300,000 on the date of the change in ownership or control. The portions of the base amount allocated to these payments are $40,000 (($200,000/$500,000) × $100,000) and $60,000 (($300,000/$500,000 × $100,000), respectively. Thus, the amount of the first excess parachute payment is $160,000 ($200,000−$40,000) and that of the second excess parachute payment is $340,000 ($400,000−$60,000). The excise tax on the $400,000 payment is $68,000 ($340,000 × 20 percent). Assume the present value (calculated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this A-11) of $68,000 is $50,000. To prepay the excise tax due on the $400,000 payment, Corporation X must satisfy its obligations under section 4999 with respect to the $50,000, in addition to the $32,000 withholding required with respect to the $200,000 payment.
Q-12: If a property transfer to a disqualified individual is a payment in the nature of compensation, when is the payment considered made (or to be made), and how is the amount of the payment determined?
A-12: (a) Except as provided in this A-12 and Q/A-13 of this section, a transfer of property is considered a payment made (or to be made) in the taxable year in which the property transferred is includible in the gross income of the disqualified individual under section 83 and the regulations thereunder. Thus, in general, such a payment is considered made (or to be made) when the property is transferred (as defined in § 1.83-3(a)) to the disqualified individual and becomes substantially vested (as defined in § 1.83-3(b) and (j)) in such individual. The amount of the payment is determined under section 83 and the regulations thereunder. Thus, in general, the amount of the payment is equal to the excess of the fair market value of the transferred property (determined without regard to any lapse restriction, as defined in § 1.83-3(i)) at the time that the property becomes substantially vested, over the amount (if any) paid for the property.
(b) An election made by a disqualified individual under section 83(b) with respect to transferred property will not apply for purposes of this A-12. Thus, even if such an election is made with respect to a property transfer that is a payment in the nature of compensation, for purposes of this section, the payment is generally considered made (or to be made) when the property is transferred to and becomes substantially vested in such individual.
(c)
See
Q/A-13 of this section for rules on applying this A-12 to transfers of stock options.
(d) The following example illustrates the principles of this A-12:

# Example.
On January 1, 2006, Corporation M gives to A, a disqualified individual, a bonus of 100 shares of Corporation M stock in connection with the performance of services to Corporation M. Under the terms of the bonus arrangement A is obligated to return the Corporation M stock to Corporation M unless the earnings of Corporation M double by January 1, 2009, or there is a change in ownership or control of Corporation M before that date. A's rights in the stock are treated as substantially nonvested (within the meaning of § 1.83-3(b)) during that period because A's rights in the stock are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of § 1.83-3(c)) and are nontransferable (within the meaning of § 1.83-3(d)). On January 1, 2008, a change in ownership or control of Corporation M occurs. On that day, the fair market value of the Corporation M stock is $250 per share. Because A's rights in the Corporation M stock become substantially vested (within the meaning of § 1.83-3(b)) on that day, the payment is considered made on that day, and the amount of the payment for purposes of this section is equal to $25,000 (100 × $250).
See
Q/A-38 through 41 for rules relating to the reduction of the excess parachute payment by the portion of the payment which is established to be reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered before the date of a change in ownership or control.
Q-13: How are transfers of statutory and nonstatutory stock options treated?
A-13: (a) For purposes of this section, an option (including an option to which section 421 applies) is treated as property that is transferred when the option becomes vested
(regardless of whether the option has a readily ascertainable fair market value as defined in § 1.83-7(b)). For purposes of this A-13,
vested
means substantially vested within the meaning of § 1.83-3(b) and (j) or the right to the payment is not otherwise subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of section 83(c). Thus, for purposes of this section, the vesting of such an option is treated as a payment in the nature of compensation. The value of an option at the time the option vests is determined under all the facts and circumstances in the particular case. Factors relevant to such a determination include, but are not limited to: The difference between the option's exercise price and the value of the property subject to the option at the time of vesting; the probability of the value of such property increasing or decreasing; and the length of the period during which the option can be exercised. Thus, an option is treated as a payment in the nature of compensation on the date of grant or vesting, as applicable, without regard to whether such option has an ascertainable fair market value. For purposes of this A-13, valuation may be determined by any method prescribed by the Commissioner in published guidance of general applicability under § 601.601(d)(2) of this Chapter.
(b) Any money or other property transferred to the disqualified individual on the exercise, or as consideration on the sale or other disposition, of an option described in paragraph (a) of this A-13 after the time such option vests is not treated as a payment in the nature of compensation to the disqualified individual under Q/A-11 of this section. Nonetheless, the amount of the otherwise allowable deduction under section 162 or 212 with respect to such transfer is reduced by the amount of the payment described in paragraph (a) of this A-13 treated as an excess parachute payment.
Q-14: Are payments in the nature of compensation reduced by consideration paid by the disqualified individual?
A-14: Yes, to the extent not otherwise taken into account under Q/A-12 and Q/A-13 of this section, the amount of any payment in the nature of compensation is reduced by the amount of any money or the fair market value of any property (owned by the disqualified individual without restriction) that is (or will be) transferred by the disqualified individual in exchange for the payment. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the fair market value of property is determined as of the date the property is transferred by the disqualified individual.

# Disqualified Individuals
Q-15: Who is a disqualified individual?
A-15: (a) For purposes of this section, an individual is a disqualified individual with respect to a corporation if, at any time during the
disqualified individual determination period
(as defined in Q/A-20 of this section), the individual is an employee or independent contractor of the corporation and is, with respect to the corporation—
(1) A shareholder (but
see
Q/A-17 of this section);
(2) An officer (
see
Q/A-18 of this section); or
(3) A highly-compensated individual (
see
Q/A-19 of this section).
(b) For purposes of this A-15, a director is a disqualified individual with respect to a corporation if, at any time during the
disqualified individual determination period,
the director is, with respect to the corporation, a shareholder (
see
Q/A-17 of this section), an officer (
see
Q/A-18 of this section), or a highly-compensated individual (
see
Q/A-19 of this section).
(c) For purposes of this A-15, an individual who is an employee or independent contractor of a corporation other than the corporation undergoing a change in ownership or control is disregarded for purposes of determining who is a disqualified individual if such individual is employed by the corporation undergoing the change in ownership or control only on the last day of the disqualified individual determination period. Thus, for example, assume that E is an employee of Corporation X, that Y is acquired by Corporation X, and that Y undergoes a change in ownership or control. If E becomes an employee of Y on the date of the acquisition, in determining the disqualified individuals with respect to Y, E is disregarded under this paragraph (c).
Q-16: Is a personal service corporation treated as an individual?
A-16: (a) Yes. For purposes of this section, a personal service corporation (as defined in section 269A(b)(1)), or a noncorporate entity that would be a personal service corporation if it were a corporation, is treated as an individual.
(b) The following example illustrates the principles of this A-16:

# Example.
Corporation N, a personal service corporation (as defined in section 269A(b)(1)), has a single individual as its sole shareholder and employee. Corporation N performs personal services for Corporation M. The compensation paid to Corporation N by Corporation M puts Corporation N within the group of highly-compensated individuals of Corporation M as determined under A-19 of this section. Thus, Corporation N is treated as a highly-compensated individual with respect to Corporation M.
Q-17: Are all shareholders of a corporation considered shareholders for purposes of paragraphs (a)(1) and (b) of Q/A-15 of this section?
A-17: (a) No. Only an individual who owns stock of a corporation with a fair market value that exceeds 1 percent of the fair market value of the outstanding shares of all classes of the corporation's stock is treated
as a disqualified individual with respect to the corporation by reason of stock ownership. An individual who owns a lesser amount of stock may, however, be a disqualified individual with respect to the corporation if such individual is an officer (
see
Q/A-18) or highly-compensated individual (see Q/A-19) with respect to the corporation.
(b) For purposes of determining the amount of stock owned by an individual for purposes of paragraph (a) of this A-17, the constructive ownership rules of section 318(a) apply. Stock underlying a vested option is considered owned by an individual who holds the vested option (and the stock underlying an unvested option is not considered owned by an individual who holds the unvested option). For purposes of the preceding sentence, however, if the option is exercisable for stock that is not substantially vested (as defined by §§ 1.83-3(b) and (j)), the stock underlying the option is not treated as owned by the individual who holds the option. Solely for purposes of determining the amount of stock owned by an individual for purposes of this A-17, mutual and cooperative corporations are treated as having stock.
(c) The following examples illustrates the principles of this A-17:

# Example 1.
E, an employee of Corporation A, received options under Corporation A's Stock Option Plan. E's stock options vest three years after the date of grant. E is not an officer or highly compensated individual during the disqualified individual determination period. E does not own, and is not considered to own under section 318, any other Corporation A stock. Two years after the options are granted to E, all of Corporation A's stock is acquired by Corporation B. Under Corporation A's Stock Option Plan, E's options are converted to Corporation B options and the vesting schedule remains the same. Under paragraph (b) of this A-17, the stock underlying the unvested options held by E on the date of the change in ownership or control is not considered owned by E. Because E is not considered to own Corporation A stock with a fair market value exceeding 1 percent of the total fair market value of all of the outstanding shares of all classes of Corporation A and E is not an officer or highly-compensated individual during the disqualified individual determination period, E is not a disqualified individual within the meaning of Q
A-15 of this section with respect to Corporation A.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example
1, except that Corporation A's Stock Option Plan provides that all unvested options will vest immediately on a change in ownership or control. Under paragraph (b) of this A-17, the stock underlying the options that vest on the change in ownership or control is considered owned by E. If the stock considered owned by E exceeds 1 percent of the total fair market value of all of the outstanding shares of all classes of Corporation A stock (including for this purpose, all stock owned or constructively owned by all shareholders, provided that no share of stock is counted more than once), E is a disqualified individual within the meaning of Q/A-15 of this section with respect to Corporation A.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that E received nonstatutory stock options that are exercisable for stock subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture under section 83. Assume further that under Corporation A's Stock Option Plan, the nonstatutory options will vest on a change in ownership or control. Under paragraph (b) of this A-17, E is not considered to own the stock underlying the options that vest on the change in ownership or control because the options are exercisable for stock subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of section 83. Because E is not considered to own Corporation A stock with a fair market value exceeding 1 percent of the total fair market value of all of the outstanding shares of all classes of Corporation A stock and E is not an officer or highly compensated individual during the disqualified individual determination period, E is not a disqualified individual within the meaning of Q/A-15 of this section with respect to Corporation A.
Q-18: Who is an officer?
A-18: (a) For purposes of this section, whether an individual is an officer with respect to a corporation is determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances in the particular case (such as the source of the individual's authority, the term for which the individual is elected or appointed, and the nature and extent of the individual's duties). Any individual who has the title of officer is presumed to be an officer unless the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the individual does not have the authority of an officer. However, an individual who does not have the title of officer may nevertheless be considered an officer if the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the individual has the authority of an officer. Generally, the term officer means an administrative executive who is in regular and continued service. The term officer implies continuity of service and excludes those employed for a special and single transaction.
(b) An individual who is an officer with respect to any member of an affiliated group that is treated as one corporation pursuant to Q/A-46 of this section is treated as an officer of such one corporation.
(c) No more than 50 employees (or, if less, the greater of 3 employees, or 10 percent of the employees (rounded up to the nearest integer)) of the corporation (in the case of an affiliated group treated as one corporation, each member of the affiliated group) are
treated as disqualified individuals with respect to a corporation by reason of being an officer of the corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of employees of the corporation is the greatest number of employees the corporation has during the disqualified individual determination period (as defined in Q/A-20 of this section). If the number of officers of the corporation exceeds the number of employees who may be treated as officers under the first sentence of this paragraph (c), then the employees who are treated as officers for purposes of this section are the highest paid 50 employees (or, if less, the greater of 3 employees, or 10 percent of the employees (rounded up to the nearest integer)) of the corporation when ranked on the basis of compensation (as determined under Q/A-21 of this section) paid during the disqualified individual determination period.
(d) In determining the total number of employees of a corporation for purposes of this A-18, employees are not counted if they normally work less than 17
1/2
hours per week (as defined in section 414(q)(5)(B) and the regulations thereunder) or if they normally work during not more than 6 months during any year (as defined in section 414(q)(5)(C) and the regulations thereunder). However, an employee who is not counted for purposes of the preceding sentence may still be an officer.
Q-19: Who is a highly-compensated individual?
A-19: (a) For purposes of this section, a highly-compensated individual with respect to a corporation is any individual who is, or would be if the individual were an employee, a member of the group consisting of the lesser of the highest paid 1 percent of the employees of the corporation (rounded up to the nearest integer), or the highest paid 250 employees of the corporation, when ranked on the basis of compensation (as determined under Q/A-21 of this section) earned during the disqualified individual determination period (as defined in Q/A-20 of this section). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the number of employees of the corporation is the greatest number of employees the corporation has during the disqualified individual determination period (as defined in Q/A-20 of this section). However, no individual whose annualized compensation during the disqualified individual determination period is less than the amount described in section 414(q)(1)(B)(i) for the year in which the change in ownership or control occurs will be treated as a highly-compensated individual.
(b) An individual who is not an employee of the corporation is not treated as a highly-compensated individual with respect to the corporation on account of compensation received for performing services (such as brokerage, legal, or investment banking services) in connection with a change in ownership or control of the corporation, if the services are performed in the ordinary course of the individual's trade or business and the individual performs similar services for a significant number of clients unrelated to the corporation.
(c) The total number of employees of a corporation for purposes of this A-19 is determined in accordance with Q/A-18(d) of this section. However, an employee who is not counted for purposes of the preceding sentence may still be a highly-compensated individual.
Q-20: What is the disqualified individual determination period?
A-20: The disqualified individual determination period is the twelve-month period prior to and ending on the date of the change in ownership or control of the corporation.
Q-21: How is
compensation
defined for purposes of determining who is a disqualified individual?
A-21: (a) For purposes of determining who is a disqualified individual, the term
compensation
means the compensation which was earned by the individual for services performed for the corporation with respect to which the change in ownership or control occurs (changed corporation), for a predecessor entity, or for a related entity. Such compensation is determined without regard to sections 125, 132(f)(4), 402(e)(3), and 402(h)(1)(B). Thus, for example, compensation includes elective or salary reduction contributions to a cafeteria plan, cash or deferred arrangement or tax-sheltered annuity, and amounts credited under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
(b) For purposes of this A-21, a predecessor entity is any entity which, as a result of a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of property or stock, corporate separation, or other similar business transaction transfers some or all of its employees to the changed corporation or to a related entity or to a predecessor entity of the changed corporation. The term
related entity
includes—
(1) All members of a controlled group of corporations (as defined in section 414(b)) that includes the changed corporation or a predecessor entity;
(2) All trades or businesses (whether or not incorporated) that are under common control (as defined in section 414(c)) if such group includes the changed corporation or a predecessor entity;
(3) All members of an affiliated service group (as defined in section 414(m)) that includes the changed corporation or a predecessor entity; and
(4) Any other entities required to be aggregated with the changed corporation or a predecessor entity pursuant to section 414(o) and the regulations thereunder (except leasing organizations as defined in section 414(n)).
(c) For purposes of Q/A-18 and Q/A-19 of this section, compensation that was contingent on the change in ownership or control and that was payable in the year of the change is not treated as compensation.

# Contingent on Change in Ownership or Control
Q-22: When is a payment contingent on a change in ownership or control?
A-22: (a) In general, a payment is treated as contingent on a change in ownership or control if the payment would not, in fact, have been made had no change in ownership or control occurred, even if the payment is also conditioned on the occurrence of another event. A payment generally is treated as one which would not, in fact, have been made in the absence of a change in ownership or control unless it is substantially certain, at the time of the change, that the payment would have been made whether or not the change occurred. (But
see
Q/A-23 of this section regarding payments under agreements entered into after a change in ownership or control.) A payment that becomes vested as a result of a change in ownership or control is not treated as a payment which was substantially certain to have been made whether or not the change occurred. For purposes of this A-22,
vested
means the payment is substantially vested within the meaning of § 1.83-3(b) and (j) or the right to the payment is not otherwise subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture as defined by section 83(c).
(b)(1) For purposes of paragraph (a), a payment is treated as contingent on a change in ownership or control if—
(i) The payment is contingent on an event that is closely associated with a change in ownership or control;
(ii) A change in ownership or control actually occurs; and
(iii) The event is materially related to the change in ownership or control.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this A-22, a payment is treated as contingent on an event that is closely associated with a change in ownership or control unless it is substantially certain, at the time of the event, that the payment would have been made whether or not the event occurred. An event is considered closely associated with a change in ownership or control if the event is of a type often preliminary or subsequent to, or otherwise closely associated with, a change in ownership or control. For example, the following events are considered closely associated with a change in the ownership or control of a corporation: The onset of a tender offer with respect to the corporation; a substantial increase in the market price of the corporation's stock that occurs within a short period (but only if such increase occurs prior to a change in ownership or control); the cessation of the listing of the corporation's stock on an established securities market; the acquisition of more than 5 percent of the corporation's stock by a person (or more than one person acting as a group) not in control of the corporation; the voluntary or involuntary termination of the disqualified individual's employment; a significant reduction in the disqualified individual's job responsibilities; and a change in ownership or control as defined in the disqualified individual's employment agreement (or elsewhere) that does not meet the definition of a change in ownership or control described in Q/A-27, 28, or 29 of this section. Whether other events are treated as closely associated with a change in ownership or control is based on all the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
(3) For purposes of determining whether an event (as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this A-22) is materially related to a change in ownership or control, the event is presumed to be materially related to a change in ownership or control if such event occurs within the period beginning one year before and ending one year after the date of the change in ownership or control. If such event occurs outside of the period beginning one year before and ending one year after the date of change in ownership or control, the event is presumed not materially related to the change in ownership or control. A payment does not fail to be contingent on a change in ownership or control merely because it is also contingent on the occurrence of a second event (without regard to whether the second event is closely associated with or materially related to a change in ownership or control). Similarly, a payment that is treated as contingent on a change in ownership or control because it is contingent on a closely associated event does not fail to be treated as contingent on a change in ownership or control merely because it is also contingent on the occurrence of a second event (without regard to whether the second event is closely associated with or materially related to a change in ownership or control).
(c) A payment that would in fact have been made had no change in ownership or control occurred is treated as contingent on a change in ownership or control if the change in ownership or control (or the occurrence of an event that is closely associated with and materially related to a change in ownership or control within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this A-22), accelerates the time at which the payment is made. Thus, for example, if a change in ownership or control accelerates the time of payment of deferred compensation that is vested without regard to the change in ownership or control, the payment may be treated as contingent on the change.
See
Q/A-24 of this section regarding the portion of a payment that is so treated.
See also
Q/A-8 of this section regarding the exemption for certain payments under
qualified plans and Q/A-40 of this section regarding the treatment of a payment as reasonable compensation.
(d) A payment is treated as contingent on a change in ownership or control even if the employment or independent contractor relationship of the disqualified individual is not terminated (voluntarily or involuntarily) as a result of the change.
(e) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-22:

# Example 1.
A corporation grants a stock appreciation right to a disqualified individual, A, more than one year before a change in ownership or control. After the stock appreciation right vests and becomes exercisable, a change in ownership or control of the corporation occurs, and A exercises the right. Assuming neither the granting nor the vesting of the stock appreciation right is contingent on a change in ownership or control, the payment made on exercise is not contingent on the change in ownership or control.

# Example 2.
A contract between a corporation and B, a disqualified individual, provides that a payment will be made to B if the corporation undergoes a change in ownership or control and B's employment with the corporation is terminated at any time over the succeeding 5 years. Eighteen months later, a change in the ownership of the corporation occurs. Two years after the change in ownership, B's employment is terminated and the payment is made to B. Because it was not substantially certain that the corporation would have made the payment to B on B's termination of employment if there had not been a change in ownership, the payment is treated as contingent on the change in ownership under paragraph (a) of this A-22. This is true even though B's termination of employment is presumed not to be, and in fact may not be, materially related to the change in ownership or control.

# Example 3.
A contract between a corporation and C, a disqualified individual, provides that a payment will be made to C if C's employment is terminated at any time over the succeeding 3 years (without regard to whether or not there is a change in ownership or control). Eighteen months after the contract is entered into, a change in the ownership or control of the corporation occurs. Six months after the change in ownership or control, C's employment is terminated and the payment is made to C. Termination of employment is considered an event closely associated with a change in ownership or control. Because the termination occurred within one year after the date of the change in ownership or control, the termination of C's employment is presumed to be materially related to the change in ownership or control under paragraph (b)(3) of this A-22. If this presumption is not successfully rebutted, the payment will be treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control under paragraph (b) of this A-22.

# Example 4.
A contract between a corporation and a disqualified individual, D, provides that a payment will be made to D upon the onset of a tender offer for shares of the corporation's stock. A tender offer is made on December 1, 2008, and the payment is made to D. Although the tender offer is unsuccessful, it leads to a negotiated merger with another entity on June 1, 2009, which results in a change in the ownership or control of the corporation. It was not substantially certain, at the time of the onset of the tender offer, that the payment would have been made had no tender offer taken place. The onset of a tender offer is considered closely associated with a change in ownership or control. Because the tender offer occurred within one year before the date of the change in ownership or control of the corporation, the onset of the tender offer is presumed to be materially related to the change in ownership or control. If this presumption is not rebutted, the payment will be treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control. If no change in ownership or control had occurred, the payment would not be treated as contingent on a change in ownership or control; however, the payment still could be a parachute payment under Q/A-37 of this section if the contract violated a generally enforced securities law or regulation.

# Example 5.
A contract between a corporation and a disqualified individual, E, provides that a payment will be made to E if the corporation's level of product sales or profits reaches a specified level. At the time the contract was entered into, the parties had no reason to believe that such an increase in the corporation's level of product sales or profits would be preliminary or subsequent to, or otherwise closely associated with, a change in ownership or control of the corporation. Eighteen months later, a change in the ownership or control of the corporation occurs and within one year after the date of the change of ownership or control, the corporation's level of product sales or profits reaches the specified level. Under these facts and circumstances (and in the absence of contradictory evidence), the increase in product sales or profits of the corporation is not an event closely associated with the change in ownership or control of the corporation. Accordingly, even if the increase is materially related to the change in ownership or control, the payment will not be treated as contingent on a change in ownership or control.
Q-23: May a payment be treated as contingent on a change in ownership or control if the payment is made under an agreement entered into after the change?
A-23: (a) No. Payments are not treated as contingent on a change in ownership or control if they are made (or are to be made) pursuant to an agreement entered into after the change (a post-change agreement). For this purpose, an agreement that is executed after a change in ownership or control pursuant to a legally enforceable agreement that was entered into before the change is considered to have been entered into before the change. (
See
Q/A-9 of this section regarding the exemption for reasonable compensation for services rendered on or after a change in ownership or control.) If an individual has a right to receive a payment that would be a parachute payment if made under an agreement entered into prior to a change in ownership or control (pre-change agreement) and gives up that right as bargained-for consideration for benefits under a post-change agreement, the agreement is treated as a post-change agreement only to the extent the value of the payments under the agreement exceed the value of the payments under the pre-change agreement. To the extent payments under the agreement have the same value as the payments under the pre-change agreement, such payments retain their character as parachute payments subject to this section.
(b) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-23:

# Example 1.
Assume that a disqualified individual is an employee of a corporation. A change in ownership or control of the corporation occurs, and thereafter the individual enters into an employment agreement with the acquiring company. Because the agreement is entered into after the change in ownership or control occurs, payments to be made under the agreement are not treated as contingent on the change.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the agreement between the disqualified individual and the acquiring company is executed after the change in ownership or control, pursuant to a legally enforceable agreement entered into before the change. Payments to be made under the agreement may be treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control pursuant to Q/A-22 of this section. However, see Q/A-9 of this section regarding the exemption from the definition of parachute payment for certain amounts of reasonable compensation.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that prior to the change in ownership or control, the individual and corporation enter into an agreement under which the individual will receive parachute payments in the event of a change in ownership or control of the corporation. After the change, the individual agrees to give up the right to payments under the pre-change agreement that would be parachute payments if made, in exchange for compensation under a new agreement with the acquiring corporation. Because the individual gave up the right to parachute payments under the pre-change agreement in exchange for other payments under the post-change agreement, payments in an amount equal to the parachute payments under the pre-change agreement are treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control under this A-23. Because the post-change agreement was entered into after the change, payments in excess of this amount are not treated as parachute payments.
Q-24: If a payment is treated as contingent on a change in ownership or control, is the full amount of the payment so treated?
A-24: (a)(1)
General rule.
Yes. If the payment is a transfer of property, the amount of the payment is determined under Q/A-12 or Q/A-13 of this section. For all other payments, the amount of the payment is determined under Q/A-11 of this section. However, in certain circumstances, described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this A-24, only a portion of the payment is treated as contingent on the change. Paragraph (b) of this A-24 applies to a payment that is vested, without regard to the change in ownership or control, and is treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control because the change accelerates the time at which the payment is made. Paragraph (c) of this A-24 applies to a payment that becomes vested as a result of the change in ownership or control if, without regard to the change in ownership or control, the payment was contingent only on the continued performance of services for the corporation for a specified period of time and if the payment is attributable, at least in part, to services performed before the date the payment becomes vested. Paragraph (b) or (c) does not apply to any payment (or portion thereof) if the payment is treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control pursuant to Q/A-25 of this section. For purposes of this A-24, vested has the same meaning as provided in Q/A-22(a).
(2)
Reduction by reasonable compensation.
The amount of a payment under paragraph (a)(1) of this A-24 is reduced by any portion of such payment that the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidence is reasonable compensation for personal services rendered by the disqualified individual on or after the date of the change of control.
See
Q/A-9 and Q/A-38 through 44 of this section for rules concerning reasonable compensation. The portion of an amount treated as contingent under paragraph (b) or (c) of this A-24 may not be reduced by reasonable compensation.
(b)
Vested payments.
This paragraph (b) applies if a payment is vested, without regard to the change in ownership or control, and is
treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control because the change accelerates the time at which the payment is made. In such a case, the portion of the payment, if any, that is treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control is the amount by which the amount of the accelerated payment exceeds the present value of the payment absent the acceleration. If the value of such a payment absent the acceleration is not reasonably ascertainable, and the acceleration of the payment does not significantly increase the present value of the payment absent the acceleration, the present value of the payment absent the acceleration is treated as equal to the amount of the accelerated payment. If the value of the payment absent the acceleration is not reasonably ascertainable, but the acceleration significantly increases the present value of the payment, the future value of such payment is treated as equal to the amount of the accelerated payment. For rules on determining present value,
see
paragraph (e) of this A-24, Q/A-32, and Q/A-33 of this section.
(c)(1)
Nonvested payments.
This paragraph (c) applies to a payment that becomes vested as a result of the change in ownership or control to the extent that—
(i) Without regard to the change in ownership or control, the payment was contingent only on the continued performance of services for the corporation for a specified period of time; and
(ii) The payment is attributable, at least in part, to the performance of services before the date the payment is made or becomes certain to be made.
(2) The portion of the payment subject to paragraph (c) of this A-24 that is treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control is the amount described in paragraph (b) of this A-24, plus an amount, as determined in paragraph (c)(4) of this A-24, to reflect the lapse of the obligation to continue to perform services. In no event can the portion of the payment treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control under this paragraph (c) exceed the amount of the accelerated payment, or, if the payment is not accelerated, the present value of the payment.
(3) For purposes of this paragraph (c) of this A-24, the acceleration of the vesting of a stock option or the lapse of a restriction on restricted stock is considered to significantly increase the value of a payment.
(4) The amount reflecting the lapse of the obligation to continue to perform services (described in paragraph (c)(2) of this A-24) is 1 percent of the amount of the accelerated payment multiplied by the number of full months between the date that the individual's right to receive the payment is vested and the date that, absent the acceleration, the payment would have been vested. This paragraph (c)(4) applies to the accelerated vesting of a payment in the nature of compensation even if the time at which the payment is made is not accelerated. In such a case, the amount reflecting the lapse of the obligation to continue to perform services is 1 percent of the present value of the future payment multiplied by the number of full months between the date that the individual's right to receive the payment is vested and the date that, absent the acceleration, the payment would have been vested.
(d)
Application of this A-24 to certain payments
—(1)
Benefits under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
In the case of a payment of benefits under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, paragraph (b) of this A-24 applies to the extent benefits under the plan are vested without regard to the change in ownership or control. Paragraph (c) of this A-24 applies to the extent benefits under the plan become vested as a result of the change in ownership or control and are attributable, at least in part, to the performance of services prior to vesting. Any other payment of benefits under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan is a payment in the nature of compensation subject to the general rule of paragraph (a) of this A-24 and the rules in Q/A-11 of this section.
(2)
Employment agreements.
The general rule of paragraph (a) of this A-24 (and not the rules in paragraphs (b) or (c)) applies to the payment of amounts due under an employment agreement on a termination of employment or a change in ownership or control that otherwise would be attributable to the performance of services (or refraining from the performance of services) during any period that begins after the date of termination of employment or change in ownership or control, as applicable. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2) of this A-24, an employment agreement means an agreement between an employee or independent contractor and employer or service recipient which describes, among other things, the amount of compensation or remuneration payable to the employee or independent contractor.
See
Q/A-42(b) and 44 of this section for the treatment of the remaining amounts of salary under an employment agreement.
(3)
Vesting due to an event other than services.
Neither paragraph (b) nor (c) of this A-24 applies to a payment if (without regard to the change in ownership or control) vesting of the payment depends on an event other than the performance of services, such as the attainment of a performance goal, and the event does not occur prior to the change in ownership or control. In such circumstances, the full amount of the accelerated payment is treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control under paragraph (a) of this A-24. However,
see
Q/A-39 of this section for rules relating to the reduction of the excess parachute payment by the portion of
the payment which is established to be reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered before the date of a change in ownership or control.
(e)
Present value.
For purposes of this A-24, the present value of a payment is determined as of the date on which the accelerated payment is made.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-24:

# Example 1.
(i) Corporation maintains a qualified plan and a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan (SERP) for its executives. Benefits under the SERP are not paid to participants until retirement. E, a disqualified individual with respect to Corporation, has a vested account balance of $500,000 under the SERP. A change in ownership or control of Corporation occurs. The SERP provides that in the event of a change in ownership or control, all vested accounts will be paid to SERP participants.
(ii) Because E was vested in $500,000 of benefits under the SERP prior to the change in ownership or control and the change merely accelerated the time at which the payment was made to E, only a portion of the payment, as determined under paragraph (b) of this A-24, is treated as contingent on the change. Thus, the portion of the payment that is treated as contingent on the change is the amount by which the amount of the accelerated payment ($500,000) exceeds the present value of the payment absent the acceleration.
(iii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 1,
except that E's account balance of $500,000 is not vested. Instead, assume that E will vest in E's account balance of $500,000 in 2 years if E continues to perform services for the next 2 years. Assume further that the SERP provides that all unvested SERP benefits vest immediately on a change in ownership or control and are paid to the participants. Because the vesting of the SERP payment, without regard to the change, depends only on the performance of services for a specified period of time and the payment is attributable, in part, to the performance of services before the change in ownership or control, only a portion of the $500,000 payment, as determined under paragraph (c) of this A-24, is treated as contingent on the change. The portion of the payment that is treated as contingent on the change is the lesser of the amount of the accelerated payment or the amount by which the accelerated payment exceeds the present value of the payment absent the acceleration, plus an amount to reflect the lapse of the obligation to continue to perform services.
(iv) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 1,
except that in addition to the pay out of the vested account balance of $500,000 on the change in ownership or control, an additional $70,000 will be credited to E's account and included in the payment to E. Because the $500,000 was vested without regard to the change in ownership or control, paragraph (b) of this A-24 applies to the $500,000 payment. Because the $70,000 is not vested, without regard to the change, and is not attributable to the performance of services prior to the change, the entire $70,000 payment is contingent on the change in ownership or control under paragraph (a) of this A-24.
(v) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 1,
except that the benefit under the SERP is calculated using a percentage of final average compensation multiplied by years of service. If, contingent on the change in ownership or control, E is credited with additional years of service, an adjustment to final average compensation, or an increase in the applicable percentage, any increase in the benefit payable under the SERP is not attributable to the performance of services prior to the change, and the entire increase in the benefit is contingent on the change in ownership or control under paragraph (a) of this A-24.

# Example 2.
As a result of a change in the effective control of a corporation D, a disqualified individual with respect to the corporation, receives accelerated payment of D's vested account balance in a nonqualified deferred compensation account plan. Actual interest and other earnings on the plan assets are credited to each account as earned before distribution. Investment of the plan assets is not restricted in such a manner as would prevent the earning of a market rate of return on the plan assets. The date on which D would have received D's vested account balance absent the change in ownership or control is uncertain, and the rate of earnings on the plan assets is not fixed. Thus, the amount of the payment absent the acceleration is not reasonably ascertainable. Under these facts, acceleration of the payment does not significantly increase the present value of the payment absent the acceleration, and the present value of the payment absent the acceleration is treated as equal to the amount of the accelerated payment. Accordingly, no portion of the payment is treated as contingent on the change.

# Example 3.
(i) On January 15, 2006, a corporation and a disqualified individual, F, enter into a contract providing for a retention bonus of $500,000 to be paid to F on January 15, 2011. The payment of the bonus will be forfeited by F if F does not remain employed by the corporation for the entire 5-year period. However, the contract provides that the full amount of the payment will be made immediately on a change in ownership or control of the corporation during the 5-year period. On January 15, 2009, a change in ownership or control of the corporation occurs and the full amount of the payment
($500,000) is made on that date to F. Under these facts, the payment of $500,000 was contingent only on F's performance of services for a specified period and is attributable, in part, to the performance of services before the change in ownership or control. Therefore, only a portion of the payment, as determined under paragraph (c) of this A-24 is treated as contingent on the change. The portion of the payment that is treated as contingent on the change is the amount by which the amount of the accelerated payment (
i.e.,
$500,000, the amount paid to the individual because of the change in ownership) exceeds the present value of the payment that was expected to have been made absent the acceleration (
i.e.,
$406,838, the present value on January 15, 2009, of a $500,000 payment on January 15, 2011), plus $115,000 (1 percent × 23 months × $500,000) which is the amount reflecting the lapse of the obligation to continue to perform services. Accordingly, the amount of the payment treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control is $208,162, the sum of $93,162 ($500,000−$406,838) + $115,000). This result does not change if F actually remains employed until the end of the 5-year period.
(ii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 3,
except that the retention bonus will vest on the change in ownership or control, but will not be paid until January 15, 2011 (the original date in the contract). Because the payment of $500,000 was contingent only on F's performance of services for a specified period and is attributable, in part, to the performance of services before the change in ownership or control, only a portion of the $500,000 payment is treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control as determined under paragraph (c) of this A-24. Because there is accelerated vesting of the bonus, the portion of the payment treated as contingent on the change is the amount described in paragraph (b) of this A-27, which is $0 under these facts, plus an amount reflecting the lapse of the obligation to continue to perform services which is $93,573 (1 percent × 23 months × $406,838 (the present value of a $500,000 payment).

# Example 4.
(i) On January 15, 2006, a corporation gives to a disqualified individual, in connection with her performance of services to the corporation, a bonus of 1,000 shares of the corporation's stock. Under the terms of the bonus arrangement, the individual is obligated to return the stock to the corporation if she terminates her employment for any reason prior to January 15, 2011. However, if there is a change in the ownership or effective control of the corporation prior to January 15, 2011, she ceases to be obligated to return the stock. The individual's rights in the stock are treated as substantially nonvested (within the meaning of § 1.83-3(b) and (j)) during that period. On January 15, 2009, a change in the ownership of the corporation occurs. On that day, the fair market value of the stock is $500,000.
(ii) Under these facts, the payment was contingent only on performance of services for a specified period and is attributable, in part, to the performance of services before the change in ownership or control. Thus, only a portion of the payment, as determined under paragraph (c) of this A-24, is treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control. The portion of the payment that is treated as contingent on the change is the amount by which the present value of the accelerated payment on January 15, 2009 ($500,000), exceeds the present value of the payment that was expected to have been made on January 15, 2011, plus an amount reflecting the lapse of the obligation to continue to perform services. At the time of the change, it cannot be reasonably ascertained what the value of the stock would have been on January 15, 2011. The acceleration of the lapse of a restriction on stock is treated as significantly increasing the value of the payment. Therefore, the value of such stock on January 15, 2011, is deemed to be $500,000, the amount of the accelerated payment. The present value on January 15, 2009, of a $500,000 payment to be made on January 15, 2011, is $406,838. Thus, the portion of the payment treated as contingent on the change is $208,162, the sum of $93,162 ($500,000−$406,838), plus $115,000 (1 percent × 23 months × $500,000), the amount reflecting the lapse of the obligation to continue to perform services.

# Example 5.
(i) On January 15, 2006, a corporation grants to a disqualified individual nonqualified stock options to purchase 30,000 shares of the corporation's stock. The options will be forfeited by the individual if he fails to perform personal services for the corporation until January 15, 2009. The options will, however, vest in the individual at an earlier date if there is a change in ownership or control of the corporation. On January 16, 2008, a change in the ownership or control of the corporation occurs and the options become vested in the individual. The value of the options on January 16, 2008, determined in accordance with Q/A-13, is $600,000.
(ii) The payment of the options to purchase 30,000 shares was contingent only on performance of services for the corporation until January 15, 2009, and is attributable, in part, to the performance of services before the change in ownership or control. Therefore, only a portion of the payment is treated as contingent on the change. The portion of the payment that is treated as contingent on the change is the amount by which the accelerated payment on January 16, 2008 ($600,000) exceeds the present value on January 16, 2008, of the payment that was expected to have been made on January 15, 2009, absent the acceleration, plus an amount
reflecting the lapse of the obligation to continue to perform services. At the time of the change, it cannot be reasonably ascertained what the value of the options would have been on January 15, 2009. The acceleration of vesting in the options is treated as significantly increasing the value of the payment. Therefore, the value of such options on January 15, 2009, is deemed to be $600,000, the amount of the accelerated payment. The present value on January 16, 2008, of a $600,000 payment to be made on January 15, 2009, is $549,964. Thus, the portion of the payment treated as contingent on the change is $116,036, the sum of $50,036 ($600,000−$549,964), plus an amount reflecting the lapse of the obligation to continue to perform services which is $66,000 (1 percent × 11 months × $600,000).

# Example 6.
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example 5,
except that the options become vested periodically (absent a change in ownership or control), with one-third of the options vesting on January 15, 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. Thus, options to purchase 20,000 shares vest independently of the January 16, 2008, change in ownership or control and the options to purchase the remaining 10,000 shares vest as a result of the change in ownership or control.
(ii) The payment of the options to purchase 10,000 shares was contingent only on performance of services for the corporation until January 15, 2009, and is attributable, in part, to the performance of services before the change in ownership or control. Therefore, only a portion of the payment as determined under paragraph (c) of this A-24 is treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control. The portion of the payment that is treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control is the amount by which the accelerated payment on January 16, 2008 ($200,000) exceeds the present value on January 16, 2008, of the payment that was expected to have been made on January 15, 2009, absent the acceleration, plus an amount reflecting the lapse of the obligation to perform services. At the time of the change in ownership or control, it cannot be reasonably ascertained what the value of the options would have been on January 15, 2009. The acceleration of vesting in the options is treated as significantly increasing the value of the payment. Therefore, the value of such options on January 15, 2009, is deemed to be $200,000, the amount of the accelerated payment. The present value on January 16, 2008, of a $200,000 payment to be made on January 15, 2009, is $183,328.38. Thus, the portion of the payment treated as contingent on the change is $38,671.62, the sum of $16,671.62 ($200,000−$183,328.38), plus an amount reflecting the lapse of the obligation to continue to perform services which is $22,000 (1 percent × 11 months × $200,000).

# Example 7.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 5,
except that the option agreement provides that the options will vest either on the corporation's level of profits reaching a specified level, or if earlier, on the date on which there is a change in ownership or control of the corporation. The corporation's level of profits do not reach the specified level prior to January 16, 2008. In such case, the full amount of the payment, $600,000, is treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control under paragraph (a) of this A-24. Because the payment was not contingent only on the performance of services for the corporation for a specified period, the rules of paragraph (b) and (c) of this A-24 do not apply. See Q/A-39 of this section for rules relating to the reduction of the excess parachute payment by the portion of the payment which is established to be reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered before the date of a change in ownership or control.

# Example 8.
On January 1, 2005, E, a disqualified individual with respect to Corporation X, enters into an employment agreement with Corporation X under which E will be paid wages of $200,000 each year during the 5-year employment agreement. The employment agreement provides that if a change in ownership or control of Corporation X occurs, E will be paid the present value of the remaining salary under the employment agreement. On January 1, 2006, a change in ownership or control of Corporation X occurs, E is terminated, and E receives a payment of the present value of $200,000 for each of the 4 years remaining under the employment agreement. Because the payment represents future salary under an employment agreement (
i.e.,
amounts otherwise attributable to the performance of services for periods that begin after the termination of employment), the general rule of paragraph (a) of this A-24 applies to the payment and not the rules of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this A-24. See Q/A-42(c) and 44 of this section for the treatment of the remaining payments under an employment agreement.

# Presumption That Payment Is Contingent on Change
Q-25: Is there a presumption that certain payments are contingent on a change in ownership or control?
A-25: Yes, for purposes of this section, any payment is presumed to be contingent on such a change unless the contrary is established by clear and convincing evidence if the payment is made pursuant to—
(a) An agreement entered into within one year before the date of a change in ownership or control; or
(b) An amendment that modifies a previous agreement in any significant respect, if the amendment is made within one year before the date of a change in ownership or control.
In the case of an amendment described in paragraph (b) of this A-25, only the portion of any payment that exceeds the amount of such payment that would have been made in the absence of the amendment is presumed, by reason of the amendment, to be contingent on the change in ownership or control.
Q-26: How may the presumption described in Q/A-25 of this section be rebutted?
A-26: (a) To rebut the presumption described in Q/A-25 of this section, the taxpayer must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the payment is not contingent on the change in ownership or control. Whether the payment is contingent on such change is determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Factors relevant to such a determination include, but are not limited to, the content of the agreement or amendment and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the agreement or amendment, such as whether it was entered into at a time when a takeover attempt had commenced and the degree of likelihood that a change in ownership or control would actually occur. However, even if the presumption is rebutted with respect to an agreement, some or all of the payments under the agreement may still be contingent on the change in ownership or control pursuant to Q/A-22 of this section.
(b) In the case of an agreement described in Q/A-25 of this section, clear and convincing evidence that the agreement is one of the three following types will generally rebut the presumption that payments under the agreement are contingent on the change in ownership or control—
(1) A
nondiscriminatory employee plan or program as defined
in paragraph (c) of this A-26;
(2) A contract between a corporation and an individual that replaces a prior contract entered into by the same parties more than one year before the change in ownership or control, if the new contract does not provide for increased payments (apart from normal increases attributable to increased responsibilities or cost of living adjustments), accelerate the payment of amounts due at a future time, or modify (to the individual's benefit) the terms or conditions under which payments will be made; or
(3) A contract between a corporation and an individual who did not perform services for the corporation prior to the one year period before the change in ownership or control occurs, if the contract does not provide for payments that are significantly different in amount, timing, terms, or conditions from those provided under contracts entered into by the corporation (other than contracts that themselves were entered into within one year before the change in ownership or control and in contemplation of the change) with individuals performing comparable services.
(c) For purposes of this section, the term
nondiscriminatory employee plan or program
means: a group term life insurance plan that meets the requirements of section 79(d); a self insured medical reimbursement plan that meets the requirements of section 105(h); a cafeteria plan (within the meaning of section 125); an educational assistance program (within the meaning of section 127); a dependent care assistance program (within the meaning of section 129); a no-additional-cost service (within the meaning of section 132(b)) or qualified employee discount (within the meaning of section 132(c)); a qualified retirement planning services program under section 132(m); an adoption assistance program (within the meaning of section 137); and such other items as provided by the Commissioner in published guidance of general applicability under § 601.601(d)(2). Payments under certain other plans are exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
under Q/A-8 of this section.
(d) The following examples illustrate the application of the presumption:

# Example 1.
A corporation and a disqualified individual who is an employee of the corporation enter into an employment contract. The contract replaces a prior contract entered into by the same parties more than one year before the change in ownership or control and the new contract does not provide for any increased payments other than a cost of living adjustment, does not accelerate the payment of amounts due at a future time, and does not modify (to the individual's benefit) the terms or conditions under which payments will be made. Clear and convincing evidence of these facts rebuts the presumption described in A-25 of this section. However, payments under the contract still may be contingent on the change in ownership or control pursuant to Q/A-22 of this section.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the contract is entered into after a tender offer for the corporation's stock had commenced and it was likely that a change in ownership or control would occur and the contract provides for a substantial bonus payment to the individual upon his signing the contract. The individual has performed services for the corporation for many years, but previous employment contracts between the corporation and the individual did not provide for a similar signing bonus. One month after the contract is entered into, a change in the ownership or control of the corporation occurs. All payments under the contract are presumed to be contingent on the change in ownership or control even though the bonus payment would have been legally required even if no change had occurred. Clear and convincing
evidence of these facts rebuts the presumption described in A-25 of this section with respect to all of the payments under the contract with the exception of the bonus payment (which is treated as contingent on the change). However, payments other than the bonus under the contract still may be contingent on the change in ownership or control pursuant to Q/A-22 of this section.

# Example 3.
A corporation and a disqualified individual, who is an employee of the corporation, enter into an employment contract within one year of a change in ownership or control of the corporation. Under the contract, in the event of a change in ownership or control and subsequent termination of employment, certain payments will be made to the individual. A change in ownership or control occurs, but the individual is not terminated until 2 years after the change in ownership or control. If clear and convincing evidence does not rebut the presumption described in A-25 of this section, because the payment is made pursuant to an agreement entered into within one year of the date of the change in ownership or control, the payment is presumed contingent on the change under A-25 of this section. This is true even though A's termination of employment is presumed not to be materially related to the change in ownership or control under Q/A-22 of this section.

# Change in Ownership or Control
Q-27: When does a change in the ownership of a corporation occur?
A-27: (a) For purposes of this section, a change in the ownership of a corporation occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as defined in paragraph (b) of this A-27), acquires ownership of stock of the corporation that, together with stock held by such person or group, has more than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of such corporation. However, if any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than 50 percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of a corporation, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a change in the ownership of the corporation (or to cause a change in the effective control of the corporation (within the meaning of Q/A-28 of this section)). An increase in the percentage of stock owned by any one person, or persons acting as a group, as a result of a transaction in which the corporation acquires its stock in exchange for property will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this section. This A-27 applies only when there is a transfer of stock of a corporation (or issuance of stock of a corporation) and stock in such corporation remains outstanding after the transaction. (
See
Q/A-29 for rules regarding the transfer of assets of a corporation).
(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this A-27, persons will not be considered to be acting as a group merely because they happen to purchase or own stock of the same corporation at the same time, or as a result of the same public offering. However, persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar business transaction with the corporation. If a person, including an entity shareholder, owns stock in both corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in a corporation only with respect to the ownership in that corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation.
(c) For purposes of this A-27 (and Q/A-28 and 29), section 318(a) applies to determine stock ownership. Stock underlying a vested option is considered owned by the individual who holds the vested option (and the stock underlying an unvested option is not considered owned by the individual who holds the unvested option). For purposes of the preceding sentence, however, if the option is exercisable for stock that is not substantially vested (as defined by sections 1.83-3(b) and (j)), the stock underlying the option is not treated as owned by the individual who holds the option. In addition, mutual and cooperative corporations are treated as having stock for purposes of this A-27.
(d) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-27:

# Example 1.
Corporation M has owned stock with a fair market value equal to 19 percent of the value of the stock of Corporation N (an otherwise unrelated corporation) for many years prior to 2006. Corporation M acquires additional stock with a fair market value equal to 15 percent of the value of the stock of Corporation N on January 1, 2006, and an additional 18 percent on February 21, 2007. As of February 21, 2007, Corporation M has acquired stock with a fair market value greater than 50 percent of the value of the stock of Corporation N. Thus, a change in the ownership of Corporation N is considered to occur on February 21, 2007 (assuming that Corporation M did not have effective control of Corporation N immediately prior to the acquisition on that date).

# Example 2.
All of the corporation's stock is owned by the founders of the corporation. The board of directors of the corporation decides to offer shares of the corporation to the
public. After the public offering, the founders of the corporation own a total of 40 percent of the corporation's stock, and members of the public own 60 percent. If no one person (or more than one person acting as a group) owns more than 50 percent of the corporation's stock (by value or voting power) after the public offering, there is no change in the ownership of the corporation.

# Example 3.
Corporation P merges into Corporation O (a previously unrelated corporation). In the merger, the shareholders of Corporation P receive Corporation O stock in exchange for their Corporation P stock. Immediately after the merger, the former shareholders of Corporation P own stock with a fair market value equal to 60 percent of the value of the stock of Corporation O, and the former shareholders of Corporation O own stock with a fair market value equal to 40 percent of the value of the stock of Corporation O. The former shareholders of Corporation P will be treated as acting as a group in their acquisition of Corporation O stock. Thus, a change in the ownership of Corporation O occurs on the date of the merger. See Q/A-29,
Example 3,
regarding whether there is a change in ownership or control of P.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3,
except that immediately after the change, the former shareholders of Corporation P own stock with a fair market value of 51 percent of the value of Corporation O stock and the former shareholders of Corporation O own stock with a fair market value equal to 49 percent of the value of Corporation O stock. Assume further that prior to the merger several Corporation O shareholders also owned Corporation P stock (overlapping shareholders). In the merger, those O shareholders received additional O stock by virtue of their ownership of P stock with a fair market value of 5 percent of the value of Corporation O stock. Including the O stock attributable to the P shares, the O shareholders hold 54 percent of O after the transaction. However, those overlapping shareholders that owned both Corporation O stock and Corporation P stock prior to the merger are treated as acting as a group with the Corporation O shareholders only with respect to their ownership interest in Corporation O prior to the transaction. Therefore, because the Corporation O shareholders owned 49 percent of the value of Corporation O stock, a change in the ownership of Corporation O occurs on the date of the merger. See Q/A-29,
Example 3,
regarding whether there is a change in ownership or control of P.

# Example 5.
A, an individual, owns stock with a fair market value equal to 20 percent of the value of the stock of Corporation Q. On January 1, 2007, Corporation Q acquires in a redemption for cash all of the stock held by shareholders other than A. Thus, A is left as the sole shareholder of Corporation O. A change in ownership of Corporation O is considered to occur on January 1, 2007 (assuming that A did not have effective control of Corporation Q immediately prior to the redemption).

# Example 6.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 5,
except that A owns stock with a fair market value equal to 51 percent of the value of all the stock of Corporation Q immediately prior to the redemption. There is no change in the ownership of Corporation Q as a result of the redemption.
Q-28: When does a change in the effective control of a corporation occur?
A-28: (a) Notwithstanding that a corporation has not undergone a change in ownership under Q/A-27, for purposes of this section, a change in the effective control of a corporation is presumed to occur on the date that either—
(1) Any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as determined under paragraph (e) of this A-28), acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of the corporation possessing 20 percent or more of the total voting power of the stock of such corporation; or
(2) A majority of members of the corporation's board of directors is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the corporation's board of directors prior to the date of the appointment or election.
(b) The presumption of paragraph (a) of this A-28 may be rebutted by establishing that such acquisition or acquisitions of the corporation's stock, or such replacement of the majority of the members of the corporation's board of directors, does not transfer the power to control (directly or indirectly) the management and policies of the corporation from any one person (or more than one person acting as a group) to another person (or group). For purposes of this section, in the absence of an event described in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this A-28, a change in the effective control of a corporation is presumed not to have occurred.
(c) In no event does a change in effective control under this A-28 occur in any transaction in which either of the two corporations involved in the transaction has a change in ownership or control under Q/A-27 or 29 of this section. Thus, for example, assume Corporation P transfers more than one-third of the total gross fair market value of its assets to Corporation O in exchange for 20 percent of O's stock. Because P has undergone a change in ownership of a substantial portion of its assets under Q/A-29 of this section, O does not have a change in effective control under Q/A-28.
(d) If any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to effectively control a corporation (within the meaning of this A-28), the acquisition of additional control of the corporation by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a change in the effective control of the corporation (or to cause a change in the ownership of the corporation within the meaning of Q/A-27 of this section).
(e) For purposes of this A-28, persons will not be considered to be acting as a group merely because they happen to purchase or own stock of the same corporation at the same time, or as a result of the same public offering. However, persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar business transaction with the corporation. If a person, including an entity shareholder, owns stock in both corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in a corporation only with respect to the ownership in that corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation.
(f) For purposes of determining stock ownership,
see
Q/A-27(c).
(g) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-28:

# Example 1.
Shareholder A acquired the following percentages of the voting stock of Corporation M (an otherwise unrelated corporation) on the following dates: 16 percent on January 1, 2005; 10 percent on January 10, 2006; 8 percent on February 10, 2006; 11 percent on March 1, 2007; and 8 percent on March 10, 2007. Thus, on March 10, 2007, A owns a total of 53 percent of M's voting stock. Because A did not acquire 20 percent or more of M's voting stock during any 12-month period, there is no presumption of a change in effective control pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this A-28. In addition, under these facts there is a presumption that no change in the effective control of Corporation M occurred. If this presumption is not rebutted (and thus no change in effective control of Corporation M is treated as occurring prior to March 10, 2007), a change in the ownership of Corporation M is treated as having occurred on March 10, 2007 (pursuant to Q/A-27 of this section) because A had acquired more than 50 percent of Corporation M's voting stock as of that date.

# Example 2.
A minority group of shareholders of a corporation opposes the practices and policies of the corporation's current board of directors. A proxy contest ensues. The minority group presents its own slate of candidates for the board at the next annual meeting of the corporation's shareholders, and candidates of the minority group are elected to replace a majority of the current members of the board. A change in the effective control of the corporation is presumed to have occurred on the date the election of the new board of directors becomes effective.
Q-29: When does a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of a corporation's assets occur?
A-29: (a) For purposes of this section, a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of a corporation's assets occurs on the date that any one person, or more than one person acting as a group (as determined in paragraph (c) of this A-29), acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the corporation that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than one-third of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the corporation immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions. For this purpose,
gross fair market value
means the value of the assets of the corporation, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets. This A-29 applies in any situation other than one involving the transfer of stock (or issuance of stock) in a parent corporation and stock in such corporation remains outstanding after the transaction. Thus, this A-29 applies to the sale of stock in a subsidiary (when that subsidiary is treated as a single corporation with the parent pursuant to Q/A-46) and to mergers involving the creation of a new corporation or with respect to the corporation that is not surviving entity.
(b) (1) There is no change in ownership or control under this A-29 when there is a transfer to an entity that is controlled by the shareholders of the transferring corporation immediately after the transfer, as provided in this paragraph (b). A transfer of assets by a corporation is not treated as a change in the ownership of such assets if the assets are transferred to—
(i) A shareholder of the corporation (immediately before the asset transfer) in exchange for or with respect to its stock;
(ii) An entity, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation;
(iii) A person, or more than one person acting as a group, that owns, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more of the total value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of the corporation; or
(iv) An entity, at least 50 percent of the total value or voting power is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this A-29.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (b) and except as otherwise provided, a person's status is determined immediately after the transfer of the assets. For example, a transfer to a corporation in which the transferor corporation has no ownership interest in before the transaction, but which is a majority-owned subsidiary of the transferor corporation after the transaction is not treated as a change in the ownership of the assets of the transferor corporation.
(c) For purposes of this A-29, persons will not be considered to be acting as a group merely because they happen to purchase assets of the same corporation at the same time, or as a result of the same public offering. However, persons will be considered to be acting as a group if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of assets, or similar business transaction with the corporation. If a person, including an entity shareholder, owns stock in both corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of stock, or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be acting as a group with other shareholders in a corporation only to the extent of the ownership in that corporation prior to the transaction giving rise to the change and not with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation.
(d) For purposes of determining stock ownership, see Q/A-27(c).
(e) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-29:

# Example 1.
Corporation M acquires assets having a gross fair market value of $500,000 from Corporation N (an unrelated corporation) on January 1, 2006. The total gross fair market value of Corporation N's assets immediately prior to the acquisition was $3 million. Since the value of the assets acquired by Corporation M is less than one-third of the total gross fair market value of Corporation N's total assets immediately prior to the acquisition, the acquisition does not represent a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of Corporation N's assets.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1.
Also assume that on November 1, 2006, Corporation M acquires from Corporation N additional assets having a fair market value of $700,000. Thus, Corporation M has acquired from Corporation N assets worth a total of $1.2 million during the 12-month period ending on November 1, 2006. Since $1.2 million is more than one-third of the total gross fair market value of all of Corporation N's assets immediately prior to the earlier of these acquisitions ($3 million), a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of Corporation N's assets is considered to have occurred on November 1, 2006.

# Example 3.
(i) All of the assets of Corporation P are transferred to Corporation O (an unrelated corporation). In exchange, the shareholders of Corporation P receive Corporation O stock. Immediately after the transfer, the former shareholders of Corporation P own 60 percent of the fair market value of the outstanding stock of Corporation O and the former shareholders of Corporation O own 40 percent of the fair market value of the outstanding stock of Corporation O. Because Corporation O is an entity more than 50 percent of the fair market value of the outstanding stock of which is owned by the former shareholders of Corporation P (based on ownership of Corporation P prior the change), the transfer of assets is not treated as a change in ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of Corporation P. However, a change in the ownership (within the meaning of Q/A-27) of Corporation O occurs.
(ii) The result in paragraph (i) would be the same if immediately after the change, the former shareholders of Corporation P own stock with a fair market value of 51 percent of the value of Corporation O stock because Corporation O is an entity more than 50 percent of the fair market value of the outstanding stock of which is owned by the former shareholders of Corporation P. See Q/A-27,
Example 4,
regarding whether there is a change in ownership or control of O.

# Example 4.
Corporation P sells all of the stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary, S, to Corporation Y. The fair market value of the affiliated group, determined without regard to its liabilities, is $210 million. The fair market value of S, determined without regard to its liabilities, is $80 million. Because there is a change in more than one-third of the gross fair market value of the total assets of the affiliated group, there is a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the affiliated group.

# Three-Times-Base-Amount Test for Parachute Payments
Q-30: Are all payments that are in the nature of compensation, are made to a disqualified individual, and are contingent on a change in ownership or control, parachute payments?
A-30: (a) No. To determine whether such payments are parachute payments, they must be tested against the individual's
base amount
(as defined in Q/A-34 of this section). To do this, the aggregate present value of all payments in the nature of compensation that are made or to be made to (or for the benefit of) the same disqualified individual and are contingent on the change in ownership or control must be determined. If this aggregate present value equals or exceeds the amount equal to 3 times the individual's base amount, the payments are parachute payments. If this aggregate present value is
less than the amount equal to 3 times the individual's base amount, no portion of the payment is a parachute payment. See Q/A-31, Q/A-32, and Q/A-33 of this section for rules on determining present value. Parachute payments that are securities violation parachute payments are not included in the foregoing computation if they are not contingent on a change in ownership or control. See Q/A-37 of this section for the definition and treatment of securities violation parachute payments.
(b) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-30:

# Example 1.
A is a disqualified individual with respect to Corporation M. A's base amount is $100,000. Payments in the nature of compensation that are contingent on a change in the ownership or control of Corporation M totaling $400,000 are made to A on the date of the change in ownership or control. The payments are parachute payments because they have an aggregate present value at least equal to 3 times A's base amount of $100,000 (3 × x$100,000 = $300,000).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the payments contingent on the change in the ownership or control of Corporation M total $290,000. Because the payments do not have an aggregate present value at least equal to 3 times A's base amount, no portion of the payments is a parachute payment.
Q-31: As of what date is the present value of a payment determined?
A-31: (a) Except as provided in this section, the present value of a payment is determined as of the date on which the change in ownership or control occurs, or, if a payment is made prior to such date, the date on which the payment is made.
(b)(1) For purposes of determining whether a payment is a parachute payment, if a payment in the nature of compensation is the right to receive payments in a year (or years) subsequent to the year of the change in ownership or control, the value of the payment is the present value of such payment (or payments) calculated in accordance with Q/A-32 of this section and based on reasonable actuarial assumptions.
(2) If the payment in the nature of compensation is an obligation to provide health care, then for purposes of this A-31 and for applying the 3-times-base-amount test under Q/A-30 of this section, the present value of such obligation should be calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For purposes of Q/A-30 and this A-31, the obligation to provide health care is permitted to be measured by projecting the cost of premiums for purchased health care insurance, even if no health care insurance is actually purchased. If the obligation to provide health care is made in coordination with a health care plan that the corporation makes available to a group, then the premiums used for this purpose may be group premiums.
Q-32: What discount rate is to be used to determine present value?
A-32: For purposes of this section, present value generally is determined by using a discount rate equal to 120 percent of the applicable Federal rate (determined under section 1274(d) and the regulations thereunder) compounded semiannually. The applicable Federal rate to be used for this purpose is the Federal rate that is in effect on the date as of which the present value is determined, using the period until the payment would have been made without regard to the change in ownership or control as the term of the debt instrument under section 1274(d). See Q/A-24 and 31 of this section. However, for any payment, the corporation and the disqualified individual may elect to use the applicable Federal rate that is in effect on the date that the contract which provides for the payment is entered into, if such election is made in the contract.
Q-33: If the present value of a payment to be made in the future is contingent on an uncertain future event or condition, how is the present value of the payment determined?
A-33: (a) In certain cases, it may be necessary to apply the 3-times-base-amount test of Q/A-30 of this section, or to allocate a portion of the base amount to a payment described in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of Q/A-2 of this section, at a time when the aggregate present value of all such payments cannot be determined with certainty because the time, amount, or right to receive one or more such payments is contingent on the occurrence of an uncertain future event or condition. For example, a disqualified individual's right to receive a payment may be contingent on the involuntary termination of such individual's employment with the corporation. In such a case, it must be reasonably estimated whether the payment will be made. If it is reasonably estimated that there is a 50-percent or greater probability that the payment will be made, the full amount of the payment is considered for purposes of the 3-times-base-amount test and the allocation of the base amount. Conversely, if it is reasonably estimated that there is a less than 50-percent probability that the payment will be made, the payment is not considered for either purpose.
(b) If the estimate made under paragraph (a) of this A-33 is later determined to be incorrect, the 3-times-base-amount test described in Q/A-30 of this section must be reapplied (and the portion of the base amount allocated to previous payments must be reallocated (if necessary) to such payments) to reflect the actual time and amount of the payment. Whenever the 3-times-base-amount test is applied (or whenever the base amount is allocated), the aggregate present value of
the payments received or to be received by the disqualified individual is redetermined as of the date described in A-31 of this section, using the discount rate described in A-32 of this section. This redetermination may affect the amount of any excess parachute payment for a prior taxable year. Alternatively, if, based on the application of the 3-times-base-amount test without regard to the payment described in paragraph (a) of this A-33, a disqualified individual is determined to have an excess parachute payment or payments, then the 3-times-base-amount test does not have to be reapplied when a payment described in paragraph (a) of this A-33 is made (or becomes certain to be made) if no base amount is allocated to such payment.
(c) To the extent provided in published guidance of general applicability under § 601.601(d)(2) of this Chapter, an initial estimate of the value of an option subject to Q/A-13 of this section is permitted to be made, with the valuation subsequently re-determined, and the 3-times-base-amount test reapplied.
(d) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-33:

# Example 1.
A, a disqualified individual with respect to Corporation M, has a base amount of $100,000. Under A's employment agreement with Corporation M, A is entitled to receive a payment in the nature of compensation in the amount of $250,000 contingent on a change in ownership or control of Corporation M. In addition, the agreement provides that if A's employment is terminated within 1 year after the change in ownership or control, A will receive an additional payment in the nature of compensation in the amount of $150,000, payable 1 year after the date of the change in ownership or control. A change in ownership or control of Corporation M occurs and A receives the first payment of $250,000. Corporation M reasonably estimates that there is a 50-percent probability that, as a result of the change, A's employment will be terminated within 1 year of the date of the change. For purposes of applying the 3-times-base-amount test (and if the first payment is determined to be a parachute payment, for purposes of allocating a portion of A's base amount to that payment), because M reasonably estimates that there is a 50-percent or greater probability that, as a result of the change, A's employment will be terminated within 1 year of the date of the change, Corporation M must assume that the $150,000 payment will be made to A as a result of the change in ownership or control. The present value of the additional payment is determined under Q/A-31 and Q/A-32 of this section.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that Corporation M reasonably estimates that there is a less than 50-percent probability that, as a result of the change, A's employment will be terminated within 1 year of the date of the change. For purposes of applying the 3-times-base-amount test, because Corporation M reasonably estimates that there is a less than 50-percent probability that, as a result of the change, A's employment will be terminated within 1 year of the date of the change, Corporation M must assume that the $150,000 payment will not be made to A as a result of the change in ownership or control.

# Example 3.
B, a disqualified individual with respect to Corporation P, has a base amount of $200,000. Under B's employment agreement with Corporation P, if there is a change in ownership or control of Corporation P, B will receive a severance payment of $600,000 and a bonus payment of $400,000. In addition, the agreement provides that if B's employment is terminated within 1 year after the change, B will receive an additional payment in the nature of compensation of $500,000. A change in ownership or control of Corporation P occurs, and B receives the $600,000 and $400,000 payments. At the time of the change in ownership or control, Corporation P reasonably estimates that there is a less than 50-percent probability that B's employment will be terminated within 1 year of the change. For purposes of applying the 3-times-base-amount test, because Corporation P reasonably estimates that there is a less than 50-percent probability that B's employment will be terminated within 1 year of the date of the change, Corporation P assumes that the $500,000 payment will not be made to B. Eleven months after the change in ownership or control, B's employment is terminated, and the $500,000 payment is made to B. Because B was determined to have excess parachute payments without regard to the $500,000 payment, the 3-times-base-amount test is not reapplied and the base amount is not reallocated to include the $500,000 payment. The entire $500,000 payment is treated as an excess parachute payment.
Q-34: What is the base amount?
A-34: (a) The base amount of a disqualified individual is the average annual compensation for services performed for the corporation with respect to which the change in ownership or control occurs (or for a predecessor entity or a related entity as defined in Q/A-21 of this section) which was includible in the gross income of such individual for taxable years in the base period (including amounts that were excluded under section 911), or which would have been includible in such gross income if such person had been a United States citizen or resident.
See
Q/A-35 of this section for the definition of base period and for examples of base amount computations.
(b) If the base period of a disqualified individual includes a short taxable year or less than all of a taxable year, compensation for
such short or incomplete taxable year must be annualized before determining the average annual compensation for the base period. In annualizing compensation, the frequency with which payments are expected to be made over an annual period must be taken into account. Thus, any amount of compensation for such a short or incomplete taxable year that represents a payment that will not be made more often than once per year is not annualized.
(c) Because the base amount includes only compensation that is includible in gross income, the base amount does not include certain items that constitute parachute payments. For example, payments in the form of excludible fringe benefits are not included in the base amount but may be treated as parachute payments.
(d) The base amount includes the amount of compensation included in income under section 83(b) during the base period.
See
Q/A-35 for the definition of base period.
(e) The following example illustrates the principles of this A-34:

# Example.
A disqualified individual, D, receives an annual salary of $500,000 per year during the 5-year base period. D defers $100,000 of D's salary each year under the corporation's nonqualified deferred compensation plan. D's base amount is $400,000 ($400,000 × (5/5)).
Q-35: What is the base period?
A-35: (a) The base period of a disqualified individual is the most recent 5 taxable years of the individual ending before the date of the change in ownership or control. For this purpose, the date of the change in ownership or control is the date the corporation experiences one of the events described in Q/A-27, Q/A-28, or Q/A-29 of this section. However, if the disqualified individual was not an employee or independent contractor of the corporation with respect to which the change in ownership or control occurs (or a predecessor entity or a related entity as defined in Q/A-21 of this section) for this entire 5-year period, the individual's base period is the portion of such 5-year period during which the individual performed personal services for the corporation or predecessor entity or related entity.
(b) The following examples illustrate the principles of Q/A-34 of this section and this Q/A-35:

# Example 1.
A disqualified individual, D, was employed by a corporation for 2 years and 4 months preceding the taxable year in which a change in ownership or control of the corporation occurs. D's includible compensation income from the corporation was $30,000 for the 4-month period, $120,000 for the first full year, and $150,000 for the second full year. D's base amount is $120,000, ((3 × $30,000) + $120,000 + $150,000)/3.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that D also received a $60,000 signing bonus when D's employment with the corporation commenced at the beginning of the 4-month period. D's base amount is $140,000, (($60,000 + (3 × $30,000)) + $120,000 + $150,000) / 3. Since the bonus will not be paid more often than once per year, the amount of the bonus is not increased in annualizing D's compensation for the 4-month period.

# Example 3.
E is a disqualified individual with respect to Corporation X who was not an employee or independent contractor for the full 5-year base period. In 2004 and 2005, E is a director of X and receives $30,000 per year for E's services. In 2006, E becomes an officer of X. E's includible compensation from Corporation X is $250,000 for 2006 and 2007, and $300,000 for 2008. In 2008, X undergoes a change in ownership or control. E's base amount is $140,000 ((2 × $250,000) + (2 × $30,000) / 4).
Q-36: How is the base amount determined in the case of a disqualified individual who did not perform services for the corporation (or a predecessor entity or a related entity as defined in Q/A-21 of this section), prior to the individual's taxable year in which the change in ownership or control occurs?
A-36: (a) In such a case, the individual's base amount is the annualized compensation for services performed for the corporation (or a predecessor entity or related entity) which—
(1) Was includible in the individual's gross income for that portion, prior to such change, of the individual's taxable year in which the change occurred (including amounts that were excluded under section 911), or would have been includible in such gross income if such person had been a United States citizen or resident;
(2) Was not contingent on the change in ownership or control; and
(3) Was not a securities violation parachute payment.
(b) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-36:

# Example 1.
On January 1, 2006, A, an individual whose taxable year is the calendar year, enters into a 4-year employment contract with Corporation M as an officer of the corporation. A has not previously performed services for Corporation M (or any predecessor entity or related entity as defined in Q/A-21 of this section). Under the employment contract, A is to receive an annual salary of $120,000 for each of the 4 years that he remains employed by Corporation M with any remaining unpaid balance to be paid immediately in the event that A's employment is terminated without cause. On July 1, 2006, after A has received compensation of $60,000, a change in the ownership or control of Corporation M occurs. Because of the change, A's employment is terminated without
cause, and he receives a payment of $420,000. It is established by clear and convincing evidence that the $60,000 in compensation is not contingent on the change in ownership or control, but the presumption that the $420,000 payment is contingent on the change is not rebutted. Thus, the payment of $420,000 is treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control of Corporation M. In this case, A's base amount is $120,000 (2 × $60,000). Since the present value of the payment which is contingent on the change in ownership of Corporation M ($420,000) is more than 3 times A's base amount of $120,000 (3 × $120,000 = $360,000), the payment is a parachute payment.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that A also receives a signing bonus of $50,000 from Corporation M on January 1, 2006. It is established by clear and convincing evidence that the bonus is not contingent on the change in ownership or control. When the change in ownership or control occurs on July 1, 2006, A has received compensation of $110,000 (the $50,000 bonus plus $60,000 in salary). In this case, A's base amount is $170,000 ($50,000 + (2 × $60,000)). Because the $50,000 bonus will not be paid more than once per year, the amount of the bonus is not increased in annualizing A's compensation. The present value of the potential parachute payment ($420,000) is less than 3 times A's base amount of $170,000 (3 × $170,000 = $510,000), and therefore no portion of the payment is a parachute payment.

# Securities Violation Parachute Payments
Q-37: Must a payment be contingent on a change in ownership or control in order to be a parachute payment?
A-37: (a) No, the term
parachute payment
also includes any payment (other than a payment exempted under Q/A-6 or Q/A-8 of this section) that is in the nature of compensation and is to (or for the benefit of) a disqualified individual, if such payment is a securities violation payment. A securities violation payment is a payment made or to be made—
(1) Pursuant to an agreement that violates any generally enforced Federal or state securities laws or regulations; and
(2) In connection with a potential or actual change in ownership or control.
(b) A violation is not taken into account under paragraph (a)(1) of this A-37 if it is merely technical in character or is not materially prejudicial to shareholders or potential shareholders. Moreover, a violation will be presumed not to exist unless the existence of the violation has been determined or admitted in a civil or criminal action (or an administrative action by a regulatory body charged with enforcing the particular securities law or regulation) which has been resolved by adjudication or consent. Parachute payments described in this A-37 are referred to in this section as securities violation payments.
(c) Securities violation parachute payments that are not contingent on a change in ownership or control within the meaning of Q/A-22 of this section are not taken into account in applying the 3-times-base-amount test of Q/A-30 of this section. Such payments are considered parachute payments regardless of whether such test is met with respect to the disqualified individual (and are included in allocating base amount under Q/A-38 of this section). Moreover, the amount of a securities violation parachute payment treated as an excess parachute payment shall not be reduced by the portion of such payment that is reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered before the date of a change in ownership or control if such payment is not contingent on such change. Likewise, the amount of a securities violation parachute payment includes the portion of such payment that is reasonable compensation for personal services to be rendered on or after the date of a change in ownership or control if such payment is not contingent on such change.
(d) The rules in paragraph (b) of this A-37 also apply to securities violation parachute payments that are contingent on a change in ownership or control if the application of these rules results in greater total excess parachute payments with respect to the disqualified individual than would result if the payments were treated simply as payments contingent on a change in ownership or control (and hence were taken into account in applying the 3-times-base-amount test and were reduced by, or did not include, any applicable amount of reasonable compensation).
(e) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-37:

# Example 1.
A, a disqualified individual with respect to Corporation M, receives two payments in the nature of compensation that are contingent on a change in the ownership or control of Corporation M. The present value of the first payment is equal to A's base amount and is not a securities violation parachute payment. The present value of the second payment is equal to 1.5 times A's base amount and is a securities violation parachute payment. Neither payment includes any reasonable compensation. If the second payment is treated simply as a payment contingent on a change in ownership or control, the amount of A's total excess parachute payments is zero because the aggregate present value of the payments does not equal or exceed 3 times A's base amount. If the second payment is treated as a securities violation parachute payment subject to the rules of paragraph (b) of this A-37, the amount of A's total excess parachute payments is 0.5 times A's base amount. Thus, the second
payment is treated as a securities violation parachute payment.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the present value of the first payment is equal to 2 times A's base amount. If the second payment is treated simply as a payment contingent on a change in ownership or control, the total present value of the payments is 3.5 times A's base amount, and the amount of A's total excess parachute payments is 2.5 times A's base amount. If the second payment is treated as a securities violation parachute payment, the amount of A's total excess parachute payments is 0.5 times A's base amount. Thus, the second payment is treated simply as a payment contingent on a change in ownership or control.

# Example 3.
B, a disqualified individual with respect to Corporation N, receives two payments in the nature of compensation that are contingent on a change in the control of Corporation N. The present value of the first payment is equal to 4 times B's base amount and is a securities violation parachute payment. The present value of the second payment is equal to 2 times B's base amount and is not a securities violation parachute payment. B establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the entire amount of the first payment is reasonable compensation for personal services to be rendered after the change in ownership or control. If the first payment is treated simply as a payment contingent on a change in ownership or control, it is exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
pursuant to Q/A-9 of this section. Thus, the amount of B's total excess parachute payment is zero because the present value of the second payment does not equal or exceed 3 times B's base amount. However, if the first payment is treated as a securities violation parachute payment, the amount of B's total excess parachute payments is 3 times B's base amount. Thus, the first payment is treated as a securities violation parachute payment.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 3,
except that B does not receive the second payment and B establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the first payment is reasonable compensation for services actually rendered before the change in the control of Corporation N. If the payment is treated simply as a payment contingent on a change in ownership or control, the amount of B's excess parachute payment is zero because the amount treated as an excess parachute payment is reduced by the amount that B establishes as reasonable compensation. However, if the payment is treated as a securities violation parachute payment, the amount of B's excess parachute payment is 3 times B's base amount. Thus, the payment is treated as a securities violation parachute payment.

# Computation and Reduction of Excess Parachute Payments
Q-38: How is the amount of an excess parachute payment computed?
A-38: (a) The amount of an excess parachute payment is the excess of the amount of any parachute payment over the portion of the disqualified individual's base amount that is allocated to such payment. For this purpose, the portion of the base amount allocated to any parachute payment is the amount that bears the same ratio to the base amount as the present value of such parachute payment bears to the aggregate present value of all parachute payments made or to be made to (or for the benefit of) the same disqualified individual. Thus, the portion of the base amount allocated to any parachute payment is determined by multiplying the base amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the present value of such parachute payment and the denominator of which is the aggregate present value of all such payments.
See
Q/A-31, Q/A-32, and Q/A-33 of this section for rules on determining present value and Q/A-34 of this section for the definition of
base amount.
(b) The following example illustrates the principles of this A-38:

# Example.
An individual with a base amount of $100,000 is entitled to receive two parachute payments, one of $200,000 and the other of $400,000. The $200,000 payment is made at the time of the change in ownership or control, and the $400,000 payment is to be made at a future date. The present value of the $400,000 payment is $300,000 on the date of the change in ownership or control. The portions of the base amount allocated to these payments are $40,000 (($200,000/$500,000) × $100,000) and $60,000 (($300,000/$500,000) × $100,000), respectively. Thus, the amount of the first excess parachute payment is $160,000 ($200,000−$40,000) and that of the second is $340,000 ($400,000−$60,000).
Q-39: May the amount of an excess parachute payment be reduced by reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered before the change in ownership or control?
A-39: (a) Generally, yes. Except in the case of payments treated as securities violation parachute payments or when the portion of a payment that is treated as contingent on the change in ownership or control is determined under paragraph (b) or (c) of Q/A-24 of this section, the amount of an excess parachute payment is reduced by any portion of the payment that the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidence is reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered by the disqualified individual before the date of the change in ownership or control. Services reasonably compensated
for by payments that are not parachute payments (for example, because the payments are not contingent on a change in ownership or control and are not securities violation parachute payments, or because the payments are exempt from the definition of parachute payment under Q/A-6 through Q/A-9 of this section) are not taken into account for this purpose. The portion of any parachute payment that is established as reasonable compensation is first reduced by the portion of the disqualified individual's base amount that is allocated to such parachute payment; any remaining portion of the parachute payment established as reasonable compensation then reduces the excess parachute payment.
(b) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-39:

# Example 1.
Assume that a parachute payment of $600,000 is made to a disqualified individual, and the portion of the individual's base amount that is allocated to the parachute payment is $100,000. Also assume that $300,000 of the $600,000 parachute payment is established as reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered by the disqualified individual before the date of the change in ownership or control. Before the reasonable compensation is taken into account, the amount of the excess parachute payment is $500,000 ($600,000—$100,000). In reducing the excess parachute payment by reasonable compensation, the portion of the parachute payment that is established as reasonable compensation ($300,000) is first reduced by the portion of the disqualified individual's base amount that is allocated to the parachute payment ($100,000), and the remainder ($200,000) then reduces the excess parachute payment. Thus, in this case, the excess parachute payment of $500,000 is reduced by $200,000 of reasonable compensation.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the full amount of the $600,000 parachute payment is established as reasonable compensation. In this case, the excess parachute payment of $500,000 is reduced to zero by $500,000 of reasonable compensation. As a result, no portion of any deduction for the payment is disallowed by section 280G, and no portion of the payment is subject to the 20-percent excise tax of section 4999.

# Determination of Reasonable Compensation
Q-40: How is it determined whether payments are reasonable compensation?
A-40: (a) In general, whether payments are reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered, or to be rendered, by the disqualified individual is determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Factors relevant to such a determination include, but are not limited to, the following—
(1) The nature of the services rendered or to be rendered;
(2) The individual's historic compensation for performing such services; and
(3) The compensation of individuals performing comparable services in situations where the compensation is not contingent on a change in ownership or control.
(b) For purposes of section 280G, reasonable compensation for personal services includes reasonable compensation for holding oneself out as available to perform services and refraining from performing services (such as under a covenant not to compete).
Q-41: Is any particular type of evidence generally considered clear and convincing evidence of reasonable compensation for personal services?
A-41: Yes. A showing that payments are made under a nondiscriminatory employee plan or program (as defined in Q/A-26 of this section) generally is considered to be clear and convincing evidence that the payments are reasonable compensation. This is true whether the personal services for which the payments are made are actually rendered before, or are to be rendered on or after, the date of the change in ownership or control. Q/A-46 of this section (relating to the treatment of an affiliated group as one corporation) does not apply for purposes of this A-41. No determination of reasonable compensation is needed for payments under qualified plans to be exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
under Q/A-8 of this section.
Q-42: Is any particular type of evidence generally considered clear and convincing evidence of reasonable compensation for personal services to be rendered on or after the date of a change in ownership or control?
A-42: (a) Yes, if payments are made or to be made to (or on behalf of) a disqualified individual for personal services to be rendered on or after the date of a change in ownership or control, a showing of the following generally is considered to be clear and convincing evidence that the payments are reasonable compensation for services to be rendered on or after the date of the change in ownership or control—
(1) The payments were made or are to be made only for the period the individual actually performs such personal services; and
(2) If the individual's duties and responsibilities are substantially the same after the change in ownership or control, the individual's annual compensation for such services is not significantly greater than such individual's annual compensation prior to the change in ownership or control, apart from normal increases attributable to increased responsibilities or cost of living adjustments. If the scope of the individual's duties and responsibilities are not substantially the
same, the annual compensation after the change is not significantly greater than the annual compensation customarily paid by the employer or by comparable employers to persons performing comparable services. However, except as provided in paragraph (b) and (c) of this A-42, such clear and convincing evidence will not exist if the individual does not, in fact, perform the services contemplated in exchange for the compensation.
(b) Generally, an agreement under which the disqualified individual must refrain from performing services (
e.g.,
a covenant not to compete) is an agreement for the performance of personal services for purposes of this A-42 to the extent that it is demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that the agreement substantially constrains the individual's ability to perform services and there is a reasonable likelihood that the agreement will be enforced against the individual. In the absence of clear and convincing evidence, payments under the agreement are treated as severance payments under Q/A-44 of this section.
(c) If the employment of a disqualified individual is involuntarily terminated before the end of a contract term and the individual is paid damages for breach of contract, a showing of the following factors generally is considered clear and convincing evidence that the payment is reasonable compensation for personal services to be rendered on or after the date of change in ownership or control—
(1) The contract was not entered into, amended, or renewed in contemplation of the change in ownership or control;
(2) The compensation the individual would have received under the contract would have qualified as reasonable compensation under section 162;
(3) The damages do not exceed the present value (determined as of the date of receipt) of the compensation the individual would have received under the contract if the individual had continued to perform services for the employer until the end of the contract term;
(4) The damages are received because an offer to provide personal services was made by the disqualified individual but was rejected by the employer (including involuntary termination or constructive discharge); and
(5) The damages are reduced by mitigation. Mitigation will be treated as occurring when such damages are reduced (or any payment of such damages is returned) to the extent of the disqualified individual's earned income (within the meaning of section 911(d)(2)(A)) during the remainder of the period in which the contract would have been in effect. See Q/A-44 of this section for rules regarding damages for a failure to make severance payments.
(d) The following examples illustrate the principles of this A-42:

# Example 1.
A, a disqualified individual, has a three-year employment contract with Corporation M, a publicly traded corporation. Under this contract, A is to receive a salary for $100,000 for the first year of the contract and, for each succeeding year, an annual salary that is 10 percent higher than the prior year's salary. During the third year of the contract, Corporation N acquires all the stock of Corporation M. Prior to the change in ownership, Corporation N arranges to retain A's services by entering into an employment contract with A that is essentially the same as A's contract with Corporation M. Under the new contract, Corporation N is to fulfill Corporation M's obligations for the third year of the old contract, and, for each of the succeeding years, pay A an annual salary that is 10 percent higher than A's prior year's salary. Amounts are payable under the new contract only for the portion of the contract term during which A remains employed by Corporation N. A showing of the facts described above (and in the absence of contradictory evidence) is regarded as clear and convincing evidence that all payments under the new contract are reasonable compensation for personal services to be rendered on or after the date of the change in ownership. Therefore, the payments under this agreement are exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
pursuant to Q/A-9 of this section.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that A does not perform the services described in the new contract, but receives payment under the new contract. Because services were not rendered after the change, the payments under this contract are not exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
pursuant to Q/A-9 of this section.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that under the new contract A agrees to perform consulting services to Corporation N, when and if Corporation N requires A's services. Assume further that when Corporation N does not require A's services, the contract provides that A must not perform services for any other competing company. Corporation N previously enforced similar contracts against former employees of Corporation N. Because A is substantially constrained under this contract and Corporation N is reasonably likely to enforce the contract against A, the agreement is an agreement for the performance of services under paragraph (b) of this A-42. Assuming the requirements of paragraph (a) of this A-42 are met and there is clear and convincing evidence that all payments under the new contract are reasonable compensation for personal services to be rendered on or after
the date of the change in ownership, the payments under this contract are exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
pursuant to Q/A-9 of this section.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that instead of agreeing not to compete with Corporation N, under the new agreement A agrees not to disparage either Corporation M or Corporation N. Because the nondisparagement agreement does not substantially constrain A's ability to perform services, no amount of the payments under this contract are reasonable compensation for the nondisparagement agreement.

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the employment contract with Corporation N does not provide that amounts are payable under the contract only for the portion of the term for which A remains employed by Corporation N. Shortly after the change in ownership, and despite A's request to remain employed by Corporation N, A's employment with Corporation N is involuntarily terminated. Shortly thereafter, A obtains employment with Corporation O. A commences a civil action against Corporation N, alleging breach of the employment contract. In settlement of the litigation, A receives an amount equal to the present value of the compensation A would have received under the contract with Corporation N, reduced by the amount of compensation A otherwise receives from Corporation O during the period that the contract would have been in effect. A showing of the facts described above (and in the absence of contradictory evidence) is regarded as clear and convincing evidence that the amount A receives as damages is reasonable compensation for personal services to be rendered on or after the date of the change in ownership. Therefore, the amount received by A is exempt from the definition of
parachute payment
pursuant to Q/A-9 of this section.
Q-43: Is any particular type of payment generally considered reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered before the date of a change in ownership or control?
A-43: Yes, payments of compensation earned before the date of a change in ownership or control generally are considered reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered before the date of a change in ownership or control if they qualify as reasonable compensation under section 162.
Q-44: May severance payments be treated as reasonable compensation?
A-44: (a) No, severance payments are not treated as reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered before, or to be rendered on or after, the date of a change in ownership or control. Moreover, any damages paid for a failure to make severance payments are not treated as reasonable compensation for personal services actually rendered before, or to be rendered on or after, the date of such change. For purposes of this section, the term
severance payment
means any payment that is made to (or for the benefit of) a disqualified individual on account of the termination of such individual's employment prior to the end of a contract term, but does not include any payment that otherwise would be made to (or for the benefit of) such individual on the termination of such individual's employment, whenever occurring.
(b) The following example illustrates the principles of this A-44:

# Example.
A, a disqualified individual, has a three-year employment contract with Corporation X. Under the contract, A will receive a salary of $200,000 for the first year of the contract, and for each succeeding year, an annual salary that is $100,000 higher than the previous year. In the event of A's termination of employment following a change in ownership or control, the contract provides that A will receive the remaining salary due under the employment contract. At the beginning of the second year of the contract, Corporation Y acquires all of the stock of Corporation X, A's employment is terminated, and A receives $700,000 ($300,000 for the second year of the contract plus $400,000 for the third year of the contract) representing the remaining salary due under the employment contract. Because the $700,000 payment is treated as a severance payment, it is not reasonable compensation for personal services on or after the date of the change in ownership or control. Thus, the full amount of the $700,000 is a parachute payment.

# Miscellaneous Rules
Q-45: How is the term
corporation
defined?
A-45: For purposes of this section, the term
corporation
has the meaning prescribed by section 7701(a)(3) and § 301.7701-2(b) of this Chapter. For example, a
corporation,
for purposes of this section, includes a publicly traded partnership treated as a corporation under section 7704(a); an entity described in § 301.7701-3(c)(1)(v)(A) of this Chapter; a real estate investment trust under section 856(a); a corporation that has mutual or cooperative (rather than stock) ownership, such as a mutual insurance company, a mutual savings bank, or a cooperative bank (as defined in section 7701(a)(32)), and a foreign corporation as defined under section 7701(a)(5).
Q-46: How is an affiliated group treated?
A-46: For purposes of this section, and except as otherwise provided in this section, all members of the same affiliated group (as defined in section 1504, determined without regard to section 1504(b)) are treated as one corporation. Rules affected by this treatment of an affiliated group include (but are
not limited to) rules relating to exempt payments of certain corporations (Q/A-6, Q/A-7 of this section (except as provided therein)), payor of parachute payments (Q/A-10 of this section), disqualified individuals (Q/A-15 through Q/A-21 of this section (except as provided therein)), rebuttal of the presumption that payments are contingent on a change (Q/A-26 of this section (except as provide therein)), change in ownership or control (Q/A-27, 28, and 29 of this section), and reasonable compensation (Q/A-42, 43, and 44 of this section).

# Effective Date
Q-47: What is the general effective date of section 280G?
A-47: (a) Generally, section 280G applies to payments under agreements entered into or renewed after June 14, 1984. Any agreement that is entered into before June 15, 1984, and is renewed after June 14, 1984, is treated as a new contract entered into on the day the renewal takes effect.
(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this A-47, a contract that is terminable or cancellable unconditionally at will by either party to the contract without the consent of the other, or by both parties to the contract, is treated as a new contract entered into on the date any such termination or cancellation, if made, would be effective. However, a contract is not treated as so terminable or cancellable if it can be terminated or cancelled only by terminating the employment relationship or independent contractor relationship of the disqualified individual.
(c) Section 280G applies to payments under a contract entered into on or before June 14, 1984, if the contract is amended or supplemented after June 14, 1984, in significant relevant respect. For this purpose, a
supplement
to a contract is defined as a new contract entered into after June 14, 1984, that affects the trigger, amount, or time of receipt of a payment under an existing contract.
(d)(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) of this A-47, a contract is considered to be amended or supplemented in significant relevant respect if provisions for payments contingent on a change in ownership or control (parachute provisions), or provisions in the nature of parachute provisions, are added to the contract, or are amended or supplemented to provide significant additional benefits to the disqualified individual. Thus, for example, a contract generally is treated as amended or supplemented in significant relevant respect if it is amended or supplemented—
(i) To add or modify, to the disqualified individual's benefit, a change in ownership or control trigger;
(ii) To increase amounts payable that are contingent on a change in ownership or control (or, where payment is to be made under a formula, to modify the formula to the disqualified individual's advantage); or
(iii) To accelerate, in the event of a change in ownership or control, the payment of amounts otherwise payable at a later date.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this A-47, a payment is not treated as being accelerated in the event of a change in ownership or control if the acceleration does not increase the present value of the payment.
(e) A contract entered into on or before June 14, 1984, is not treated as amended or supplemented in significant relevant respect merely by reason of normal adjustments in the terms of employment relationship or independent contractor relationship of the disqualified individual. Whether an adjustment in the terms of such a relationship is considered normal for this purpose depends on all of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Relevant factors include, but are not limited to, the following—
(1) The length of time between the adjustment and the change in ownership or control;
(2) The extent to which the corporation, at the time of the adjustment, viewed itself as a likely takeover candidate;
(3) A comparison of the adjustment with historical practices of the corporation;
(4) The extent of overlap between the group receiving the benefits of the adjustment and those members of that group who are the beneficiaries of pre-June 15, 1984, parachute contracts; and
(5) The size of the adjustment, both in absolute terms and in comparison with the benefits provided to other members of the group receiving the benefits of the adjustment.
Q-48: What is the effective date of this section?
A-48: This section applies to any payments that are contingent on a change in ownership or control if the change in ownership or control occurs on or after January 1, 2004. Taxpayers may rely on these regulations after August 4, 2003, for the treatment of any parachute payment.

§ 1.280H-1T
Limitation on certain amounts paid to employee-owners by personal service corporations electing alternative taxable years (temporary).
(a)
Introduction.
This section applies to any taxable year that a personal service corporation has a section 444 election in effect (an “applicable election year”). For purposes of this section, the term
personal service corporation
has the same meaning given such term in § 1.441-3(c).
(b)
Limitation on certain deductions of personal service corporations
—(1)
In general.
If, for any applicable election year, a personal service corporation does not satisfy the minimum distribution requirement in paragraph (c) of this section, the deduction otherwise allowable under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code) for applicable amounts, as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, shall not exceed the maximum deductible amount, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Carryover of nondeductible amounts.
Any amount not allowed as a deduction in an applicable election year under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be allowed as a deduction in the succeeding taxable year.
(3)
Disallowance inapplicable for certain purposes.
The disallowance of deductions under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply for purposes of subchapter G of chapter 1 of the Code (relating to corporations used to avoid income tax on shareholders) nor for determining whether the compensation of employee-owners is reasonable. Thus, for example, in determining whether a personal service corporation is subject to the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531, deductions disallowed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section are treated as allowed in computing accumulated taxable income.
(4)
Definition of applicable amount
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of section 280H and the regulations thereunder, the term
applicable amount
means, with respect to a taxable year, any amount that is otherwise deductible by a personal service corporation in such year and includable at any time, directly or indirectly, in the gross income of a taxpayer that during such year is an employee-owner. Thus, an amount includable in the gross income of an employee-owner will be considered an applicable amount even though such employee owns no stock of the corporation on the date the employee includes the amount in income. See
Example 1
in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.
(ii)
Special rule for certain indirect payments.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, amounts are indirectly includable in the gross income of an employee-owner of a personal service corporation that has made a section 444 election (an electing personal service corporation) if the amount is includable in the gross income of—
(A) The spouse (other than a spouse who is legally separated from the partner or shareholder under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance) or
child (under age 14) of such employee-owner, or
(B) A corporation more than 50 percent (measured by fair market value) of which is owned in the aggregate by employee-owners (and individuals related under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section to such employee-owners), of the electing personal service corporation, or
(C) A partnership more than 50 percent of the profits and capital of which is owned by employee-owners (and individuals related under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section to such employee-owners) of the electing personal service corporation, or
(D) A trust more than 50 percent of the beneficial ownership of which is owned in the aggregate by employee-owners (and individuals related under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section to any such employee-owners), of the electing personal service corporation.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), ownership by any person described in this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) shall be treated as ownership by the employee-owners of the electing personal service corporation. Paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section will not apply if the corporation has made a section 444 election to use the same taxable year as that of the electing personal service corporation. Similarly, paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section will not apply if the partnership has made a section 444 election to use the same taxable year as that of the electing personal service corporation. Notwithstanding the general effective date provision of paragraph (f) of this section, this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) is effective for amounts deductible on or after June 1, 1988.
(iii)
Example.
The provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
A is an employee of P, an accrual basis personal service corporation with a taxable year ending September 30. P makes a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987. On October 1, 1987, A owns no stock of P; However, on March 31, 1988, A acquires 10 of the 200 outstanding shares of P stock. During the period October 1, 1987 to March 31, 1988, A earned $40,000 of compensation as an employee of P. During the period April 1, 1988 to September 30 1988, A earned $60,000 of compensation as an employee-owner of P. If paragraph (b) of this section does not apply, P would deduct for its taxable year ended September 30, 1988 the $100,000 earned by A during such year. Based upon these facts, the $100,000 otherwise deductable amount is considered an applicable amount under this section.

# Example 2.
I1 and I2, calendar year individuals, are employees of PSC1, a personal service corporation that has historically used a taxable year ending January 31. I1 and I2 also own all the stock, and are employees, of PSC2, a calendar year personal service corporation. For its taxable years beginning February 1, 1987, 1988, and 1989, PSC1 has a section 444 election in effect to use a January 31 taxable year. During its taxable years beginning February 1, 1986, 1987, and 1988, PSC1 deducted $10,000, $11,000, and $12,000, respectively, that was included in PSC2's gross income. Furthermore, of the $12,000 deducted by PSC1 for its taxable year beginning February 1, 1988, $7,000 was deducted during the period June 1, 1988 to January 31, 1989. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, the $7,000 deducted by PSC1 on or after June 1, 1988, and included in PSC2's gross income is considered an applicable amount for PSC1's taxable year beginning February 1, 1988. Amounts deducted by PSC1 prior to June 1, 1988, are not subject to paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that for its taxable years beginning February 1, 1987, 1988, and 1989, PSC2 has a section 444 election in effect to use a January 31 taxable year. Since both PSC1 and PSC2 have the same taxable year and both have section 444 elections in effect, paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section does not apply to the $7,000 deducted by PSC1 for its taxable year beginning February 1, 1988.
(c)
Minimum distribution requirement
—(1)
Determination of whether requirement satisfied
—(i)
In general.
A personal service corporation meets the minimum distribution requirement of this paragraph (c) for an applicable election year if, during the deferral period of such taxable year, the applicable amounts (determined without regard to paragraph (b)(2) of this section) for all employee-owners in the aggregate equal or exceed the lesser of—
(A) The amount determined under the “preceding year test” (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section), or
(B) The amount determined under the “3-year average test” (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section).
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(1)(i).

# Example.
Q, an accrual-basis personal service corporation, makes a section 444 election to retain a year ending January 31 for its taxable year beginning February 1, 1987. Q has 4 employee-owners, B, C, D, and E. For Q's applicable election year beginning February 1, 1987 and ending January 31, 1988, B earns $6,000 a month plus a $45,000 bonus on January 15, 1988; C earns $5,000 a month plus a $40,000 bonus on January 15, 1988; D and E each earn $4,500 a month plus a $4,000 bonus on January 15, 1988. Q meets the minimum distribution requirement for such applicable election year if the applicable amounts during the deferral period (
i.e.,
$220,000) equal or exceed the amount determined under the preceding year test or the 3-year average test.
(ii)
Employee-owner defined.
For purposes of section 280H and the regulations thereunder, a person is an employee-owner of a corporation for a taxable year if—
(A) On any day of the corporation's taxable year, the person is an employee of the corporation or performs personal services for or on behalf of the corporation, even if the legal form of that person's relationship to the corporation is that of an independent contractor, and
(B) On any day of the corporation's taxable year, the person owns any outstanding stock of the corporation.
(2)
Preceding year test
—(i)
In general.
The amount determined under the preceding year test is the product of—
(A) The applicable amounts during the taxable year preceding the applicable election year (the “preceding taxable year”), divided by the number of months (but not less than one) in the preceding taxable year, multiplied by
(B) The number of months in the deferral period of the applicable election year.
(ii)
Example.
The provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section may be illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
R, a personal service corporation, has historically used a taxable year ending January 31. For its taxable year beginning February 1, 1987, R makes a section 444 election to retain its January 31 taxable year. R is an accrual basis taxpayer and has one employee-owner, F. For R's taxable year ending January 31, 1987, F earns $5,000 a month plus a $40,000 bonus on January 15, 1987. The amount determined under the preceding year test for R's applicable election year beginning February 1, 1987 is $91,667 ($100,000, the applicable amounts during R's taxable year ending January 31, 1987, divided by 12, the number of months in R's taxable year ending January 31, 1987, multiplied by 11, the number of months in R's deferral period for such year).
(3)
3-year average test
—(i)
In general.
The amount determined under the 3-year average test is the applicable percentage multiplied by the adjusted taxable income for the deferral period of the applicable election year.
(ii)
Applicable percentage.
The term
applicable percentage
means the percentage (not in excess of 95 percent) determined by dividing—
(A) The applicable amounts during the 3 taxable years of the corporation (or, if fewer, the taxable years the corporation has been in existence) immediately preceding the applicable election year, by
(B) The adjusted taxable income of such corporation for such 3 taxable years (or, if fewer, the taxable years of existence).
(iii)
Adjusted taxable income
—(A)
In general.
The term
adjusted taxable income
means taxable income determined without regard to applicable amounts.
(B)
Determination of adjusted taxable income for the deferral period of the applicable election year.
Adjusted taxable income for the deferral period of the applicable election year equals the adjusted taxable income that would result if the personal service corporation filed an income tax return for the deferral period of the applicable election year under its normal method of accounting. However, a personal service corporation may make a reasonable estimate of such amount.
(C)
NOL carryovers.
For purposes of determining adjusted taxable income for any period, any NOL carryover shall be reduced by the amount of such carryover that is attributable to the deduction of applicable amounts. The portion of the NOL carryover attributable to the deduction of applicable amounts is the difference between the NOL carryover computed with the deduction of such amounts and the NOL carryover computed without the deduction of such amounts. For purposes of determining the adjusted taxable income for the deferral period, an NOL carryover to the applicable election year, reduced as provided in this paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C), shall be allowed
first against the income of the deferral period.
(D)
Examples.
The provisons of this paragraph (c)(3)(iii) may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
S is a personal service corporation that has historically used a taxable year ending January 31. For its taxable year beginning February 1, 1987, S makes a section 444 election to retain its taxable year ending January 31. S does not satisfy the minimum distribution requirement for its first applicable election year, and the applicable amounts for that year exceed the maximum deductible amount by $54,000. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $54,000 excess is carried over to S's taxable year beginning February 1, 1988. Furthermore, if S continues its section 444 election for its taxable year beginning February 1, 1988, and desires to use the 3-year average test provided in this paragraph for such year, pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section the $54,000 will not be allowed to reduce adjusted taxable income for such year. See also section 280H(e) regarding the disallowance of net operating loss carrybacks to (or from) any taxable year of a corporation personal service election under section 444 applies.

# Example 2.
T, a personal service corporation with a section 444 election in effect, is determining whether it satisfies the 3-year average test for its second applicable election year. T had a net operating loss (NOL) for its first applicable election year of $45,000. The NOL resulted from $150,000 of gross income less the sum of $96,000 of salary, $45,000 of other expenses, and $54,000 of deductible applicable amounts. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, the entire amount of the $45,000 NOL is attributable to applicable amounts since the applicable amounts deducted in arriving at the NOL (
i.e.,
$54,000) were greater than the NOL (
i.e.,
$45,000). Thus, for purposes of computing the adjusted taxable income for the deferral period of T's second applicable election year, the NOL carryover to that year is $0 ($45,000 NOL less $45,000 amount of NOL attributable to applicable amounts).
(d)
Maximum deductible amount
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the term
maximum deductible amount
means the sum of—
(i) The applicable amounts during the deferral period of the applicable election year, plus
(ii) An amount equal to the product of—
(A) The amount determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section divided by the number of months in the deferral period of the applicable election year, multiplied by
(B) The number of months in the nondeferral period of the applicable election year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term
nondeferral period
means the portion of the applicable election year that occurs after the portion of such year constituting the deferral period.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following example.

# Example.
U, an accrual basis personal service corporation with a taxable year ending January 31, makes a section 444 election to retain a year ending January 31 for its taxable year beginning February 1, 1987. For its applicable election year beginning February 1, 1987, U does not satisfy the minimum distribution requirement in paragraph (c) of this section. Furthermore, U has 3 employee-owners, G, H, and I. G and H have been employee-owners of U for 10 years. Although I has been an employee of U for 4 years, I did not become an employee-owner until December 1, 1987, when I acquired 5 of the 20 outstanding shares of U stock. For U's applicable election year beginning February 1, 1987, G earns $5,000 a month plus a $40,000 bonus on January 15, 1988, and H and I each earn $4,000 a month plus a $32,000 bonus on January 15, 1988. Thus, the total of the applicable amounts during the deferral period of the applicable election year beginning February 1, 1987 is $143,000. Based on these facts, U's deduction for applicable amounts is limited to $156,000, determined as follows—$143,000 (applicable amounts during the deferral period) plus $13,000 (applicable amounts during the deferral period, divided by the number of months in the deferral period, multiplied by the number of months in the nondeferral period).
(e)
Special rules and definition
—(1)
Newly organized personal service corporations.
A personal service corporation is deemed to satisfy the preceding year test and the 3-year average test for the first year of the corporation's existence.
(2)
Existing corporations that become personal service corporations.
If an existing corporation becomes a personal service corporation and makes a section 444 election, the determination of whether the corporation satisfies the preceding year test and the 3-year average test is made by treating the corporation as though it were a personal service corporation for each of the 3
years preceding the applicable election year.
(3)
Disallowance of NOL carryback.
No net operating loss carryback shall be allowed to (or from) any applicable election year of a personal service corporation.
(4)
Deferral period.
For purposes of section 280H and the regulations thereunder, the term
deferral period
has the same meaning as under § 1.444-1T(b)(4).
(5)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
V is a personal service corporation with a taxable year ending September 30. V makes a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987, and incurs a net operating loss (NOL) for such year. Because an NOL is not allowed to be carried back from an applicable election year, V may not carry back the NOL from its first applicable election year to reduce its 1985, 1986, or 1987 taxable income.

# Example 2.
W, a personal service corporation, commences operations on July 1, 1990. Furthermore, for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1990, W makes a section 444 election to use a year ending September 30. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, W satisfies the preceding year test and the 3-year average test for its first year in existence. Thus, W may deduct, without limitation under this section, any applicable amounts for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1990.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2.
For its taxable year beginning October 1, 1990, W incurs an NOL and is not a personal service corporation. Furthermore, W desires to carry back the NOL to its preceding taxable year (a year that was an applicable election year). Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, W may not carry back an NOL “to” its taxable year beginning July 1, and ending September 30, 1990, because such year was an applicable election year.
(f)
Effective date.
The provisions of this section are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.
[T.D. 8205, 53 FR 19711, May 27, 1988]

# Taxable Years Beginning Prior to January 1, 1986
§ 1.274-5A
Substantiation requirements.
(a)
In general.
No deduction shall be allowed for any expenditure with respect to:
(1) Traveling away from home (including meals and lodging) deductible under section 162 or 212,
(2) Any activity which is of a type generally considered to constitute entertainment, amusement, or recreation, or with respect to a facility used in connection with such an activity, including the items specified in section 274(e), or
(3) Gifts defined in section 274, unless the taxpayer substantiates such expenditure as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. This limitation supersedes with respect to any such expenditure the doctrine of Cohan v. Commissioner (C.C.A. 2d 1930) 39 F. 2d 540. The decision held that, where the evidence indicated a taxpayer incurred deductible travel or entertainment expense but the exact amount could not be determined, the court should make a close approximation and not disallow the deduction entirely. Section 274(d) contemplates that no deduction shall be allowed a taxpayer for such expenditures on the basis of such approximations or unsupported testimony of the taxpayer. For purposes of this section, the term
entertainment
means entertainment, amusement, or recreation, and use of a facility therefore; and the term
expenditure
includes expenses and items (including items such as losses and depreciation).
(b)
Elements of an expenditure
—(1)
In general.
Section 274(d) and this section contemplate that no deduction shall be allowed for any expenditure for travel, entertainment, or a gift unless the taxpayer substantiates the following elements for each such expenditure:

Occupation or other information relating to the person or persons entertained, including name, title, or other designation, sufficient to establish business relationship to the taxpayer.
(4)

(i)
Time.

Rules for substantiation
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer must substantiate each element of an expenditure (described in paragraph (b) of this section) by adequate records or by sufficient evidence corroborating his own statement except as otherwise provided in this section. Section 274(d) contemplates that a taxpayer will maintain and produce such substantiation as will constitute clear proof of an expenditure for travel, entertainment, or gifts referred to in section 274. A record of the elements of an expenditure made at or near the time of the expenditure, supported by sufficient documentary evidence, has a high degree of credibility not present with respect to a statement prepared subsequent thereto when generally there is a lack of accurate recall. Thus, the corroborative evidence required to support a statement not made at or near the time of the expenditure must have a high degree of probative value to elevate such statement and evidence to the level of credibility reflected by a record made at or near the time of the expenditure supported by sufficient documentary
evidence. The substantiation requirements of section 274(d) are designed to encourage taxpayers to maintain the records, together with documentary evidence, as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. To obtain a deduction for an expenditure for travel, entertainment, or gifts, a taxpayer must substantiate, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, each element of such an expenditure.
(2)
Substantiation by adequate records
—(i)
In general.
To meet the “adequate records” requirements of section 274(d), a taxpayer shall maintain an account book, diary, statement of expense or similar record (as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) and documentary evidence (as provided in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) which, in combination, are sufficient to establish each element of an expenditure specified in paragraph (b) of this section. It is not necessary to record information in an account book, diary, statement of expense or similar record which duplicates information reflected on a receipt so long as such account book and receipt complement each other in an orderly manner.
(ii)
Account book, diary, etc.
An account book, diary, statement of expense or similar record must be prepared or maintained in such manner that each recording of an element of an expenditure is made at or near the time of the expenditure.
(
a
)
Made at or near the time of the expenditure.
For purposes of this section, the phrase
made at or near the time of the expenditure
means the elements of an expenditure are recorded at a time when, in relation to the making of an expenditure, the taxpayer has full present knowledge of each element of the expenditure, such as the amount, time, place and business purpose of the expenditure and business relationship to the taxpayer of any person entertained. An expense account statement which is a transcription of an account book, diary, or similar record prepared or maintained in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision shall be considered a record prepared or maintained in the manner prescribed in the preceding sentence if such expense account statement is submitted by an employee to his employer or by an independent contractor to his client or customer in the regular course of good business practice.
(
b
)
Substantiation of business purpose.
In order to constitute an adequate record of business purpose within the meaning of section 274(d) and this subparagraph, a written statement of business purpose generally is required. However, the degree of substantiation necessary to establish business purpose will vary depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Where the business purpose of an expenditure is evident from the surrounding facts and circumstances, a written explanation of such business purpose will not be required. For example, in the case of a salesman calling on customers on an established sales route, a written explanation of the business purpose of such travel ordinarily will not be required. Similarly, in the case of a business meal described in section 274(e)(1), if the business purpose of such meal is evident from the business relationship to the taxpayer of the persons entertained and other surrounding circumstances, a written explanation of such business purpose will not be required.
(
c
)
Confidential information.
If any information relating to the elements of an expenditure, such as place, business purpose or business relationship, is of a confidential nature, such information need not be set forth in the account book, diary, statement of expense or similar record, provided such information is recorded at or near the time of the expenditure and is elsewhere available to the district director to substantiate such element of the expenditure.
(iii)
Documentary evidence.
Documentary evidence, such as receipts, paid bills, or similar evidence sufficient to support an expenditure shall be required for:
(
a
) Any expenditure for lodging while traveling away from home, and
(
b
) Any other expenditure of $25 or more, except, for transportation charges, documentary evidence will not be required if not readily available.
Provided, however, that the Commissioner, in his discretion, may prescribe rules waiving such requirements in circumstances where he determines it is
impracticable for such documentary evidence to be required. Ordinarily, documentary evidence will be considered adequate to support an expenditure if it includes sufficient information to establish the amount, date, place, and the essential character of the expenditure. For example, a hotel receipt is sufficient to support expenditures for business travel if it contains the following: name, location, date, and separate amounts for charges such as for lodging, meals, and telephone. Similarly, a restaurant receipt is sufficient to support an expenditure for a business meal if it contains the following: name and location of the restaurant, the date and amount of the expenditure, and, if a charge is made for an item other than meals and beverages, an indication that such is the case. A document may be indicative of only one (or part of one) element of an expenditure. Thus, a cancelled check, together with a bill from the payee, ordinarily would establish the element of cost. In contrast, a cancelled check drawn payable to a named payee would not by itself support a business expenditure without other evidence showing that the check was used for a certain business purpose.
(iv)
Retention of documentary evidence.
The Commissioner may, in his discretion, prescribe rules under which an employer may dispose of documentary evidence submitted to him by employees who are required to, and do, make an adequate accounting to the employer (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4) of this section) if the employer maintains adequate accounting procedures with respect to such employees (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(5) of this section).
(v)
Substantial compliance.
If a taxpayer has not fully substantiated a particular element of an expenditure, but the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the district director that he has substantially complied with the
adequate records
requirements of this subparagraph with respect to the expenditure, the taxpayer may be permitted to establish such element by evidence which the district director shall deem adequate.
(3)
Substantiation by other sufficient evidence.
If a taxpayer fails to establish to the satisfaction of the district director that he has substantially complied with the “adequate records” requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph with respect to an element of an expenditure, then, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the taxpayer must establish such element:
(i) By his own statement, whether written or oral, containing specific information in detail as to such element; and
(ii) By other corroborative evidence sufficient to establish such element.
If such element is the description of a gift, or the cost, time, place, or date of an expenditure, the corroborative evidence shall be direct evidence, such as a statement in writing or the oral testimony of persons entertained or other witness setting forth detailed information about such element, or the documentary evidence described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. If such element is either the business relationship to the taxpayer of persons entertained or the business purpose of an expenditure, the corroborative evidence may be circumstantial evidence.
(4)
Substantiation in exceptional circumstances.
If a taxpayer establishes that, by reason of the inherent nature of the situation in which an expenditure was made:
(i) He was unable to obtain evidence with respect to an element of the expenditure which conforms fully to the “adequate records” requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph,
(ii) He is unable to obtain evidence with respect to such element which conforms fully to the “other sufficient evidence” requirements of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, and
(iii) He has presented other evidence, with respect to such element, which possesses the highest degree of probative value possible under the circumstances, such other evidence shall be considered to satisfy the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and this paragraph.
(5)
Loss of records due to circumstances beyond control of taxpayer.
Where the taxpayer establishes that the failure to produce adequate records is due to the loss of such records through circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control, such as destruction by fire, flood,
earthquake, or other casualty, the taxpayer shall have a right to substantiate a deduction by reasonable reconstruction of his expenditures.
(6)
Special rules
—(i)
Separate expenditure
—(
a
)
In general.
For the purposes of this section, each separate payment by the taxpayer shall ordinarily be considered to constitute a separate expenditure. However, concurrent or repetitious expenses of a similar nature occurring during the course of a single event shall be considered a single expenditure. To illustrate the above rules, where a taxpayer entertains a business guest at dinner and thereafter at the theater, the payment for dinner shall be considered to constitute one expenditure and the payment for the tickets for the theater shall be considered to constitute a separate expenditure. Similarly, if during a day of business travel a taxpayer makes separate payments for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, he shall be considered to have made three separate expenditures. However, if during entertainment at a cocktail lounge the taxpayer pays separately for each serving of refreshments, the total amount expended for the refreshments will be treated as a single expenditure. A tip may be treated as a separate expenditure.
(
b
)
Aggregation.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the account book, diary, statement of expense, or similar record required by subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph shall be maintained with respect to each separate expenditure and not with respect to aggregate amounts for two or more expenditures. Thus, each expenditure for such items as lodging and air or rail travel shall be recorded as a separate item and not aggregated. However, at the option of the taxpayer, amounts expended for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, may be aggregated. A tip or gratuity which is related to an underlying expense may be aggregated with such expense. For other provisions permitting recording of aggregate amounts in an account book, diary, statement of expense or similar record see paragraph (b)(2)(i) and (b)(3) of this section (relating to incidental costs of travel and entertainment).
(ii)
Allocation of expenditure.
For purposes of this section, if a taxpayer has established the amount of an expenditure, but is unable to establish the portion of such amount which is attributable to each person participating in the event giving rise to the expenditure, such amount shall ordinarily be allocated to each participant on a pro rata basis, if such determination is material. Accordingly, the total number of persons for whom a travel or entertainment expenditure is incurred must be established in order to compute the portion of the expenditure allocable to each such person.
(iii)
Primary use of a facility.
Section 274(a) (1)(B) and (2)(C) denies a deduction for any expenditure paid or incurred before January 1, 1979, with respect to a facility, or paid or incurred at any time with respect to a club, used in connection with an entertainment activity unless the taxpayer establishes that the facility (including a club) was used primarily for the furtherance of his trade or business. A determination whether a facility before January 1, 1979, or a club at any time was used primarily for the futherance of the taxpayer's trade or business will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. In order to establish that a facility was used primarily for the furtherance of his trade or business, the taxpayer shall maintain records of the use of the facility, the cost of using the facility, mileage or its equivalent (if appropriate), and such other information as shall tend to establish such primary use. Such records of use shall contain:
(
a
) For each use of the facility claimed to be in furtherance of the taxpayer's trade or business, the elements of an expenditure specified in paragraph (b) of this section, and
(
b
) For each use of the facility not in furtherance of the taxpayer's trade or business, an appropriate description of such use, including cost, date, number of persons entertained, nature of entertainment and, if applicable, information such as mileage or its equivalent. A notation such as “personal use” or “family use” would, in the case of such use, be sufficient to describe the nature of entertainment.
If a taxpayer fails to maintain adequate records concerning a facility which is likely to serve the personal
purposes of the taxpayer, it shall be presumed that the use of such facility was primarily personal.
(iv)
Additional information.
In a case where it is necessary to obtain additional information, either:
(
a
) To clarify information contained in records, statements, testimony, or documentary evidence submitted by a taxpayer under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, or
(
b
) To establish the reliability or accuracy of such records, statements, testimony, or documentary evidence, the district director may, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, obtain such additional information as he determines necessary to properly implement the provisions of section 274 and the regulations thereunder by personal interview or otherwise.
(7)
Specific exceptions.
Except as otherwise prescribed by the Commissioner, substantiation otherwise required by this paragraph is not required for:
(i) Expenses described in section 274 (e)(2) relating to food and beverages for employees, section 274(e)(3) relating to expenses treated as compensation, section 274(e)(8) relating to items available to the public, and section 274(e)(9) relating to entertainment sold to customers, and
(ii) Expenses described in section 274(e)(5) relating to recreational, etc., expenses for employees, except that a taxpayer shall keep such records or other evidence as shall establish that such expenses were for activities (or facilities used in connection therewith) primarily for the benefit of employees other than employees who are officers, shareholders or other owners (as defined in section 274(e)(5)), or highly compensated employees.
(d)
Disclosure on returns.
The Commissioner may, in his discretion, prescribe rules under which any taxpayer claiming a deduction for entertainment, gifts, or travel or any other person receiving advances, reimbursements, or allowances for such items, shall make disclosure on his tax return with respect to such items. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.
(e)
Reporting and substantiation of expenses of certain employees for travel, entertainment, and gifts
—(1)
In general.
The purpose of this paragraph is to provide rules for reporting and substantiation of certain expenses paid or incurred by taxpayers in connection with the performance of services as employees. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
business expenses
means ordinary and necessary expenses for travel, entertainment, or gifts which are deductible under section 162, and the regulations thereunder, to the extent not disallowed by section 274(c). Thus, the term
business expenses
does not include personal, living or family expenses disallowed by section 262 or travel expenses disallowed by section 274(c), and advances, reimbursements, or allowances for such expenditures must be reported as income by the employee.
(2)
Reporting of expenses for which the employee is required to make an adequate accounting to his employer
—(i)
Reimbursements equal to expenses.
For purposes of computing tax liability, an employee need not report on his tax return business expenses for travel, transportation, entertainment, gifts, and similar purposes, paid or incurred by him solely for the benefit of his employer for which he is required to, and does, make an adequate accounting to his employer (as defined in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) and which are charged directly or indirectly to the employer (for example, through credit cards) or for which the employee is paid through advances, reimbursements, or otherwise, provided that the total amount of such advances, reimbursements, and charges is equal to such expenses.
(ii)
Reimbursements in excess of expenses.
In case the total of the amounts charged directly or indirectly to the employer or received from the employer as advances, reimbursements, or otherwise, exceeds the business expenses paid or incurred by the employee and the employee is required to, and does, make an adequate accounting to his employer for such expenses, the employee must include such excess (including amounts received for expenditures not deductible by him) in income.
(iii)
Expense in excess of reimbursements.
If an employee incurs deductible
business expenses on behalf of his employer which exceed the total of the amounts charged directly or indirectly to the employer and received from the employer as advances, reimbursements, or otherwise, and the employee wishes to claim a deduction for such excess, he must:
(
a
) Submit a statement as part of his tax return showing all of the information required by subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, and,
(
b
) Maintain such records and supporting evidence as will substantiate each element of an expenditure (described in paragraph (b) of this section) in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(3)
Reporting of expenses for which the employee is not required to make an adequate accounting to his employer.
If the employee is not required to make an adequate accounting to his employer for his business expenses or, though required, fails to make an adequate accounting for such expenses, he must submit, as a part of his tax return, a statement showing the following information:
(i) The total of all amounts received as advances or reimbursements from his employer, including amounts charged directly or indirectly to the employer through credit cards or otherwise; and
(ii) The nature of his occupation, the number of days away from home on business, and the total amount of business expenses paid or incurred by him (including those charged directly or indirectly to the employer through credit cards or otherwise) broken down into such categories as transportation, meals and lodging while away from home overnight, entertainment, gifts, and other business expenses.
In addition, he must maintain such records and supporting evidence as will substantiate each element of an expenditure (described in paragraph (b) of this section) in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(4)
Definition of an “adequate accounting” to the employer.
For purposes of this paragraph an adequate accounting means the submission to the employer of an account book, diary, statement of expense, or similar record maintained by the employee in which the information as to each element of an expenditure (described in paragraph (b) of this section) is recorded at or near the time of the expenditure, together with supporting documentary evidence, in a manner which conforms to all the “adequate records” requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. An adequate accounting requires that the employee account for all amounts received from his employer during the taxable year as advances, reimbursements, or allowances (including those charged directly or indirectly to the employer through credit cards or otherwise) for travel, entertainment, and gifts. The methods of substantiation allowed under paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5) of this section also will be considered to be an adequate accounting if the employer accepts an employee's substantiation and establishes that such substantiation meets the requirements of such paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5). For purposes of an adequate accounting the method of substantiation allowed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section will not be permitted.
(5)
Substantiation of expenditures by certain employees.
An employee who makes an adequate accounting to his employer within the meaning of this paragraph will not again be required to substantiate such expense account information except in the following cases:
(i) An employee whose business expenses exceed the total of amounts charged to his employer and amounts received through advances, reimbursements or otherwise and who claims a deduction on his return for such excess;
(ii) An employee who is related to his employer within the meaning of section 267(b) but for this purpose the percentage referred to in section 267(b)(2) shall be 10 percent; and
(iii) Employees in cases where it is determined that the accounting procedures used by the employer for the reporting and substantiation of expenses by such employees are not adequate, or where it cannot be determined that such procedures are adequate. The district director will determine whether the employer's accounting procedures are adequate by considering the facts and circumstances of each case, including the use of proper internal controls.
For example, an employer should require that an expense account must be verified and approved by a responsible person other than the person incurring such expenses. Accounting procedures will be considered inadequate to the extent that the employer does not require an adequate accounting from his employees as defined in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, or does not maintain such substantiation. To the extent an employer fails to maintain adequate accounting procedures he will thereby obligate his employees to separately substantiate their expense account information.
(f)
Substantiation by reimbursement arrangements or per diem, mileage, and other traveling allowances.
The Commissioner may, in his discretion, prescribe rules under which:
(1) Reimbursement arrangements covering ordinary and necessary expenses of traveling away from home (exclusive of transportation expenses to and from destination),
(2) Per diem allowances providing for ordinary and necessary expenses of traveling away from home (exclusive of transportation costs to and from destination), and
(3) Mileage allowances providing for ordinary and necessary expenses of transportation while traveling away from home, will, if in accordance with reasonable business practice, be regarded as equivalent to substantiation by adequate records or other sufficient evidence for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section of the amount of such traveling expenses and as satisfying, with respect to the amount of such traveling expenses, the requirements of an adequate accounting to the employer for purposes of paragraph (e)(4) of this section. If the total travel allowance received exceeds the deductible traveling expenses paid or incurred by the employee, such excess must be reported as income on the employee's return. See paragraph (h) of this section relating to the substantiation of meal expenses while traveling.
(g)
Reporting and substantiation of certain reimbursements of persons other than employees
—(1)
In general.
The purpose of this paragraph is to provide rules for the reporting and substantiation of certain expenses for travel, entertainment, and gifts paid or incurred by one person (hereinafter termed “independent contractor”) in connection with services performed for another person other than an employer (hereinafter termed “client or customer”) under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement with such client or customer. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
business expenses
means ordinary and necessary expenses for travel, entertainment, or gifts which are deductible under section 162, and the regulations thereunder, to the extent not disallowed by section 274(c). Thus, the term
business expenses
does not include personal, living or family expenses disallowed by section 262 or travel expenses disallowed by section 274(c), and reimbursements for such expenditures must be reported as income by the independent contractor. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
reimbursements
means advances, allowances, or reimbursements received by an independent contractor for travel, entertainment, or gifts, in connection with the performance by him of services for his client or customer, under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement with his client or customer, and includes amounts charged directly or indirectly to the client or customer through credit card systems or otherwise. See paragraph (h) of this section relating to the substantiation of meal expenses while traveling.
(2)
Substantiation by independent contractors.
An independent contractor shall substantiate, with respect to his reimbursements, each element of an expenditure (described in paragraph (b) of this section) in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section; and, to the extent he does not so substantiate, he shall include such reimbursements in income. An independent contractor shall so substantiate a reimbursement for entertainment regardless of whether he accounts (within the meaning of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) for such entertainment.
(3)
Accounting to a client or customer under section 274(e)(4)(B).
Section 274(e)(4)(B) provides that section 274(a) (relating to disallowance of expenses for entertainment) shall not apply to
expenditures for entertainment for which an independent contractor has been reimbursed if the independent contractor accounts to his client or customer to the extent provided by section 274(d). For purposes of section 274(e)(4)(B), an independent contractor shall be considered to account to his client or customer for an expense paid or incurred under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement with his client or customer if, with respect to such expense for entertainment, he submits to his client or customer adequate records or other sufficient evidence conforming to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
(4)
Substantiation by client or customer.
A client or customer shall not be required to substantiate, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, reimbursements to an independent contractor for travel and gifts, or for entertainment unless the independent contractor has accounted to him (within the meaning of section 274(e)(4)(B) and subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) for such entertainment. If an independent contractor has so accounted to a client or customer for entertainment, the client or customer shall substantiate each element of the expenditure (as described in paragraph (b) of this section) in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
(h)
Authority for an optional method of computing meal expenses while traveling.
The Commissioner may establish a method under which a taxpayer may elect to use a specified amount or amounts for meals while traveling in lieu of substantiating the actual cost of meals. The taxpayer would not be relieved of substantiating the actual cost of other travel expenses as well as the time, place, and business purpose of the travel. See paragraph (b)(2) and (c) of this section.
(i)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
Section 274(d) and this section apply with respect to taxable years ending after December 31, 1962, but only with respect to period after that date.
(2)
Certain meal expenses.
Paragraph (h) of this section is effective for expenses paid or incurred after December 31, 1982.

# Terminal Railroad Corporations and Their Shareholders
§ 1.281-1
In general.
Section 281 provides special rules for the computation of the taxable incomes of a terminal railroad corporation and its shareholders when the terminal railroad corporation, as a result of taking related terminal income into account, reduces a charge which was made or which would be made for related terminal services furnished to a railroad corporation. Section 281 and paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 1.281-2 provide that the “reduced amount” described in paragraph (c) of § 1.281-2 is not includable in gross income of the terminal railroad corporation, is not treated as a dividend or other distribution to its railroad shareholders, and is not treated as an amount paid -or incurred by the railroad shareholders to the terminal railroad corporation. Section 281 and paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.281-2 provide that no deduction otherwise allowable to a terminal railroad corporation shall be disallowed as a result of the “reduced amount” described in paragraph (c) of § 1.281-2. Section 1.281-3 defines the terms
terminal railroad corporation, related terminal income, related terminal services, agreement,
and
railroad corporation.
Section 1.281-4 describes the effective dates and special rules for application of section 281 to taxable years ending before October 23, 1962.
[T.D. 7356, 40 FR 23732, June 2, 1975]
§ 1.281-2
Effect of section 281 upon the computation of taxable income.
(a)
Computation of taxable income of terminal railroad corporations
—(1)
Income not considered received or accrued.
A terminal railroad corporation (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.281-3) shall not be considered to have received or accrued the “reduced amount” described in paragraph (c) of this section
in the computation of its taxable income. Thus, income is not to be considered accrued or actually or constructively received by a terminal railroad corporation where, in the manner described in paragraph (c) of this section, (i) a charge which would be made to any railroad corporation for related terminal services is not made, or (ii) a portion of any liability payable by any railroad corporation with respect to related terminal services is discharged.
(2)
Deduction not disallowed.
In the computation of the taxable income of a terminal railroad corporation, a deduction relating to a “reduced amount”, described in paragraph (c) of this section, which is otherwise allowable to it under chapter 1 of the Code (without regard to sec. 277) shall not be disallowed by reason of section 281. Thus, deductions for expenses attributable to services rendered to a shareholder are not to be disallowed to a terminal railroad corporation merely because, in the manner described in paragraph (c) of this section, (i) a charge which would be made to any railroad corporation for related terminal services is not made, or (ii) a portion of any liability payable by any railroad corporation with respect to related terminal services is discharged. To the extent that section 281 applies to a deduction relating to a “reduced amount”, such deduction shall not be disallowed under section 277.
(b)
Computation of taxable income of shareholders
—(1)
Income not considered received or accrued.
A shareholder of a terminal railroad corporation shall not be considered to have received or accrued any “reduced amount” (described in paragraph (c) of this section) in the computation of the shareholder's taxable income. Thus a dividend is not to be considered actually or constructively received by a shareholder of a terminal railroad corporation merely because, in the manner described in paragraph (c) of this section, (i) a charge which would be made to the shareholder or any other railroad corporation for related terminal services is not made, or (ii) a portion of any liability payable by it or any other railroad corporation with respect to related terminal services is discharged.
(2)
Expenses not considered paid or incurred.
In the computation of the taxable income of a shareholder of a terminal railroad corporation, the shareholder shall not be considered to have paid or incurred any “reduced amount” (described in paragraph (c) of this section). Thus, a shareholder of the terminal railroad corporation may not deduct as an expense for related terminal services (as defined in paragraph (c) of § 1.281-3) an amount in excess of the net cost to it of such services.
(c)
Amounts to which section 281 applies
—(1)
Reduced amount.
For purposes of this section, the term
reduced amount
means, subject to the limitation of paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the amount by which:
(i) A charge which would be made by a terminal railroad corporation for its taxable year for related terminal services provided to a railroad corporation; or
(ii) A liability of a railroad corporation, resulting from a charge made by a terminal railroad corporation for its taxable year, with respect to related terminal services provided by the terminal railroad corporation, is reduced by reason of the terminal railroad corporation's taking into account, pursuant to an agreement (as defined in paragraph (d) of § 1.281-3), related terminal income (as defined in paragraph (b) of § 1.281-3) received or accrued (without regard to section 281) during such taxable year.
(2)
Charge which would be made.
For purposes of this section, a “charge which would be made” by a terminal railroad corporation is the amount that would be charged to any railroad corporation for related terminal services provided if the terminal railroad corporation made the charge without taking related terminal income into account.
(3)
Reduction resulting from related terminal income.
For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this section, a charge or a liability is reduced by taking related terminal income into account to the extent that:
(i) Related terminal income is received or accrued (without regard to section 281) by the terminal railroad corporation for its taxable year in
which the charge or liability is reduced; and
(ii) The charge or liability in question would have been larger than it is had such income not been received or accrued (without regard to section 281).
The reduction must be made (directly or indirectly) on the books of the terminal railroad corporation, and in fact, for the same taxable year for which the charge would be made or for which the liability is incurred. The reduction of the charge or liability must be taken into account by the terminal railroad corporation in ascertaining the income, profit, or loss for such taxable year for the purpose of reports to shareholders and the Interstate Commerce Commission, and for credit purposes.
(4)
Limitation.
To the extent that a reduced amount (as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section but without regard to the limitation under this subparagraph) would operate either to create or to increase a net operating loss for the terminal railroad corporation, this section shall not apply. Therefore, if a portion of a liability is discharged (in the manner described in this paragraph) and the discharged portion of the liability exceeds an amount equal to the terminal railroad corporation's gross income minus the deductions allowed by chapter 1 of the Code (computed with regard to the modifications specified in section 172(d) but without regard to section 281 and this section), then section 281 and this section shall not apply to such excess. The limitation described in this subparagraph shall apply only to taxable years of terminal railroad corporations ending after October 23, 1962.
(d)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples. In these examples, references to “before the application of section 281”, “after the application of section 281”, “taxable income”, and “allowable deductions” take no account of section 277, which may apply to deductions to which section 281 does not apply.

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
The T Company is a terminal railroad corporation which charges its three equal shareholders, the X, Y, and Z railroad corporations, a rental calculated monthly on a wheelage or user basis for the use of its services and facilities. The T Company and each of its shareholders report income on the calendar year basis. A written lease agreement to which all of the shareholders were parties was entered into in 1947. The agreement provides that at the end of each year the liabilities of each of the shareholders resulting from charges for rental obligations with respect to related terminal services shall be reduced by the shareholder's one-third share of the net income from each source of revenue that produced income (computed before reduction for Federal income taxes). For the calendar year 1973, the T Company's charges to its shareholders include the following charges for related terminal services: $35,000 to the X Company, $25,000 to the Y Company, and $20,000 to the Z Company. Thus, prior to reduction, total shareholder liabilities to the T Company for related terminal services are $80,000 at the end of 1973. The T Company's net income from all sources (before reduction of liabilities pursuant to the 1947 agreement and before reduction for Federal income taxes) and its taxable income, before the application of section 281, for 1973 are $36,000 determined as follows:

The liability of each shareholder is, pursuant to the agreement, discharged in part by the T Company crediting $12,000 against the rental due from each shareholder for a total discharge of liabilities of $36,000 (the net income from all sources), resulting in net shareholder liabilities owing to the T Company at the end of 1973 of $44,000 ($80,000 less $36,000): $23,000 from the X Company, $13,000 from the Y Company, and $8,000 from the Z Company.
(ii)
Effect on terminal railroad corporation.
The reduced amount to which this section applies is $24,000 (related terminal income of $9,000 from nonshareholders and $15,000 from shareholders). Thus, to the extent of $24,000, the T Company is not considered to have received or accrued income from the discharged liabilities of $36,000. Similarly, to the extent of the same $24,000, the T Company is not disallowed deductions for expenses merely by reason of the discharge. The T Company's taxable income for 1973 after application of section 281 is $12,000, computed as follows:
Gross income ($156,000 less $24,000)
$132,000
Less allowable deductions
120,000
Taxable income
12,000
(iii)
Effect on shareholders
—The reduced amount of $24,000 shall not be deemed to constitute either a dividend to the shareholders of the T Company or an expense paid or incurred by them. Thus, under the facts described, neither the X Company, the Y Company, nor the Z Company shall be considered to have received or accrued a dividend of $8,000, or to have paid or incurred an expense of $8,000. Assuming the X Company's taxable income for 1973 before the application of section 281 would have been $43,200, computed in the following manner, its taxable income for 1973 after the application of section 281 is $50,000, determined as follows:
Before the application of sec. 281
After the application of sec. 281

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the charges to each of the shareholders for related terminal services for 1973 were as follows: $35,000 to the X Company, $40,000 to the Y Company, and $5,000 to the Z Company. Assume further that the Z Company, prior to the reduction in liabilities at the end of 1973, owed the T Company an additional $4,000 resulting from charges for 1972 for related terminal services and $6,000 resulting from the purchase of equipment. Since only $21,000 (X Company $8,000, Y Company $8,000, Z Company $5,000) of the liabilities which were discharged resulted from charges made for 1973 for related terminal services, the reduced amount to which this section applies is $21,000 (instead of $24,000 as in
Example 1
). Thus, the T Company's taxable income for 1973 would be $15,000 ($36,000 less $21,000 reduced amount) and the amount which shall be considered not to have been received or accrued as a dividend nor paid or incurred as an expense of each shareholder is $8,000 for the X Company, $8,000 for the Y Company, and $5,000 for the Z Company.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that the allowable deductions with respect to nonrelated terminal activities were $39,000 instead of $18,000. The T Company's net income from all sources (before reduction for Federal income taxes) and its taxable income, before the application of section 281, is therefore $15,000, determined as follows:
Source
Gross income
Allowable deductions
Income (or loss)
Related terminal income
$126,000
$102,000
$24,000
Nonrelated terminal income
30,000
39,000
(9,000)
Total
156,000
141,000
15,000
The liability of each shareholder is nevertheless discharged in part, pursuant to the agreement, by the T Company crediting $8,000 against the rental due from each shareholder for a total discharge of liabilities of $24,000 (the net income from each source of revenue that produced income). Assume further that none of the modifications specified in section 172(d) apply. If the limitation under paragraph (c)(4) of this section were not applied, the reduced amount for the purposes of this section would be $24,000, and the operation of this section would result in a net operating loss of $9,000, since the allowable deductions of $141,000 would exceed the gross income of $132,000 ($156,000 less discharged liabilities of $24,000) by that amount. Because of the limitation under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, however, $9,000 is not included in the reduced amount to which this section applies. Accordingly, the reduced amount is $15,000 (instead of $24,000 as in
Example 1
). Thus, the T Company's taxable income for 1973 would be zero ($15,000 less the $15,000 reduced amount), and the amount which each shareholder shall be considered not to have received or accrued as a dividend nor paid or incurred as an expense is $5,000.

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that under the agreement income from the terminal parking lot would not reduce the shareholders' liabilities. Assume further that such income amounted to $3,000 of the total related terminal income of $24,000 for the taxable year 1973. The liability of each shareholder therefore is discharged by crediting $11,000 against its rental due for a total discharge of liabilities of $33,000. The reduced amount to which this section applies is $21,000 ($24,000 less $3,000) since only to the extent of $21,000 would there have been no such reduction under the agreement if there were no related terminal income.

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that, pursuant to the agreement, the A Company, a nonshareholder railroad corporation, is to have its liabilities resulting from charges for rental obligations reduced equally with each of the shareholders. Assume further that the T Company's charges to the A Company for the calendar year 1973 included $15,000 for related terminal services and that the liability of each shareholder and the A Company is discharged in part pursuant to the agreement by the T Company crediting $9,000 against the rental due from each. The reduced amount to which this section applies is $24,000. Thus, the T Company's taxable income for 1973 is $12,000, and each shareholder shall not be considered to have received or accrued as a dividend nor paid or incurred as an expense $6,000 ($24,000/ $36,000 × $9,000) merely because of the discharge of its own liability. Similarly, each shareholder shall not be considered to have received or accrued as a dividend nor paid or incurred as an expense $2,000 (1/3 × ($24,000/$36,000 × $9,000)) merely because of the discharge of the liability of the A Company. Section 281 does not apply to the determination of the tax consequences of the transaction to the A Company. Similarly, the section does not apply to the determination of the tax consequences to the shareholders resulting from that portion of the discharge of the liability of the A Company which is attributable to the application of income which is not related terminal income ($3,000). Hence, such consequences shall be determined under the sections of the Internal Revenue Code which govern in the absence of section 281.

# Example 6.
(i)
Facts.
The TR Company is a terminal railroad corporation with three equal shareholders, the M, N, and O Railroad Corporations. The TR Company and each of its shareholders report income on the calendar year basis. Pursuant to a written agreement entered into in 1947 to which all shareholders were parties, the TR Company makes one annual charge to each of the three shareholders at the end of each year for the difference between the cost of operations, allocated on a wheelage or user basis for the use of its services and facilities provided to the shareholder during the year, and one-third of its net income from all other sources (computed before reduction for Federal income taxes). The TR Company's taxable income, before the application of section 281, for 1973 is $21,000 determined as follows:

For the calendar year 1973, the TR company's charges to its shareholders are $23,000 ($30,000 less $7,000) to the M company, $13,000 ($20,000 less $7,000) to the N company, and $8,000 ($15,000 less $7,000) to the O company for a total of $44,000 for related terminal services.
(ii)
Effect on terminal railroad corporation.
The reduced amount to which this section applies is $9,000. The TR company is not considered to have received or accrued income of $9,000 (related terminal income) merely because the charge of $21,000 (net income from all sources other than shareholders) was not made. Similarly, to the extent of $9,000, the TR company is not disallowed deductions for expenses merely because the full cost of services was not charged. The TR company's taxable income for 1973 after application of section 281, is $12,000, computed as follows:
Gross income ($141,000 less $9,000 charges not made)
$132,000

(iii)
Effect on shareholders.
Neither the M company, the N company, nor the O company shall be considered to have received or accrued a dividend of $3,000 nor to have paid or incurred an expense of $3,000 merely by reason of the reduced charges. Thus, assuming the M company's taxable income for 1973 before the application of section 281 would have been $47,450, computed in the following manner, its taxable income for 1973 after the application of section 281 is $50,000, determined as follows:

§ 1.281-3
Definitions.
(a)
Terminal railroad corporation.
The term
terminal railroad corporation
means a corporation which, in the taxable year, meets all of the following conditions:
(1) The corporation and each of its shareholders must be domestic corporations. Thus, all of the shareholders of the corporation, as well as the corporation itself, must be corporations which were organized or created in the United States, including only the States and the District of Columbia, or under the law of the United States or of any State or territory.
(2) All of the shareholders must be railroad corporations which are subject to Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act. Thus, if any shareholder of the corporation, regardless of the class or percentage of stock owned, is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission under part I of that Act, the corporation cannot qualify as a terminal railroad corporation.
(3) The corporation must not be a member of an affiliated group of corporations (as defined in section 1504), other than as a common parent corporation. For this purpose it is immaterial whether or not the affiliated group has ever made a consolidated income tax return. Thus, if the X railroad corporation owns 80 percent of all of the outstanding stock of the Y railroad corporation, the X railroad corporation may qualify, but the Y railroad corporation cannot qualify, as a terminal railroad corporation.
(4) The primary business of the corporation must be that of providing to domestic railroad corporations subject to Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act and to the shippers and passengers of such railroad corporations one or more of the following facilities or services: (i) Railroad terminal facilities, (ii) railroad switching facilities, (iii) railroad terminal services, or (iv) railroad switching services. The designated facilities and services include the furnishing of terminal trackage, the operation of stockyards or a union passenger or freight station, and the operation of railroad bridges and ferries. The providing of the designated facilities includes the leasing of those facilities. A corporation shall be considered as having established that its primary business is that of providing the designated facilities and services if more than 50 percent of its gross income (computed without regard to section 281, and excluding dividends and gains and losses from the disposition of capital assets or property described in section 1231(b)) for the taxable year is derived from those sources. The fact that income from a service or facility is included within the definition of related terminal income is immaterial for purposes of determining whether that service or facility is one which is designated in this subparagraph. Thus, although income from the operation of a commuter railroad line may be related terminal income, a corporation whose primary business is the operation of that facility is not a terminal railroad corporation, since its primary business is not the providing of the designated facilities or services.
(5) A substantial part of the services rendered by the corporation for the taxable year must be rendered to one or more of its shareholders. For purposes of this requirement, providing the use of facilities shall be considered the rendering of services.
(6) Each shareholder of the corporation must compute its taxable income on the basis of a taxable year which either begins or ends on the same day as the taxable year of the corporation.
(b)
Related terminal income
—(1)
In general.
Related terminal income is, generally, the type of income normally earned from the operation of a railroad
terminal. The term
related terminal income
means the taxable income (computed without regard to sections 172, 277, or 281) which the terminal railroad corporation derives for the taxable year from the sources enumerated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Related terminal income must be derived from direct provision of the specified facilities or services by the terminal corporation itself. Thus, income consisting of rent from a lease of a terminal facility by a terminal corporation to a railroad user would qualify; but dividends from a corporation in which the terminal corporation owned stock and which provided such facilities or services to others would not qualify. The term does not include gain or loss derived from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of capital assets or section 1231 assets, whether or not section 1245 or section 1250 applies to part or all of that gain. For example, the term does not apply to gain from the sale of a terminal building or terminal equipment. All direct and indirect expenses and other deductible items attributable to related terminal services or facilities shall be deducted in determining related terminal income. Attribution shall be determined in accordance with customary railroad accounting practices accepted by the Interstate Commerce Commission, except that interest paid with respect to the indebtedness of a terminal railroad corporation shall be deducted from related terminal income to the extent that the proceeds from the indebtedness were directly or indirectly applied to facilities or activities producing such income. The district director may either accept the use of the taxpayer's method of determining the application of the proceeds of all indebtedness of such corporation or prescribe the use of another method which, under all the facts and circumstances, appears to reflect more accurately the probable application of such proceeds.
(2)
Sources of related terminal income.
The term
related terminal income
includes only income derived from one or more of the following sources:
(i) From services or facilities of a character ordinarily and regularly provided by terminal railroad corporations for railroad corporations or for the employees, passengers, or shippers of railroad corporations. Whether the services or facilities are of a character ordinarily and regularly provided by terminal railroad corporations is to be determined by accepted industry practice. The fact that nonterminal businesses may also provide such services or facilities is immaterial. However, there must be a direct relationship between the service or facility provided and the operation of the terminal, including the operation of its trackage and switching facilities. Thus, the term
related terminal income
includes income derived from operating or leasing switching facilities and terminal facilities, such as income from charges to railroad corporations for the use of a union passenger or freight station. Also included for this purpose is income derived from charges to railroad shippers, including express companies and freight forwarders, for the use of sheds or warehouses, even though not directly intended for railroad use. The term includes income derived from leasing or operating restaurants, drugstores, barbershops, newsstands, ticket agencies, banking facilities, car rental facilities, or other similar facilities for passengers, in waiting rooms or along passenger concourses. Similarly, the term includes income derived from operating or leasing passenger parking facilities, and from renting taxicab space, located on or adjacent to the terminal premises. Although the term does include income derived from the operation of a small hotel operated primarily for and usually occupied primarily by the employees of the railroad corporations, it does not include income derived from the operation of a hotel for passengers or other persons.
(ii) From any railroad corporation for services or facilities provided by the terminal railroad corporation in connection with railroad operations. A service or a facility is provided in connection with railroad operations if it is of a character ordinarily and regularly availed of by railroad corporations. For purposes of this subdivision, the income must be derived from railroad corporations. Thus, in addition to the income derived from sources described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section,
the term
related terminal income
includes income derived from switching facilities or leasing to any railroad corporation, or operating for the benefit of such corporation, a beltline or bypass railroad leading to or from the terminal premises. Also included are income derived from the rental of office space (whether or not services are provided to the occupants) in the terminal building to any railroad corporation for that corporation's administrative or operating divisions, and income derived from tolls charged to any railroad corporation for the use of a railroad bridge or ferry.
(iii) From the use by persons other than railroad corporations of a portion of a facility, or of a service, which is used primarily for railroad purposes. A facility or service is used primarily for railroad purposes if the predominant reason for its continued operation or provision is the furnishing of facilities or services described in either subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph. The determination required by this subdivision is to be made independently for each separate facility or service. Two substantial portions of a single structure may be considered separate facilities, depending upon the respective uses made of each. Moreover, any substantial addition, constructed after October 23, 1962, to a facility shall be considered a separate facility.
The term
related terminal income
includes income produced by operating a commuter service or by renting tracks and facilities for a commuter service to an independent operator. The term also includes the sale or rental of advertising space at a terminal facility. If the conditions described in this subdivision are satisfied, the term
related terminal income
may include income which has no connection with the operation of the terminal. Thus, if a terminal railroad corporation operates a railroad bridge primarily to provide railroad corporations a means of crossing a river and the lower level of the bridge contains a roadway for similar use by automobiles, the term includes income derived from the tolls charged to the automobiles for the use of the bridge roadway. However, upon the discontinuance of operations of the railroad level of the bridge, the term would cease to include the automobile tolls. If excess steam from a steam plant operated primarily to supply steam to the terminal is sold to another business in the neighborhood, the term would include the income derived from such sale. However, because an oil or gas well or a mine constitutes a separate facility, the term
related terminal income
does not include income derived in any form from a deposit of oil, natural gas, or any other mineral located on property owned or leased by the terminal railroad corporation.
Similarly, while the term includes income derived from the rental of a small number of offices located in the terminal building (whether or not the lessees are railroad corporations), it does not include income derived from the leasing or operation, for the use of the general public, of a large number of offices or a large number of rooms for lodging, whether or not the space is physically part of the same structure as the terminal. Moreover, the term does not include income derived from the rental of offices to the general public in an addition to the terminal building constructed after October 23, 1962, unless the addition is primarily used for railroad purposes and the offices rented to the general public do not constitute a separate facility in the addition. Whether or not income from the addition is determined to be related terminal income, the income from the small number of offices which were included in the terminal building before the addition was constructed shall continue to be related terminal income.
(iv) From the United States in payment for facilities or services in connection with mail handling. The income must be derived directly from the U.S. Government, or any agency thereof (including for this purpose the U.S. Postal Service), through the receipt of payments for mail-handling facilities or services. Thus, the term would include income derived from the rental of space for a post office for use by the general public on the terminal premises or from the sorting of mail in a railroad box car.

(c)
Related terminal services.
The term
related terminal services
means only the services or the use of facilities, provided by the terminal railroad corporation, which are taken into account in computing related terminal income. Thus, the term includes the providing of terminal and switching services, the furnishing of terminal and switching facilities including the furnishing of terminal trackage, and the operation of bridges and ferries for railroad purposes. For example, upon the facts of the example in the preceding paragraph, the charges for related terminal services are $126,000, determined as follows:
Switching charges
$50,000
Express companies
2,000
Commuter line

Total

(d)
Agreement.
As used in section 281 and § 1.281-2 the term
agreement
means a written contract, entered into before the beginning of the terminal railroad corporation's taxable year in question, to which all shareholders of the terminal railroad corporation are parties. The fact that other railroad corporations or persons are also parties will not disqualify an agreement. Section 281 applies only if, and to the extent that, the reduction of the liability or charge that would be made, as described in paragraph (c) of § 1.281-2, results from the agreement. Thus, where
the other conditions of the statute are met, section 281 applies if a written agreement, to which all of the shareholders were parties and which was entered into prior to the beginning of the terminal railroad corporation's taxable year, provides that the net revenues of the terminal railroad corporation are to be applied as a reduction of what would otherwise be the charge for the taxable year for related terminal services provided to the shareholders. Similarly, section 281 applies, where its other requirements are fulfilled, if the agreement provides that the net revenues are to be credited against rental obligations resulting from related terminal services furnished to shareholders. However, section 281 does not apply where the agreement provides that the net revenues are to be divided among the shareholders and distributed to them in cash or held subject to their unconditional right of withdrawal instead of being applied to the computation of charges, or in reduction of liabilities incurred, for related terminal services.
(e)
Railroad corporation.
For purposes of section 281, § 1.281-2, and this section, the term
railroad corporation
means any corporation (regardless of whether it is a shareholder of the terminal railroad corporation) that is engaged as a common carrier in the furnishing or sale of transportation by railroad, or is a lessor of railroad equipment or facilities. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a corporation is a lessor of railroad equipment or facilities only if (1) it is subject to part I of the Interstate Commerce Act, (2) substantially all of its railroad properties have been leased to a railroad corporation or corporations, (3) each lease is for a term of more than 20 years, and (4) 80 percent or more of its gross income for the taxable year is derived for such leases.
[T.D. 7356, 40 FR 23735, June 2, 1975]
§ 1.281-4
Taxable years affected.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the provisions of section 281 and §§ 1.281-2 and 1.281-3 shall apply to all taxable years to which either the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 apply.
(b)
Taxable years ending before October 23, 1962.
(1)(i) In the case of a taxable year of a terminal railroad corporation ending before October 23, 1962, section 281 (a) shall apply only to the extent that the terminal railroad corporation (
a
) computed its taxable income on its return for such taxable year as if the “reduced amount”, described in paragraph (c) of § 1.281-2, were not received or accrued, and (
b
) did not decrease its otherwise allowable deductions for such taxable year on account of that “reduced amount”. Similarly, in the case of a taxable year of a shareholder of a terminal railroad corporation ending before October 23, 1962, section 281(b) shall apply only to the extent that such shareholder computed its taxable income on its return for such taxable year as if the shareholder had neither received or accrued as a dividend nor paid or incurred as an expense the “reduced amount” described in paragraph (c) of § 1.281-2. Such return must have been filed on or before the due date (including the period of any extension of time) for filing the return for the applicable taxable year. The fact that an amended return or claim for refund or credit of overpayment was subsequently filed, or a deficiency subsequently assessed, based upon a computation of taxable income which is inconsistent with the manner in which the taxable income was computed on the timely filed return, is immaterial.
(ii) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
The G Company is a terminal railroad corporation which in 1960 reduced the liabilities resulting from charges to its shareholders, pursuant to a 1947 written agreement, by its income from nonshareholder sources. For the calendar year 1960, the G Company's related terminal income was $24,000, of which $3,000 is attributable to income from the United States in payment for facilities and services in connection with mail handling. Although the shareholders' liabilities were reduced by $24,000 as a result of taking related terminal income earned during the taxable year into account, on its timely filed 1960 income tax return the G Company treated the $3,000 of liabilities which were reduced on account of income from mail handling as gross income received or accrued during the year. Assuming that the provisions of § 1.281-2 otherwise apply,
their application to the determination of the 1960 tax liability of the G Company shall not extend to the entire “reduced amount” of $24,000, but shall be limited to $21,000 of that amount.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
and the following additional facts. The G Company had three shareholders in 1960, and an equal discharge of liability of $8,000 resulted for each of them on account of related terminal income. Each shareholder treated, on its timely filed 1960 income tax return, $1,000 of its liabilities, which were so reduced and were attributable to income from the United States in payment for facilities and services in connection with mail handling, as if it had received $1,000 from the G Company as a dividend and paid that $1,000 to the G Company for services. Each shareholder treated the remaining $7,000 of its liabilities which were so reduced as if the liabilities which were reduced had never been incurred. Assuming that the provisions of § 1.281-2 otherwise apply, each shareholder shall not be considered to have received or accrued as a dividend, nor to have paid or incurred as an expense $7,000 (instead of $8,000).
(2) For any taxable year of a terminal railroad corporation ending before October 23, 1962, a claim for refund or credit of overpayment of income tax based upon section 281 may be filed, even though such refund or credit of overpayment was otherwise barred by operation of any law or rule of law on October 23, 1962, subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.
(i) The claim for refund or credit of overpayment must not have been barred by a closing agreement (under either section 3760 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or section 7121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954), or by a compromise (under section 3761 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or section 7122 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954);
(ii) The claim for refund or credit of overpayment shall be allowed only to the extent that the overpayment of income tax results from the recomputation of the terminal railroad corporation's taxable income in the manner described in paragraph (a) of § 1.281-2;
(iii) The claim for refund or credit of the overpayment must have been filed prior to October 23, 1963;
(iv) The claim for refund or credit of overpayment shall be allowed only to the extent that the manner in which the terminal railroad corporation's taxable income is recomputed is the manner in which the terminal railroad corporation's taxable income was computed on its timely filed income tax return for such taxable year; and
(v) Each railroad corporation which was a shareholder of the terminal railroad corporation during such taxable year must consent in writing to the assessment, within such period as may be agreed upon with the district director, of any deficiency for any year (even though assessment of the deficiency would otherwise be prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law at the time of filing the consent) to the extent that:
(A) The deficiency is attributable to the recomputation of the shareholder's taxable income in the manner described in paragraph (b) of § 1.281-2, and
(B) The deficiency results from the shareholder's allocable portion of the “reduced amount” (described in paragraph (c) of § 1.281-2) which gives rise to the refund or credit granted to the terminal railroad corporation under this subparagraph.
