refers to title 40, part 63, section 1440.

# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# INQUIRIES
For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at the top of odd-numbered pages.

This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for primary copper smelters. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with all applicable emission limitations, work practice standards, design standards, and operation and maintenance requirements in this subpart.
§ 63.1441
Am I subject to this subpart?
You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a primary copper smelter that is (or is part of) a major source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions on the first compliance date that applies to you (see § 63.1443). Your primary copper smelter is a major source of HAP if it emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at the rate of 10 tons or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 tons or more per year.
§ 63.1442
What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?
(a) This subpart applies to each new and existing affected source at your primary copper smelter. The affected sources are each copper concentrate dryer, each smelting vessel, each slag cleaning vessel, each copper converter department, each anode refining department, process fugitive emission sources (
i.e.,
roofline vents) from smelting vessels, slag cleaning vessels, copper converter department and anode refining department, each bypass stack, and the entire group of fugitive dust sources, as defined in § 63.1459.
(b) The following affected sources: each copper concentrate dryer, each smelting vessel, each slag cleaning vessel, each copper converter department, and the entire group of fugitive dust sources at your primary copper smelter are existing if you commenced construction or reconstruction of the affected source before April 20, 1998.
(c) The following affected sources: each copper concentrate dryer, each smelting vessel, each slag cleaning vessel, each copper converter department and the entire group of fugitive dust sources at your primary copper smelter are new if you commenced construction or reconstruction of the affected source on or after April 20, 1998. An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the definition of “reconstruction” in § 63.2.
(d) The following affected sources: each anode refining department and process fugitive emission sources (
i.e.,
roofline vents) from smelting vessels, slag cleaning vessels, copper converter department and anode refining department are existing if you commenced construction or reconstruction of the affected source before January 11, 2022.
(e) The following affected sources: each anode refining department and process fugitive emission sources (i.e., roofline vents) from smelting vessels, slag cleaning vessels, copper converter department and anode refining department at your primary copper smelter are new if you commenced construction or reconstruction of the affected source on or after January 11, 2022. An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the definition of “reconstruction” in § 63.2.
(f) The bypass stack is existing if you commenced construction or reconstruction of the affected source before July 24, 2023.
(g) The bypass stack is new if you commenced construction or reconstruction of the affected source on or after July 24, 2023. An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the definition of “reconstruction” in § 63.2.
§ 63.1443
When do I have to comply with this subpart?
(a) If you have an existing affected source, you must comply with each emission limitation, work practice standard, design standard, and operation and maintenance requirement in this subpart that applies to you no later than June 13, 2005, except as specified in table 4 to this subpart.

(d) If your primary copper smelter is an area source that becomes a major source of HAP (see § 63.1441), the compliance dates listed in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section apply to you.
(1) Any portion of the existing primary copper smelter that is a new affected source or a new reconstructed source must be in compliance with this subpart upon startup.
(2) All other parts of the primary copper smelter must be in compliance with this subpart no later than 3 years after it becomes a major source (see § 63.1441).
(e) You must meet the notification and schedule requirements in § 63.1454. Several of these notifications must be submitted before the compliance date for your affected source.
§ 63.1444
What emissions limitations, work practice standards, and design standards must I meet for my copper concentrate dryers, smelting vessels, slag cleaning vessels, copper converter departments, anode refining departments, process fugitive emissions from roofline vents, and bypass stacks?
(a)
Copper concentrate dryers.
For each copper concentrate dryer, you must comply with the emission limitation in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section that applies to you.
(1) For each existing copper concentrate dryer, you must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from the dryer vent any gases that contain filterable particulate matter in excess of 50 milligrams per dry standard cubic meter (mg/dscm) as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(a).
(2) For each new copper concentrate dryer, you must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from the dryer vent any gases that contain filterable particulate matter in excess of 23 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(a).
(b)
Smelting vessels.
For each smelting vessel, you must comply with the emission limitations and work practice standards in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) For each smelting vessel, you must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere any process off-gas that contains nonsulfuric acid particulate matter in excess of 6.2 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(b). Process off-gas from a smelting vessel is generated when copper ore concentrates and fluxes are being smelted to form molten copper matte and slag layers.
(2) For each smelting vessel, you must control the process fugitive emissions released when tapping copper matte or slag from the smelting vessel according to paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) At all times when copper matte or slag is tapped from the smelting vessel, you must operate a capture system that collects the gases and fumes released from the tapping port in use.
The design and placement of this capture system must be such that the tapping port opening, launder, and receiving vessel (e.g., ladle, slag pot) are positioned within the confines or influence of the capture system's ventilation draft during those times when the copper matte or slag is flowing from the tapping port opening.
(ii) You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from the capture system used to comply with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section any gases that contain filterable particulate matter in excess of 23 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(a).
(c)
Slag cleaning vessels.
For each slag cleaning vessel, you must comply with the emission limitations and work practice standards in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section that apply to you.
(1) For each slag cleaning vessel, except as provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, you must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere any process off-gas that contains nonsulfuric acid particulate matter in excess of 6.2 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(b).
(2) As an alternative to complying with the emission limit for nonsulfuric acid particulate matter in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for each existing slag cleaning vessel you may choose to comply with the emission limit for filterable particulate matter specified in this paragraph (c)(2). You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere any process off-gas that contains filterable particulate matter in excess of 46 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(a).
(3) For each slag cleaning vessel, you must control process fugitive emissions released when tapping copper matte or slag from the slag cleaning vessel according to paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) At all times when copper matte or slag is tapped from the slag cleaning vessel, you must operate a capture system that collects the gases and fumes released from the tapping port in use. The design and placement of this capture system must be such that the tapping port opening, launder, and receiving vessel (e.g., ladle, slag pot) are positioned within the confines or influence of the capture system's ventilation draft during those times when the copper matte or slag is flowing from the tapping port opening.
(ii) You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from the capture system used to comply with paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section any gases that contain filterable particulate matter in excess of 23 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(a).
(d)
Existing copper converter departments.
For each existing copper converter department, you must comply with the emission limitations and work practice standards in paragraphs (d)(1) through (6) of this section that apply to you.
(1) You must operate a capture system that collects the process off gas vented from each batch copper converter. At all times when one or more batch copper converters are blowing, you must operate the capture system according to the written operation and maintenance plan that has been prepared according to the requirements in § 63.1447(b).
(2) If your copper converter department uses Peirce-Smith converters, the capture system design must include use of a primary hood that covers the entire mouth of the converter vessel when the copper converter is positioned for blowing. Additional hoods (e.g., secondary hoods) or other capture devices must be included in the capture system design as needed to achieve the opacity limit in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. The capture system design may use multiple intake and duct segments through which the ventilation rates are controlled independently of each other, and individual duct segments may be connected to separate control devices.
(3) If your copper converter department uses Hoboken converters, the capture system must collect all process off-gas vented during blowing through the side-flue intake on each converter vessel.
(4) You must operate the capture system such that any visible emissions exiting the roof monitors or roof exhaust fans on the building housing the copper converter department meet the
opacity limit as specified in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) The opacity of any visible emissions exiting the roof monitors or roof exhaust fans on the building housing the copper converter department must not exceed 4 percent as determined by a performance test conducted according to § 63.1450(c).
(ii) The opacity limit in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section applies only at those times when a performance test is conducted according to § 63.1450(c). The requirements for compliance with opacity and visible emission standards specified in § 63.6(h) do not apply to this opacity limit.
(5) You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from any Peirce-Smith converter primary hood capture system or Hoboken converter side-flue intake capture system any process off-gas that contains nonsulfuric acid particulate matter in excess of 6.2 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(b).
(6) You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from any secondary capture system any gases that contain filterable particulate matter in excess of 23 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(a).
(e)
New copper converter departments.
For each new copper converter department for which construction commenced on or after April 20, 1998, the use of batch copper converters is prohibited. For each new copper converter department which will contain a copper converter other than a batch converter (such as a continuous converter), you must comply with the emission limitation and work practice standards in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) You must not cause to be discharged to the atmosphere from any combination of stacks or other vents any captured process off-gas that contains filterable particulate matter greater than a daily (24-hour) average of 0.031 pounds of particulate matter per ton of copper concentrate feed charged to the smelting vessel as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(a).
(2) You must operate a capture system that collects the gases and fumes released from converting vessels and conveys the collected gas stream to a control device.
(f)
New and existing anode refining departments.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, for each new and existing anode refining department, you must comply with the emission limitation and work practice standards in paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section.
(1) If the anode refining department process exhaust gases are combined with the Hoboken converter process fugitive capture system, you must demonstrate compliance with the emission limitation and work practice standards in paragraph (g) of this section.
(2) For each new and existing anode refining department, you must not discharge to the atmosphere captured process exhaust gases from the anode refining furnaces containing filterable particulate matter emissions in excess of 5.8 mg/dscm as measured using the test methods specified in § 63.1450(a).
(3) You must operate a capture system that collects the process off-gases and fumes released from the anode refining department and convey the collected gas stream to a control device.
(g)
Existing combined anode refining department and Hoboken converter process fugitive capture system.
For each new and existing anode refining department and Hoboken converter process fugitive capture system, you must comply with the emission limitation and work practice standards in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.

(3) For a control device applied to emissions from an affected source and subject to work practice standards and emission limit(s) in § 63.1444(i), (j), or (k) or § 63.1446(e) for appropriate, site-specific operating parameters that are representative and reliable indicators of the control device performance, you must establish a site-specific operating limit(s) according to the procedures in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(4) You must conduct each performance test that applies to your affected source under normal operating conditions of the affected source. The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The use of the bypass stack during a performance test of the process shall invalidate the performance test. The owner or operator must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent the entire range of normal operation, including operational conditions for maximum emissions if such emissions are not expected during maximum production. The owner or operator shall make
available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(c)
Copper converter department capture system opacity limit.
You must conduct each performance test to determine compliance with the opacity limit in § 63.1444 using the test methods and procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (9) of this section and during the particulate matter performance test.
(1) You must conduct the performance test during the period when the primary copper smelter is operating under conditions representative of the smelter's normal blister copper production rate. You may not conduct a performance test during a malfunction. Before conducting the performance test, you must prepare a written test plan specifying the copper production conditions to be maintained throughout the opacity observation period and including a copy of the written documentation you have prepared according to paragraph (a)(3) of this section to support the established operating limits for the copper converter department capture system. You must submit a copy of the test plan for review and approval by the Administrator or delegated authority. During the observation period, you must collect appropriate process information and copper converter department capture system operating information to prepare documentation sufficient to verify that all opacity observations were made during the copper production and capture system operating conditions specified in the approved test plan.
(2) You must notify the Administrator or delegated authority before conducting the opacity observations to allow the Administrator or delegated authority the opportunity to have authorized representatives attend the test. Written notification of the location and scheduled date for conducting the opacity observations must be received by the Administrator on or before 30 calendar days before this scheduled date.
(3) You must gather the data needed for determining compliance with the opacity limit using qualified visible emission observers and process monitors as described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) Opacity observations must be performed by a sufficient number of qualified visible emission observers to obtain two complete concurrent sets of opacity readings for the required observation period. Each visible emission observer must be certified as a qualified observer by the procedure specified in section 3 of Method 9 in appendix A-4 to 40 CFR part 60. The entire set of readings during the required observation period does not need to be made by the same two observers. More than two observers may be used to allow for substitutions and provide for observer rest breaks. The owner or operator must obtain proof of current visible emission reading certification for each observer. ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 9 with the specified conditions in paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(A) through (E) of this section.
(A) During the digital camera opacity technique (DCOT) certification procedure outlined in section 9.2 of ASTM D7520-16, you or the DCOT vendor must present the plumes in front of various backgrounds of color and contrast representing conditions anticipated during field use such as blue sky, trees, and mixed backgrounds (clouds and/or a sparse tree stand).
(B) You must also have standard operating procedures in place including daily or other frequency quality checks to ensure the equipment is within manufacturing specifications as outlined in section 8.1 of ASTM D7520-16.
(C) You must follow the record keeping procedures outlined in § 63.10(b)(1) for the DCOT certification, compliance report, data sheets, and all raw unaltered JPEGs used for opacity and certification determination.
(D) You or the DCOT vendor must have a minimum of four (4) independent technology users apply the software to determine the visible opacity of the 300 certification plumes. For each set of 25 plumes, the user may not exceed 15% opacity of anyone reading and the average error must not exceed 7.5% opacity.
(E) This approval does not provide or imply a certification or validation of any vendor's hardware or software. The
onus to maintain and verify the certification and/or training of the DCOT camera, software and operator in accordance with ASTM D7520-16 and this letter is on the facility, DCOT operator, and DCOT vendor.
(ii) A person (or persons) familiar with the copper production operations conducted at the smelter must serve as the indoor process monitor. The indoor process monitor is stationed at a location inside the building housing the batch copper converters such that he or she can visually observe and record operations that occur in the batch copper converter aisle during the times that the visible emission observers are making opacity readings. More than one indoor process monitor may be used to allow for substitutions and provide for rest breaks.
(4) You must make all opacity observations using Method 9 in appendix A-4 to 40 CFR part 60 and following the procedures described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section. ASTM D7520-16 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 9 with the specified conditions in paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(A) through (E) of this section.
(i) Each visible emission observer must make his or her readings at a position from the outside of the building that houses the copper converter department such that the observer's line-of-sight is approximately perpendicular to the longer axis of the converter building, and the observer has an unobstructed view of the building roof monitor sections or roof exhaust fan outlets that are positioned over each of the batch copper converters inside the building. Opacity readings can only be made during those times when the observer's position meets the sun orientation and other conditions specified in section 2.1 of Method 9 in appendix A-4 to 40 CFR part 60.
(ii) At 15-second intervals, each visible emission observer views the building roof monitor sections or roof exhaust fan outlets that are positioned over each of the batch copper converters inside the building and reads the opacity of the visible plumes. If no plume is visible, the observer records zero as the opacity value for the 15-second interval. In situations when it is possible for an observer to distinguish two or more visible emission plumes from the building roof monitor sections or roof exhaust fan outlets, the observer must identify, to the extent feasible, the plume having the highest opacity and record his or her opacity reading for that plume as the opacity value for the 15-second interval.
(5) You must make opacity observations for a period of sufficient duration to obtain a minimum of 120 1-minute intervals during which at least one copper converter is blowing and no interferences have occurred from other copper production events, as specified in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, which generate visible emissions inside the building that potentially can interfere with the visible emissions from the converter capture systems as seen by the outside observers. To obtain the required number of 1-minute intervals, the observation period may be divided into two or more segments performed on the same day or on different days if conditions prevent the required number of opacity readings from being obtained during one continuous time period. Examples of these conditions include, but are not limited to, changes in the sun's orientation relative to visible emission observers' positions such that the conditions in Method 9 in appendix A-4 to 40 CFR part 60 are no longer met or an unexpected thunderstorm. If the total observation period is divided into two or more segments, all opacity observations must be made during the same set of copper production conditions described in your approved test plan as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(6) You must gather indoor process information during all times that the visible emission observers are making opacity readings outside the building housing the copper converter department. The indoor process monitor must continually observe the operations occurring in the copper converter department and prepare a written record of his or her observations using the procedure specified in paragraphs (c)(6)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) At the beginning of each observation period or segment, the clock time setting on the watch or clock to be used by the indoor process monitor
must be synchronized with the clock time settings for the timepieces to be used by the outdoor opacity observers.
(ii) During each period or segment when opacity readings are being made by the visible emission observers, the indoor process monitor must continuously observe the operations occurring in the copper converter department and record his or her observations in a log book, on data sheets, or other type of permanent written format.
(iii) When a batch copper converter is blowing, a record must be prepared for the converter that includes, but is not limited to, the clock times for when blowing begins and when blowing ends and the converter blowing rate. This information may be recorded by the indoor process monitor or by a separate, automated computer data system.
(iv) The process monitor must record each event other than converter blowing that occurs in or nearby the converter aisle that he or she observes to generate visible emissions inside the building. The recorded entry for each event must include, but is not limited to, a description of the event and the clock times when the event begins and when the event ends.
(7) You must prepare a summary of the data for the entire observation period using the information recorded during the observation period by the outdoor visible emission observers and the indoor process monitor and the procedure specified in paragraphs (c)(7)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) Using the field data sheets, identify the 1-minute clock times for which a total of eight opacity readings were made and recorded by both observers at 15-second intervals according to the test procedures (i.e., a total of four opacity values have been recorded for the 1-minute interval by each of the two observers). Calculate the average of the eight 15-second interval readings recorded on the field data sheets by the two observers during the clock time minute interval (add the four consecutive 15-second interval opacity readings made by Observer A during the specified clock time minute, plus the four consecutive 15-second interval opacity readings made by Observer B during the same clock time minute, and divide the resulting total by eight). Record the clock time and the opacity average for the 1-minute interval on a data summary sheet. Figure 1 to this subpart shows an example of the format for the data summary sheet you may use, but are not required to use.
(ii) Using the data summary sheets prepared according to paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section and the process information recorded according to paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section, identify those 1-minute intervals for which at least one of the batch copper converters was blowing.
(iii) Using the data summary sheets prepared according to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section and the process information recorded according to paragraph (c)(6)(iv) of this section, identify the 1-minute intervals during which at least one copper converter was blowing but none of the interference events listed in paragraphs (c)(7)(iii)(A) through (F) of this section occurred. Other ancillary activities not listed but conducted in or adjacent to the converter aisle during the opacity observations are not considered to be interference events (e.g., converter aisle cleaning, placement of smoking ladles or skulls on the converter aisle floor).
(A) Charging of copper matte, reverts, or other materials to a batch copper converter;
(B) Skimming slag or other molten materials from a batch copper converter;
(C) Pouring of blister copper or other molten materials from a batch copper converter;
(D) Return of slag or other molten materials to the flash smelting vessel or slag cleaning vessel;
(E) Roll-out or roll-in of the batch copper converter; or
(F) Smoke and fumes generated inside the converter building by operation of the smelting vessel, the slag cleaning vessel (if used), anode refining and casting processes that drift into the copper converter department.
(iv) Using the data summary sheets prepared according to paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section, up to five 1-minute intervals following an interference event may be eliminated from
data used for the compliance determination calculation specified in paragraph (c)(8) of this section by applying a time delay factor. The time delay factor must be a constant number of minutes not to exceed 5 minutes that is added to the clock time recorded when cessation of the interference event occurs. The same time delay factor must be used for all interference events (i.e., a constant time delay factor for the smelter of 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes, or 5 minutes). The number of minutes to be used for the time delay factor is determined based on the site-specific equipment and converter building configuration. An explanation of the rationale for selecting the value used for the time delay factor must be prepared and included in the test report.
(8) You must use the data summary prepared in paragraph (c)(7) of this section to calculate the average opacity value for a minimum of 120 1-minute intervals during which at least one copper converter was blowing with no interference events as determined according to paragraphs (c)(7)(iii) and (iv) of this section. Average opacity is calculated using equation 1 to this paragraph (c)(8):

# Equation 1 to paragraph (c)(8)
ER13MY24.110
Where:
VEave = Average opacity to be used for compliance determination (percent);
n = Total number of 1-minute intervals during which at least one copper converter was blowing with no interference events as determined according to paragraphs (c)(7)(iii) and (iv) of this section (at least 120 1-minute intervals);

(ii) For any dampers that are manually set and remain in the same position at all times the capture system is operating, the damper position must be visually checked and recorded at the beginning and end of each opacity observation period segment.
(iii) Review the recorded monitoring data. Identify and explain any times during batch copper converter blowing when the capture system operated outside the applicable operating limits.

feed/charge
means the weight of material (including molten aluminum, T-bar, sow, ingot, etc.) and alloying agents that enter the process unit within a specified time period (e.g., a time period equal to the performance test period). The
feed/charge
for a dross only furnace includes the total weight of dross and solid flux.
Fluxing
means refining of molten aluminum to improve product quality, achieve product specifications, or reduce material loss, including the addition of solvents to remove impurities (solvent flux); and the injection of gases such as chlorine, or chlorine mixtures, to remove magnesium (demagging) or hydrogen bubbles (degassing).
Fluxing
may be performed in the furnace or outside the furnace by an
in-line fluxer.
Furnace hearth
means the combustion zone of a furnace in which the molten metal is contained.
Group 1 furnace

HCl
means hydrogen chloride.
HF
means hydrogen fluoride.
In-line fluxer
means a device exterior to a furnace, located in a transfer line from a furnace, used to refine (flux) molten aluminum; also known as a flux box, degassing box, or demagging box.
Internal scrap

Operating cycle
means for a batch process, the period beginning when the feed material is first charged to the operation and ending when all feed material charged to the operation has been processed. For a batch melting or holding furnace process,
operating cycle
means the period including the charging and melting of scrap aluminum and the fluxing, refining, alloying, and tapping of molten aluminum (the period from tap-to-tap).
PM
means, for the purposes of this subpart, emissions of particulate matter that serve as a measure of total particulate emissions and as a surrogate for metal HAPs contained in the particulates, including but not limited to, antimony, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, and selenium.
Pollution prevention
means source reduction as defined under the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (e.g., equipment or technology modifications, process or procedure modifications, reformulation or redesign of products, substitution of raw materials, and improvements in housekeeping, maintenance, training, or inventory control), and other practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants through increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water, or other resources, or protection of natural resources by conservation.
Reactive fluxing
means the use of any gas, liquid, or solid flux (other than cover flux) that results in a HAP emission. Argon and nitrogen are not reactive and do not produce HAP.
Reconstruction
means the replacement of components of an affected source or
emission unit
such that the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable new affected source, and it is technologically and economically feasible for the reconstructed source to meet relevant standard(s) established in this subpart. Replacement of the refractory in a furnace is routine maintenance and is not a
reconstruction.
The repair and replacement of
in-line fluxer
components (
e.g.,
rotors/shafts, burner tubes, refractory, warped steel) is considered to be routine maintenance and is not considered a
reconstruction. In-line fluxers
are typically removed to a maintenance/repair area and are replaced with repaired units. The replacement of an existing
in-line fluxer
with a repaired unit is not considered a
reconstruction.
Residence time
means, for an
afterburner,
the duration of time required for gases to pass through the
afterburner
combustion zone.
Residence time
is calculated by dividing the

e.g.
, by tapping a furnace). Shutdown ends when the emission unit is near ambient temperature.
Sidewell
means an open well adjacent to the hearth of a furnace with connecting arches between the hearth and the open well through which molten aluminum is circulated between the hearth, where heat is applied by burners, and the open well, which is used for charging scrap and solid flux or salt to the furnace, injecting fluxing agents, and skimming dross.

delacquering kilns, decoating kilns, dross-only furnaces, group 1 furnaces, in-line fluxers, sweat furnaces and group 2 furnaces that begins with equipment warming from a shutdown, that is, the equipment is at or near ambient temperature. Startup ends at the point that flux or feed/charge is introduced.
Sweat furnace
means a furnace used exclusively to reclaim aluminum from scrap that contains substantial quantities of iron by using heat to separate the low-melting point aluminum from the scrap while the higher melting-point iron remains in solid form.
Tap
means the end of an operating cycle of any individual furnace when processed molten aluminum is poured from that furnace.
TEQ
means the international method of expressing toxicity equivalents for dioxins and furans as defined in “Interim Procedures for Estimating Risks Associated with Exposures to Mixtures of Chlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and -Dibenzofurans (CDDs and CDFs) and 1989 Update” (EPA-625/3-89-016), available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 22161, NTIS no.

. Except as provided in paragraph (u) of this section, the owner or operator must calculate and record the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average emissions of PM, HCl, and D/F (and HF for uncontrolled group 1 furnaces) for each secondary aluminum processing unit on a daily basis. To calculate the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average, the owner or operator must:
(1) Calculate and record the total weight of material charged to each emission unit in the secondary aluminum processing unit for each 24-hour day of operation using the feed/charge weight information required in paragraph (e) of this section. If the owner or operator chooses to comply on the basis of weight of aluminum produced by the emission unit, rather than weight of material charged to the emission unit, all performance test emissions results and all calculations must be conducted on the aluminum production weight basis.
(2) Multiply the total feed/charge weight to the emission unit, or the
weight of aluminum produced by the emission unit, for each emission unit for the 24-hour period by the emission rate (in lb/ton of feed/charge) for that emission unit (as determined during the performance test) to provide emissions for each emission unit for the 24-hour period, in pounds.
(i) Where no performance test has been conducted, for a particular emission unit, because the owner of operator has, with the approval of the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources, chosen to determine the emission rate of an emission unit by testing a representative unit, in accordance with § 63.1511(f), the owner or operator shall use the emission rate determined from the representative unit in the SAPU emission rate calculation required in § 63.1510(t)(4).
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (t)(2)(iii) of this section, if the owner or operator has not conducted performance tests for HCl (and HF for an uncontrolled group 1 furnace) or for HCl for an in-line fluxer, in accordance with the provisions of § 63.1512(d)(3), (e)(3), or (h)(2), the calculation required in § 63.1510(t)(4) to determine SAPU-wide HCl and HF emissions shall be made under the assumption that all chlorine contained in reactive flux added to the emission unit is emitted as HCl and all fluorine contained in reactive flux added to the emission unit is emitted as HF.
(iii) Prior to the date by which the initial performance test for HF emissions from uncontrolled group 1 furnaces is conducted, or is required to be conducted, the calculation required in § 63.1505(k) to determine the SAPU-wide HF emission limit and the calculation required in § 63.1510(t)(4) to determine the SAPU-wide HF emission rate must exclude HF emissions from untested uncontrolled group 1 furnaces and feed/charge processed in untested uncontrolled group 1 furnaces.
(3) Divide the total emissions for each SAPU for the 24-hour period by the total material charged to the SAPU, or the weight of aluminum produced by the SAPU over the 24-hour period to provide the daily emission rate for the SAPU.
(4) Compute the 24-hour daily emission rate using Equation 4:
ER18SE15.010
Where:
E
day
= The daily PM, HCl, and D/F (and HF for uncontrolled group 1 furnaces) emission rate for the secondary aluminum processing unit for the 24-hour period;
T
i
= The total amount of feed, or aluminum produced, for emission unit i for the 24-hour period (tons or Mg);
ER
i
= The measured emission rate for emission unit i as determined in the performance test (lb/ton or µg/Mg of feed/charge); and
n = The number of emission units in the secondary aluminum processing unit.
(5) Calculate and record the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average for each pollutant each day by summing the daily emission rates for each pollutant over the 3 most recent consecutive days and dividing by 3. The SAPU is in compliance with an applicable emission limit if the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average for each pollutant is no greater than the applicable SAPU emission limit determined in accordance with § 63.1505(k)(1)-(3).
(u)
Secondary aluminum processing unit compliance by individual emission unit demonstration.
As an alternative to the procedures of paragraph (t) of this section, an owner or operator may demonstrate, through performance tests, that each individual emission unit within the secondary aluminum production unit is in compliance with the applicable emission limits for the emission unit.
(v)
Alternative monitoring method for lime addition.
The owner or operator of a lime-coated fabric filter that employs intermittent or noncontinuous lime addition may apply to the Administrator for approval of an alternative method for monitoring the lime addition schedule and rate based on monitoring the weight of lime added per ton of feed/charge for each operating cycle or time period used in the performance test. An alternative monitoring method will not be approved unless the owner or operator provides assurance through data and information that the affected source will meet the relevant emission standards on a continuous basis.
(w)
Alternative monitoring methods.
If an owner or operator wishes to use an alternative monitoring method to demonstrate compliance with any emission standard in this subpart, other than those alternative monitoring methods which may be authorized pursuant to § 63.1510(j)(5) and § 63.1510(v), the owner or operator may submit an application to the Administrator. Any such application will be processed according to the criteria and procedures set forth in paragraphs (w)(1) through (6) of this section.
(1) The Administrator will not approve averaging periods other than those specified in this section.
(2) The owner or operator must continue to use the original monitoring requirement until necessary data are submitted and approval is received to use another monitoring procedure.
(3) The owner or operator shall submit the application for approval of alternate monitoring methods no later than the notification of the performance test. The application must contain the information specified in paragraphs (w)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section:
(i) Data or information justifying the request, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality of using the required approach;
(ii) A description of the proposed alternative monitoring requirements, including the operating parameters to be monitored, the monitoring approach and technique, and how the limit is to be calculated; and
(iii) Data and information documenting that the alternative monitoring requirement(s) would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance with the relevant emission standard(s).
(4) The Administrator will not approve an alternate monitoring application unless it would provide equivalent or better assurance of compliance with the relevant emission standard(s). Before disapproving any alternate monitoring application, the Administrator will provide:
(i) Notice of the information and findings upon which the intended disapproval is based; and
(ii) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present additional supporting information before final action is taken on the application. This notice will specify how much additional time is allowed for the owner or operator to provide additional supporting information.
(5) The owner or operator is responsible for submitting any supporting information in a timely manner to enable the Administrator to consider the application prior to the performance test. Neither submittal of an application nor the Administrator's failure to approve or disapprove the application relieves the owner or operator of the responsibility to comply with any provisions of this subpart.
(6) The Administrator may decide at any time, on a case-by-case basis, that additional or alternative operating limits, or alternative approaches to establishing operating limits, are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards of this subpart.
[65 FR 15710, Mar. 23, 2000, as amended at 67 FR 59792, Sept. 24, 2002; 67 FR 79816, Dec. 30, 2002; 69 FR 53984, Sept. 3, 2004; 80 FR 56741, Sept. 18, 2015; 81 FR 38087, June 13, 2016]
§ 63.1511
Performance test/compliance demonstration general requirements.
(a)
Site-specific test plan.
Prior to conducting any performance test required by this subpart, the owner or operator must prepare a site-specific test plan which satisfies all of the rule requirements, and must obtain approval of the plan pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 63.7. Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the
owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(b)
Initial performance test.
Following approval of the site-specific test plan, the owner or operator must demonstrate initial compliance with each applicable emission, equipment, work practice, or operational standard for each affected source and emission unit, and report the results in the notification of compliance status report as described in § 63.1515(b). The owner or operator of any affected source constructed before February 14, 2012, for which an initial performance test is required to demonstrate compliance must conduct this initial performance test no later than the date for compliance established by § 63.1501. The owner or operator of any affected source constructed or reconstructed after February 14, 2012, for which an initial performance test is required must conduct this initial performance test within 180 days after the date for compliance established by § 63.1501. Except for the date by which the performance test must be conducted, the owner or operator must conduct each performance test in accordance with the requirements and procedures set forth in § 63.7(c). Owners or operators of affected sources located at facilities which are area sources are subject only to those performance testing requirements pertaining to D/F. Owners or operators of sweat furnaces meeting the specifications of § 63.1505(f)(1) are not required to conduct a performance test.
(1) The performance tests must be conducted under representative conditions expected to produce the highest level of HAP emissions expressed in the units of the emission standards for the HAP (considering the extent of feed/charge contamination, reactive flux addition rate and feed/charge rate). If a single test condition is not expected to produce the highest level of emissions for all HAP, testing under two or more sets of conditions (for example high contamination at low feed/charge rate, and low contamination at high feed/charge rate) may be required. Any subsequent performance tests for the purposes of establishing new or revised parametric limits shall be allowed upon pre-approval from the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources. These new parametric settings shall be used to demonstrate compliance for the period being tested.
(2) Each performance test for a continuous process must consist of 3 separate runs; pollutant sampling for each run must be conducted for the time period specified in the applicable method or, in the absence of a specific time period in the test method, for a minimum of 3 hours.
(3) Each performance test for a batch process must consist of three separate runs; pollutant sampling for each run must be conducted over the entire process operating cycle. Additionally, for batch processes where the length of the process operating cycle is not known in advance, and where isokinetic sampling must be conducted based on the procedures in Method 5 in appendix A to part 60, use the following procedure to ensure that sampling is conducted over the entire process operating cycle:
(i) Choose a minimum operating cycle length and begin sampling assuming this minimum length will be the run time (
e.g.
, if the process operating cycle is known to last from four to six hours, then assume a sampling time of four hours and divide the sampling time evenly between the required number of traverse points);
(ii) After each traverse point has been sampled once, begin sampling each point again for the same time per point, in the reverse order, until the operating cycle is complete. All traverse points as required by Method 1 of appendix A to part 60, must be sampled at least once during each test run;
(iii) In order to distribute the sampling time most evenly over all the traverse points, do not perform all runs using the same sampling point order (
e.g.
, if there are four ports and sampling for run 1 began in port 1, then sampling for run 2 could begin in port 4 and continue in reverse order.)
(4) Where multiple affected sources or emission units are exhausted
through a common stack, pollutant sampling for each run must be conducted over a period of time during which all affected sources or emission units complete at least 1 entire process operating cycle or for 24 hours, whichever is shorter.
(5) Initial compliance with an applicable emission limit or standard is demonstrated if the average of three runs conducted during the performance test is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit or standard.
(6) Apply paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section for each pollutant separately if a different production rate, charge material or, if applicable, reactive fluxing rate would apply and thereby result in a higher expected emissions rate for that pollutant.
(7) The owner or operator may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction.
(c)
Test methods.
The owner or operator must use the following methods in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to determine compliance with the applicable emission limits or standards:
(1) Method 1 for sample and velocity traverses.
(2) Method 2 for velocity and volumetric flow rate.
(3) Method 3 for gas analysis.
(4) Method 4 for moisture content of the stack gas.
(5) Method 5 for the concentration of PM.
(6) Method 9 for visible emission observations.
(7) Method 23 for the concentration of D/F.
(8) Method 25A for the concentration of THC, as propane.
(9) Method 26A for the concentration of HCl and HF. Method 26 may also be used, except at sources where entrained water droplets are present in the emission stream. Where a lime-injected fabric filter is used as the control device to comply with the 90 percent reduction standard, the owner or operator must measure the fabric filter inlet concentration of HCl at a point before lime is introduced to the system.
(d)
Alternative methods.
The owner or operator may use alternative test methods as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) The owner or operator may use test method ASTM D7520-13 as an alternative to EPA Method 9 subject to conditions described in § 63.1510(f)(4).
(2) In lieu of conducting the annual flow rate measurements using Methods 1 and 2, the owner or operator may use Method 204 in Appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to conduct annual verification of a permanent total enclosure for the affected source/emission unit.
(3) The owner or operator may use an alternative test method approved by the Administrator.
(e)
Repeat tests.
The owner or operator of new or existing affected sources and emission units located at secondary aluminum production facilities that are major sources must conduct a performance test every 5 years following the initial performance test.
(f)
Testing of representative emission units.
With the prior approval of the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources, an owner or operator may utilize emission rates obtained by testing a particular type of group 1 furnace that does not have an add-on air pollution control device, or by testing an in-line flux box that does not have an add-on air pollution control device, to determine the emission rate for other units of the same type at the same facility. Such emission test results may only be considered to be representative of other units if all of the following criteria are satisfied:
(1) The tested emission unit must use feed materials and charge rates which are comparable to the emission units that it represents;
(2) The tested emission unit must use the same type of flux materials in the same proportions as the emission units it represents;
(3) The tested emission unit must be operated utilizing the same work practices as the emission units that it represents;
(4) The tested emission unit must be of the same design as the emission units that it represents; and
(5) The tested emission unit must be tested under the highest load or capacity reasonably expected to occur for any of the emission units that it represents.
(6) All 3 separate runs of a performance test must be conducted on the same emission unit.
(g)
Establishment of monitoring and operating parameter values.
The owner or operator of new or existing affected sources and emission units must establish a minimum or maximum operating parameter value, or an operating parameter range for each parameter to be monitored as required by § 63.1510 that ensures compliance with the applicable emission limit or standard. To establish the minimum or maximum value or range, the owner or operator must use the appropriate procedures in this section and submit the information required by § 63.1515(b)(4) in the notification of compliance status report. The owner or operator may use existing data in addition to the results of performance tests to establish operating parameter values for compliance monitoring provided each of the following conditions are met to the satisfaction of the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources:
(1) The complete emission test report(s) used as the basis of the parameter(s) is submitted.
(2) The same test methods and procedures as required by this subpart were used in the test.
(3) The owner or operator certifies that no design or work practice changes have been made to the source, process, or emission control equipment since the time of the report.
(4) All process and control equipment operating parameters required to be monitored were monitored as required in this subpart and documented in the test report.
(5) If the owner or operator wants to conduct a new performance test and establish different operating parameter values, they must submit a revised site specific test plan and receive approval in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. In addition, if an owner or operator wants to use existing data in addition to the results of the new performance test to establish operating parameter values, they must meet the requirements in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section.
(h)
Testing of commonly-ducted units within a secondary aluminum processing unit.
When group 1 furnaces and/or in-line fluxers are included in a single existing SAPU or new SAPU, and the emissions from more than one emission unit within that existing SAPU or new SAPU are manifolded to a single control device, compliance for all units within the SAPU is demonstrated if the total measured emissions from all controlled and uncontrolled units in the SAPU do not exceed the emission limits calculated for that SAPU based on the applicable equation in § 63.1505(k).
(i)
Testing of commonly-ducted units not within a secondary aluminum processing unit.
With the prior approval of the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources, an owner or operator may do combined performance testing of two or more individual affected sources or emission units which are not included in a single existing SAPU or new SAPU, but whose emissions are manifolded to a single control device. Any such performance testing of commonly-ducted units must satisfy the following basic requirements:
(1) All testing must be designed to verify that each affected source or emission unit individually satisfies all emission requirements applicable to that affected source or emission unit;
(2) All emissions of pollutants subject to a standard must be tested at the outlet from each individual affected source or emission unit while operating under the highest load or capacity reasonably expected to occur, and prior to the point that the emissions are manifolded together with emissions from other affected sources or emission units;
(3) The combined emissions from all affected sources and emission units which are manifolded to a single emission control device must be tested at the outlet of the emission control device;
(4) All tests at the outlet of the emission control device must be conducted with all affected sources and emission units whose emissions are manifolded to the control device operating simultaneously under the highest load or capacity reasonably expected to occur; and
(5) For purposes of demonstrating compliance of a commonly-ducted unit with any emission limit for a particular type of pollutant, the emissions of that pollutant by the individual unit shall be presumed to be controlled by the same percentage as total emissions of that pollutant from all commonly-ducted units are controlled at the outlet of the emission control device.

If visible emission observation is the selected monitoring option, the owner or operator must record visible emission observations from each exhaust stack for all consecutive 6-minute periods during the PM emission test according to the requirements of Method 9 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60. If emissions observations by ASTM Method D7520-13 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) is the selected monitoring option, the owner or operator must record opacity observations from each exhaust stack for all consecutive 6-minute periods during the PM emission test.
(b)
Thermal chip dryer.
The owner or operator must conduct a performance test to measure THC and D/F emissions at the outlet of the control device while the unit processes only unpainted aluminum chips.
(c)
Scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln.
The owner or operator must conduct performance tests to measure emissions of THC, D/F, HCl, and PM at the outlet of the control device.

(iii) Assume an 80-percent capture efficiency for the furnace exhaust (
i.e.,
multiply emissions measured at the furnace exhaust outlet by 1.25). If the source fails to demonstrate compliance using the 80-percent capture efficiency assumption, the owner or operator must re-test with a hood that meets
the ACGIH Guidelines within 180 days, or petition the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources, within 180 days that such hoods are impractical under the provisions of paragraph (e)(6) of this section and propose testing procedures that will minimize unmeasured emissions during the performance test according to paragraph (e)(7) of this section.
(iv) The 80-percent capture efficiency assumption is not applicable in the event of testing conducted under an approved petition submitted pursuant to paragraphs (e)(5)(ii) or (iii) of this section.
(6) The installation of hooding that meets ACGIH Guidelines (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) is considered impractical if any of the following conditions exist:

(ii) Space limitations or work area constraints exist such that the temporary hood cannot be supported or located to prevent interference with normal furnace operations or avoid unsafe working conditions for the furnace operator; or
(iii) Other obstructions and limitations subject to agreement of the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources.
(7) Testing procedures that will minimize unmeasured emissions may include, but are not limited to the following:
(i) Installing a hood that does not entirely meet ACGIH guidelines;
(ii) Using the building as an enclosure, and measuring emissions exhausted from the building if there are no other furnaces or other significant sources in the building of the pollutants to be measured;
(iii) Installing temporary baffles on those sides or top of furnace opening if it is practical to do so where they will not interfere with material handling or with the furnace door opening and closing;

(vi) Agitating or stirring molten metal as soon as practicable after salt flux addition and closing doors as soon as possible after solid fluxing operations, including mixing and dross removal;
(vii) Keeping building doors and other openings closed to the greatest extent possible to minimize drafts that would divert emissions from being drawn into the furnace;
(viii) Maintaining burners on low-fire or pilot operation while the doors are open or the top is off;
(ix) Use of fans or other device to direct flow into a furnace when door is open; or
(x) Removing the furnace cover one time in order to add a smaller but representative charge and then replacing the cover.

Sweat furnace.
Except as provided in § 63.1505(f)(1), the owner or operator must measure emissions of D/F from each sweat furnace at the outlet of the control device.
(g)
Dross-only furnace.
The owner or operator must conduct a performance test to measure emissions of PM from each dross-only furnace at the outlet of each control device while the unit processes only dross and salt flux as the sole feedstock.
(h)
In-line fluxer.
(1) The owner or operator of an in-line fluxer that uses reactive flux materials must conduct a performance test to measure emissions of HCl and PM or otherwise demonstrate compliance in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section. If the in-line fluxer is equipped with an add-on control device, the emissions must be measured at the outlet of the control device.
(2) The owner or operator may choose to limit the rate at which reactive flux is added to an in-line fluxer and assume, for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with the SAPU emission limit, that all chlorine in the reactive flux added to the in-line fluxer is emitted as HCl. Under these circumstances, the owner or operator is not required to conduct an emission
test for HCl. If the owner or operator of any in-line flux box that has no ventilation ductwork manifolded to any outlet or emission control device chooses to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits for HCl by limiting use of reactive flux and assuming that all chlorine in the flux is emitted as HCl, compliance with the HCl limit shall also constitute compliance with the emission limit for PM and no separate emission test for PM is required. In this case, the owner or operator of the unvented in-line flux box must use the maximum permissible PM emission rate for the in-line flux boxes when determining the total emissions for any SAPU which includes the flux box.

Rotary dross cooler.
The owner or operator must conduct a performance test to measure PM emissions at the outlet of the control device.
(j)
Secondary aluminum processing unit
. The owner or operator must conduct performance tests as described in paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section. The results of the performance tests are used to establish emission rates in lb/ton of feed/charge for PM, HCl and HF and µg TEQ/Mg of feed/charge for D/F emissions from each emission unit. These emission rates are used for compliance monitoring in the calculation of the 3-day, 24-hour rolling average emission rates using the equation in § 63.1510(t). A performance test is required for:
(1) Each group 1 furnace processing only clean charge to measure emissions of PM and either:
(i) Emissions of HF and HCl (for determining the emission limit); or
(ii) The mass flow rate of HCl at the inlet to and outlet from the control device (for the percent reduction standard).
(2) Each group 1 furnace that processes scrap other than clean charge to measure emissions of PM and D/F and either:

During the emission test(s) conducted to determine compliance with emission limits in a kg/Mg (lb/ton) format, the owner or operator of an affected source or emission unit, subject to an emission limit in a kg/Mg (lb/ton) of feed/charge format, must measure (or otherwise determine) and record the total weight of feed/charge to the affected source or emission unit for each of the three test runs and calculate and record the total weight. An owner or operator that chooses to demonstrate compliance on the basis of the aluminum production weight must measure the weight of aluminum produced by the emission unit or affected source instead of the feed/charge weight.
(l)
Continuous opacity monitoring system.
The owner or operator of an affected source or emission unit using a continuous opacity monitoring system must conduct a performance evaluation to demonstrate compliance with Performance Specification 1 in appendix B to 40 CFR part 60.

(1) Continuously measure and record the weight of gaseous or liquid reactive flux injected for each 15 minute period during the HCl, HF and D/F tests, determine and record the 15-minute block average weights, and calculate and record the total weight of the gaseous or liquid reactive flux for the 3 test runs;
(2) Record the identity, composition, and total weight of each addition of solid reactive flux for the 3 test runs;
(3) Determine the total reactive chlorine flux injection rate and, for uncontrolled furnaces, the total reactive fluorine flux injection rate by adding the recorded measurement of the total weight of chlorine and, for uncontrolled furnaces, fluorine in the gaseous or liquid reactive flux injected and the total weight of chlorine and, for uncontrolled furnaces, fluorine in the solid reactive flux using Equation 5:

= Weight of solid reactive flux;
(4) Divide the weight of total chlorine or fluorine usage (W
t
) for the 3 test runs by the recorded measurement of the total weight of feed for the 3 test runs; and

The owner or operator of an affected source or emission unit using a lime-injected fabric filter system must use these procedures during the HCl and D/F tests to establish an operating parameter value for the feeder setting for each operating cycle or time period used in the performance test.
(1) For continuous lime injection systems, ensure that lime in the feed hopper or silo is free-flowing at all times; and
(2) Record the feeder setting and lime injection rate for the 3 test runs. If the feed rate setting and lime injection rates vary between the runs, determine and record the average feed rate and lime injection rate from the 3 runs.

§ 63.1514
Change of furnace classification.
The requirements of this section are in addition to the other requirements of this subpart that apply to group 1 and group 2 furnaces.
(a)
Changing from a group 1 controlled furnace processing other than clean charge to group 1 uncontrolled furnace processing other than clean charge
. An owner or operator wishing to change operating modes must conduct performance tests in accordance with §§ 63.1511 and 63.1512 to demonstrate to the permitting authority for major sources, or the Administrator for area sources that compliance can be achieved under both modes. Operating parameters relevant to each mode of operation must be established during the performance test.
(1) Operators of major sources must conduct performance tests for PM, HCl and D/F, according to the procedures in § 63.1512(d) with the capture system and control device operating normally if compliance has not been previously demonstrated in this operating mode. Performance tests must be repeated at least once every 5 years to demonstrate compliance for each operating mode.
(i) Testing under this paragraph must be conducted in accordance with § 63.1511(b)(1) in the controlled mode.
(ii) Operating parameters must be established during these tests, as required by § 63.1511(g).
(iii) The emission factors for this mode of operation for use in the demonstration of compliance with the emission limits for SAPUs specified in § 63.1505(k) must be determined.
(2) Operators of major sources must conduct performance tests for PM, HCl, HF and D/F, according to the procedures in § 63.1512(e) without operating a control device if compliance has not been previously demonstrated for this operating mode. Performance tests must be repeated at least once every 5 years to demonstrate compliance for each operating mode.
(i) Testing under this paragraph must be conducted in accordance with § 63.1511(b)(1) in the uncontrolled mode.
(ii) Testing under this paragraph must be conducted with furnace emissions captured in accordance with the provisions of § 63.1506(c) and directed to the stack or vent tested.
(iii) Operating parameters representing uncontrolled operation must be established during these tests, as required by § 63.1511(g). For furnaces in batch (cyclic) operation, the number of tap-to-tap cycles (including zero, if none) elapsed using the feed/charge type, feed/charge rate and flux rate must be established as a parameter to be met before changing to uncontrolled mode. For furnaces in continuous (non-cyclic) operation, the time period elapsed (including no time, if none) using the feed/charge type, feed/charge rate and flux rate must be established as a parameter to be met before changing to uncontrolled mode.

(4) The lead emission rate in pounds per quarter is calculated by multiplying the quarterly lead emission rate in pounds per hour by the quarterly plant operating time, in hours as shown in Equation 1:
ER15NO11.000
Where:
E
Pb
= quarterly lead emissions, pounds per quarter;
ER
Pb
= quarterly lead emissions rate, pounds per hour; and
QPOT = quarterly plant operating time, hours per quarter.
(5) The lead production rate, in units of tons per quarter, must be determined based on production data for the previous quarter according to the procedures detailed in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section:

(iii) Total copper speiss production multiplied by the fractional lead content must be determined in units of tons.
(iv) Total quarterly lead production must be determined by summing the values obtained in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(6) To determine compliance with the production-based lead compound emission rate in § 63.1543(a), the quarterly production-based lead compound emission rate, in units of pounds of lead emissions per ton of lead produced, is calculated as shown in Equation 2 by dividing lead emissions by lead production.
ER15NO11.001
Where:
CE
Pb
= quarterly production-based lead compound emission rate, in units of pounds of lead emissions per ton of lead produced;
E
Pb

[76 FR 70858, Nov. 15, 2011]
§ 63.1551
Affirmative defense for exceedance of emission limit during malfunction.
In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in this subpart you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for civil penalties for exceedances of such standards that are caused by malfunction, as defined at 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be assessed, however, if you fail to meet your burden of proving all of the requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall not be available for claims for injunctive relief.
(a)
Affirmative defense.
To establish the affirmative defense in any action to enforce such a limit, you must timely meet the notification requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, and must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
(1) The excess emissions:
(i) Were caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of air pollution control and monitoring equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner, and
(ii) Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper design
or better operation and maintenance practices; and
(iii) Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been foreseen and avoided, or planned for; and
(iv) Were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate design, operation, or maintenance; and
(2) Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when the applicable emission limitations were being exceeded. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent practicable to make these repairs; and
(3) The frequency, amount and duration of the excess emissions (including any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable during periods of such emissions; and
(4) If the excess emissions resulted from a bypass of control equipment or a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; and
(5) All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the excess emissions on ambient air quality, the environment and human health; and
(6) All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices; and
(7) All of the actions in response to the excess emissions were documented by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs; and
(8) At all times, the facility was operated in a manner consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions; and
(9) A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the malfunction and the excess emissions resulting from the malfunction event at issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the result of the malfunction.
(b)
Notification.
The owner or operator of the facility experiencing an exceedance of its emission limit(s) during a malfunction shall notify the Administrator by telephone or facsimile (FAX) transmission as soon as possible, but no later than two business days after the initial occurrence of the malfunction, if it wishes to avail itself of an affirmative defense to civil penalties for that malfunction. The owner or operator seeking to assert an affirmative defense shall also submit a written report to the Administrator within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance of the standards in this subpart to demonstrate, with all necessary supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. The owner or operator may seek an extension of this deadline for up to 30 additional days by submitting a written request to the Administrator before the expiration of the 45 day period. Until a request for an extension has been approved by the Administrator, the owner or operator is subject to the requirement to submit such report within 45 days of the initial occurrence of the exceedance.

# Subpart UUU—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Petroleum Refineries: Catalytic Cracking Units, Catalytic Reforming Units, and Sulfur Recovery Units

# Source:
67 FR 17773, Apr. 11, 2002, unless otherwise noted.

# What This Subpart Covers
§ 63.1560
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from petroleum refineries. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission limitations and work practice standards.
§ 63.1561
Am I subject to this subpart?
(a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a petroleum refinery that is located at a major source of HAP emissions.
(1) A petroleum refinery is an establishment engaged primarily in petroleum refining as defined in the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 2911 and the North American Industry Classification (NAIC) code 32411, and used mainly for:
(i) Producing transportation fuels (such as gasoline, diesel fuels, and jet fuels), heating fuels (such as kerosene, fuel gas distillate, and fuel oils), or lubricants;
(ii) Separating petroleum; or
(iii) Separating, cracking, reacting, or reforming an intermediate petroleum stream, or recovering a by-product(s) from the intermediate petroleum stream (e.g., sulfur recovery).
(2) A major source of HAP is a plant site that emits or has the potential to
emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.
(b) [Reserved]
§ 63.1562
What parts of my plant are covered by this subpart?
(a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing affected source at a petroleum refinery.
(b) The affected sources are:
(1) The process vent or group of process vents on fluidized catalytic cracking units that are associated with regeneration of the catalyst used in the unit (
i.e.
, the catalyst regeneration flue gas vent).
(2) The process vent or group of process vents on catalytic reforming units (including but not limited to semi-regenerative, cyclic, or continuous processes) that are associated with regeneration of the catalyst used in the unit. This affected source includes vents that are used during the unit depressurization, purging, coke burn, and catalyst rejuvenation.
(3) The process vent or group of process vents on Claus or other types of sulfur recovery plant units or the tail gas treatment units serving sulfur recovery plants that are associated with sulfur recovery.
(4) Each bypass line serving a new, existing, or reconstructed catalytic cracking unit, catalytic reforming unit, or sulfur recovery unit. This means each vent system that contains a bypass line (e.g., ductwork) that could divert an affected vent stream away from a control device used to comply with the requirements of this subpart.
(c) An affected source is a new affected source if you commence construction of the affected source after September 11, 1998, and you meet the applicability criteria in § 63.1561 at the time you commenced construction.
(d) Any affected source is reconstructed if you meet the criteria in § 63.2.
(e) An affected source is existing if it is not new or reconstructed.
(f) This subpart does not apply to:
(1) A thermal catalytic cracking unit.
(2) A sulfur recovery unit that does not recover elemental sulfur or where the modified reaction is carried out in a water solution which contains a metal ion capable of oxidizing the sulfide ion to sulfur (e.g., the LO-CAT II process).
(3) A redundant sulfur recovery unit not located at a petroleum refinery and used by the refinery only for emergency or maintenance backup.
(4) Equipment associated with bypass lines such as low leg drains, high point bleed, analyzer vents, open-ended valves or lines, or pressure relief valves needed for safety reasons.
(5) Gaseous streams routed to a fuel gas system, provided that on and after January 30, 2019, any flares receiving gas from the fuel gas system are subject to § 63.670.
[67 FR 17773, Apr. 11, 2002, as amended at 70 FR 6938, Feb. 9, 2005; 80 FR 75273, Dec. 1, 2015]
§ 63.1563
When do I have to comply with this subpart?
(a) If you have a new or reconstructed affected source, you must comply with this subpart according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) If you startup your affected source before April 11, 2002, then you must comply with the emission limitations and work practice standards for new and reconstructed sources in this subpart no later than April 11, 2002 except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) If you startup your affected source after April 11, 2002, you must comply with the emission limitations and work practice standards for new and reconstructed sources in this subpart upon startup of your affected source except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(b) If you have an existing affected source, you must comply with the emission limitations and work practice standards for existing affected sources in this subpart by no later than April 11, 2005 except as specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
(c) We will grant an extension of compliance for an existing catalytic cracking unit allowing additional time to meet the emission limitations and work practice standards for catalytic
cracking units in §§ 63.1564 and 63.1565 if you commit to hydrotreating the catalytic cracking unit feedstock and to meeting the emission limitations of this subpart on the same date that your facility meets the final Tier 2 gasoline sulfur control standard (40 CFR part 80, subpart J). To obtain an extension, you must submit a written notification to your permitting authority according to the requirements in § 63.1574(e). Your notification must include the information in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) Identification of the affected source with a brief description of the controls to be installed (if needed) to comply with the emission limitations for catalytic cracking units in this subpart.

Conduct a performance test for HCN from each catalytic cracking unit no later than August 1, 2017 or within 150 days of startup of a new unit according to the applicable requirements in paragraphs (a)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) If you conducted a performance test for HCN for a specific catalytic cracking unit between March 31, 2011 and February 1, 2016, you may submit a request to the Administrator to use the previously conducted performance test
results to fulfill the one-time performance test requirement for HCN for each of the catalytic cracking units tested according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(6)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.
(A) The request must include a copy of the complete source test report, the date(s) of the performance test and the test methods used. If available, you must also indicate whether the catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator was operated in partial or complete combustion mode during the test, the control device configuration, including whether platinum or palladium combustion promoters were used during the test, and the CO concentration (measured using CO CEMS or manual test method) for each test run.
(B) You must submit a separate request for each catalytic cracking unit tested and you must submit each request to the Administrator no later than March 30, 2016.
(C) The Administrator will evaluate each request with respect to the completeness of the request, the completeness of the submitted test report and the appropriateness of the test methods used. The Administrator will notify the facility within 60 days of receipt of the request if it is approved or denied. If the Administrator fails to respond to the facility within 60 days of receipt of the request, the request will be automatically approved.
(D) If the request is approved, you do not need to conduct an additional HCN performance test. If the request is denied, you must conduct an additional HCN performance test following the requirements in (a)(6)(ii) of this section.
(ii) Unless you receive approval to use a previously conducted performance test to fulfill the one-time performance test requirement for HCN for your catalytic cracking unit as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section, conduct a performance test for HCN for each catalytic cracking unit no later than August 1, 2017 according to following requirements:
(A) Select sampling port location, determine volumetric flow rate, conduct gas molecular weight analysis and measure moisture content as specified in either Item 1 of Table 4 of this subpart or Item 1 of Table 11 of this subpart.
(B) Measure HCN concentration using Method 320 of appendix A of this part. The method ASTM D6348-03 (Reapproved 2010) including Annexes A1 through A8 (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 320 of appendix A of this part. The method ASTM D6348-12e1 (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14) is an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 320 of appendix A of this part with the following two caveats:
(
1
) The test plan preparation and implementation in the Annexes to ASTM D6348-03 (Reapproved 2010), Sections A1 through A8 are mandatory; and
(
2
) In ASTM D6348-03 (Reapproved 2010) Annex A5 (Analyte Spiking Technique), the percent (%) R must be determined for each target analyte (Equation A5.5). In order for the test data to be acceptable for a compound, %R must be 70% ≥ R ≤ 130%. If the %R value does not meet this criterion for a target compound, the test data is not acceptable for that compound and the test must be repeated for that analyte (
i.e.,
the sampling and/or analytical procedure should be adjusted before a retest). The %R value for each compound must be reported in the test report, and all field measurements must be corrected with the calculated %R value for that compound by using the following equation:
Reported Result = (Measured Concentration in the Stack × 100÷/% R.
(C) Measure CO concentration as specified in either Item 2 or 3a of Table 11 of this subpart.
(D) Record and include in the test report an indication of whether the catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerator was operated in partial or complete combustion mode and the control device configuration, including whether platinum or palladium combustion promoters were used during the test.
(b)
What are the general requirements for performance test and performance evaluations?
You must:
(1) Performance tests shall be conducted according to the provisions of § 63.7(e) except that performance tests shall be conducted at maximum representative operating capacity for the
process. During the performance test, you must operate the control device at either maximum or minimum representative operating conditions for monitored control device parameters, whichever results in lower emission reduction. You must not conduct a performance test during startup, shutdown, periods when the control device is bypassed or periods when the process, monitoring equipment or control device is not operating properly. You may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that the test was conducted at maximum representative operating capacity. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(2) Except for opacity and visible emission observations, conduct three separate test runs for each performance test as specified in § 63.7(e)(3). Each test run must last at least 1 hour.
(3) Conduct each performance evaluation according to the requirements in § 63.8(e).
(4) Calculate the average emission rate for the performance test by calculating the emission rate for each individual test run in the units of the applicable emission limitation using Equation 2, 5, or 8 of § 63.1564, and determining the arithmetic average of the calculated emission rates.
(c)
What procedures must I use for an engineering assessment?
You may choose to use an engineering assessment to calculate the process vent flow rate, net heating value, TOC emission rate, and total organic HAP emission rate expected to yield the highest daily emission rate when determining the emission reduction or outlet concentration for the organic HAP standard for catalytic reforming units. If you use an engineering assessment, you must document all data, assumptions, and procedures to the satisfaction of the applicable permitting authority. An engineering assessment may include the approaches listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section. Other engineering assessments may be used but are subject to review and approval by the applicable permitting authority.
(1) You may use previous test results provided the tests are representative of current operating practices at the process unit, and provided EPA methods or approved alternatives were used;
(2) You may use bench-scale or pilot-scale test data representative of the process under representative operating conditions;
(3) You may use maximum flow rate, TOC emission rate, organic HAP emission rate, or organic HAP or TOC concentration specified or implied within a permit limit applicable to the process vent; or
(4) You may use design analysis based on engineering principles, measurable process parameters, or physical or chemical laws or properties. Examples of analytical methods include, but are not limited to:
(i) Use of material balances based on process stoichiometry to estimate maximum TOC concentrations;
(ii) Calculation of hourly average maximum flow rate based on physical equipment design such as pump or blower capacities; and
(iii) Calculation of TOC concentrations based on saturation conditions.
(d)
Can I adjust the process or control device measured values when establishing an operating limit?
If you do a performance test to demonstrate compliance, you must base the process or control device operating limits for continuous parameter monitoring systems on the results measured during the performance test. You may adjust the values measured during the performance test according to the criteria in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) If you must meet the HAP metal emission limitations in § 63.1564, you elect the option in paragraph (a)(1)(v) in § 63.1564 (Ni lb/hr), and you use continuous parameter monitoring systems, you must establish an operating limit for the equilibrium catalyst Ni concentration based on the laboratory analysis of the equilibrium catalyst Ni concentration from the initial performance test. Section 63.1564(b)(2) allows you to adjust the laboratory measurements of the equilibrium catalyst Ni
concentration to the maximum level. You must make this adjustment using Equation 1 of this section as follows:
ER11AP02.017
Where:
Ecat-Limit = Operating limit for equilibrium catalyst Ni concentration, mg/kg;
NiEmR1
st
= Average Ni emission rate calculated as the arithmetic average Ni emission rate using Equation 5 of this section for each performance test run, g Ni/hr; and
Ecat
st
= Average equilibrium Ni concentration from laboratory test results, mg/kg.
(2) If you must meet the HAP metal emission limitations in § 63.1564, you elect the option in paragraph (a)(1)(vi) in § 63.1564 (Ni per coke burn-off), and you use continuous parameter monitoring systems, you must establish an operating limit for the equilibrium catalyst Ni concentration based on the laboratory analysis of the equilibrium catalyst Ni concentration from the initial performance test. Section 63.1564(b)(2) allows you to adjust the laboratory measurements of the equilibrium catalyst Ni concentration to the maximum level. You must make this adjustment using Equation 2 of this section as follows:
ER11AP02.018
Where:
NiEmR2
st
= Average Ni emission rate calculated as the arithmetic average Ni emission rate using Equation 8 of § 63.1564 for each performance test run, mg/kg coke burn-off.
(3) If you choose to adjust the equilibrium catalyst Ni concentration to the maximum level, you can't adjust any other monitored operating parameter (i.e., gas flow rate, voltage, pressure drop, liquid-to-gas ratio).
(4) Except as specified in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, if you use continuous parameter monitoring systems, you may adjust one of your monitored operating parameters (flow rate, total power and secondary current, pressure drop, liquid-to-gas ratio) from the average of measured values during the performance test to the maximum value (or minimum value, if applicable) representative of worst-case operating conditions, if necessary. This adjustment of measured values may be done using control device design specifications, manufacturer recommendations, or other applicable information. You must provide supporting documentation and rationale in your Notification of Compliance Status, demonstrating to the satisfaction of your permitting authority, that your affected source complies with the applicable emission limit at the operating limit based on adjusted values.
(e)
Can I change my operating limit?
You may change the established operating limit by meeting the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) You may change your established operating limit for a continuous parameter monitoring system by doing an additional performance test, a performance test in conjunction with an engineering assessment, or an engineering assessment to verify that, at the new operating limit, you are in compliance with the applicable emission limitation.
(2) You must establish a revised operating limit for your continuous parameter monitoring system if you make
any change in process or operating conditions that could affect control system performance or you change designated conditions after the last performance or compliance tests were done. You can establish the revised operating limit as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(3) You may change your site-specific opacity operating limit or Ni operating limit only by doing a new performance test.

You may also use this alternative to a continuous parameter monitoring system for the gas flow rate exiting the catalyst regenerator to determine inlet velocity to the primary internal cyclones as required in § 63.1564(c)(5) regardless of the configuration of the catalytic regenerator exhaust vent downstream of the regenerator (
i.e.,
regardless of whether or not any other gas streams are introduced into the catalyst regeneration vent). Except, if you only use this alternative to demonstrate compliance with § 63.1564(c)(5), you shall use this procedure for the performance test and for monitoring after the performance test. You shall:
(i) Install and operate a continuous parameter monitoring system to measure and record the hourly average volumetric air flow rate to the catalytic cracking unit or catalytic reforming unit regenerator. Or, you may determine and record the hourly average volumetric air flow rate to the catalytic cracking unit or catalytic reforming unit regenerator using the appropriate control room instrumentation.
(ii) Install and operate a continuous parameter monitoring system to measure and record the temperature of the gases entering the control device (or exiting the catalyst regenerator if you do not use an add-on control device).
(iii) Calculate and record the hourly average actual exhaust gas flow rate using Equation 1 of this section as follows:
ER09FE05.008
Where
Q
gas
= Hourly average actual gas flow rate, acfm;
1.12 = Default correction factor to convert gas flow from dry standard cubic feet per minute (dscfm) to standard cubic feet per minute (scfm);
Q
air
= Volumetric flow rate of air to regenerator, as determined from the control room instrumentations, dscfm;
Q
other
= Volumetric flow rate of other gases entering the regenerator as determined from the control room instrumentations, dscfm. (Examples of “other” gases include an oxygen-enriched air stream to catalytic cracking unit regenerators and a nitrogen stream to catalytic reforming unit regenerators.);
Temp
gas
= Temperature of gas stream in vent measured as near as practical to the control device or opacity monitor, °K. For wet scrubbers, temperature of gas prior to the wet scrubber; and
P
vent
= Absolute pressure in the vent measured as near as practical to the control device or opacity monitor, as applicable, atm. When used to assess the gas flow rate in the final atmospheric vent stack, you can assume P
vent
= 1 atm.
(2) You may use this alternative to calculating Q
r
, the volumetric flow rate of exhaust gas for the catalytic cracking regenerator as required in Equation 1 of § 63.1564, if you have a gas analyzer installed in the catalytic cracking regenerator exhaust vent prior to the addition of air or other gas streams. You may measure upstream or downstream of an electrostatic precipitator, but you shall measure upstream of a carbon monoxide boiler. You shall:
(i) Install and operate a continuous parameter monitoring system to measure and record the hourly average volumetric air flow rate to the catalytic cracking unit regenerator. Or, you can determine and record the hourly average volumetric air flow rate to the catalytic cracking unit regenerator using the catalytic cracking unit control room instrumentation.
(ii) Install and operate a continuous gas analyzer to measure and record the concentration of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and oxygen of the catalytic cracking regenerator exhaust.
(iii) Calculate and record the hourly average flow rate using Equation 2 of this section as follows:
ER09FE05.009
Where:
Q
r
= Volumetric flow rate of exhaust gas from the catalyst regenerator before adding air or gas streams, dscm/min (dscf/min);
79 = Default concentration of nitrogen and argon in dry air, percent by volume (dry basis);

Q
oxy
= Volumetric flow rate of oxygen-enriched air stream to regenerator as determined from the catalytic cracking unit control room instrumentations, dscm/min (dscf/min);
%CO

= Carbon dioxide concentration in regenerator exhaust, percent by volume (dry basis);
CO = Carbon monoxide concentration in regenerator exhaust, percent by volume (dry basis); and
%O
2
= Oxygen concentration in regenerator exhaust, percent by volume (dry basis).
(b)
What is the approved alternative for monitoring pressure drop?
You may use this alternative to a continuous parameter monitoring system for pressure drop if you operate a jet ejector type wet scrubber or other type of wet scrubber equipped with atomizing spray nozzles. You shall:
(1) Conduct a daily check of the air or water pressure to the spray nozzles;
(2) Maintain records of the results of each daily check; and
(3) Repair or replace faulty (
e.g.,
leaking or plugged) air or water lines within 12 hours of identification of an abnormal pressure reading.
(c)
What is the approved alternative for monitoring pH or alkalinity levels?
You may use the alternative in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section for a catalytic reforming unit.
(1) You shall measure and record the pH of the water (or scrubbing liquid) exiting the wet scrubber or internal scrubbing system at least once an hour during coke burn-off and catalyst rejuvenation using pH strips as an alternative to a continuous parameter monitoring system. The pH strips must meet the requirements in Table 41 of this subpart.

(d)
Can I use another type of monitoring system?
You may use an automated data compression system. An automated data compression system does not record monitored operating parameter values at a set frequency (
e.g.,
once every hour) but records all values that meet set criteria for variation from previously recorded values. You must maintain a record of the description of the monitoring system and data recording system, including the criteria used to determine which monitored values are recorded and retained, the method for calculating daily averages, and a demonstration that the system meets all of the criteria in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section:
(1) The system measures the operating parameter value at least once every hour;
(2) The system records at least 24 values each day during periods of operation;
(3) The system records the date and time when monitors are turned off or on;
(4) The system recognizes unchanging data that may indicate the monitor is not functioning properly, alerts the operator, and records the incident; and
(5) The system computes daily average values of the monitored operating parameter based on recorded data.
(e)
Can I monitor other process or control device operating parameters?
You may request approval to monitor parameters other than those required in this subpart. You must request approval if:
(1) You use a control device other than a thermal incinerator, boiler, process heater, flare, electrostatic precipitator, or wet scrubber;
(2) You use a combustion control device (e.g., incinerator, flare, boiler or process heater with a design heat capacity of at least 44 MW, boiler or process heater where the vent stream is introduced into the flame zone), electrostatic precipitator, or scrubber but want to monitor a parameter other than those specified; or
(3) You wish to use another type of continuous emission monitoring system that provides direct measurement of a pollutant (i.e., a PM or multi-metals HAP continuous emission monitoring system, a carbonyl sulfide/carbon disulfide continuous emission monitoring system, a TOC continuous emission monitoring system, or HCl continuous emission monitoring system).
(f)
How do I request to monitor alternative parameters?
You must submit a request for review and approval or disapproval to the Administrator. The request must include the information in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) A description of each affected source and the parameter(s) to be monitored to determine whether the affected source will continuously comply with the emission limitations and an explanation of the criteria used to select the parameter(s).
(2) A description of the methods and procedures that will be used to demonstrate that the parameter can be used to determine whether the affected source will continuously comply with the emission limitations and the schedule for this demonstration. You must
certify that you will establish an operating limit for the monitored parameter(s) that represents the conditions in existence when the control device is being properly operated and maintained to meet the emission limitation.
(3) The frequency and content of monitoring, recording, and reporting, if monitoring and recording are not continuous. You also must include the rationale for the proposed monitoring, recording, and reporting requirements.
(4) Supporting calculations.

(g)
How do I apply for alternative monitoring requirements if my catalytic cracking unit is equipped with a wet scrubber and I have approved alternative monitoring requirements under the new source performance standards for petroleum refineries?
(1) You may request alternative monitoring requirements according to the procedures in this paragraph if you meet each of the conditions in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section:
(i) Your fluid catalytic cracking unit regenerator vent is subject to the PM limit in 40 CFR 60.102(a)(1) and uses a wet scrubber for PM emissions control;
(ii) You have alternative monitoring requirements for the continuous opacity monitoring system requirement in 40 CFR 60.105(a)(1) approved by the Administrator; and
(iii) You are required by this subpart to install, operate, and maintain a continuous opacity monitoring system for the same catalytic cracking unit regenerator vent for which you have approved alternative monitoring requirements.
(2) You can request approval to use an alternative monitoring method prior to submitting your notification of compliance status, in your notification of compliance status, or at any time.
(3) You must submit a copy of the approved alternative monitoring requirements along with a monitoring plan that includes a description of the continuous monitoring system or method, including appropriate operating parameters that will be monitored, test results demonstrating compliance with the opacity limit used to establish an enforceable operating limit(s), and the frequency of measuring and recording to establish continuous compliance. If applicable, you must also include operation and maintenance requirements for the continuous monitoring system.
(4) We will contact you within 30 days of receipt of your application to inform you of approval or of our intent to disapprove your request.

All other performance test and performance evaluation results (
i.e.,
those not supported by EPA's ERT) must be reported in the Notification of Compliance Status.
(b) As specified in § 63.9(b)(2), if you startup your new affected source before April 11, 2002, you must submit the initial notification no later than August 9, 2002, or no later than 120 days after the source becomes subject to this subpart, whichever is later.
(c) If you startup your new or reconstructed affected source on or after April 11, 2002, you must submit the initial notification no later than 120 days after you become subject to this subpart.
(d) You also must include the information in Table 42 of this subpart in your notification of compliance status.

The purpose of this plan is to detail the operation, maintenance, and monitoring procedures you will follow.
(1) You must submit the plan to your permitting authority for review and approval along with your notification of compliance status. While you do not have to include the entire plan in your permit under part 70 or 71 of this chapter, you must include the duty to prepare and implement the plan as an applicable requirement in your part 70 or 71 operating permit. You must submit any changes to your permitting authority for review and approval and comply with the plan as submitted until the change is approved.
(2) Each plan must include, at a minimum, the information specified in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (xii) of this section.
(i) Process and control device parameters to be monitored for each affected source, along with established operating limits.
(ii) Procedures for monitoring emissions and process and control device operating parameters for each affected source.
(iii) Procedures that you will use to determine the coke burn-rate, the volumetric flow rate (if you use process data rather than direct measurement), and the rate of combustion of liquid or solid fossil fuels if you use an incinerator-waste heat boiler to burn the exhaust gases from a catalyst regenerator.

This plan must include procedures you will use for calibrations, accuracy audits, and adjustments to the system needed to meet applicable requirements for the system.
(x) Maintenance schedule for each monitoring system and control device for each affected source that is generally consistent with the manufacturer's instructions for routine and long-term maintenance.
(xi) If you use a fixed-bed gas-solid adsorption system to control emissions from a catalytic reforming unit, you must implement corrective action procedures if the HCl concentration measured at the selected compliance monitoring sampling location within the bed exceeds the operating limit. These procedures must require, at minimum, repeat measurement and recording of the HCl concentration in the adsorption system exhaust gases and at the selected compliance monitoring sampling location within the bed. If the HCl concentration at the selected compliance monitoring location within the bed is above the operating limit during the repeat measurement while the HCl concentration in the adsorption system exhaust gases remains below the operating limit, the adsorption bed must be replaced as soon as practicable. Your procedures must specify the sampling frequency that will be used to monitor the HCl concentration in the adsorption system exhaust gases subsequent to the repeat measurement and prior to replacement of the sorbent material (but not less frequent than once every 4 hours during coke burn-off). If the HCl concentration of the adsorption system exhaust gases is above the operating limit when measured at any time, the adsorption bed must be replaced within 24 hours or before the next regeneration cycle, whichever is longer.
(xii) Procedures that will be used for purging the catalyst if you do not use a control device to comply with the organic HAP emission limits for catalytic reforming units. These procedures will include, but are not limited to, specification of the minimum catalyst temperature and the minimum cumulative volume of gas per mass of catalyst used for purging prior to uncontrolled releases (i.e., during controlled purging events); the maximum purge gas temperature for uncontrolled purge events; and specification of the monitoring systems that will be used to monitor and record data during each purge event.

If you claim that some of the performance evaluation information being submitted is CBI, you must submit a complete file generated through the use of the EPA's ERT or an alternate electronic file consistent with the XML schema listed on the EPA's ERT Web site, including information claimed to be CBI, on a compact disc, flash drive or other commonly used electronic storage media to the EPA. The electronic storage media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to U.S. EPA/OAQPS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: Group Leader, Measurement Policy Group, MD C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703.
The same ERT or alternate file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (k)(2)(i).
(ii) For any performance evaluations of continuous monitoring systems measuring RATA pollutants that are not supported by the EPA's ERT as listed on the EPA's ERT Web site at the time of the evaluation, you must submit the results of the performance evaluation to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in § 63.13.
(l)
Extensions to electronic reporting deadlines.
(1) If you are required to electronically submit a report through the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI) in the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX), and due to a planned or actual outage of either the EPA's CEDRI or CDX systems within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date that the submission is due, you will be or are precluded from accessing CEDRI or CDX and submitting a required report within the time prescribed, you may assert a claim of EPA system outage for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying the date(s) and time(s) the CDX or CEDRI were unavailable when you attempted to access it in the 5 business days prior to the submission deadline; a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the EPA system outage; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved. The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(2) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX and a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning 5 business days prior to the date the submission is due, the owner or operator may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. For the purposes of this section, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (
e.g.,
hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (
e.g.,
large scale power outage). If you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the force majeure event occurs. The decision to accept the claim of force majeure and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.

Catalytic reforming unit regenerator
means one or more regenerators which
comprise that portion of the catalytic reforming unit and ancillary equipment in which the following regeneration steps typically are performed: depressurization, purge, coke burn-off, catalyst rejuvenation with a chloride (or other halogenated) compound(s), and a final purge. The catalytic reforming unit catalyst regeneration process can be done either as a semi-regenerative, cyclic, or continuous regeneration process.

1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable to the determination of analyte concentrations on catalyst particles. This method is applicable for catalyst particles obtained from the fluid catalytic cracking unit
(FCCU) regenerator (
i.e.
, equilibrium catalyst), from air pollution control systems operated for the FCCU catalyst regenerator vent (FCCU fines), from catalytic reforming units (CRU), and other processes as specified within an applicable regulation. This method is applicable only when specified within the regulation.
1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from the analytical method.

# 2.0 Summary of Method.
2.1 A representative sample of catalyst particles is collected, prepared, and analyzed for analyte concentration using either energy or wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescent (XRF) spectrometry instrumental analyzers. In both types of XRF spectrometers, the instrument irradiates the sample with high energy (primary) x-rays and the elements in the sample absorb the x-rays and then re-emit secondary (fluorescent) x-rays of characteristic wavelengths for each element present. In energy dispersive XRF spectrometers, all secondary x-rays (of all wavelengths) enter the detector at once. The detector registers an electric current having a height proportional to the photon energy, and these pulses are then separated electronically, using a pulse analyzer. In wavelength dispersive XRF spectrometers, the secondary x-rays are dispersed spatially by crystal diffraction on the basis of wavelength. The crystal and detector are made to synchronously rotate and the detector then receives only one wavelength at a time. The intensity of the x-rays emitted by each element is proportional to its concentration, after correcting for matrix effects. For nickel compounds and total chlorides, the XRF instrument response is expected to be linear to analyte concentration. Performance specifications and test procedures are provided to ensure reliable data.

# 3.0 Definitions.
3.1 Measurement System. The total equipment required for the determination of analyte concentration. The measurement system consists of the following major subsystems:
3.1.1 Sample Preparation. That portion of a system used for one or more of the following: sample acquisition, sample transport, sample conditioning, or sample preparation prior to introducing the sample into the analyzer.
3.1.2 Analyzer. That portion of the system that senses the analyte to be measured and generates an output proportional to its concentration.
3.1.3 Data Recorder. A digital recorder or personal computer used for recording measurement data from the analyzer output.
3.2 Span. The upper limit of the gas concentration measurement range displayed on the data recorder.
3.3 Calibration Standards. Prepared catalyst samples or other samples of known analyte concentrations used to calibrate the analyzer and to assess calibration drift.
3.4 Energy Calibration Standard. Calibration standard, generally provided by the XRF instrument manufacturer, used for assuring accuracy of the energy scale.
3.5 Accuracy Assessment Standard. Prepared catalyst sample or other sample of known analyte concentrations used to assess analyzer accuracy error.
3.6 Zero Drift. The difference in the measurement system output reading from the initial value for zero concentration level calibration standard after a stated period of operation during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment took place.
3.7 Calibration Drift. The difference in the measurement system output reading from the initial value for the mid-range calibration standard after a stated period of operation during which no unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment took place.
3.8 Spectral Interferences. Analytical interferences and excessive biases caused by elemental peak overlap, escape peak, and sum peak interferences between elements in the samples.
3.9 Calibration Curve. A graph or other systematic method of establishing the relationship between the analyzer response and the actual analyte concentration introduced to the analyzer.
3.10 Analyzer Accuracy Error. The difference in the measurement system output reading and the ideal value for the accuracy assessment standard.

# 4.0 Interferences.
4.1 Spectral interferences with analyte line intensity determination are accounted for within the method program. No action is required by the XRF operator once these interferences have been addressed within the method.
4.2 The X-ray production efficiency is affected by particle size for the very lightest elements. However, particulate matter (PM) 2.5 particle size effects are substantially
1 percent for most elements. The calibration standards should be prepared with material of similar particle size or be processed (ground) to produce material of similar particle size as the catalyst samples to be analyzed. No additional correction for particle size is performed. Alternatively, the sample can be fused in order to eliminate any potential particle size effects.

# 5.0 Safety.
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
5.2 X-ray Exposure. The XRF uses X-rays; XRF operators should follow instrument manufacturer's guidelines to protect from accidental exposure to X-rays when the instrument is in operation.
5.3 Beryllium Window. In most XRF units, a beryllium (Be) window is present to separate the sample chamber from the X-ray tube and detector. The window is very fragile and brittle. Do not allow sample or debris to fall onto the window, and avoid using compressed air to clean the window because it will cause the window to rupture. If the window should rupture, note that Be metal is poisonous. Use extreme caution when collecting pieces of Be and consult the instrument manufacturer for advice on cleanup of the broken window and replacement.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies.
6.1 Measurement System. Use any measurement system that meets the specifications of this method listed in section 13. The typical components of the measurement system are described below.
6.1.1 Sample Mixer/Mill. Stainless steel, or equivalent to grind/mix catalyst and binders, if used, to produce uniform particle samples.
6.1.2 Sample Press/Fluxer. Stainless steel, or equivalent to produce pellets of sufficient size to fill analyzer sample window, or alternatively, a fusion device capable of preparing a fused disk of sufficient size to fill analyzer sample window.
6.1.3 Analytical Balance. ±0.0001 gram accuracy for weighing prepared samples (pellets).
6.1.4 Analyzer. An XRF spectrometer to determine the analyte concentration in the prepared sample. The analyzer must meet the applicable performance specifications in section 13.
6.1.5 Data Recorder. A digital recorder or personal computer for recording measurement data. The data recorder resolution (
i.e.
, readability) must be 0.5 percent of span. Alternatively, a digital or analog meter having a resolution of 0.5 percent of span may be used to obtain the analyzer responses and the readings may be recorded manually.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards.
7.1 Calibration Standards. The calibration standards for the analyzer must be prepared catalyst samples or other material of similar particle size and matrix as the catalyst samples to be tested that have known concentrations of the analytes of interest. Preparation (grinding/milling/fusion) of the calibration standards should follow the same processes used to prepare the catalyst samples to be tested. The calibration standards values must be established as the average of a minimum of three analyses using an approved EPA or ASTM method with instrument analyzer calibrations traceable to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), if available. The maximum percent deviation of the triplicate calibration standard analyses should agree within 10 percent of the average value for the triplicate analysis (see Figure 1). If the calibration analyses do not meet this criteria, the calibration standards must be re-analyzed. If unacceptable variability persists, new calibration standards must be prepared. Approved methods for the calibration standard analyses include, but are not limited to, EPA Methods 6010B, 6020, 7520, or 7521 of SW-846.
1
Use a minimum of four calibration standards as specified below (see Figure 1):
7.1.1 High-Range Calibration Standard. Concentration equivalent to 80 to 100 percent of the span. The concentration of the high-range calibration standard should exceed the maximum concentration anticipated in the catalyst samples.
7.1.2 Mid-Range Calibration Standard. Concentration equivalent to 40 to 60 percent of the span.
7.1.3 Low-Range Calibration Standard. Concentration equivalent to 1 to 20 percent of the span. The concentration of the low-range calibration standard should be selected so that it is less than either one-fourth of the applicable concentration limit or of the lowest concentration anticipated in the catalyst samples.
7.1.4 Zero Calibration Standard. Concentration of less than 0.25 percent of the span.
7.2 Accuracy Assessment Standard. Prepare an accuracy assessment standard and determine the ideal value for the accuracy assessment standard following the same procedures used to prepare and analyze the calibration standards as described in section 7.1. The maximum percent deviation of the triplicate accuracy assessment standard analyses should agree within 10 percent of the average value for the triplicate analysis (see Figure 1). The concentration equivalent of the accuracy assessment standard must be between 20 and 80 percent of the span.
7.3 Energy Calibration Standard. Generally, the energy calibration standard will be provided by the XRF instrument manufacturer for energy dispersive spectrometers. Energy calibration is performed using the manufacturer's recommended calibration standard and involves measurement of a specific energy line (based on the metal in the
energy calibration standard). This is generally an automated procedure used to assure the accuracy of the energy scale. This calibration standard may not be applicable to all models of XRF spectrometers (particularly wavelength dispersive XRF spectrometers).

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage. [Reserved]

# 9.0 Quality Control.
9.1 Energy Calibration. For energy dispersive spectrometers, conduct the energy calibration by analyzing the energy calibration standard provided by the manufacturer. The energy calibration involves measurement of a specific energy line (based on the metal in the energy calibration standard) and then determination of the difference between the measured peak energy value and the ideal value. This analysis, if applicable, should be performed daily prior to any sample analyses to check the instrument's energy scale. This is generally an automated procedure and assures the accuracy of the energy scale. If the energy scale calibration process is not automated, follow the manufacturer's procedures to manually adjust the instrument, as necessary.
9.2 Zero Drift Test. Conduct the zero drift test by analyzing the analyte concentration output by the measurement system with the initial calibration value for the zero calibration standard (see Figure 2). This analysis should be performed with each set of samples analyzed.
9.3 Calibration Drift Test. Conduct the calibration drift test by analyzing the analyte concentration output by the measurement system with the initial calibration value for the mid-range calibration standard (see Figure 2). This analysis should be performed with each set of samples analyzed.
9.4 Analyzer Accuracy Test. Conduct the analyzer accuracy test by analyzing the accuracy assessment standard and comparing the value output by the measurement system with the ideal value for the accuracy assessment standard (see Figure 2). This analysis should be performed with each set of samples analyzed.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization.
10.1 Perform the initial calibration and set-up following the instrument manufacturer's instructions. These procedures should include, at a minimum, the major steps listed in sections 10.2 and 10.3. Subsequent calibrations are to be performed when either a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) limit listed in section 13 is exceeded or when there is a change in the excitation conditions, such as a change in the tube, detector, X-ray filters, or signal processor. Calibrations are typically valid for 6 months to 1 year.
10.2 Instrument Calibration. Calibration is performed initially with calibration standards of similar matrix and binders, if used, as the samples to be analyzed (see Figure 1).
10.3 Reference Peak Spectra. Acquisition of reference spectra is required only during the initial calibration. As long as no processing methods have changed, these peak shape references remain valid. This procedure consists of placing the standards in the instrument and acquiring individual elemental spectra that are stored in the method file with each of the analytical conditions. These reference spectra are used in the standard deconvolution of the unknown spectra.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure.
11.1 Sample Preparation. Prepare catalyst samples using the same procedure used to prepare the calibration standards. Measure and record the weight of sample used. Measure and record the amount of binder, if any, used. Pellets or films must be of sufficient size to cover the analyzer sample window.
11.2 Sample Analyses. Place the prepared catalyst samples into the analyzer. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for analyzing the samples.
11.3 Record and Store Data. Use a digital recorder or personal computer to record and store results for each sample. Record any mechanical or software problems encountered during the analysis.

# 12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations.
Carry out the following calculations, retaining at least one extra significant figure beyond that of the acquired data. Round off figures after final calculation.
12.1 Drift. Calculate the zero and calibration drift for the tests described in sections 9.2 and 9.3 (see also Figure 2) as follows:
ER09FE05.010
Where:
CurrentAnalyzerCal.Response = Instrument response for current QC sample analyses;
InitialCal.Response = Initial instrument response for calibration standard;
QC Value = QC metric (zero drift or calibration drift), percent of span;
Span = Span of the monitoring system.
12.2 Analyzer Accuracy. Calculate the analyzer accuracy error for the tests described in section 9.4 (see also Figure 2) as follows:
ER09FE05.011
Where:
Accuracy Value = Percent difference of instrument response to the ideal response for the accuracy assessment standard;
CurrentAnalyzerCal.Response = Instrument response for current QC sample analyses;
IdealCal.Response = Ideal instrument response for the accuracy assessment standard.

# 13.0 Method Performance.
13.1 Analytical Range. The analytical range is determined by the instrument design. For this method, a portion of the analytical range is selected by choosing the span of the monitoring system. The span of the monitoring system must be selected such that it encompasses the range of concentrations anticipated to occur in the catalyst sample. If applicable, the span must be selected such that the analyte concentration equivalent to the emission standard is not less than 30 percent of the span. If the measured analyte concentration exceeds the concentration of the high-range calibration standard, the sample analysis is considered invalid. Additionally, if the measured analyte concentration is less than the concentration of the low-range calibration standard but above the detectable limit, the sample analysis results must be flagged with a footnote stating, in effect, that the analyte was detected but that the reported concentration is below the lower quantitation limit.
13.2 Minimum Detectable Limit. The minimum detectable limit depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurement system. For a well-designed system, the minimum detectable limit should be less than 2 percent of the span.
13.3 Zero Drift. Less than ±2 percent of the span.
13.4 Calibration Drift. Less than ±5 percent of the span.
13.5 Analyzer Accuracy Error. Less than ±10 percent.

# Subpart VVV—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Publicly Owned Treatment Works

# Source:
82 FR 49525, Oct. 26, 2017, unless otherwise noted.

# Applicability
§ 63.1580
Am I subject to this subpart?
(a) You are subject to this subpart if the following are all true:
(1) You own or operate a publicly owned treatment works (POTW) that includes an affected source (§ 63.1595);
(2) The affected source is located at a Group 2 POTW which is a major source of HAP emissions, or at any Group 1 POTW regardless of whether or not it is a major source of HAP; and
(3) Your POTW is required to develop and implement a pretreatment program as defined by 40 CFR 403.8, or your POTW meets the general criteria for development and implementation of a pretreatment program.
(b) If your existing POTW treatment plant is not located at a major source as of October 26, 1999, but thereafter becomes a major source for any reason other than reconstruction, then, for the purpose of this subpart, your POTW treatment plant would be considered an existing source.

# Note to paragraph (
b

# ):
See § 63.2 of the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) General Provisions in subpart A of this part for the definitions of major source and area source.
(c) If you commence construction or reconstruction of your POTW treatment plant after December 1, 1998, then the requirements for a new POTW apply.
§ 63.1581
Does the subpart distinguish between different types of POTW treatment plants?
Yes, POTW treatment plants are divided into two subcategories: Group 1 POTW treatment plants and Group 2 POTW treatment plants, as described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
(a) Your POTW is a Group 1 POTW treatment plant if an industrial user complies with its NESHAP by using the treatment and controls located at your POTW treatment plant. Your POTW treatment plant accepts the regulated waste stream and provides treatment and controls as an agent for the industrial user. Group 1 POTW treatment plant is defined in § 63.1595.
(b) Your POTW is a Group 2 POTW treatment plant if your POTW treats wastewater that is not subject to control by another NESHAP or the industrial user does not comply with its NESHAP by using the treatment and controls located at your POTW treatment plant. “Group 2 POTW treatment plant” is defined in § 63.1595.
(c) If, in the future, an industrial user complies with its NESHAP by using the treatment and controls located at your POTW treatment plant, then your Group 2 POTW treatment plant becomes a Group 1 POTW treatment plant on the date your POTW begins treating that regulated industrial wastewater stream.

# Requirements for Group 1 POTW Treatment Plants
§ 63.1582
[Reserved]
§ 63.1583
What are the emission points and control requirements for a Group 1 POTW treatment plant?
(a) The emission points and control requirements for an existing Group 1 POTW treatment plant are specified in the appropriate NESHAP for the industrial user(s).
(b) The emission points and control requirements for a new Group 1 POTW treatment plant are both those specified by the appropriate NESHAP which apply to the industrial user(s) who discharge their waste for treatment to the POTW, and those emission points and control requirements set forth in § 63.1586(b) or (c), as applicable.
(c) If your existing or new Group 1 POTW treatment plant accepts one or more specific regulated industrial waste streams as part of compliance with one or more other NESHAP, then you are subject to all the requirements of each appropriate NESHAP for each waste stream.
(d) At all times, the POTW must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the POTW to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
§ 63.1584
[Reserved]
§ 63.1585
How does a Group 1 POTW treatment plant demonstrate compliance?
(a) An existing Group 1 POTW treatment plant demonstrates compliance by operating treatment and control devices which meet all requirements specified in the appropriate NESHAP. Requirements may include performance tests, routine monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.
(b) A new Group 1 POTW treatment plant demonstrates compliance by operating treatment and control devices which meet all requirements specified in the appropriate NESHAP and by meeting the requirements specified in § 63.1586, as applicable, as well as the applicable requirements in §§ 63.1588 through 63.1595.

# Requirements for Group 1 and Group 2 POTW Treatment Plants
§ 63.1586
What are the emission points and control requirements for a Group 1 or Group 2 POTW?
(a) An existing Group 1 or Group 2 POTW treatment plant must comply with the initial notification requirements in § 63.1591(a).
(b)
Cover and control standard.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, new Group 1 and Group 2 POTW treatment plants must install covers on the emission points up to, but not including, the secondary influent pumping station or the secondary treatment units. These emission points are treatment units that include, but are not limited to, influent waste stream conveyance channels, bar screens, grit chambers, grinders, pump stations, aerated feeder channels, primary clarifiers, primary effluent channels, and primary screening stations. In addition, all covered units, except primary clarifiers, must have the air in the headspace underneath the cover ducted to a control device in accordance with the standards for closed-vent systems and control devices in § 63.693 of subpart DD—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Off-site Waste and Recovery Operations of this part, except you may substitute visual inspections for leak detection rather than Method 21 of appendix A-7 of part 60 of this chapter. Covers must meet the following requirements:
(1) Covers must be tightly fitted and designed and operated to prevent exposure of the wastewater to the atmosphere. This includes, but is not limited
to, the absence of visible cracks, holes, or gaps in the roof sections or between the roof and the supporting wall; broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged seals or gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing hatches, access covers, caps, or other closure devices.
(2) If wastewater is in a treatment unit, each opening in the cover must be maintained in a closed, sealed position, unless plant personnel are present and conducting wastewater or sludge sampling, or equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair.
(c)
HAP fraction emitted standard.
As an alternative to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, a new Group 1 and Group 2 POTW treatment plant may comply by demonstrating, for all emission points up to, but not including, the secondary influent pumping station or the secondary treatment units, that the annual rolling average HAP fraction emitted (calculated as specified in § 63.1588(c)(3)) does not exceed 0.014. You must demonstrate that for your POTW treatment plant, the sum of all HAP emissions from these units divided by the sum of all HAP mass loadings to the POTW treatment plant results in an annual rolling average of the HAP fraction emitted of no greater than 0.014. You may use any combination of pretreatment, wastewater treatment plant modifications, and control devices to achieve this performance standard.
(d) At all times, the POTW must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the POTW to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if the requirements of the applicable standard have been met. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator, which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
§ 63.1587
When do I have to comply?
Sources subject to this subpart are required to achieve compliance on or before the dates specified in table 2 of this subpart.
§ 63.1588
How do Group 1 and Group 2 POTW treatment plants demonstrate compliance?
(a) If you are complying with § 63.1586(b) by using covers, you must conduct the following inspections:
(1) You must visually check the cover and its closure devices for defects that could result in air emissions. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in the roof sections or between the roof and the supporting wall; broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged seals or gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing hatches, access covers, caps, or other closure devices.
(2) You must perform an initial visual inspection within 60 calendar days of becoming subject to this NESHAP and perform follow-up inspections at least once per year, thereafter.
(3) In the event that you find a defect on a cover on a treatment unit in use, you must repair the defect within 45 calendar days. If you cannot repair within 45 calendar days, you must notify the EPA or the delegated authority immediately and report the reason for the delay and the date you expect to complete the repair. If you find a defect on a cover on a treatment unit that is not in service, you must repair the defect prior to putting the treatment unit back in wastewater service.
(b) If you own or operate a control device used to meet the requirements for § 63.1586(b), you must comply with the inspection and monitoring requirements of § 63.695(c) of subpart DD of this part.
(c) To comply with the HAP fraction emitted standard specified in § 63.1586(c), you must develop, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, an Inspection and Monitoring Plan. This Inspection and Monitoring Plan must include, at a minimum, the following:
(1) A method to determine the influent HAP mass loading,
i.e.,
the annual
mass quantity for each HAP entering the wastewater treatment plant.
(2) A method to determine your POTW treatment plant's annual HAP emissions for all units up to, but not including, the secondary influent pumping station or the secondary treatment units. The method you use to determine your HAP emissions, such as modeling or direct source measurement, must:
(i) Be approved by the Administrator for use at your POTW;
(ii) Account for all factors affecting emissions from your POTW treatment plant including, but not limited to, emissions from wastewater treatment units; emissions resulting from inspection, maintenance, and repair activities; fluctuations (e.g., daily, monthly, annual, seasonal) in your influent wastewater HAP concentrations; annual industrial loading; performance of control devices; or any other factors that could affect your annual HAP emissions; and
(iii) Include documentation that the values and sources of all data, operating conditions, assumptions, etc., used in your method result in an accurate estimation of annual emissions from your POTW treatment plant.
(3) A method to demonstrate that your POTW treatment plant meets the HAP fraction emitted standard specified in § 63.1586(c),
i.e.,
the sum of all HAP emissions from paragraph (c)(2) of this section divided by the sum of all HAP mass loadings from paragraph (c)(1) of this section results in a fraction emitted of 0.014 or less to demonstrate compliance with § 63.1586(c). The Inspection and Monitoring Plan must require, at a minimum, that you perform the calculations shown in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (viii) of this section within 90 days of the end of each month. This calculation shall demonstrate that your annual rolling average of the HAP fraction emitted is 0.014 or less when demonstrating compliance with § 63.1586(c).
(i) Determine the average daily flow in million gallons per day (MGD) of the wastewater entering your POTW treatment plant for the month;
(ii) Determine the flow-weighted monthly concentration of each HAP listed in Table 1 to subpart DD of this part that is reasonably anticipated to be present in your influent;
(iii) Using the information in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, determine a total annual flow-weighted loading in pounds per day (lbs/day) of each HAP entering your POTW treatment plant;
(iv) Sum up the values for each individual HAP loading in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section and determine a total annual flow-weighted loading value (lbs/day) for all HAP entering your POTW treatment plant for the current month;
(v) Based on the current month's information in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section along with source testing and emission modeling, for each HAP, determine the annual emissions (lbs/day) from all wastewater units up to, but not including, secondary treatment units;
(vi) Sum up the values in paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section and calculate the total annual emissions value for the month for all HAP from all wastewater treatment units up to, but not including, secondary treatment units;
(vii) Calculate the HAP fraction emitted value for the month, using Equation 1 of this section as follows:
ER26OC17.018
Where:
f
e
monthly = HAP fraction emitted for the previous month
∑E = Total HAP emissions value from paragraph (c)(3)(vi) of this section
∑L = Total annual loading from paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section
(viii) Average the HAP fraction emitted value for the month determined in paragraph (c)(3)(vii) of this section, with the values determined for the previous 11 months, to calculate an annual rolling average of the HAP fraction emitted.
(4) A method to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that your POTW treatment plant is in continuous compliance with the requirements of § 63.1586(c). Continuous compliance means that your emissions, when averaged over the course of a year, do not exceed the level of emissions that allows your POTW to comply with § 63.1586(c). For example, you may identify a parameter(s) that you
can monitor that assures your emissions, when averaged over the entire year, will meet the requirements in § 63.1586(c). Some example parameters that may be considered for monitoring include your wastewater influent HAP concentration and flow, industrial loading from your permitted industrial users, and your control device performance criteria. Where emission reductions are due to proper operation of equipment, work practices, or other operational procedures, your demonstration must specify the frequency of inspections and the number of days to completion of repairs.
(d) Prior to receiving approval on the Inspection and Monitoring Plan, you must follow the plan submitted to the Administrator as specified in § 63.1590(f).
§ 63.1589
What records must I keep?
(a) To comply with the cover and control standard specified in § 63.1586(b), you must prepare and maintain the records required in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section:
(1) A record for each treatment unit inspection required by § 63.1588(a). You must include a treatment unit identification number (or other unique identification description as selected by you) and the date of inspection.
(2) For each defect detected during inspections required by § 63.1588(a), you must record the location of the defect, a description of the defect, the date of detection, the corrective action taken to repair the defect, and the date the repair to correct the defect is completed.
(3) If repair of the defect is delayed as described in § 63.1588(a)(3), you must also record the reason for the delay and the date you expect to complete the repair.
(4) If you own or operate a control device used to meet the requirements for § 63.1586(b), you must comply with the recordkeeping requirements of § 63.696(a), (b), (g), and (h).

You must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description identifying the date, time and length of the outage; a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the EPA system outage; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the
date you reported. In any circumstance, the report must be submitted electronically as soon as possible after the outage is resolved. The decision to accept the claim of EPA system outage and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.
(h) If you are required to electronically submit a report through CEDRI in the EPA's CDX and a force majeure event is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred or there are lingering effects from such an event within the period of time beginning five business days prior to the date the submission is due, the owner or operator may assert a claim of force majeure for failure to timely comply with the reporting requirement. For the purposes of this section, a force majeure event is defined as an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents you from complying with the requirement to submit a report electronically within the time period prescribed. Examples of such events are acts of nature (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods), acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility (e.g., large scale power outage). If you intend to assert a claim of force majeure, you must submit notification to the Administrator in writing as soon as possible following the date you first knew, or through due diligence should have known, that the event may cause or caused a delay in reporting. You must provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the delay in reporting beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure event; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay in reporting; and identify a date by which you propose to report, or if you have already met the reporting requirement at the time of the notification, the date you reported. In any circumstance, the reporting must occur as soon as possible after the force majeure event occurs. The decision to accept the claim of force majeure and allow an extension to the reporting deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator.

§ 63.1595
List of definitions.
As used in this subpart:
Affected source
means the group of all equipment that comprise the POTW treatment plant.
Cover
means a device that prevents or reduces air pollutant emissions to the atmosphere by forming a continuous barrier over the waste material managed in a treatment unit. A cover may have openings (such as access hatches, sampling ports, gauge wells) that are necessary for operation, inspection, maintenance, and repair of the treatment unit on which the cover is used. A cover may be a separate piece of equipment which can be detached and removed from the treatment unit, or a cover may be formed by structural features permanently integrated into the design of the treatment unit. The cover and its closure devices must be made of
suitable materials that will prevent exposure of the waste material to the atmosphere and will maintain the integrity of the cover and its closure devices throughout its intended service life.
Existing source or existing POTW
means a POTW that commenced construction on or before December 1, 1998, and has not been reconstructed after December 1, 1998.
Fraction emitted
means the fraction of the mass of HAP entering the POTW wastewater treatment plant which is emitted prior to secondary treatment.
Group 1 POTW
means a POTW that accepts a waste stream regulated by another NESHAP and provides treatment and controls as an agent for the industrial user. The industrial user complies with its NESHAP by using the treatment and controls located at the POTW. For example, an industry discharges its benzene-containing waste stream to the POTW for treatment to comply with 40 CFR part 61, subpart FF—National Emission Standard for Benzene Waste Operations. This definition does not include POTW treating waste streams not specifically regulated under another NESHAP.
Group 2 POTW
means a POTW that does not meet the definition of a Group 1 POTW. A Group 2 POTW can treat a waste stream that is either:
(1) Not specifically regulated by another NESHAP, or
(2) From an industrial user that complies with the specific wastewater requirements in their applicable NESHAP prior to discharging the waste stream to the POTW.
Industrial user
means a nondomestic source introducing any pollutant or combination of pollutants into a POTW. Industrial users can be commercial or industrial facilities whose wastes enter local sewers.
New source or new POTW
means any POTW that commenced construction or reconstruction after December 1, 1998.
Publicly owned treatment works (POTW)
means a treatment works, as that term is defined by section 112(e)(5) of the Clean Air Act, which is owned by a municipality (as defined by section 502(4) of the Clean Water Act), a state, an intermunicipal or interstate agency, or any department, agency, or instrumentality of the federal government. This definition includes any intercepting sewers, outfall sewers, sewage collection systems, pumping, power, and other equipment. The wastewater treated by these facilities is generated by industrial, commercial, and domestic sources. As used in this subpart, the term POTW refers to both any publicly owned treatment works which is owned by a state, municipality, or intermunicipal or interstate agency and, therefore, eligible to receive grant assistance under the Subchapter II of the Clean Water Act, and any federally owned treatment works as that term is described in section 3023 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.
POTW treatment plant
means that portion of the POTW which is designed to provide treatment (including recycling and reclamation) of municipal sewage and industrial waste.
Secondary treatment
means treatment processes, typically biological, designed to reduce the concentrations of dissolved and colloidal organic matter in wastewater.
Waste and wastewater
means a material, or spent or used water or waste, generated from residential, industrial, commercial, mining, or agricultural operations or from community activities that contain dissolved or suspended matter, and that is discarded, discharged, or is being accumulated, stored, or physically, chemically, thermally, or biologically treated in a publicly owned treatment works.

Bag leak detection system
means a system that is capable of continuously monitoring particulate matter (dust) loadings in the exhaust of a baghouse in order to detect bag leaks and other upset conditions. A bag leak detection system includes, but is not limited to, an instrument that operates on triboelectric, light scattering, light transmittance, or other effect to continuously monitor relative particulate matter loadings.
Capture system
means the equipment (including hoods, ducts, fans, dampers,
etc.) used to capture or transport particulate matter generated by an affected submerged arc furnace.
Casting
means the period of time from when molten ferroalloy falls from the furnace tapping runner into the ladle until pouring into molds is completed. This includes the following operations: ladle filling, pouring alloy from one ladle to another, slag separation, slag removal, and ladle transfer by crane, truck, or other conveyance.
Crushing and screening equipment
means the crushers, grinders, mills, screens and conveying systems used to crush, size, and prepare for packing manganese-containing materials, including raw materials, intermediate products, and final products.
Fugitive dust source

Monitoring requirements.
(a)
Baghouses.
(1) For the baghouses serving the submerged arc furnaces, the metal oxygen refining process, and crushing and screening operations, the owner or operator must observe on a daily basis for the presence of any visible emissions.
(2) In addition to the daily visible emissions observation, the owner or operator must conduct the following activities:

(vii) Quarterly confirmation of the physical integrity of the baghouse structure through visual inspection of the baghouse interior for air leaks.
(viii) Semiannual inspection of fans for wear, material buildup, and corrosion through visual inspection, vibration detectors, or equivalent means.
(3) In addition to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator of a new or reconstructed submerged arc furnace must install and continuously operate a bag leak detection system if the furnace primary and/or tapping emissions are ducted to a negative pressure baghouse or to a positive pressure baghouse equipped with a stack. The bag leak detection system must meet the following requirements:
(i) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at concentrations of 10 milligrams per actual cubic meter (0.0044 grains per actual cubic foot) or less.
(ii) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of relative particulate matter loadings, and the owner or operator must continuously record the output from the bag leak detection system.
(iii) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm system that will sound when an increase in relative particulate loadings is detected over a preset level. The alarm must be located where it can be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.
(iv) Each bag leak detection system that works based on the triboelectric effect must be installed, calibrated, operated, and maintained consistent with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance document “Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance” (EPA-454/R-98-015). Other bag leak detection systems must be installed, calibrated, and maintained consistent with the manufacturer's written specifications and recommendations.
(v) The initial adjustment of the system must, at a minimum, consist of establishing the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, and establishing the alarm set points and the alarm delay time.
(vi) Following initial adjustment, the owner or operator must not adjust the sensitivity or range, averaging period, alarm set points, or alarm delay time, except as detailed in the maintenance plan required under § 63.1655(b). In no event must the sensitivity be increased by more than 100 percent or decreased more than 50 percent over a 365-day period unless a responsible official certifies the baghouse has been inspected
and found to be in good operating condition.
(vii) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
(4) As part of the maintenance plan required by § 63.1655(b), the owner or operator must develop and implement corrective action procedures to be followed in the case of a bag leak detection system alarm (for baghouses equipped with such a system), the observation of visible emissions from the baghouse, or the indication through the periodic baghouse system inspections that the system is not operating properly. The owner or operator must initiate corrective action as soon as practicable after the occurrence of the observation or event indicating a problem.
(5) The corrective action plan must include procedures used to determine the cause of an alarm or other indications of problems as well as actions to minimize emissions. These actions may include the following:
(i) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in emissions.
(ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media.
(iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media, or otherwise repairing the control device.

(b)
Venturi scrubbers.
(1) The owner or operator must monitor the pressure drop across the venturi at least every 5 minutes and record the average hourly pressure drop. Measurement of an average hourly pressure drop less than the pressure drop operating parameter limit established during a successful compliance demonstration would be a violation of the applicable emission standard, unless the excursion in the pressure drop is due to a malfunction.
(2) As part of the maintenance plan required by § 63.1655(b), the owner or operator must develop and implement corrective action procedures to be followed in the case of a violation of the pressure drop requirement. The owner or operator must initiate corrective action as soon as practicable after the excursion.
(3) Failure to monitor or failure to take corrective action under the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section would be a violation of the general duty to operate in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices that minimizes emissions per § 63.1652(f).
(c)
Shop opacity.

The selected option must be consistent with that selected during the initial performance test described in § 63.1656(d)(2). Alternatively, the owner or operator may use the provisions of § 63.8(f) to request approval to use an alternative monitoring method.
(1) The owner or operator must check and record the control system fan motor amperes and capture system damper positions once per shift.
(2) The owner or operator must install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that continuously records the volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood.
(3) The owner or operator must install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that continuously records the volumetric flow rate at the inlet of the air pollution control device and must check and record the capture system damper positions once per shift.
(4) The flow rate monitoring devices must meet the following requirements:
