(a) Suppliers of water for community public water systems shall collect and analyze one sample per plant at the entry point of the distribution system for the determination of sodium concentration levels; samples must be collected and analyzed annually for systems utilizing surface water sources in whole or in part, and at least every three years for systems utilizing solely ground water sources. The minimum number of samples required to be taken by the system shall be based on the number of treatment plants used by the system, except that multiple wells drawing raw water from a single aquifer may, with the State approval, be considered one treatment plant for determining the minimum number of samples. The supplier of water may be required by the State to collect and analyze water samples for sodium more frequently in locations where the sodium content is variable.
(b) The supplier of water shall report to EPA and/or the State the results of the analyses for sodium within the first 10 days of the month following the month in which the sample results were received or within the first 10 days following the end of the required monitoring period as stipulated by the State, whichever of these is first. If more than annual sampling is required the supplier shall report the average sodium concentration within 10 days of the month following the month in which the analytical results of the last sample used for the annual average was received. The supplier of water shall not be required to report the results to EPA where the State has adopted this regulation and results are reported to the State. The supplier shall report the results to EPA where the State has not adopted this regulation.
(c) The supplier of water shall notify appropriate local and State public health officials of the sodium levels by written notice by direct mail within three months. A copy of each notice required to be provided by this paragraph shall be sent to EPA and/or the State within 10 days of its issuance. The supplier of water is not required to notify appropriate local and State public health officials of the sodium levels where the State provides such notices in lieu of the supplier.
(d) Analyses for sodium shall be conducted as directed in § 141.23(k)(1).

The PFAS Mixture Hazard Index (HI) is the sum of component hazard quotients (HQs), which are calculated by dividing the measured component PFAS concentration in water by the corresponding contaminant's health-based water concentration (HBWC) when expressed in the same units (shown in ng/l). The HBWC for PFHxS is 10 ng/l; the HBWC for HFPO-DA is 10 ng/l; the HBWC for PFNA is 10 ng/l; and the HBWC for PFBS is 2000 ng/l. A PFAS Mixture Hazard Index greater than 1 (unitless) indicates an exceedance of the health protective level and indicates potential human health risk from the PFAS mixture in drinking water.
Hazard Index = ([HFPO-DA

A POU, or “point-of-use” technology is a treatment device installed at a single tap used for the purpose of reducing contaminants in drinking water at that one tap. POU devices are typically installed at the kitchen tap. See the April 21, 2000 NODA for more details.
Limitations Footnotes: Technologies for Radionuclides:
a
The regeneration solution contains high concentrations of the contaminant ions. Disposal options should be carefully considered before choosing this technology.
b
When POU devices are used for compliance, programs for long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring must be provided by water utility to ensure proper performance.
c
Reject water disposal options should be carefully considered before choosing this technology. See other RO limitations described in the SWTR Compliance Technologies Table.
d
The combination of variable source water quality and the complexity of the water chemistry involved may make this technology too complex for small surface water systems.
e
Removal efficiencies can vary depending on water quality.
f
This technology may be very limited in application to small systems. Since the process requires static mixing, detention basins, and filtration, it is most applicable to systems with sufficiently high sulfate levels that already have a suitable filtration treatment train in place.
g
This technology is most applicable to small systems that already have filtration in place.
h
Handling of chemicals required during regeneration and pH adjustment may be too difficult for small systems without an adequately trained operator.

Assumes modification to a coagulation/filtration process already in place.

# Source:
54 FR 27527, June 29, 1989, unless otherwise noted.
§ 141.70
General requirements.
(a) The requirements of this subpart H constitute national primary drinking water regulations. These regulations establish criteria under which filtration is required as a treatment technique for public water systems supplied by a surface water source and public water systems supplied by a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water. In addition, these regulations establish treatment technique requirements in lieu of maximum contaminant levels for the following contaminants:
Giardia lamblia,
viruses, heterotrophic plate count bacteria,
Legionella,
and turbidity. Each public water system with a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water must provide treatment of that source water that complies with these treatment technique requirements. The treatment technique requirements consist of installing and properly operating water treatment processes which reliably achieve:
(1) At least 99.9 percent (3-log) removal and/or inactivation of
Giardia lamblia
cysts between a point where the raw water is not subject to recontamination by surface water runoff and a point downstream before or at the first customer; and
(2) At least 99.99 percent (4-log) removal and/or inactivation of viruses between a point where the raw water is not subject to recontamination by surface water runoff and a point downstream before or at the first customer.
(b) A public water system using a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water is considered to be in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if:
(1) It meets the requirements for avoiding filtration in § 141.71 and the disinfection requirements in § 141.72(a); or
(2) It meets the filtration requirements in § 141.73 and the disinfection requirements in § 141.72(b).
(c) Each public water system using a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of
surface water must be operated by qualified personnel who meet the requirements specified by the State.
(d)
Additional requirements for systems serving at least 10,000 people.
In addition to complying with requirements in this subpart, systems serving at least 10,000 people must also comply with the requirements in subpart P of this part.
(e)
Additional requirements for systems serving fewer than 10,000 people.
In addition to complying with requirements in this subpart, systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must also comply with the requirements in subpart T of this part.

§ 141.71
Criteria for avoiding filtration.
A public water system that uses a surface water source must meet all of the conditions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and is subject to paragraph (c) of this section, beginning December 30, 1991, unless the State has determined, in writing pursuant to § 1412(b)(7)(C)(iii), that filtration is required. A public water system that uses a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water must meet all of the conditions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and is subject to paragraph (c) of this section, beginning 18 months after the State determines that it is under the direct influence of surface water, or December 30, 1991, whichever is later, unless the State has determined, in writing pursuant to § 1412(b)(7)(C)(iii), that filtration is required. If the State determines in writing pursuant to § 1412(b)(7)(C)(iii) before December 30, 1991, that filtration is required, the system must have installed filtration and meet the criteria for filtered systems specified in §§ 141.72(b) and 141.73 by June 29, 1993. Within 18 months of the failure of a system using surface water or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water to meet any one of the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section or after June 29, 1993, whichever is later, the system must have installed filtration and meet the criteria for filtered systems specified in §§ 141.72(b) and 141.73.
(a)
Source water quality conditions.
(1) The fecal coliform concentration must be equal to or less than 20/100 ml, or the total coliform concentration must be equal to or less than 100/100 ml (measured as specified in § 141.74 (a) (1) and (2) and (b)(1)), in representative samples of the source water immediately prior to the first or only point of disinfectant application in at least 90 percent of the measurements made for the 6 previous months that the system served water to the public on an ongoing basis. If a system measures both fecal and total coliforms, the fecal coliform criterion, but not the total coliform criterion, in this paragraph must be met.
(2) The turbidity level cannot exceed 5 NTU (measured as specified in § 141.74 (a)(1) and (b)(2)) in representative samples of the source water immediately prior to the first or only point of disinfectant application unless: (i) the State determines that any such event was caused by circumstances that were unusual and unpredictable; and (ii) as a result of any such event, there have not been more than two events in the past 12 months the system served water to the public, or more than five events in the past 120 months the system served water to the public, in which the turbidity level exceeded 5 NTU. An “event” is a series of consecutive days during which at least one turbidity measurement each day exceeds 5 NTU.
(b)
Site-specific conditions.
(1)(i) The public water system must meet the requirements of § 141.72(a)(1) at least 11 of the 12 previous months that the system served water to the public, on an ongoing basis, unless the system fails to meet the requirements during 2 of the 12 previous months that the system served water to the public, and the State determines that at least one of these failures was caused by circumstances that were unusual and unpredictable.
(ii) The public water system must meet the requirements of § 141.72(a)(2) at all times the system serves water to the public.
(iii) The public water system must meet the requirements of § 141.72(a)(3) at all times the system serves water to the public unless the State determines
that any such failure was caused by circumstances that were unusual and unpredictable.
(iv) The public water system must meet the requirements of § 141.72(a)(4) on an ongoing basis unless the State determines that failure to meet these requirements was not caused by a deficiency in treatment of the source water.
(2) The public water system must maintain a watershed control program which minimizes the potential for contamination by
Giardia lamblia
cysts and viruses in the source water. The State must determine whether the watershed control program is adequate to meet this goal. The adequacy of a program to limit potential contamination by
Giardia lamblia
cysts and viruses must be based on: the comprehensiveness of the watershed review; the effectiveness of the system's program to monitor and control detrimental activities occurring in the watershed; and the extent to which the water system has maximized land ownership and/or controlled land use within the watershed. At a minimum, the watershed control program must:
(i) Characterize the watershed hydrology and land ownership;
(ii) Identify watershed characteristics and activities which may have an adverse effect on source water quality; and
(iii) Monitor the occurrence of activities which may have an adverse effect on source water quality.
The public water system must demonstrate through ownership and/or written agreements with landowners within the watershed that it can control all human activities which may have an adverse impact on the microbiological quality of the source water. The public water system must submit an annual report to the State that identifies any special concerns about the watershed and how they are being handled; describes activities in the watershed that affect water quality; and projects what adverse activities are expected to occur in the future and describes how the public water system expects to address them. For systems using a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water, an approved wellhead protection program developed under section 1428 of the Safe Drinking Water Act may be used, if the State deems it appropriate, to meet these requirements.
(3) The public water system must be subject to an annual on-site inspection to assess the watershed control program and disinfection treatment process. Either the State or a party approved by the State must conduct the on-site inspection. The inspection must be conducted by competent individuals such as sanitary and civil engineers, sanitarians, or technicians who have experience and knowledge about the operation and maintenance of a public water system, and who have a sound understanding of public health principles and waterborne diseases. A report of the on-site inspection summarizing all findings must be prepared every year. The on-site inspection must indicate to the State's satisfaction that the watershed control program and disinfection treatment process are adequately designed and maintained. The on-site inspection must include:
(i) A review of the effectiveness of the watershed control program;
(ii) A review of the physical condition of the source intake and how well it is protected;
(iii) A review of the system's equipment maintenance program to ensure there is low probability for failure of the disinfection process;
(iv) An inspection of the disinfection equipment for physical deterioration;
(v) A review of operating procedures;
(vi) A review of data records to ensure that all required tests are being conducted and recorded and disinfection is effectively practiced; and
(vii) Identification of any improvements which are needed in the equipment, system maintenance and operation, or data collection.
(4) The public water system must not have been identified as a source of a waterborne disease outbreak, or if it has been so identified, the system must have been modified sufficiently to prevent another such occurrence, as determined by the State.
(5) The public water system must comply with the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for total coliforms in § 141.63(a) and (b) and the MCL for
E.
coli
in § 141.63(c) at least 11 months of the 12 previous months that the system served water to the public, on an ongoing basis, unless the State determines that failure to meet this requirement was not caused by a deficiency in treatment of the source water.
(6) The public water system must comply with the requirements for trihalomethanes in §§ 141.12 and 141.30 until December 31, 2001. After December 31, 2001, the system must comply with the requirements for total trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids (five), bromate, chlorite, chlorine, chloramines, and chlorine dioxide in subpart L of this part.
(c)
Treatment technique violations.
(1) A system that (i) fails to meet any one of the criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and/or which the State has determined that filtration is required, in writing pursuant to § 1412(b)(7)(C)(iii), and (ii) fails to install filtration by the date specified in the introductory paragraph of this section is in violation of a treatment technique requirement.
(2) A system that has not installed filtration is in violation of a treatment technique requirement if:
(i) The turbidity level (measured as specified in § 141.74(a)(1) and (b)(2)) in a representative sample of the source water immediately prior to the first or only point of disinfection application exceeds 5 NTU; or
(ii) The system is identified as a source of a waterborne disease outbreak.

§ 141.72
Disinfection.
A public water system that uses a surface water source and does not provide filtration treatment must provide the disinfection treatment specified in paragraph (a) of this section beginning December 30, 1991, unless the State determines that filtration is required in writing pursuant to § 1412 (b)(7)(C)(iii). A public water system that uses a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water and does not provide filtration treatment must provide disinfection treatment specified in paragraph (a) of this section beginning December 30, 1991, or 18 months after the State determines that the ground water source is under the influence of surface water, whichever is later, unless the State has determined that filtration is required in writing pursuant to § 1412(b)(7)(C)(iii). If the State has determined that filtration is required, the system must comply with any interim disinfection requirements the State deems necessary before filtration is installed. A system that uses a surface water source that provides filtration treatment must provide the disinfection treatment specified in paragraph (b) of this section beginning June 29, 1993, or beginning when filtration is installed, whichever is later. A system that uses a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water and provides filtration treatment must provide disinfection treatment as specified in paragraph (b) of this section by June 29, 1993, or beginning when filtration is installed, whichever is later. Failure to meet any requirement of this section after the applicable date specified in this introductory paragraph is a treatment technique violation.
(a)
Disinfection requirements for public water systems that do not provide filtration.
Each public water system that does not provide filtration treatment must provide disinfection treatment as follows:
(1) The disinfection treatment must be sufficient to ensure at least 99.9 percent (3-log) inactivation of
Giardia lamblia
cysts and 99.99 percent (4-log) inactivation of viruses, every day the system serves water to the public, except any one day each month. Each day a system serves water to the public, the public water system must calculate the CT value(s) from the system's treatment parameters, using the procedure specified in § 141.74(b)(3), and determine whether this value(s) is sufficient to achieve the specified inactivation rates for
Giardia lamblia
cysts and viruses. If a system uses a disinfectant other than chlorine, the system may demonstrate to the State, through the use of a State-approved protocol for on-site disinfection challenge studies or other information satisfactory to the State, that CT
99.9
values other than
those specified in tables 2.1 and 3.1 in § 141.74(b)(3) or other operational parameters are adequate to demonstrate that the system is achieving minimum inactivation rates required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(2) The disinfection system must have either (i) redundant components, including an auxiliary power supply with automatic start-up and alarm to ensure that disinfectant application is maintained continuously while water is being delivered to the distribution system, or (ii) automatic shut-off of delivery of water to the distribution system whenever there is less than 0.2 mg/l of residual disinfectant concentration in the water. If the State determines that automatic shut-off would cause unreasonable risk to health or interfere with fire protection, the system must comply with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
(3) The residual disinfectant concentration in the water entering the distribution system, measured as specified in § 141.74 (a)(2) and (b)(5), cannot be less than 0.2 mg/l for more than 4 hours.
(4)(i) The residual disinfectant concentration in the distribution system, measured as total chlorine, combined chlorine, or chlorine dioxide, as specified in § 141.74 (a)(2) and (b)(6), cannot be undetectable in more than 5 percent of the samples each month, for any two consecutive months that the system serves water to the public. Water in the distribution system with a heterotrophic bacteria concentration less than or equal to 500/ml, measured as heterotrophic plate count (HPC) as specified in § 141.74(a)(1), is deemed to have a detectable disinfectant residual for purposes of determining compliance with this requirement. Thus, the value “V” in the following formula cannot exceed 5 percent in one month, for any two consecutive months.
EC15NO91.131
where:
a = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is measured;
b = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is not measured but heterotrophic bacteria plate count (HPC) is measured;
c = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is measured but not detected and no HPC is measured;
d = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is measured but not detected and where the HPC is
500/ml; and
e = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is not measured and HPC is
500/ml.
(ii) If the State determines, based on site-specific considerations, that a system has no means for having a sample transported and analyzed for HPC by a certified laboratory under the requisite time and temperature conditions specified by § 141.74(a)(1) and that the system is providing adequate disinfection in the distribution system, the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section do not apply to that system.
(b)
Disinfection requirements for public water systems which provide filtration.
Each public water system that provides filtration treatment must provide disinfection treatment as follows.
(1) The disinfection treatment must be sufficient to ensure that the total treatment processes of that system achieve at least 99.9 percent (3-log) inactivation and/or removal of
Giardia lamblia
cysts and at least 99.99 percent (4-log) inactivation and/or removal of viruses, as determined by the State.
(2) The residual disinfectant concentration in the water entering the distribution system, measured as specified in § 141.74 (a)(2) and (c)(2), cannot be less than 0.2 mg/l for more than 4 hours.
(3)(i) The residual disinfectant concentration in the distribution system, measured as total chlorine, combined chlorine, or chlorine dioxide, as specified in § 141.74 (a)(2) and (c)(3), cannot be undetectable in more than 5 percent of the samples each month, for any two consecutive months that the system serves water to the public. Water in the distribution system with a heterotrophic bacteria concentration less than or equal to 500/ml, measured as heterotrophic plate count (HPC) as specified in § 141.74(a)(1), is deemed to have a detectable disinfectant residual for purposes of determining compliance with this requirement. Thus, the value “V” in the following formula cannot
exceed 5 percent in one month, for any two consecutive months.
EC15NO91.132
where:
a = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is measured;
b = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is not measured but heterotrophic bacteria plate count (HPC) is measured;
c = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is measured but not detected and no HPC is measured;
d = number of instances where no residual disinfectant concentration is detected and where the HPC is
500/ml; and
e = number of instances where the residual disinfectant concentration is not measured and HPC is
500/ml.
(ii) If the State determines, based on site-specific considerations, that a system has no means for having a sample transported and analyzed for HPC by a certified laboratory under the requisite time and temperature conditions specified in § 141.74(a)(1) and that the system is providing adequate disinfection in the distribution system, the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section do not apply.
[54 FR 27527, June 29, 1989, as amended at 69 FR 38855, June 29, 2004]
§ 141.73
Filtration.
A public water system that uses a surface water source or a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water, and does not meet all of the criteria in § 141.71 (a) and (b) for avoiding filtration, must provide treatment consisting of both disinfection, as specified in § 141.72(b), and filtration treatment which complies with the requirements of paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section by June 29, 1993, or within 18 months of the failure to meet any one of the criteria for avoiding filtration in § 141.71 (a) and (b), whichever is later. Failure to meet any requirement of this section after the date specified in this introductory paragraph is a treatment technique violation.
(a)
Conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration.
(1) For systems using conventional filtration or direct filtration, the turbidity level of representative samples of a system's filtered water must be less than or equal to 0.5 NTU in at least 95 percent of the measurements taken each month, measured as specified in § 141.74 (a)(1) and (c)(1), except that if the State determines that the system is capable of achieving at least 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivation of
Giardia lamblia
cysts at some turbidity level higher than 0.5 NTU in at least 95 percent of the measurements taken each month, the State may substitute this higher turbidity limit for that system. However, in no case may the State approve a turbidity limit that allows more than 1 NTU in more than 5 percent of the samples taken each month, measured as specified in § 141.74 (a)(1) and (c)(1).
(2) The turbidity level of representative samples of a system's filtered water must at no time exceed 5 NTU, measured as specified in § 141.74 (a)(1) and (c)(1).
(3) Beginning January 1, 2002, systems serving at least 10,000 people must meet the turbidity requirements in § 141.173(a).
(4) Beginning January 1, 2005, systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must meet the turbidity requirements in §§ 141.550 through 141.553.
(b)
Slow sand filtration.
(1) For systems using slow sand filtration, the turbidity level of representative samples of a system's filtered water must be less than or equal to 1 NTU in at least 95 percent of the measurements taken each month, measured as specified in § 141.74 (a)(1) and (c)(1), except that if the State determines there is no significant interference with disinfection at a higher turbidity level, the State may substitute this higher turbidity limit for that system.
(2) The turbidity level of representative samples of a system's filtered water must at no time exceed 5 NTU, measured as specified in § 141.74 (a)(1) and (c)(1).
(c)
Diatomaceous earth filtration.
(1) For systems using diatomaceous earth filtration, the turbidity level of representative samples of a system's filtered water must be less than or equal to 1 NTU in at least 95 percent of the measurements taken each month,
measured as specified in § 141.74 (a)(1) and (c)(1).
(2) The turbidity level of representative samples of a system's filtered water must at no time exceed 5 NTU, measured as specified in § 141.74 (a)(1) and (c)(1).
(d)
Other filtration technologies.
A public water system may use a filtration technology not listed in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section if it demonstrates to the State, using pilot plant studies or other means, that the alternative filtration technology, in combination with disinfection treatment that meets the requirements of § 141.72(b), consistently achieves 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivation of
Giardia lamblia
cysts and 99.99 percent removal and/or inactivation of viruses. For a system that makes this demonstration, the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section apply. Beginning January 1, 2002, systems serving at least 10,000 people must meet the requirements for other filtration technologies in § 141.173(b). Beginning January 14, 2005, systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must meet the requirements for other filtration technologies in § 141.550 through 141.553.

(b)
Monitoring requirements for systems that do not provide filtration.
A public water system that uses a surface water source and does not provide filtration treatment must begin monitoring, as specified in this paragraph (b), beginning December 31, 1990, unless the State has determined that filtration is required in writing pursuant to § 1412(b)(7)(C)(iii), in which case the State may specify alternative monitoring requirements, as appropriate, until filtration is in place. A public water system that uses a ground water source under the direct influence of surface water and does not provide filtration treatment must begin monitoring as specified in this paragraph (b) beginning December 31, 1990, or 6 months after the State determines that the ground water source is under the direct influence of surface water, whichever is later, unless the State has determined that filtration is required in writing pursuant to § 1412(b)(7)(C)(iii), in which case the State may specify alternative monitoring requirements, as appropriate, until filtration is in place.
(1) Fecal coliform or total coliform density measurements as required by § 141.71(a)(1) must be performed on representative source water samples immediately prior to the first or only point of disinfectant application. The system must sample for fecal or total coliforms at the following minimum frequency each week the system serves water to the public:
System size (persons served)
Samples/week
1
≤500
1
501 to 3,300
2
3,301 to 10,000
3
10,001 to 25,000
4
25,000
5
1
Must be taken on separate days.
Also, one fecal or total coliform density measurement must be made every day the system serves water to the public and the turbidity of the source water exceeds 1 NTU (these samples count towards the weekly coliform sampling requirement) unless the State determines that the system, for logistical reasons outside the system's control, cannot have the sample analyzed within 30 hours of collection.
(2) Turbidity measurements as required by § 141.71(a)(2) must be performed on representative grab samples of source water immediately prior to the first or only point of disinfectant application every four hours (or more frequently) that the system serves water to the public. A public water system may substitute continuous turbidity monitoring for grab sample monitoring if it validates the continuous measurement for accuracy on a regular basis using a protocol approved by the State.
(3) The total inactivation ratio for each day that the system is in operation must be determined based on the CT
99.9
values in tables 1.1-1.6, 2.1, and 3.1 of this section, as appropriate. The parameters necessary to determine the total inactivation ratio must be monitored as follows:
(i) The temperature of the disinfected water must be measured at least once per day at each residual disinfectant concentration sampling point.
(ii) If the system uses chlorine, the pH of the disinfected water must be measured at least once per day at each chlorine residual disinfectant concentration sampling point.
(iii) The disinfectant contact time(s) (“T”) must be determined for each day during peak hourly flow.
(iv) The residual disinfectant concentration(s) (“C”) of the water before or at the first customer must be measured each day during peak hourly flow.
(v) If a system uses a disinfectant other than chlorine, the system may demonstrate to the State, through the use of a State-approved protocol for on-site disinfection challenge studies or other information satisfactory to the State, that CT
99.9
values other than those specified in tables 2.1 and 3.1 in this section other operational parameters are adequate to demonstrate that the system is achieving the minimum inactivation rates required by § 141.72(a)(1).

These values are for pH values of 6 to 9. These CT values may be assumed to achieve greater than 99.99 percent inactivation of viruses only if chlorine is added and mixed in the water prior to the addition of ammonia. If this condition is not met, the system must demonstrate, based on on-site studies or other information, as approved by the State, that the system is achieving at least 99.99 percent inactivation of viruses. CT values between the indicated temperatures may be determined by linear interpolation. If no interpolation is used, use the CT
99.9
value at the lower temperature for determining CT
99.9
values between indicated temperatures.
(4) The total inactivation ratio must be calculated as follows:
(i) If the system uses only one point of disinfectant application, the system may determine the total inactivation ratio based on either of the following two methods:
(A) One inactivation ratio (CTcalc/CT
99.9
) is determined before or at the first customer during peak hourly flow and if the CTcalc/CT
99.9
≥1.0, the 99.9 percent
Giardia lamblia
inactivation requirement has been achieved; or
(B) Successive CTcalc/CT
99.9
values, representing sequential inactivation ratios, are determined between the point of disinfectant application and a point before or at the first customer during peak hourly flow. Under this alternative, the following method must be used to calculate the total inactivation ratio:
EC15NO91.133
lamblia
inactivation requirement has been achieved.
(ii) If the system uses more than one point of disinfectant application before or at the first customer, the system must determine the CT value of each disinfection sequence immediately prior to the next point of disinfectant application during peak hourly flow. The CTcalc/CT
99.9
value of each sequence and
EC15NO91.134
must be calculated using the method in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section to determine if the system is in compliance with § 141.72(a).
(iii) Although not required, the total percent inactivation for a system with one or more points of residual disinfectant concentration monitoring may be calculated by solving the following equation:
EC15NO91.135
(5) The residual disinfectant concentration of the water entering the distribution system must be monitored continuously, and the lowest value must be recorded each day, except that if there is a failure in the continuous monitoring equipment, grab sampling every 4 hours may be conducted in lieu of continuous monitoring, but for no more than 5 working days following the failure of the equipment, and systems serving 3,300 or fewer persons may take grab samples in lieu of providing continuous monitoring on an ongoing
basis at the frequencies prescribed below:

The day's samples cannot be taken at the same time. The sampling intervals are subject to State review and approval.
If at any time the residual disinfectant concentration falls below 0.2 mg/l in a system using grab sampling in lieu of continuous monitoring, the system must take a grab sample every 4 hours until the residual concentration is equal to or greater than 0.2 mg/l.
(6)(i) Until March 31, 2016, the residual disinfectant concentration must be measured at least at the same points in the distribution system and at the same time as total coliforms are sampled, as specified in § 141.21. Beginning April 1, 2016, the residual disinfectant concentration must be measured at least at the same points in the distribution system and at the same time as total coliforms are sampled, as specified in §§ 141.854 through 141.858. The State may allow a public water system which uses both a surface water source or a ground water source under direct influence of surface water, and a ground water source, to take disinfectant residual samples at points other than the total coliform sampling points if the State determines that such points are more representative of treated (disinfected) water quality within the distribution system. Heterotrophic bacteria, measured as heterotrophic plate count (HPC) as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, may be measured in lieu of residual disinfectant concentration.
(ii) If the State determines, based on site-specific considerations, that a system has no means for having a sample transported and analyzed for HPC by a certified laboratory under the requisite time and temperature conditions specified by paragraph (a)(1) of this section and that the system is providing adequate disinfection in the distribution system, the requirements of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section do not apply to that system.
(c)
Monitoring requirements for systems using filtration treatment.
A public water system that uses a surface water source or a ground water source under the influence of surface water and provides filtration treatment must monitor in accordance with this paragraph (c) beginning June 29, 1993, or when filtration is installed, whichever is later.
(1) Turbidity measurements as required by § 141.73 must be performed on representative samples of the system's filtered water every four hours (or more frequently) that the system serves water to the public. A public water system may substitute continuous turbidity monitoring for grab sample monitoring if it validates the continuous measurement for accuracy on a regular basis using a protocol approved by the State. For any systems using slow sand filtration or filtration treatment other than conventional treatment, direct filtration, or diatomaceous earth filtration, the State may reduce the sampling frequency to once per day if it determines that less frequent monitoring is sufficient to indicate effective filtration performance. For systems serving 500 or fewer persons, the State may reduce the turbidity sampling frequency to once per day, regardless of the type of filtration treatment used, if the State determines that less frequent monitoring is sufficient to indicate effective filtration performance.
(2) The residual disinfectant concentration of the water entering the distribution system must be monitored continuously, and the lowest value must be recorded each day, except that if there is a failure in the continuous monitoring equipment, grab sampling every 4 hours may be conducted in lieu of continuous monitoring, but for no more than 5 working days following the failure of the equipment, and systems serving 3,300 or fewer persons may take grab samples in lieu of providing continuous monitoring on an ongoing basis at the frequencies each day prescribed below:

The day's samples cannot be taken at the same time. The sampling intervals are subject to State review and approval.
If at any time the residual disinfectant concentration falls below 0.2 mg/l in a system using grab sampling in lieu of continuous monitoring, the system must take a grab sample every 4 hours until the residual disinfectant concentration is equal to or greater than 0.2 mg/l.
(3)(i) Until March 31, 2016, the residual disinfectant concentration must be measured at least at the same points in the distribution system and at the same time as total coliforms are sampled, as specified in § 141.21. Beginning April 1, 2016, the residual disinfectant concentration must be measured at least at the same points in the distribution system and at the same time as total coliforms are sampled, as specified in §§ 141.854 through 141.858. The State may allow a public water system which uses both a surface water source or a ground water source under direct influence of surface water, and a ground water source, to take disinfectant residual samples at points other than the total coliform sampling points if the State determines that such points are more representative of treated (disinfected) water quality within the distribution system. Heterotrophic bacteria, measured as heterotrophic plate count (HPC) as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, may be measured in lieu of residual disinfectant concentration.
(ii) If the State determines, based on site-specific considerations, that a system has no means for having a sample transported and analyzed for HPC by a certified laboratory under the requisite time and temperature conditions specified by paragraph (a)(1) of this section and that the system is providing adequate disinfection in the distribution system, the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section do not apply to that system.

(b)
Scope.
The regulations in this subpart constitute a treatment technique rule that includes treatment techniques to control corrosion, treat source water, replace service lines, and provide public education. The regulations in this subpart include requirements to support the treatment technique including a service line inventory, tap sampling, and monitoring for lead in schools and child care facilities. Some of the requirements in this subpart only apply if there is an exceedance of the lead or copper action levels, specified in paragraph (c) of this section, as measured in samples collected at consumers' taps.
(c)
Lead and copper action levels and method for determining whether there is an exceedance of the action level.
Action levels must be determined based on tap water samples that must be considered for inclusion under § 141.86(e) for the purpose of calculating the 90th percentile and tested using the analytical methods specified in § 141.89. The action levels described in this paragraph (c) are applicable to all sections of subpart I of this part. Action levels for lead and copper are as follows:
(1) The lead action level is exceeded if the 90th percentile concentration of lead as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section is greater than 0.010 mg/L.
(2) The copper action level is exceeded if the 90th percentile concentration of copper as specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section is greater than 1.3 mg/L.
(3) For purposes of this subpart, the 90th percentile concentration must be derived as follows:
(i) For water systems that do not have Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 sites and only have sites identified as Tier 3, 4, or 5 under § 141.86(a):
(A) The results of all lead or copper samples taken during a tap sampling period and eligible for inclusion in the 90th percentile calculation under § 141.86(e) must be placed in ascending order from the sample with the lowest concentration of lead or copper to the sample with the highest concentration of lead or copper. Each sampling result must be assigned a number, in ascending order beginning with the number 1 for the sample with the lowest concentration of lead or copper. The number assigned to the sample with the highest concentration must be equal to the total number of samples taken and considered for inclusion in the 90th percentile calculation, in accordance with § 141.86(e).
(B) The number of samples taken during the tap sampling period must be multiplied by 0.9.
(C) The 90th percentile concentration is the concentration of lead or copper in the numbered sample yielded after multiplying the number of samples by 0.9 in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
(D) For water systems that collect five samples per tap sampling period, the 90th percentile concentration is the average of the highest and second highest concentration from the results in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section.
(E) For a water system that is allowed by the State to collect fewer than five samples in accordance with § 141.86(a)(2) or has failed to meet their required minimum number of samples and collected fewer than five samples, the sample result with the highest concentration from the results in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section is considered the 90th percentile value.
(ii) For water systems with sites identified as Tier 1 or 2 under § 141.86(a) with sufficient Tier 1 and 2 sites to meet the minimum number of sites required in § 141.86(c) or (d) as applicable:
(A) For lead, water systems must include the higher of the first-liter and fifth-liter lead sample results at each Tier 1 and 2 site (or first-liter lead sample if tiering is based on premise plumbing) taken during the tap sampling period in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(B) through (D) of this section. For copper, water systems must include all first-liter copper samples collected at each Tier 1 and 2 site taken during the tap sampling period. Lead or copper sample results from Tier 3, 4, or 5 sites cannot be included in this calculation.
(B) The results of the lead or copper samples taken during a tap sampling period and eligible for inclusion in the 90th percentile calculation under § 141.86(e) identified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section must be placed in ascending order from the sample with the lowest concentration to the sample with the highest concentration. Each sampling result must be assigned a number, in ascending order beginning with the number 1 for the sample with the lowest concentration. The number assigned to the sample with the highest concentration must be equal to the total number of samples.
(C) The number of samples identified in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) must be multiplied by 0.9.
(D) The 90th percentile concentration is the concentration of lead or copper in the numbered sample yielded after multiplying the number of samples by 0.9 in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.
(E) For water systems that collect samples from five sites per tap sampling period, the 90th percentile concentration is the average of the highest and second highest concentration from the results in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(F) For a water system that is allowed by the State to collect fewer than five copper samples or five first-liter-and-fifth-liter-paired lead samples in accordance with § 141.86(a)(2), or has failed to collect at least five copper samples or five first-liter-and fifth-liter-paired lead samples, the sample result with the highest concentration from the results in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) is considered the 90th percentile value.
(iii) For water systems with sites identified as Tier 1 or 2 under § 141.86(a) with an insufficient number of Tier 1 or 2 sites to meet the minimum number of sites required in § 141.86(c) or (d) as applicable:
(A) For lead, the system must use the higher value of the first-liter and fifth-liter lead sample for each Tier 1 or 2 site (or first-liter lead sample if tiering is based on premise plumbing) and the first-liter lead samples from sites in the next highest available tier (
i.e.,
Tier 3, 4, and 5) to meet the minimum number of sites required in § 141.86(c) or (d) sampled during a tap sampling period for the steps in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(B) through (D) of this section. For copper, the system must use all first-liter copper samples collected.
(B) The results of all of the lead or copper samples identified in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section must be placed in ascending order from the sample with the lowest concentration to the sample with the highest concentration. The water system must reduce this list to only include samples with the highest concentrations such that the number of sample results equals the minimum number of sites required to be sampled by § 141.86(c) or (d), as applicable. From this reduced list, each sampling result must be assigned a number, in ascending order beginning with the number 1 for the sample with the lowest concentration. The number assigned to the sample with the highest concentration must be equal to the minimum number of sites required by § 141.86(c) or (d), as applicable.
(C) The number of samples identified in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) must be multiplied by 0.9.
(D) The 90th percentile concentration is the concentration of lead or copper in the numbered sample yielded after multiplying the number of samples by 0.9 in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.
(E) For water systems that collect samples from five sites per tap sampling period, the 90th percentile concentration is the average of the highest and second highest concentration from the results in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.
(F) For a water system that is allowed by the State to collect fewer than five copper samples or five first-liter-and-fifth-liter-paired lead samples in accordance with § 141.86(a)(2), or has failed to collect at least five copper samples or five first-and-fifth—liter-paired lead samples, the sample result with the highest concentration from the results in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) is considered the 90th percentile value.
(G) If a water system does not collect enough samples sufficient to meet the minimum number of sites required in § 141.86(c) or (d), the system must calculate the 90th percentile lead and copper levels following the steps in § 141.80(c)(3)(i)(A) through (C).

Water systems must complete standard monitoring for at least two consecutive tap monitoring periods under § 141.86(c)(2)(iii)(D) and water quality parameter monitoring under § 141.87(b)(3) after completing paragraph (e)(5) of this section (step 5). The first tap monitoring period for standard monitoring must begin on January 1 or July 1, whichever is sooner, after completing paragraph (e)(5) (step 5).
(7)
Step 7: State sets optimal water quality parameters (OWQPs).

(8)
Step 8: Systems meet OWQPs to demonstrate compliance.
Water systems must comply with the State-designated OWQPs (§ 141.82(g)) and conduct tap sampling under § 141.86(c)(2)(iii)(E) and water quality parameter monitoring under § 141.87(b)(4).
(f)
Systems with lead or galvanized requiring replacement service lines that can complete full service line replacement in five years or less.
(1) A water system with one or more lead or galvanized requiring replacement service lines is not required to complete the steps under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section if the system meets all the following requirements:
(i) Deadline to complete mandatory service line replacement.
(A) A water system must complete the service line replacement requirements under § 141.84(d) in five years or less from the date of the end of the tap sampling period in which the system first exceeds the lead action level; or
(B) A large water system without corrosion control treatment must complete the service line replacement requirements under § 141.84(d) in five years or less from the date of the end of the tap sampling period in which the system's 90th percentile results first exceed the lead practical quantitation limit; and
(C) For a water system with less than five years remaining to complete mandatory service line replacement in accordance with § 141.84(d), the system must complete the service line replacement requirements under this paragraph (f)(1)(i) by that deadline.
(ii) At a minimum, a system must replace the total number of lead and/or galvanized requiring replacement service lines each year, as identified in that system's inventory on the date of the end of the tap sampling period in which the system first exceeds the lead action level or in which the system's 90th percentile first exceeds the lead practical quantitation limit, whichever applies, at an annual rate equally divided by the total number of years for service line replacement provided in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section. For purposes of calculating the annual rate, the system must replace all lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines within the least number of years feasible not to exceed five years from the date of the end of the tap sampling period in which the system first exceeds
the lead action level or in which the system's 90th percentile first exceeds the lead practical quantitation limit, whichever applies. If the State determines a replacement deadline less than five years is feasible for a water system, the system must replace service lines by that deadline and establish an annual replacement rate based on that number of years until that deadline.
(iii) By the end of the five-year-or-less period in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the system must have replaced all lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines calculated in accordance with § 141.84(d)(6) (

no lead, galvanized requiring replacement or lead status unknown service lines remain in the inventory), and identified the material of all lead status unknown service lines, completed the inventory validation requirements in accordance with § 141.84(b)(5), and replaced all unknowns found to be lead or galvanized requiring replacement service lines.
(iv) Except as provided in this section, all other requirements in § 141.84(d) apply.
(2) Throughout the five-year-or-less period in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, systems with corrosion control treatment must continue to operate and maintain corrosion control treatment in addition to completing the mandatory service line replacement requirements under this section.
(3) A water system that does not replace lead and/or galvanized requiring replacement service lines calculated in accordance with § 141.84(d)(6) at the minimum annual rate provided in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section in any one year of the five-year-or-less period in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section or complete the service line replacement requirements under § 141.84(d) in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, must meet the requirements under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, as applicable, starting immediately after the system fails to meet the annual removal requirements under paragraph (f)(1)(ii).
(4) At the end of each year of the five-year-or-less period, the system must submit written documentation to the State about the number of lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines removed that year and whether the minimum annual replacement rate in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section was met. If a system reports or a State determines that the system did not meet its minimum annual replacement rate that year, the system is no longer eligible to defer the requirements under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, and must meet those requirements, as applicable.
(5) After completing service line replacement in accordance with the requirements in this paragraph (f), a water system must meet the requirements under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, as applicable, if at the end of a subsequent tap sampling period, the system either exceeds the lead action level or the lead practical quantitation limit, whichever is applicable.

Completing corrosion control steps for small and medium water systems without corrosion control treatment.
(1) Any small or medium water system without corrosion control treatment required to complete the steps in paragraph (e) of this section that does not exceed the lead action level and copper action level during two consecutive six-month tap monitoring periods pursuant to § 141.86 prior to the start of step 3 in paragraph (e)(3) of this section or prior to or concurrent with the end of step 4 in paragraph (e)(4) of this section may stop completing the steps and is not required to complete paragraph (e)(3) or (5) (step 3 or step 5), respectively, except that medium water systems without corrosion control treatment and with lead service lines must complete a corrosion control treatment study under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. A 90th percentile level at or below the lead action level or copper action level based on less than the required minimum number of samples under § 141.86 cannot be used to meet the requirements of this paragraph (g)(1). Eligible systems can only use the exception in this paragraph (g)(1) once.
(2) Any system that starts step 5 in accordance with paragraph (e)(5) of this section must complete all remaining steps (
i.e.,
steps 6 through 8) in paragraphs (e)(6) through (8) of this section and is not permitted to stop the steps.
(3) Any small or medium water system without corrosion control treatment under paragraph (g)(1) of this section that stopped the steps in paragraph (e) of this section and subsequently exceeds either the lead action level or copper action level must complete the corrosion control treatment steps in paragraph (e) beginning with the first treatment step that was not completed.
(4) The State may require a water system to repeat treatment steps previously completed by the water system when the State determines that this is necessary to implement the treatment requirements of this section. The State must notify the system in writing of such a determination and explain the basis for its decision.
(h)
Notification requirements for upcoming long-term change in treatment or source.
At a time specified by the State, or if no specific time is designated, as early as possible but no later than six months prior to the addition of a new source or any long-term change in water treatment, a water system must submit written documentation describing the addition of a new source or long-term change in treatment to the State. Systems may not implement the addition of a new source or long-term treatment change without State approval. The State must review and approve the addition of a new source or long-term change in water treatment before it can be implemented by the water system. The State may require any such water system to take actions before or after the addition of a new source or long-term treatment change to ensure that the water system will operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment, such as additional water quality parameter monitoring, additional lead or copper tap sampling, and re-evaluating corrosion control treatment. Examples of long-term treatment changes include but are not limited to the addition of a new treatment process or modification of an existing treatment process. Examples of modifications include switching secondary disinfectants, switching coagulants (
e.g.,
alum to ferric chloride), and switching corrosion inhibitor products (
e.g.,
orthophosphate to blended phosphate). Long-term treatment changes can also include dose changes to existing chemicals if the system is planning long-term changes to its finished water pH or residual inhibitor concentration. Long-term treatment changes would not include chemical dose fluctuations associated with daily raw water quality changes where a new source has not been added.
[89 FR 86627, Oct. 30, 2024]
§ 141.82
Description of corrosion control treatment requirements.
This section provides the requirements for systems and States designating optimal corrosion control treatment (OCCT) for a system that is optimizing or re-optimizing OCCT. All systems must complete the corrosion control treatment requirements in this section as applicable under § 141.81.
(a)
System recommendation regarding corrosion control treatment.
(1) Any system without corrosion control treatment that is required to recommend a treatment option in accordance with § 141.81(e)(1)(iii) must, based on the results of lead and copper tap sampling and water quality parameter monitoring, recommend designating one or more of the corrosion control treatments listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to the State as the optimal corrosion control treatment for that system. The State may require the system to conduct additional water quality parameter monitoring to assist the State in reviewing the system's recommendation.
(2) Any system with corrosion control treatment that exceeds the lead action level that is required to recommend a treatment option to the State in accordance with § 141.81(d)(1)(iii) must recommend designating one or more of the corrosion control treatments listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section as the optimal corrosion control treatment for that system.
(3) States may waive the requirement for a system to recommend OCCT if the State requires the system, in writing, to complete a corrosion control study within three months after the end of the tap sampling period in which the lead or copper action level exceedance occurred. These systems must proceed
directly to paragraph (c) of this section and complete a corrosion control study.
(b)
State decision to require studies to identify initial OCCT under § 141.81(e)(2) and re-optimized OCCT under § 141.81(d)(2).
(1) The State may require any small or medium water system without corrosion control treatment that exceeds either the lead action level or copper action level to perform corrosion control treatment studies under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to identify OCCT for the system.
(2) The State may require any small or medium water system with corrosion control treatment exceeding either the lead action level or copper action level to perform corrosion control treatment studies under paragraph (c)(2) of this section to identify re-optimized OCCT for the system (
i.e.,
OCCT after a re-optimization evaluation).
(c)
Performance of corrosion control studies.
(1) Systems without corrosion control treatment required to conduct corrosion control studies under § 141.81(e) must evaluate the effectiveness of each of the following treatments, and if appropriate, combinations of the following treatments, to identify OCCT for the system:
(i) Alkalinity and pH adjustment;
(ii) The addition of an orthophosphate- or a silicate-based corrosion inhibitor at a concentration sufficient to maintain an effective corrosion inhibitor residual concentration in all test samples;
(iii) The addition of an orthophosphate-based corrosion inhibitor at a concentration sufficient to maintain an orthophosphate residual concentration of 1 mg/L (as PO
4
) in all test samples; and
(iv) The addition of an orthophosphate-based corrosion inhibitor at a concentration sufficient to maintain an orthophosphate residual concentration of 3 mg/L (as PO
4
) in all test samples.
(2) Systems with corrosion control treatment required to conduct corrosion control studies under § 141.81(d) must evaluate the effectiveness of the following treatments, and if appropriate, combinations of the following treatments, to identify re-optimized OCCT for the system:
(i) Alkalinity and/or pH adjustment or re-adjustment;
(ii) The addition of an orthophosphate- or a silicate-based corrosion inhibitor at a concentration sufficient to maintain an effective corrosion inhibitor residual concentration in all test samples if no such inhibitor is currently utilized;
(iii) The addition of an orthophosphate-based corrosion inhibitor at a concentration sufficient to maintain an orthophosphate residual concentration of 1 mg/L (as PO
4
) in all test samples unless the current inhibitor process already meets this residual; and
(iv) The addition of an orthophosphate-based corrosion inhibitor at a concentration sufficient to maintain an orthophosphate residual concentration of 3 mg/L (as PO
4
) in all test samples unless the current inhibitor process already meets this residual.
(3) Systems must evaluate each of the corrosion control treatments specified in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section individually or, if appropriate, in combinations, using pipe rig/loop tests, metal coupon tests, partial-system tests, and/or analyses based on documented analogous treatments with similar size systems that have a similar water chemistry and similar distribution system configurations. Large and medium water systems with lead service lines, and other systems as required by the State, that exceed the lead action level must conduct pipe rig/loop studies using harvested lead service lines from their distribution systems to assess the effectiveness of corrosion control treatment options on the existing pipe scale. Metal coupon tests can be used as a screen to reduce the number of options evaluated in the pipe rig/loop studies to the current water quality and at least two additional treatment options.
(4) Systems must measure the following water quality parameters in any tests conducted under paragraph (c)(3) of this section both before and after evaluating the corrosion control treatments listed in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section:
(i) Lead;
(ii) Copper;
(iii) pH;
(iv) Alkalinity;
(v) Orthophosphate as PO
4
(when an orthophosphate-based inhibitor is used);
(vi) Silicate (when a silicate-based inhibitor is used); and
(vii) Any additional parameters necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of a corrosion control treatment as determined by the State.
(5) Systems must identify all chemical or physical constraints that limit or prohibit the use of a particular corrosion control treatment and document those constraints by providing either of the following:
(i) Data and documentation showing a particular corrosion control treatment has adversely affected other drinking water treatment processes when used by another water system with comparable water quality characteristics. Systems using metal coupon tests to screen and/or pipe rig/loop studies to evaluate treatment options cannot exclude treatment strategies from the studies based on the constraints identified in this paragraph (c)(5)(i).
(ii) Data and documentation demonstrating the water system previously attempted to evaluate a particular corrosion control treatment and found the treatment was ineffective or adversely affects other drinking water quality treatment processes. Systems using metal coupon tests to screen and/or pipe rig/loop studies to evaluate treatment options cannot exclude treatment strategies from the studies based on the constraints identified in this paragraph (c)(5)(ii), unless the treatment was found to be ineffective in a previous pipe rig/loop study.
(6) Systems must evaluate the effect of the chemicals used for corrosion control treatment on other drinking water quality treatment processes. Systems using metal coupon tests to screen and/or pipe rig/loop studies to evaluate treatment options cannot exclude any of the required treatment strategies specified in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section from the studies based on the effects identified in this section.
(7) Based on the data and analysis for each treatment option evaluated under this paragraph (c), systems must recommend to the State, in writing, the treatment option that the corrosion control studies indicate constitutes OCCT for that system as defined in § 141.2. Systems must provide the State with a rationale for the OCCT recommendation and all supporting documentation specified in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) and paragraphs (c)(3) through (7) of this section.
(d)
State designation of OCCT and re-optimized OCCT
—(1)
Designation of OCCT or re-optimized OCCT.
Based on available information including, where applicable, studies conducted under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section and/or a system's recommended corrosion control treatment option, the State must either approve the corrosion control treatment option recommended by the system or designate alternative corrosion control treatment(s) from among those listed in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable. The State must notify the water system, in writing, of its designation of OCCT or re-optimized OCCT and explain the basis for this determination.
(i) When designating OCCT, the State must consider the effects that additional corrosion control treatment will have on water quality parameters and other drinking water quality treatment processes.
(ii) If the State requests additional information to aid its review, the water system must provide that information.
(2) [Reserved]
(e)
Installation of OCCT and re-optimized OCCT.
Each system must install and operate the OCCT or re-optimized OCCT designated by the State under paragraph (d) of this section throughout its distribution system.
(f)
State review of treatment and designation of optimal water quality parameters for OCCT and re-optimized OCCT.
The State must evaluate the results of all lead and copper tap and water quality parameter sampling submitted by the water system and determine whether the water system has installed and operated the OCCT designated by the State in paragraph (d) of this section. Upon reviewing the system's tap and water quality parameter sampling
results, both before and after the water system installs OCCT, or re-optimizes OCCT, the State must designate each of the following:
(1) A minimum value or a range of values for pH measured at each entry point to the distribution system.
(2) A minimum pH value measured in all distribution system samples. This value must be equal to or greater than 7.0, unless the State determines that meeting a pH level of 7.0 is not technologically feasible or is not necessary for OCCT.
(3) If a corrosion inhibitor is used, a minimum concentration or a range of concentrations for orthophosphate (as PO
4
) or silicate measured at each entry point to the distribution system.
(4) If a corrosion inhibitor is used, a minimum orthophosphate (as PO
4
) or silicate concentration measured in all tap samples that the State determines is necessary to form a passivating film on the interior walls of the pipes of the distribution system. When orthophosphate is used, for OCCT designations for systems previously without corrosion control treatment, the orthophosphate concentration must be equal to or greater than 0.5 mg/L (as PO
4
) and for OCCT designations for systems previously with corrosion control treatment, the orthophosphate concentration must be equal to or greater than 1.0 mg/L, unless the State determines that meeting the applicable minimum orthophosphate residual is not technologically feasible or is not necessary for OCCT.
(5) If alkalinity is adjusted as part of OCCT, a minimum concentration or a range of concentrations for alkalinity, measured at each entry point to the distribution system and in all tap samples.
(6) The values for the applicable water quality parameters in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section must be the values the State determines reflect OCCT or re-optimized OCCT for the water system. The State may designate values for additional water quality parameters the State determines reflect OCCT or re-optimized OCCT for the water system. The State must notify the system, in writing, of these determinations and explain the basis for its decisions.
(g)
Continued operation and monitoring for OCCT and re-optimized OCCT.
All systems, including those optimizing or re-optimizing OCCT, must continue to operate and maintain OCCT, including maintaining water quality parameters at or above the minimum values or within the ranges designated by the State under paragraph (f) of this section, in accordance with this paragraph (g) for all water quality parameter samples collected under § 141.87(b)(4) through (d). The requirements of this paragraph (g) apply to all systems, including consecutive systems that distribute water that has been treated to control corrosion by another system, and any water system with corrosion control treatment, OCCT, or re-optimized OCCT that is not required to monitor water quality parameters under § 141.87.
(1) Compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (g) must be determined every six months, as specified under § 141.87(b)(4). A water system is out of compliance with the requirements of this paragraph (g) for a six-month period if it has excursions for any State-specified parameter on more than nine days, cumulatively, during the period. An excursion occurs whenever the daily value for one or more of the water quality parameters measured at a sampling location is below the minimum value or outside the range designated by the State. Daily values are calculated as set out in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. States have discretion to not include results of obvious sampling errors from this calculation. Sampling errors must still be recorded even when not included in calculations.
(2)(i) On days when more than one measurement for the water quality parameter is collected at the sampling location, the daily value must be the average of all results collected at that sampling location during the same day regardless of whether they are collected through continuous monitoring, grab sampling, or a combination of both. If EPA has approved an alternative formula under § 142.16(d)(1)(ii) of this chapter in the State's application for a program revision submitted pursuant to § 142.12 of this chapter, the
State's formula must be used to aggregate multiple measurements taken at a sampling point for the water quality parameters in lieu of the formula in this paragraph (g)(2).
(ii) On days when only one measurement for the water quality parameter is collected at the sampling location, the daily value must be the result of that measurement.
(iii) On days when no measurement is collected for the water quality parameter at the sampling location, the daily value must be the daily value calculated on the most recent day on which the water quality parameter was measured at the sampling location.
(h)
Modification of State treatment determination for OCCT and re-optimized OCCT.
Upon its own initiative or in response to a request by a water system or other interested party, a State may modify its determination of OCCT under paragraph (d) of this section, or optimal water quality parameters under paragraph (f) of this section. A request for modification by a system or other interested party must be in writing, explaining why the modification is appropriate, and providing supporting documentation. The State may require a system to conduct a CCT study to support modification of the determination of OCCT or re-optimized OCCT. The State may modify its determination where it concludes that such change is necessary to ensure that the water system continues to optimize corrosion control treatment. A revised designation must be made in writing, set forth the new treatment requirements and/or optimal water quality parameters, explain the basis for the State's determination, and provide an implementation schedule for completing the treatment modifications for re-optimized corrosion control treatment.
(i)
Treatment decisions by EPA in lieu of the State on OCCT and re-optimized OCCT.
Pursuant to the procedures in § 142.19 of this chapter, the EPA Regional Administrator may review OCCT determinations made by a State under paragraph (d), (f), or (h) of this section and issue Federal corrosion control treatment determinations consistent with the requirements of paragraph (d), (f), or (h) where the EPA Regional Administrator finds that:
(1) A State failed to issue a treatment determination by the applicable deadlines contained in § 141.81;
(2) A State abused its discretion; or
(3) The technical aspects of a State's determination would be indefensible in a Federal enforcement action taken against a water system.
(j)
Distribution System and Site Assessment for tap sample sites with lead results that exceed 0.010 mg/L.
The water system must conduct the following steps when the lead results from an individual tap sample site sampled under § 141.86 exceed 0.010 mg/L and the site is included in the site sample plan under § 141.86(a)(1):
(1)
Step 1: Corrosion control treatment assessment.
Within five days of receiving the tap sampling results, the water system must sample at a water quality parameter site in accordance with paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section that is on the same size water main in the same pressure zone and located within a half mile radius of the site with the lead result exceeding 0.010 mg/L. Water systems without corrosion control treatment are not required to collect these samples.
(i) The water system must measure the following water quality parameters:
(A) pH;
(B) Alkalinity;
(C) Orthophosphate (as PO
4
), when an inhibitor containing an orthophosphate compound is used; and
(D) Silica, when an inhibitor containing a silicate compound is used.
(ii) The water system must measure at the following locations:
(A) Water systems with an existing water quality parameter site that meets the requirements in this paragraph (j)(1) can conduct this sampling at that site.
(B) All water systems required to meet optimal water quality parameters but do not have an existing water quality parameter site that meets the requirements in this paragraph (j)(1) must add new sites to the minimum number of sites as described in § 141.87(b)(1)(i). Sites must be added until a system has twice the minimum number of sites listed in table 1 to
§ 141.87(b)(1)(i). When a system exceeds twice the number of sites, the State has discretion to determine if these additional newer sites can better assess the effectiveness of the corrosion control treatment and whether to remove existing sites during sanitary survey evaluation of OCCT.
(2)
Step 2: Site assessment.
Within 30 days of receiving the tap sampling results, water systems must collect and analyze a follow-up sample for lead at any tap sample site that exceeds 0.010 mg/L. These follow-up samples may use different sample volumes or different sample collection procedures to assess the source of elevated lead levels. Samples collected under this section must be submitted to the State but cannot be included in the 90th percentile calculation for compliance monitoring under § 141.86. If the water system is unable to collect a follow-up sample at a site, the water system must provide documentation to the State, as specified in § 141.90(g)(2), explaining why it was unable to collect a follow-up sample.
(3)
Step 3: Evaluate results and system treatment recommendation.
Water systems must evaluate the results of the sampling conducted under paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section to determine if either localized or centralized adjustment of the OCCT or other distribution system actions are necessary and submit the recommendation to the State within six months after the end of the tap sampling period in which the site(s) exceeded 0.010 mg/L. Corrosion control treatment modification may not be necessary to address every exceedance of 0.010 mg/L. Other distribution system actions may include flushing to reduce water age. Water systems must note the cause of the elevated lead level, if known from the site assessment, in their recommendation to the State as site-specific issues can be an important factor in why the system is not recommending any adjustment of corrosion control treatment or other distribution system actions. Systems in the process of optimizing or re-optimizing OCCT under paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section do not need to submit a treatment recommendation for distribution system and site assessment.
(4)
Step 4: State approval of treatment recommendation.
The State must approve the treatment recommendation or specify a different approach within six months of completing step 3 as described in paragraph (j)(3) of this section and notify the water system in writing.
(5)
Step 5: Modifications to OCCT.
If the State-approved treatment recommendation requires the water system to adjust the OCCT process, the water system must complete modifications to its corrosion control treatment within 12 months of receiving notification from the State as described in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. Systems without corrosion control treatment required to install OCCT must follow the schedule in § 141.81(e).
(6)
Step 6: Follow-up sampling.
Water systems adjusting OCCT must complete follow-up sampling in accordance with §§ 141.86(c)(2)(iii)(D) and 141.87(b)(3) within 12 months after completing step 5 as described in paragraph (j)(5) of this section and submit sampling results to the State in accordance with §§ 141.86 and 141.87.
(7)
Step 7: State OWQP designation.
For water systems adjusting OCCT, the State must review the water system's modification of corrosion control treatment and designate optimal water quality parameters in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section within six months of receiving sampling result in paragraph (j)(6) of this section.
(8)
Step 8: Operate in compliance.
For a water system adjusting OCCT, the water system must operate in compliance with the State-designated optimal water quality parameters in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section and continue to conduct tap sampling in accordance with §§ 141.86(c)(2)(iii)(E) and 141.87(b)(4).

(b)
Description of source water treatment requirements
—(1)
System treatment recommendation.
Any system which exceeds the lead or copper action level shall recommend in writing to the State the installation and operation of one of the source water treatments listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. A system may recommend that no treatment be installed based upon a demonstration that source water treatment is not necessary to minimize lead and copper levels at users' taps.
(2)
State determination regarding source water treatment.
The State shall complete an evaluation of the results of all source water samples submitted by the water system to determine whether source water treatment is necessary to minimize lead or copper levels in water delivered to users' taps. If the State determines that treatment is needed, the State shall either require installation and operation of the source water treatment recommended by the system (if any) or require the installation and operation of another source water treatment from among the following: Ion exchange, reverse osmosis, lime softening or coagulation/filtration. If the State requests additional information to aid in its review, the water system shall provide the information by the date specified by the State in its request. The State shall notify the system in writing of its determination and set forth the basis for its decision.
(3)
Installation of source water treatment.
Each system shall properly install and operate the source water treatment designated by the State under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(4)
State review of source water treatment and specification of maximum permissible source water levels.
The State shall review the source water samples taken by the water system both before and after the system installs source water treatment, and determine whether the system has properly installed and operated the source water treatment designated by the State. Based upon its review, the State shall designate the maximum permissible lead and copper concentrations for finished water entering the distribution system. Such levels shall reflect the contaminant removal capability of the treatment properly operated and maintained. The State shall notify the system in writing and explain the basis for its decision.
(5)
Continued operation and maintenance.
Each water system shall maintain lead and copper levels below the maximum permissible concentrations designated by the State at each sampling point monitored in accordance with § 141.88. The system is out of compliance with this paragraph if the level of lead or copper at any sampling point is greater than the maximum permissible concentration designated by the State.
(6)
Modification of State treatment decisions.
Upon its own initiative or in response to a request by a water system or other interested party, a State may
modify its determination of the source water treatment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or maximum permissible lead and copper concentrations for finished water entering the distribution system under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. A request for modification by a system or other interested party shall be in writing, explain why the modification is appropriate, and provide supporting documentation. The State may modify its determination where it concludes that such change is necessary to ensure that the system continues to minimize lead and copper concentrations in source water. A revised determination shall be made in writing, set forth the new treatment requirements, explain the basis for the State's decision, and provide an implementation schedule for completing the treatment modifications.
(7)
Treatment decisions by EPA in lieu of the State.
Pursuant to the procedures in § 142.19, the EPA Regional Administrator may review treatment determinations made by a State under paragraphs (b) (2), (4), or (6) of this section and issue Federal treatment determinations consistent with the requirements of those paragraphs where the Administrator finds that:
(i) A State has failed to issue a treatment determination by the applicable deadlines contained in § 141.83(a),
(ii) A state has abused its discretion in a substantial number of cases or in cases affecting a substantial population, or
(iii) The technical aspects of a State's determination would be indefensible in an expected Federal enforcement action taken against a system.

§ 141.84
Service line inventory and replacement requirements.
(a)
Service line and connector inventory development.
All water systems must develop a service line inventory that identifies the material and location of each service line connected to the public water distribution system. The inventory must include all service lines connected to the public water distribution system regardless of ownership status (
e.g.,
where service line ownership is shared, the inventory includes both the portion of the service line owned by the water system and the portion of the service line owned by the customer). The inventory must meet the following requirements:
(1) All water systems are required to develop an initial inventory and submit it to the State by October 16, 2024, as specified in § 141.80(a)(4)(i).
(2) All water systems must develop an updated initial inventory, known as the “baseline inventory”. Systems must submit the baseline inventory to the State by the compliance date in § 141.80(a)(3). Newly regulated public water systems, as defined in § 141.2, must develop a baseline inventory on a schedule established by the State that does not exceed three years from the date the system becomes subject to National Primary Drinking Water Regulations in this part. The baseline inventory must include each service line and identified connector that is connected to the public water distribution system regardless of ownership status (
e.g.,
where service line ownership is shared, the inventory includes both the portion of the service line owned by the water system and the portion of the service line owned by the customer).
(i) For the baseline inventory, water systems must conduct a review of any information listed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section that describes connector materials and locations. Water systems must also conduct a review of any information on lead and galvanized iron or steel materials that they have identified pursuant to § 141.42(d) to identify connector materials and locations. The water system may use other sources of information not listed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) if approved or required by the State.
(ii) Water systems must include each connector identified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section in their baseline inventory. Connector materials must be categorized in the following manner:
(A) “Lead” where the connector is made of lead.
(B) “Non-Lead” where the connector is determined through an evidence-based record, method, or technique not to be made of lead. Water systems are not required to identify the specific
material of a non-lead connector; however, they may use the material (
e.g.,
copper or galvanized) as an alternative to categorizing it as “Non-Lead”.
(C) “Unknown” where the material of the connector is not known.
(D) “No connector present” where there is no connector at the location (
e.g.,
where a service line directly connects a water main to a building inlet).
(iii) All water systems must include any new information on service line materials from all applicable sources described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section in the baseline inventory.
(3) Each service line, or portion of the service line where ownership is shared, must be categorized in the following manner:
(i) “Lead” where the service line is a lead service line as defined in § 141.2.
(ii) “Galvanized Requiring Replacement” where the service line is a galvanized requiring replacement service line as defined in § 141.2.
(iii) “Non-Lead” where the service line is determined through an evidence-based record, method, or technique not to be a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line. Water systems are not required to identify the specific material of a non-lead service line; however, they may use the material (
e.g.,
plastic or copper) as an alternative to categorizing it as “Non-Lead”.
(iv) “Lead Status Unknown” or “Unknown” where the service line material is not known to be lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or non-lead, such as where there is no documented evidence or evidence reliably supporting material categorization. Water systems may elect to provide more information regarding their unknown service lines as long as the inventory clearly distinguishes unknown service lines from those where the categorization of the material is based on the categorization methods approved under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(4) The inventory must include a street address associated with each service line and connector. Where a street address is not available for an individual service line or connector, a unique locational identifier (e.g., block, Global Positioning System or GPS coordinates, intersection, or landmark) may be used.
(5) The inventory must be publicly accessible.
(i) The publicly accessible inventory must include the information described in paragraphs (a)(2) through (4) of this section and be updated in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii) Water systems serving greater than 50,000 persons must make the publicly accessible inventory available online.
(6) When a water system has no lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service lines, no known lead connectors, and no connectors of unknown material, it may comply with the requirements in paragraph (a)(5) of this section using a written statement in lieu of the publicly accessible inventory, declaring that the distribution system has no lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service lines, no known lead connectors, and no connectors of unknown material. The statement must include a general description of all applicable sources used in the inventory as described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) and (b)(2) of this section to make this determination.
(7) Instructions to access the publicly accessible inventory (including inventories consisting only of a statement in accordance with paragraph (a)(6) of this section) must be included in the Consumer Confidence Report in accordance with § 141.153(h)(8)(ii).
(b)
Additional requirements for service line and connector inventory maintenance.
(1) All water systems must update the baseline inventory of service lines and connectors developed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and submit the updates to the State on an annual basis in accordance with § 141.90(e)(4). These updates begin one year after the compliance date in § 141.80(a)(3). The publicly accessible inventory must reflect any updates no later than the deadline to submit the updated inventory to the State.
(i) All water systems must identify the material of all lead status unknown service lines by the applicable mandatory service line replacement deadline in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(ii) Water systems whose inventories contain only non-lead service lines and non-lead connectors or no connectors present are not required to provide updated inventories to the State or updates to the publicly accessible inventory. If, in the future, such a water system discovers a lead service line, galvanized requiring replacement service line, or lead connector within its system, the system must notify the State no later than 60 days after the discovery, prepare an updated inventory in accordance with this section on a schedule established by the State, replace the lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, and replace any lead connector along the service line in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
(2) Water systems must update the inventory annually with any new information acquired from all applicable sources described in paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) of this section and follow all applicable requirements for the inventory in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. The water system may update the inventory using other sources of information not listed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section if the use of those sources is approved or required by the State.
(i) All construction and plumbing codes, permits, and records or other documentation that indicate the service line and connector materials used to connect structures to the distribution system.
(ii) All water system records on service lines and connectors, including distribution system maps and drawings, recent or historical records on each service connection and connector, meter installation records, historical capital improvement or master plans, and standard operating procedures.
(iii) All records of inspections in the distribution system that indicate the material composition of the service connections and connectors that connect a structure to the distribution system.
(iv) Water systems must update their inventory annually based on any lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line replacements, service line material inspections, or lead connector replacements that have been conducted. Each updated inventory and subsequent update to the publicly accessible inventory must include the following information regarding service line material identification and replacement:
(A) The total number of lead service lines in the inventory;
(B) The total number of galvanized requiring replacement service lines in the inventory;
(C) The total number of lead status unknown service lines in the inventory;
(D) The total number of non-lead service lines in the inventory;
(E) The total number of lead connectors in the inventory;
(F) The total number of connectors of unknown material in the inventory;
(G) The total number of full lead service line replacements and full galvanized requiring replacement service line replacements that have been conducted in each preceding program year as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section; and
(H) The total number of partial lead service line replacements and partial galvanized requiring replacement service line replacements that have been conducted in each preceding program year as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section.
(v) Water systems must identify service line material in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, connector material in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and addresses in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section as they are encountered in the course of normal operations (
e.g.,
checking service line materials when reading water meters or performing maintenance activities). Water systems must update the inventory annually based on the identified service line materials, connector materials and addresses.
(3) Water systems that discover a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line that was previously inventoried as non-lead must update their inventory in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Water systems must notify the State in accordance with § 141.90(e) and
comply with any additional actions required by the State to address the inventory inaccuracy.
(4) If a consumer or customer (if different from the person served at that service connection) notifies the water system of a suspected incorrect categorization of their service line material in the inventory, the system must respond to the consumer or customer within 30 days of receiving the notification to make an offer to inspect the service line.
(5) All water systems must validate the accuracy of the non-lead service line category in the inventory as follows:
(i) The water system must identify a validation pool consisting of all service lines categorized as “non-lead,” but excluding non-lead service lines identified by the following: records showing the service line was installed after June 19, 1988, or after the compliance date of a State or local law prohibiting the use of service lines that do not meet the 1986 definition of lead free in accordance with section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended in 1986 (Pub. L. 99-339, title I, sec. 109(a), 100 Stat. 651) and 40 CFR 141.43(d)(1) and (2), as codified on July 1, 1991, whichever is earlier; visual inspection of the pipe exterior at a minimum of two points (
e.g.,
excavation, visual inspection in the meter pit or stop box, or visual inspection inside the home); or previously replaced lead or galvanized requiring replacement service lines.
(ii) The water system must confirm the service line material of a random sample (
e.g.,
a sample selected by use of a random number generator or lottery method) of non-lead service lines from the validation pool. Confirmation of service line material must be done by visual inspection of the pipe exterior at a minimum of two points. Where ownership is shared, the water system must conduct at least one visual inspection on each portion of the service line. Where ownership is shared and only one portion of the service line is included in the validation pool, systems must conduct at least one point of visual inspection on the unconfirmed portion of the service line. Water systems must validate at least as many service lines as are required in table 1 to this paragraph (b)(5)(ii).

(iii) If physical access to private property is necessary to complete the validation and the water system is unable to gain access, the system is not required to conduct a validation at that site. The system must replace the site by randomly selecting a new service line that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section to conduct the validation.
(iv) The deadlines for inventory validation are:
(A) No later than December 31 following seven years after the compliance date in § 141.80(a)(3) for water systems subject to the mandatory service line replacement deadline in paragraph (d)(4) of this section or water systems who have reported only non-lead service lines in their baseline inventory, submitted to the State in accordance with § 141.90(e)(9);
(B) A deadline established by the State for water systems conducting mandatory service line replacement on a shortened deadline for service line replacement as established by the State in accordance with paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section; or
(C) A deadline established by the State to be no later than three years prior to the deadline for completing mandatory service line replacement if the water system is eligible for and plans to use a deferred deadline under paragraph (d)(5)(vi) of this section or an extended schedule for mandatory service line replacement pursuant to an exemption or a variance.
(v) Water systems that conduct inventory validation pursuant to this paragraph (b)(5) must complete the validation by the applicable deadline described in paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this
section, submit the results of the validation in accordance with § 141.90(e)(9), and comply with any additional actions required by the State to address inventory inaccuracies. The system must submit to the State the specific version (including the date) of the service line inventory that was used to determine the number of non-lead service lines included in the validation pool in accordance with § 141.90(e)(9).
(vi) Water systems may make a written request to the State to approve a waiver of the inventory validation requirements in this paragraph (b). To obtain a waiver, the water system must submit documentation to the State to demonstrate the system has conducted an inventory validation that is at least as stringent as the inventory validation requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section by the compliance date in § 141.80(a)(3) and obtain written approval of the waiver from the State.
(c)
Service line replacement plan.
All water systems with one or more lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service lines in their distribution system must create a service line replacement plan by the compliance date in § 141.80(a)(3) and submit a service line replacement plan to the State in accordance with § 141.90(e). The service line replacement plan must be sufficiently detailed to ensure a system is able to comply with the service line inventory and replacement requirements in this section.
(1) The service line replacement plan must include a description of:
(i) A strategy for determining the material composition of lead status unknown service lines in the service line inventory under paragraph (a) of this section;
(ii) A standard operating procedure for conducting full service line replacement (
e.g.,
techniques to replace service lines);
(iii) A communication strategy to inform consumers (
i.e.,
persons served at the service connection) and customers before a full or partial lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line replacement consistent with the requirements for notification and mitigation in paragraph (h) of this section;
(iv) A procedure for consumers and customers to flush service lines and premise plumbing of particulate lead following disturbance of a lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service line in accordance with § 141.85(f) and following full or partial replacement of a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line consistent with the requirements for notification and mitigation in paragraph (h) of this section;
(v) A strategy to prioritize service line replacement based on factors including, but not limited to, known lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines and community-specific factors, such as populations disproportionately impacted by lead and populations most sensitive to the effects of lead;
(vi) A funding strategy for conducting service line replacement. Where the water system intends to charge customers for the cost to replace all or a portion of the service line because it is authorized or required to do so under State or local law or water tariff agreement, the funding strategy must include a description of whether and how the water system intends to assist customers who are unable to pay to replace the portion of the service line they own;
(vii) A communication strategy to inform residential and non-residential customers and consumers (
e.g.,
property owners, renters, and tenants) served by the water system about the service line replacement plan and program; and
(viii) Identification of any laws, regulations, and/or water tariff agreements that affect the water system's ability to gain access to conduct full lead and galvanized requiring replacement service line replacement, including the citation to the specific laws, regulations, or water tariff agreement provisions. This includes identification of any laws, regulations, and/or water tariff agreements that require customer consent and/or require or authorize customer cost-sharing.
(ix) For any water system that identifies any lead-lined galvanized service lines in the service line inventory as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a strategy to determine
the extent of the use of lead-lined galvanized service lines in the distribution system and categorize any lead-lined galvanized service lines as lead pursuant to table 2 to paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(A) of this section.
(x) For any water system that is eligible for and plans to use a deferred deadline pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(vi) of this section:
(A) Documentation to support the system's determination that it is eligible for a deferred deadline, showing that 10 percent of the total number of known lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines in the replacement pool exceeds 39 annual replacements per 1,000 service connections as calculated in paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) of this section;
(B) Identification of the deferred deadline and the associated cumulative average replacement rate that the system considers to be the fastest feasible but no slower than a deadline and replacement rate corresponding to 39 annual replacements per 1,000 service connections as calculated in paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) of this section, as well as the annual number of replacements required, the length of time (in years and months), and the date of completion for this deadline and rate; and
(C) Information supporting the system's determination that replacing lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines by an earlier date and faster rate than provided under the deferred deadline provision in paragraph (d)(5)(vi) of this section is not feasible.
(2) The service line replacement plan must be made accessible to the public. Water systems serving greater than 50,000 persons must make the plan available to the public online.
(3) Water systems must annually update the service line replacement plan to include any new or updated information and submit the updates to the State on an annual basis in accordance with § 141.90(e). The water system must make the updated plan publicly accessible no later than the deadline to submit the updated plan to the State.
(i) If there is no new or updated information to include in the service line replacement plan since the previous iteration, the water system may certify to the State that the plan has no updates in lieu of resubmitting the plan unless the system is replacing service lines in accordance with a deferred deadline and paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section applies.
(ii) If there is no new or updated information to include in the service line replacement plan and the water system is replacing service lines in accordance with a deferred deadline pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(vi) of this section, every three years after the initial submission of the plan, the system must update the information specified in paragraph (c)(1)(x) of this section to support why the system continues to need the deferred deadline and resubmit the plan to the State.
(iii) If there are no longer lead, galvanized requiring replacement, and unknown service lines in the inventory as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, water systems are not required to resubmit the service line replacement plan or certify to the State that the plan has no updates.
(d)
Mandatory full service line replacement.
(1) All water systems must replace all lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines under the control of the water system unless the replacement would leave in place a partial lead service line.
(2) Where a water system has access (
e.g.,
legal access, physical access) to conduct full service line replacement, the service line is under its control, and the water system must replace the service line. Where a water system does not have access to conduct full service line replacement, the water system is not required by this subpart to replace the line, but the water system must document the reasons that the water system does not have access and include any specific laws, regulations, and/or water tariff agreements that affect the water system's ability to gain access to conduct full replacement of lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines. The water system must provide this documentation to the State pursuant to § 141.90(e)(10).
(i) This subpart does not establish the criteria for determining whether a system has access to conduct full service line replacement. Any applicable State or local laws or water tariff
agreement requirements to gain access to conduct full service line replacement must be identified in the service line replacement plan as described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii) [Reserved]
(3) Where a water system has legal access to conduct full service line replacement only if property owner consent is obtained, the water system must make a “reasonable effort” to obtain property owner consent. If such a water system does not obtain consent after making a “reasonable effort” to obtain it from any property owner, then the water system is not required by this subpart to replace any portion of the service line at that address unless there is a change in ownership of the property as described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. The water system must provide documentation of the reasonable effort to the State pursuant to § 141.90(e)(10).
(i) A “reasonable effort” must include at least four attempts to engage the property owner using at least two different methods of communication (
e.g.,
in-person conversation, phone call, text message, email, written letter, postcard, or information left at the door such as a door hanger) before the applicable deadline of mandatory service line replacement as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. The State may require systems to conduct additional attempts and may require specific outreach methods to be used.
(ii) Within six months of any change in ownership of the property, the water system must offer full service line replacement to any new property owner. Systems may use new service initiation or service transfer to a new customer to identify when there is a change in ownership. Within one year of any change in ownership of the property, the system must make a “reasonable effort” to obtain the property owner's consent as described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. If the water system is unable to obtain consent from the current property owner after making a “reasonable effort” to obtain it, the water system is not required under this subpart to replace the line. This paragraph (d)(3)(ii) continues to apply until all lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines are replaced.
(4) The deadline for water systems to replace all lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines under the control of the water system is no later than 10 program years after the compliance date specified in § 141.80(a)(3) unless the system is subject to a different deadline under paragraphs (d)(5)(v) and (vi) of this section.
(i) Water systems must start mandatory service line replacement programs no later than the compliance date specified in § 141.80(a)(3).
(ii) If a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line is discovered when the system's inventory is comprised of only non-lead service lines, the system must complete the following requirements:
(A) Update the replacement pool calculated under paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section.
(B) Conduct a full service line replacement of the affected service line as soon as practicable but no later than 180 days after the date the service line is discovered. Where a system determines that it is not practicable to conduct full service line replacement within 180 days after the date of discovery (e.g., due to freezing ground conditions), the system may request State approval for an extension of no later than one year after the date the service line was discovered to replace the affected service line. The request for an extension must be made no later than 90 days after the date of discovery of the affected service line.
(5) Water systems must meet a minimum cumulative average annual replacement rate for completing mandatory service line replacement in accordance with this paragraph (d)(5):
(i)
Annual replacement rate.
A water system must replace lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines as described in paragraph (d)(6) of this section at an average annual replacement rate of at least 10 percent calculated across a cumulative period unless the system is subject to a shortened replacement rate or eligible for a deferred replacement rate in accordance with paragraphs (d)(5)(v) and (vi) of this section.
(ii)
Cumulative percent of service lines replaced.
To calculate the cumulative percent of service lines replaced, at the end of each mandatory service line replacement “program year” as specified in paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section, water systems must divide the total number of lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines replaced thus far in the program in accordance with paragraph (d)(6)(iii) of this section by the number of service lines within the replacement pool in accordance with paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section.
(iii)
Program year.
The first mandatory service line replacement “program year” is from the compliance date specified in § 141.80(a)(3) to the end of the next calendar year. Every program year thereafter is on a calendar year basis. This paragraph (d)(5)(iii) applies for the purposes of this section.
(iv)
Cumulative average replacement rate.
The annual replacement rate in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section is assessed annually as a cumulative average. The first cumulative average replacement rate must be assessed at the end of the third program year and is calculated by dividing the cumulative percent of service lines replaced in accordance with paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section by the number of completed program years (or three in this case). Annually thereafter, at the end of each program year, systems must assess the cumulative average replacement rate by dividing the most recent cumulative percent of service lines replaced in accordance with paragraph (d)(5)(ii) by the number of completed program years. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, the cumulative average replacement rate must be 10 percent or greater each program year, and the water system must replace all lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines under its control by the applicable deadline for completing mandatory service line replacement in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(A) A water system is not required by this section to meet the cumulative average replacement rate described in this paragraph (d)(5) where, after the compliance date specified in § 141.80(a)(3), the system has replaced all lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines in the replacement pool as described in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section that are under the control of the system, identified all unknown service lines in the inventory, and documented and submitted to the State the reasons the system currently does not have access to conduct full replacement of the remaining lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines in the replacement pool in accordance with paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section. When lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines come under the control of the system, the water system is required to replace the service lines as described in this paragraph (d). This paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(A) continues to apply until all lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines are replaced.
(B) [Reserved]
(v)
Shortened deadline and associated replacement rate.
Where the State determines that a shortened replacement deadline is feasible for a water system (
e.g.,
by considering the number of lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines in a system's inventory), the system must replace service lines by the State-determined deadline and by a faster minimum replacement rate in accordance with paragraph (d)(5)(v)(A) of this section. The State must make this determination in writing and notify the system of its finding. The State must set a shortened deadline at any time throughout a system's replacement program if a State determines a shorter deadline is feasible. This paragraph (d)(5)(v) also applies to systems eligible for a deferred deadline as specified in paragraph (d)(5)(vi) of this section.
(A) Systems must replace lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines at an average annual replacement rate calculated by dividing 100 by the number of years needed to meet the shortened deadline determined by the State, expressed as a percentage. Systems must comply with the cumulative average replacement rate in accordance with paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section, where the first cumulative average replacement rate is assessed at the end of the program year that is at least one year after the shortened deadline determination, as determined
by the State, unless the shortened replacement deadline is less than three years. If the system's shortened replacement deadline is less than three years, the cumulative average replacement rate must be assessed on a schedule determined by the State.
(B) [Reserved]
(vi)
Deferred deadlines and associated replacement rates.
A water system may defer service line replacement past the deadline in paragraph (d)(4) of this section if the system meets the following criteria:
(A) If a water system replacing 10 percent of the total number of known lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines in a system's replacement pool results in an annual number of service line replacements by the water system that exceeds 39 per 1,000 service connections, the system may complete replacement of all lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines by a deadline that corresponds to the system conducting 39 annual replacements per 1,000 service connections at a cumulative average replacement rate assessed in accordance with paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section. This paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(A) is also applicable if a water system with service lines newly under their control, after previously not having control as described in paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(A) of this section, is required to conduct more than 39 annual replacements per 1,000 service connections. The number of annual replacements corresponding to 39 annual replacements per 1,000 service connections can be calculated by multiplying the number of service connections in a system by 0.039. The number of years needed to complete replacement is the total number of known lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines in a system's replacement pool divided by the calculated number of annual replacements. To calculate the minimum cumulative average replacement rate, the system must divide 100 by the number of years needed to achieve replacing 39 annual replacements per 1,000 service connections, expressed as a percentage.
(B) Any water system that is eligible for and plans to use a deferred deadline must include information, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(x) of this section, to support the use of a deferred deadline including identifying the deadline and associated cumulative average rate of replacement to meet this deferred deadline in the system's initial service line replacement plan and subsequent updates to the plan in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The system must identify an annual replacement rate that is no less than 39 annual replacements per 1,000 service connections.
(C) As soon as practicable, but no later than the end of the second program year as defined in paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section, and every three years thereafter, the State must determine in writing whether the deferred deadline and associated cumulative average replacement rate the system documented in paragraph (c)(1)(x)(B) of this section are the fastest feasible to conduct mandatory service line replacement and either approve the continued use of this deferred deadline and replacement rate as the fastest feasible for the system, or set a shorter deferred deadline and identify an associated replacement rate to ensure the system is replacing service lines at the fastest feasible rate for the system. The State must consider information that includes, but is not limited to, the system's submissions of the service line inventory and replacement plan in accordance with paragraph (a) through (c) of this section and information collected from other water systems conducting mandatory service line replacement. The State may require the system to provide additional information for the State to consider in its assessment of the continued use of a deferred deadline and the fastest feasible replacement rate.
(D) In the first two program years, the system must comply with the annual replacement rate identified in its initial replacement plan (unless the State determines a faster rate is feasible sooner). In subsequent program years, the system must comply with the applicable deferred deadline and associated replacement rate identified in the State's written determination of the deadline and replacement rate in paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(C) of this section.
(6) Calculation of the replacement pool, the annual number of replacements required, and the number of service lines replaced each year to calculate a system's cumulative average replacement rate described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section are as follows:
(i)
Replacement pool.
To calculate the replacement pool, systems must add the total number of lead, galvanized requiring replacement, and lead status unknown service lines in the baseline inventory submitted by the compliance date specified in § 141.80(a)(3). The water system must not subtract lead or galvanized requiring replacement service lines from the replacement pool when they are replaced. The water system must not subtract service lines that are not under the control of the system from the replacement pool. At the beginning of each program year, water systems must update the replacement pool according to the counts of specific types of recategorized service lines in the inventory annually thereafter as described in this paragraph (d)(6)(i):
(A) Unknown service lines that are identified as non-lead service lines must be subtracted from the replacement pool. Unknown service lines that are identified as lead or galvanized requiring replacement service lines must be recategorized appropriately in the inventory and replacement pool, but they do not change the number of service lines in the replacement pool because recategorization does not remove these service lines from the replacement pool.
(B) Non-lead service lines discovered to be lead or galvanized requiring replacement service lines must be added to the replacement pool.
(C) Lead or galvanized requiring replacement service lines discovered to be non-lead service lines must be subtracted from the replacement pool.
(D) Each entire service line must count only once for purposes of calculating the replacement pool.
(ii)
Annual number of replacements required.
To calculate the number of lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines a system is required to replace in a given program year, divide the number of service lines in the most up-to-date replacement pool, calculated at the beginning of each program year, by the total number of years remaining under paragraph (d)(4) of this section to complete mandatory service line replacement (e.g., 10 years).
(iii)
Number of service lines replaced.
When calculating the cumulative average replacement rate, the water system may only include full service line replacements of lead or galvanized requiring replacement service lines when counting the number of service lines replaced. Wherever the system conducts a replacement of a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line (either a portion of a service line or the entire service line), the replacement counts as a full service line replacement only if, after the replacement, the entire service line can be categorized in the inventory as non-lead under paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section.
(A) For purposes of mandatory service line replacement, systems must count each entire service line once, including where ownership of the service line is shared, with a single material categorization in accordance with table 2 to this paragraph (d)(6)(iii)(A).

(B) A full service line replacement is counted where a non-lead service line is installed for use and the lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line is disconnected from the water main or other service line. If the lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line is disconnected from the water main or system-owned portion of the service line but not removed, the water system must be subject to a State or local law or have a written policy to preclude the water system from reconnecting the lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line to the water main or other service line.
(C) A full service line replacement may be counted where a system physically disconnects a service line that is not in use and the water system does not install a new non-lead service line because there is no service line in use (
e.g.,
at an abandoned property). If the disconnected lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line is not removed, the water system must be subject to a State or local law or have a written policy to preclude the water system from reconnecting the disconnected service line (
i.e.,
a new non-lead service line must be installed if active use is to resume).
(D) Water systems must not count the following as a full service line replacement for purposes of this subpart:
(
1
) Where the service line is partially replaced as defined in § 141.2.
(
2
) Where a lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or unknown service line is determined to be a non-lead service line.
(
3
) Where only a lead connector is replaced.
(
4
) Where pipe lining or coating technologies are used while the lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line remains in use.
(
5
) Where a water system does not replace a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line because it is not be under the control of the system as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(e)
Replacement of lead connectors when encountered by a water system.
(1) The water system must replace any lead connector when encountered during planned or unplanned water system infrastructure work unless the connector is not under the control of the system (e.g., where the system does not have and cannot obtain access to conduct the connector replacement).
(i) Upon replacement of any connector that is attached to a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line, the water system must follow risk mitigation measures for disturbances as specified in § 141.85(f)(2).
(ii) Following replacement of a lead connector, the water system must update the information on the connector material and location in its inventory in accordance with paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (b)(2) of this section.
(2) The water system must comply with any State or local laws that require additional connectors to be replaced.
(f)
Replacement of a service line prompted by the customer.
If State or local laws or water tariff agreements do not prevent customers from conducting partial lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line replacements (“customer-initiated replacements”), the water system must meet the following requirements:
(1) If the water system is notified by the customer that the customer intends to conduct a partial lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line replacement, the water system must:
(i) Replace the remaining portion of the lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line at the same time as, or as soon as practicable after, the customer-initiated replacement, but no later than 45 days from the date the customer conducted the partial replacement;
(ii) Provide notification and risk mitigation measures in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, as applicable, before the affected service line is returned to service; and
(iii) Notify the State within 30 days if it cannot meet the deadline in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section and complete the replacement no later than 180 days from the date the customer conducted the partial replacement.
(2) If the water system is notified or otherwise learns that a customer-initiated replacement occurred within the previous six months and left in place the system-owned portion of a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line, the water system must:
(i) Replace any remaining portion of the affected service line within 45 days from the day of becoming aware of the customer-initiated replacement; and
(ii) Provide notification and risk mitigation measures in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section within 24 hours of becoming aware of the customer replacement.
(iii) Notify the State within 30 days if it cannot meet the deadline in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section and complete the replacement no later than 180 days of the date the system learns of the customer-initiated replacement.
(3) When a water system is notified or otherwise learns of a customer-initiated replacement of a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line that occurred more than six months in the past, this section does not require the water system to complete the lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line replacement of the system-owned portion under this paragraph (f). However, the remaining portion of the lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line must be identified in the inventory in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and replaced in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
(g)
Requirements for conducting partial service line replacements.
This paragraph (g) prohibits water systems from conducting a partial lead service line replacement or a partial galvanized requiring replacement service line replacement as defined under § 141.2 unless it is conducted as part of an emergency repair or in coordination with planned infrastructure work that impacts service lines, excluding planned infrastructure work solely for the purposes of lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line replacement. Where a water system has access to conduct full service line replacement as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the water system must fully replace the service line. Where a water system conducts partial service line replacement, the system must comply with the notification and mitigation requirements specified in paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) Whenever a water system conducts a partial replacement of a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line, the system must include a dielectric coupling separating the remaining service line and the replaced service line (
i.e.,
newly installed service line) to prevent galvanic corrosion unless the replaced service line is made of plastic.
(2) [Reserved]
(h)
Protocols for notification and mitigation for partial and full service line replacements
—(1)
Notification and mitigation requirements for planned partial service line replacement.
Whenever a water system plans to partially replace a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line in coordination with planned infrastructure work that impacts service lines, the water system must provide written notice to the property owner, or the owner's authorized agent, as well as non-owner occupant(s) served by the affected service line at least 45 days prior to the replacement. Where a water system has access to conduct full service line replacement only if property owner consent is obtained, the water system must make a reasonable effort to obtain property owner consent to replace the remaining portion of the service line in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. The reasonable effort must be completed before the partial lead service line replacement.
(i) Before the affected service line is returned to service, the water system must provide written notification that explains that consumers may experience a temporary increase of lead levels in their drinking water due to the replacement and that meets the content requirements of § 141.85(a)(1)(ii) through (iv) and contact information for the water system. In instances where multi-family dwellings or multiple non-residential occupants are
served by the affected service line to be partially replaced, the water system may elect to post the information at a conspicuous location instead of providing individual written notification to all residents or non-residential occupants.
(ii) Before the affected service line is returned to service, the water system must provide written information about a procedure for consumers to flush service lines and premise plumbing of particulate lead following partial replacement of a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line.
(iii) Before the affected service line is returned to service, the water system must provide the consumer with a pitcher filter or point-of-use device certified by an American National Standards Institute accredited certifier to reduce lead, six months of replacement cartridges, and instructions for use. If the affected service line serves more than one residence or non-residential unit (
e.g.,
a multi-unit building), the water system must provide a pitcher filter or point-of-use device, six months of replacement cartridges and use instructions to every residential and non-residential unit in the building.
(iv) The water system must offer to the consumer to collect a follow up tap sample between three months and six months after the completion of any partial replacement of a lead service line. The tap sample must be a first- and fifth-liter paired sample after at least six hours of stagnation, following the tap sampling protocol under § 141.86(b). The water system must provide the results of the sample to the persons served by the service line in accordance with § 141.85(d).
(2)
Notification and mitigation requirements for emergency partial service line replacement.
Any water system that creates a partial replacement of a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line due to an emergency repair must provide notice and risk mitigation measures to the persons served by the affected service line in accordance with paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section before the affected service line is returned to service. The water system must offer to the property owner, or the owner's authorized agent, to replace the partial service line created by the emergency repair within 45 days.
(3)
Notification and mitigation requirements for full service line replacement.
Any water system that conducts a full lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line replacement must provide written notice to the persons served by the affected service line before the affected service line is returned to service; written notice must be provided to the owner or the owner's authorized agent, no later than 30 days following completion of the replacement.
(i) The written notification must explain that consumers may experience a temporary increase of lead levels in their drinking water due to the replacement and must meet the content requirements of § 141.85(a)(1)(ii) through (iv) as well as contact information for the water system. In instances where multi-family dwellings or multiple non-residential occupants are served by the lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line to be replaced, the water system may elect to post the information at a conspicuous location instead of providing individual written notification to all persons served in residential and non-residential units.
(ii) Before the replaced service line is returned to service, the water system must provide written information about a procedure for consumers to flush service lines and premise plumbing of particulate lead following full replacement of a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line.
(iii) Before the replaced service line is returned to service, the water system must provide the consumer with a pitcher filter or point-of-use device certified by an American National Standards Institute accredited certifier to reduce lead, six months of replacement cartridges, and instructions for use. If the lead service line serves more than one residence or non-residential unit (
e.g.,
a multi-unit building), the water system must provide a pitcher filter or point-of-use device, six months of replacement cartridges and instructions for use to every residential and non-residential unit in the building.
(iv) The water system must offer to the consumer to collect a follow up tap
sample between three months and six months after completion of any full replacement of a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line. The tap sample must be a first-liter sample after at least six hours of stagnation, following the tap sampling protocol under § 141.86(b). The water system must provide the results of the sample to the consumer in accordance with § 141.85(d).
(i)
Reporting to demonstrate compliance to the State.
To demonstrate compliance with paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section, a water system must report to the State the information specified in § 141.90(e).
[89 FR 86634, Oct. 30, 2024]
§ 141.85
Public education and supplemental monitoring and mitigation requirements.
A water system that exceeds the lead action level based on tap water samples collected in accordance with § 141.86 must distribute the public education materials contained in paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with the delivery requirements in paragraph (b) of this section. Water systems that exceed the lead action level must offer to sample the tap water of any person served by the water system who requests it in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Water systems must offer to sample for lead in the tap water of any person served by a lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service line who requests it in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. All water systems must deliver a consumer notice of lead tap water monitoring results and copper tap water monitoring results to persons served by the water system at sites that are sampled, as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. A water system with lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service lines must deliver public education materials to persons with a lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service line as specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. All community water systems that do not meet the minimum replacement rate for mandatory service line replacement as required under § 141.84(d) must conduct outreach activities as specified in paragraph (h) of this section. All community water systems must conduct annual outreach to local and State health agencies as outlined in paragraph (i) of this section. Water systems with multiple lead action level exceedances, as specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, must conduct public outreach and make filters certified to reduce lead available as specified in paragraphs (j)(2) through (6) of this section. For water systems serving a large proportion of consumers with limited English proficiency, as determined by the State, all public education materials required under this section must comply with the language requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(a)(1)(ii)
There is no safe level of lead in drinking water. Exposure to lead in drinking water can cause serious health effects in all age groups, especially pregnant people, infants (both formula-fed and breastfed), and young children. Some of the health effects to infants and children include decreases in IQ and attention span. Lead exposure can also result in new or worsened learning and behavior problems. The children of persons who are exposed to lead before or during pregnancy may be at increased risk of these harmful health effects. Adults have increased risks of heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney or nervous system problems. Contact your health care provider for more information about your risks.
(iii)
Sources of lead.
(A) Explain what lead is.
(B) Explain possible sources of lead in drinking water and how lead enters drinking water. Include information on home/building plumbing materials, service lines, and connectors that may contain lead and include information about the definition of lead free as provided in Safe Drinking Water Act section 1417 of 1986 and as subsequently revised in 2011. Explain that lead levels may vary and therefore lead exposure is possible even when tap sampling results do not detect lead at one point in time.
(C) Discuss other important sources of lead exposure in addition to drinking water (
e.g.,
paint).
(iv)
Consumer steps to reduce lead exposure.
Discuss the steps the consumer can take to reduce their exposure to lead in drinking water.
(A) Explain that using a filter, certified by an American National Standards Institute accredited certifier to reduce lead, is effective in reducing lead exposures. If the system makes filters available in accordance with paragraph (j)(2) of this section, also include information on how the consumer can obtain a filter.
(B) Encourage running the water to flush out the lead. Explain that lead levels increase over time as water sits in lead-containing plumbing materials and regular water usage in the building can reduce lead levels in drinking water. Advise consumers served by lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines that they may need to flush the water for longer periods.
(C) Explain concerns with using hot water from the tap and specifically caution against the use of hot water for preparing baby formula.
(D) Explain that boiling water does not reduce lead levels.
(E) Encourage regular cleaning of faucet aerators.
(F) Discuss other steps consumers can take to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water, especially for pregnant persons, infants, and young children, such as using alternative sources of water.
(G) Suggest that parents have their child's blood tested for lead. Provide contact information for the State and/or local health department.
(H) Tell consumers how to get their water tested, including information in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(v)
Levels of lead in drinking water.
Explain why there are elevated levels of lead in the system's drinking water (if known) and what the water system is doing to reduce the lead levels in homes/buildings in this area.
(vi)
Information on lead, galvanized requiring replacement, and unknown service lines.
For systems with lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service lines in the system's inventory pursuant to § 141.84(a) and (b), public education materials must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(vi)(A) through (G) of this section. For systems with lead connectors or connectors of unknown material in the system's inventory pursuant to § 141.84(a) and (b), public education materials must meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(vi)(C) of this section:
(A) Discuss opportunities to replace lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines;
(B) Discuss opportunities to have the material of a lead status unknown service line identified;
(C) Include information on how to obtain a copy of the service line inventory or view the inventory on the internet if the system is required to make the inventory available online so the consumer can find out if they are served by a lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service line, or known lead connector or connector of unknown material;
(D) Include information on how to obtain a copy of the service line replacement plan or view the plan on the internet if the system is required to make the service line replacement plan available online;
(E) Include information about opportunities to replace lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines. Where the water system intends for customer payment for a portion of the replacement where it is required or authorized by State or local law or a water tariff agreement, the notice must include information about programs that provide financing solutions to assist property owners with replacement of their portion of a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line;
(F) Include a statement that the water system is required to replace its portion of a lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line when the property owner notifies the water system that they are replacing their portion of the lead or galvanized requiring replacement service line; and
(G) Include a statement that provides instructions for the customer or consumer to notify the water system if they disagree with the service line material categorization in the inventory.

(i) To select sampling sites, a water system must use information regarding the material of service lines and connectors, including lead, copper, and galvanized iron or steel, required to be collected under § 141.84.
(ii) Water systems must identify locations in the site sample plan by selecting from sites in the highest tier, unless the site has been found to be unavailable, in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(iii) Sampling sites cannot include sites with installed point-of-entry (POE) treatment devices or taps with point-of-use devices designed to remove inorganic contaminants, except in water systems using these devices at all service connections for primary drinking water taps to meet other primary and secondary drinking water standards as under § 141.93(c)(1).
(2) A water system that has fewer than five sites with drinking water taps that can be used for human consumption meeting the sample site criteria of this paragraph (a) to reach the required number of sample sites listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (d)(1) of this section, must collect at least one sample from each tap and collect additional samples from those taps on different days during the tap sampling period to meet the required number of sites. Alternatively, the State may allow these water systems to collect a number of samples fewer than the number of sites specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (d)(1), provided that 100 percent of all taps that can be used for human consumption are sampled. The State must approve this reduction of the minimum number of samples in writing based on a request from the system or onsite verification by the State.
(3) A water system serving sites with premise plumbing made of lead and/or that are served by a lead service line must collect all samples for monitoring under this section from sites with premise plumbing made of lead and/or served by a lead service line. A water system that cannot identify enough sampling sites with premise plumbing made of lead and/or served by lead service lines to meet the minimum number of sites required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (d)(1) of this section must still collect samples from every available site, in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section, containing premise plumbing made of lead and/or served by a lead service line and collect the remaining samples in accordance with the tiering requirements under paragraph (a)(4).
(4) Sampling sites must be selected from the highest tier available (Tier 1 is the highest tier and Tier 5 is the lowest tier). Sites are available unless a customer refuses to participate in sampling or a system has made at least two outreach attempts at a site and has not received a response. The number of customer refusals and non-responses for compliance sampling during each tap sampling period must be submitted to the State in accordance with the requirements at § 141.90(a)(2)(viii). Systems may continue conducting outreach at sites considered unavailable and may subsequently add such sites to the site sample plan for any reason, such as receiving a service initiation request from a new property owner or occupant or receiving a new consumer request for sampling. A system without a large enough number of sites from a higher tier to meet the number of sites required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (d)(1) of this section may sample sites from the next highest tier. For water systems where Tier 2 sites comprise at least 20 percent of the residential structures served by the community water system, Tier 2 sites may be sampled even when Tier 1 sites are available.
(i) Tier 1 sampling sites are single-family structures with premise plumbing made of lead and/or served by a lead service line.
(ii) Tier 2 sampling sites are buildings, including multiple-family residences, with premise plumbing made of lead and/or served by a lead service line.
(iii) Tier 3 sampling sites are sites that are served by a lead connector. Tier 3 sites are also sites served by a galvanized service line or containing galvanized premise plumbing identified as ever having been downstream of a lead service line. Tier 3 for community water systems only includes single-family structures.
(iv) Tier 4 sampling sites are sites that contain copper premise plumbing with lead solder installed before the effective date of the State's applicable lead ban. Tier 4 for community water systems only includes single-family structures.
(v) Tier 5 sampling sites are sites that are representative of sites throughout the distribution system. For purpose of this paragraph (a), a representative site is a site in which the plumbing materials used at that
site would be commonly found at other sites served by the water system.
(b)
Sample collection protocol.
(1) Except for samples described in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section, all tap samples collected for analysis of lead and copper must be one liter in volume and have stood motionless in the plumbing system and/or service line of each sampling site for at least six hours. Bottles used to collect samples for analysis must be wide-mouth, one-liter sample bottles, as defined at § 141.2. Samples from residential housing must be collected from an interior kitchen or bathroom sink cold-water tap. Samples from a nonresidential building must be collected at an interior cold-water tap from which water is typically drawn for human consumption. Samples may be collected by the system, or the system may allow members of the public to collect samples after providing instructions for collecting samples in accordance with this paragraph (b)(1). Sample collection instructions cannot direct the sample collector to remove or clean the aerator or flush taps prior to the start of the minimum six-hour stagnation period. To protect members of the public from injury due to handling nitric acid, samples may be acidified up to 14 days after the sample is collected. After acidification to resolubilize the metals, the sample must stand in the original container for a period of time, as specified by the approved EPA method in § 141.23 selected for sample analysis. If a system allows members of the public to sample, the system cannot challenge the accuracy of the sampling results based on alleged sample collection errors.
(i) The first-liter sample must be analyzed for lead and copper at sample sites where both contaminants are required to be monitored. At sample sites where only lead is required to be monitored, the first-liter sample may be analyzed for only lead.
(ii) For sites served by a lead service line, which fall under Tier 1 and Tier 2, an additional fifth-liter sample must be collected at the same time as the first-liter sample and must be analyzed for lead. To collect a first-liter-and-fifth-liter-paired sample, systems must collect tap water in five consecutively numbered, wide-mouth, one-liter sample bottles after the water has stood motionless in the plumbing of each sampling site, including the lead service line, for at least six hours without flushing the tap prior to sample collection. Systems must collect samples starting with the first sample bottle and then fill each subsequently numbered bottle in consecutive order until the final bottle is filled, with the water running constantly while the samples are being collected. In this sequence, the first-liter sample is the first sample collected and the fifth-liter sample is the final sample collected.
(iii) State-approved samples collected pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section may include samples with stagnation periods less than six hours, but must meet all the other sample collection criteria in this paragraph (b)(1), including being one-liter in volume using a wide-mouth bottle and collected at an interior tap from which water is typically drawn for human consumption.
(iv) Systems may use different sample volumes and/or different sample collection procedures when they collect follow-up samples for Distribution System and Site Assessment under § 141.82(j)(2) and consumer-requested samples under § 141.85(c) to assess the source of lead. Consumer-requested samples must be collected in accordance with § 141.85(c). Systems must submit these sample results to the State in accordance with § 141.90(a)(2)(i) and (g).
(2) Systems must sample at sites listed in the site sample plan. Additionally, systems must prioritize sampling at the same sites that were sampled in the previous tap sampling period. If such a site no longer qualifies under the tiering criteria or if, for reasons beyond the control of the water system, the water system cannot gain access to a sampling site in order to collect a tap sample, the system must collect the tap sample from another site in its site sample plan that meets the original tiering criteria, where such a site exists. Systems must report any change in sites from the previous tap sampling period, and include an explanation of why sampling sites have changed, as required in § 141.90(a)(2)(v). If changes
are needed to the site sample plan, systems must submit their updated site sample plan, as required under § 141.90(a)(1)(i), before the start of the next tap sampling period conducted by the system.
(3) A non-transient non-community water system, or a community water system that meets the criteria of § 141.85(b)(8), that does not have enough sites with taps from which first-liter samples or first-liter-and-fifth-liter-paired samples meeting the six-hour minimum stagnation time can be collected, as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, may apply to the State in writing to request approval to substitute first-liter or first-liter-and-fifth-liter-paired samples that do not meet the six-hour minimum stagnation time. Such systems must collect as many first-liter or first-liter-and-fifth-liter-paired samples from interior taps used for human consumption as possible towards meeting the minimum number of sites required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (d)(1) of this section. For the remaining samples to meet the minimum number required, systems must identify sampling times and locations that would likely result in the longest standing times. The State has the discretion to waive the requirement for prior State approval of sites not meeting the six-hour stagnation time either through State regulation or written notification to the system.
(c)
Standard monitoring.
Standard monitoring consists of six-month tap monitoring periods that begin on January 1 and July 1.
(1)
Standard monitoring sites.
During a standard tap monitoring period, a water system must collect at least one sample from the number of sites in the following table 1 to this paragraph (c)(1). Standard monitoring sites must be selected in accordance with the sampling tiers identified in paragraph (a) of this section.

Criteria for standard monitoring.
The following systems must conduct standard monitoring for at least two consecutive tap monitoring periods beginning January 1 or July 1, whichever is sooner, following the tap sampling period in which the criterion is met. Systems may then reduce monitoring in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
(i) All water systems with lead or galvanized requiring replacement service lines in their inventories as of November 1, 2027, including those deemed optimized under § 141.81(b)(3), must conduct standard monitoring in the first six-month tap monitoring period following November 1, 2027, unless the system has, before or by that date, met all the following criteria:
(A) The system conducts compliance monitoring of sites that meet the correct priority tiering targeting sites served by lead and galvanized requiring replacement service lines in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section;
(B) The system collects samples in accordance with all sample collection requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (3) of this section; and
(C) The system collects either first-liter samples or first-liter-and-fifth-liter- paired samples in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(ii) Any water system whose most recent 90th percentile lead and/or copper results as of November 1, 2027, exceeds the lead and/or copper action level must conduct standard monitoring in the first six-month tap monitoring period following November 1, 2027.
(iii) Systems meeting any of the following criteria:
(A) Any water system that exceeds a lead or copper action level.
(B) Any system that fails to operate at or above the minimum value or
within the range of values for the optimal water quality parameters designated by the State under § 141.82(f) for more than nine days in any tap monitoring period as specified in § 141.87.
(C) Any water system that becomes a large water system without corrosion control treatment or any large water system without corrosion control treatment whose lead 90th percentile exceeds the lead practical quantitation limit of 0.005 mg/L.
(D) Any water system that installs OCCT or re-optimizes OCCT as a result of exceeding the lead or copper action level, or any water system that adjusts OCCT following a Distribution System and Site Assessment. Systems conducting standard monitoring under this criterion must continue standard monitoring until the State designates new optimal water quality parameters, at which point systems must comply with paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(E) of this section.
(E) Any water system for which the State has designated new values for optimal water quality parameters under § 141.82.
(F) Any water system that installs source water treatment pursuant to § 141.83(a)(3).
(G) Any water system that has notified the State in writing in accordance with § 141.90(a)(4) of an upcoming addition of a new source or long-term change in treatment, unless the State determines that the addition of the new source or long-term change in treatment is not significant and, therefore, does not warrant more frequent monitoring.
(H) Any water system without lead or galvanized requiring replacement service lines in its inventory that notifies the State under § 141.90(e)(4)(ii) of any subsequently discovered lead or galvanized requiring replacement service lines in its distribution system, unless the system replaces all the discovered service lines before the start of the next tap monitoring period.
(d)
Reduced monitoring based on 90th percentile levels.
Reduced monitoring refers to an annual or triennial tap monitoring period. Each annual or triennial tap monitoring period includes one tap sampling period. The reduced monitoring frequency is based on the 90th percentile value for the water system.
(1)
Reduced monitoring sites.
During a reduced tap monitoring period, a water system must collect at least one sample from the number of sites specified in table 2 to this paragraph (d)(1), unless otherwise specified. Reduced monitoring sites must be selected in accordance with the sampling tiers identified in paragraph (a) of this section. Lead and copper sampling results collected from point-of-use sites under § 141.93(c)(1) cannot be used to meet the criteria for reduced monitoring under this section. States may specify the locations of sample sites when a system is conducting reduced monitoring.

(2)
Criteria for reduced monitoring.
Systems are eligible for reduced monitoring if they meet all the requirements of this section, including collecting at least the minimum number of samples required, for at least two consecutive tap monitoring periods. The State may require an eligible system to conduct more frequent monitoring.
(i)
Annual monitoring for any system size.
Any system that does not exceed the lead and copper action levels and, for systems with State-designated OWQPs, also maintains the range of optimal water quality parameters designated by the State in accordance with § 141.82(f), for two consecutive six-month tap monitoring periods may reduce the monitoring frequency to annual monitoring. Systems with an annual tap monitoring period must sample at least the standard number of sampling sites for lead in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and at least the reduced number of sites for copper as
specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Prior to conducting annual monitoring, systems must receive a written determination from the State approving annual monitoring based on the State's review of monitoring, treatment, and other relevant information submitted by the system as required by § 141.90. For systems that reduce to annual monitoring, the first annual tap monitoring period must begin no later than six months following the last tap monitoring period.
(ii)
Triennial monitoring for small and medium water systems.
Any small or medium water system that does not exceed the lead and copper action levels and, for systems with State-designated OWQPs, also maintains the range of optimal water quality parameters designated by the State in accordance with § 141.82(f), during three consecutive years of monitoring, including monitoring conducted at both standard and annual frequencies (standard monitoring completed during both six-month periods of a calendar year is considered one year of monitoring), may reduce the monitoring frequency to triennial monitoring. Systems on triennial monitoring must sample at least the reduced number of sites for lead and copper in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Prior to conducting triennial monitoring, systems must receive a written determination from the State approving triennial monitoring based on the State's review of monitoring, treatment, and other relevant information submitted by the system as required by § 141.90. For systems that reduce to triennial monitoring, the first triennial tap monitoring period must immediately follow the last annual monitoring period, and the first triennial sampling period must begin no later than three calendar years after the last calendar year in which the system sampled.
(iii)
Triennial monitoring for any system size.
Any water system that demonstrates for two consecutive tap monitoring periods that its 90th percentile lead level, calculated under § 141.80(c)(3), is less than or equal to 0.005 mg/L, the 90th percentile copper level, calculated under § 141.80(c)(3), is less than or equal to 0.65 mg/L and, for systems with State-designated OWQPs, also maintains the range of optimal water quality parameters designated by the State in accordance with § 141.82(f), may reduce the monitoring frequency to triennial monitoring. Systems on triennial monitoring must sample at least the reduced number of sites for lead and copper in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Prior to conducting triennial monitoring, systems must receive a written determination from the State approving triennial monitoring based on the State's review of monitoring, treatment, and other relevant information submitted by the system as required by § 141.90. For systems that reduce to triennial monitoring, the first triennial tap monitoring period must immediately follow the last monitoring period, and the first triennial tap sampling period must begin no later than three calendar years after the last calendar year in which the system sampled.
(3)
Tap sampling period under reduced monitoring.
The tap sampling period for systems on reduced monitoring must occur within the months of June, July, August, or September, unless the State has approved a different tap sampling period in accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. Only systems on reduced monitoring can monitor during a tap sampling period that is shorter than the tap monitoring period.
(i) The State may approve a different tap sampling period for systems collecting samples on reduced monitoring. An alternative tap sampling period approved by the State must be a continuous period of time no longer than four consecutive months, must occur entirely within one calendar year, and must represent a time of normal operation where the highest levels of lead are most likely to occur. For a non-transient non-community water system that does not operate during the months of June through September and for which the period of normal operation where the highest levels of lead are most likely to occur is not known, the State must designate a period that represents normal operation for the system.
(ii) Systems that receive State-approval for an alternate tap sampling
period under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section and have been sampling in the months of June through September must complete their next tap sampling period no later than 21 months, if on annual monitoring, or no later than 45 months, if on triennial monitoring, following the end of the previous tap sampling period.
(iii) Systems with waivers granted pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section that have been collecting samples during the months of June through September and receive State approval to alter their sampling period as per paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section must collect their next round of samples before the end of the next nine-year period.
(e)
Inclusion of lead and copper tap samples for calculation of the 90th percentile.
Water systems and the State must consider the results of any sampling conducted in addition to the minimum number of samples required in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, as applicable, in making any determinations (
i.e.,
calculating the 90th percentile lead or copper level in accordance with § 141.80(c)(3)) under this subpart if the samples meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Consumer-requested sampling conducted in accordance with § 141.85(c) must be considered if the sample meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b). If multiple samples from the same site, taken during the same tap sampling period, meet the requirements of this section for consideration of the 90th percentile calculation, only the highest value from each site can be considered, except for systems under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(1) Water systems sampling at one or more Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 sites in a tap sampling period that are unable to collect the minimum number of samples required in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section from Tier 1 or 2 sites must consider the lead and copper values from the next highest tier available in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. If a water system has sufficient samples after including the samples from the next highest available tier to meet the minimum number of samples required in paragraph (c) or (d), the system may not consider additional samples from other available lower tiers. Systems (or the State) must calculate the 90th percentile lead and copper values in accordance with § 141.80(c)(3)(iii) using a total number of samples equal to the minimum number of samples required in paragraph (c) or (d). Systems must submit all additional sampling results to the State that were not used in the 90th percentile calculation.
(2) Systems (or the State when the State is calculating the 90th percentile) cannot include samples collected as part of Distribution System and Site Assessment under § 141.82(j)(2) in the 90th percentile calculation.
(3) Systems (or the State when the State is calculating the 90th percentile) cannot include follow-up samples collected as a result of monitoring after service line replacement under § 141.84(h) in the 90th percentile calculation.
(f)
Invalidation of lead and copper tap samples used in the calculation of the 90th percentile.
A sample invalidated under this paragraph (f) does not count towards determining lead or copper 90th percentile levels under § 141.80(c)(3) or towards meeting the minimum monitoring requirements of paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. The system must report the results of all samples to the State and all supporting documentation for samples the system believes should be invalidated.
(1) The State may invalidate a lead or copper tap water sample if at least one of the following conditions is met:
(i) The laboratory establishes that improper sample analysis caused erroneous results.
(ii) The State determines that a sample collected for compliance purposes under this section, that is not an additional sample collected under paragraph (e) of this section, was taken from a site that did not meet the site selection criteria under paragraph (a) of this section, such as when sites of a higher tier were still available.
(iii) The State determines the sample was collected in a manner that did not meet the sample collection protocol under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(iv) The sample container was damaged in transit.
(v) There is a substantial reason to believe that the sample was subject to tampering.
(2) To invalidate a sample under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the State must document in writing both the decision and the rationale for the decision. States may not invalidate a sample solely on the grounds that a follow-up sample result is higher or lower than that of the original sample.
(3) The water system must collect replacement samples for any samples invalidated under this section if, after the invalidation of one or more samples, the system has too few samples to meet the minimum requirements of paragraph (c)(1) or (d)(1) of this section. Any such replacement samples must be taken as soon as possible, but no later than 20 days after the date the State notifies the system of an invalidated sample or by the end of the tap sampling period, whichever occurs later. Replacement samples taken after the end of the applicable tap sampling period can only be used to meet the monitoring requirements of the applicable tap monitoring period in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section and not a subsequent tap monitoring period. The replacement samples must be taken at the same locations as the invalidated samples, except when the sample is invalidated due to an error in meeting the site selection criteria under paragraph (a) of this section, or a system cannot gain access for sampling. The replacement samples must then be taken at locations that meet the site selection criteria other than those locations already used for sampling during the tap monitoring period.
(g)
Monitoring waivers for systems serving 3,300 or fewer persons.
Any water system serving 3,300 or fewer persons that meets the criteria of this paragraph (g) may apply, in writing, to the State to reduce the frequency of monitoring for lead and/or copper to once every nine years. The system must meet the materials criteria specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section and the monitoring criteria specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. Systems meeting only the criteria for lead may apply for a lead waiver, systems meeting only the criteria for copper may apply for a copper waiver, and systems meeting the criteria for both lead and copper may apply for a full waiver.
(1)
Materials criteria.
The system must demonstrate that its distribution system and service lines and all drinking water supply plumbing, including plumbing conveying drinking water within all residences and buildings connected to the system, are free of lead-containing materials and/or copper-containing materials, as those terms are defined in this paragraph (g)(1), as follows:
(i)
Lead.
To qualify for a lead waiver, the water system must certify and provide supporting documentation to the State that the system, including the distribution system and all premise plumbing, is free of all lead-containing materials, as follows:
(A) It contains no plastic pipes which contain lead plasticizers, or plastic service lines which contain lead plasticizers; and
(B) It is free of lead service lines, galvanized requiring replacement service lines, lead connectors, lead pipes, lead soldered pipe joints, and leaded brass or bronze alloy fittings and fixtures, unless such fittings and fixtures meet the specifications of any standard established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 300g-6(e) (SDWA section 1417(e)).
(ii)
Copper.
To qualify for a copper waiver, the water system must certify and provide supporting documentation to the State that the system contains no copper service lines or premise plumbing.
(2)
Monitoring criteria.
The system must have completed at least one six-month round of standard tap water monitoring for lead and copper at sites approved by the State and from the number of sites required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section and demonstrate that the 90th percentile levels for any and all rounds of monitoring conducted since the system became free of all lead-containing and/or copper-containing materials, as appropriate, meet the following criteria.
(i)
Lead levels.
To qualify for a lead waiver, the system must demonstrate that the 90th percentile lead level does not exceed 0.005 mg/L.
(ii)
Copper levels.
To qualify for a copper waiver, the system must demonstrate that the 90th percentile copper level does not exceed 0.65 mg/L.
(3)
State approval of waiver application.
The State must notify the system of its waiver determination, in writing, setting forth the basis of its decision and any condition(s) of an approved waiver. As a condition of a waiver, the State may require the system to perform specific activities (
e.g.,
limited monitoring, periodic outreach to customers to remind them to avoid installing materials that might void the waiver) to avoid lead or copper concentrations of concern in tap water. The water system must continue monitoring for lead and copper at the tap as required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as appropriate, until it receives written notification from the State that a waiver has been approved.
(4)
Monitoring frequency for systems with waivers.
(i) A system with a full waiver must conduct tap monitoring for lead and copper in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section at least once every nine years. A system with a full waiver must provide the State with the materials certification specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section for both lead and copper when submitting their tap sampling results to the State. Samples collected every nine years must be collected no later than every ninth calendar year.
(ii) A system with a lead waiver or copper waiver must conduct tap monitoring for only the waived contaminant in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section at least once every nine years. A system with a lead waiver or copper waiver must provide the State with the materials certification specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section for only the waived contaminant when submitting their tap sampling results to the State. Also, a system must continue to monitor for the non-waived contaminant in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as appropriate.
(iii) Any water system with a waiver must notify the State in writing in accordance with § 141.90(a)(4) about any addition of a new source water or long-term change in treatment, as described in that section. The State may add or modify waiver conditions (
e.g.,
require recertification that the system is free of lead-containing and/or copper-containing materials, require additional round(s) of monitoring), if the State deems any modifications are necessary to address treatment or source water changes at the system.
(iv) If a system with a waiver becomes aware that the system is no longer free of lead-containing or copper-containing materials, as appropriate (
e.g.,
as a result of new construction or repairs), the system must notify the State in writing no later than 60 days after becoming aware of such a change.
(5)
Discontinuation of eligibility.
A system with a waiver where any of the following conditions occurs is not allowed to continue monitoring under its waiver:
(i) A system with a full waiver or a lead waiver no longer satisfies the materials criteria of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section or has a 90th percentile lead level greater than 0.005 mg/L.
(ii) A system with a full waiver or a copper waiver no longer satisfies the materials criteria of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section or has a 90th percentile copper level greater than 0.65 mg/L.
(iii) The State notifies the system, in writing, that the waiver has been revoked, setting forth the basis of its decision.
(6)
Requirements following waiver revocation.
A system whose waiver is revoked may re-apply for a waiver when it meets the appropriate materials criteria and monitoring criteria of paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section. A system whose waiver is revoked by the State is subject to the following corrosion control treatment and lead and copper tap water monitoring requirements:
(i) If the system exceeds the lead and/or copper action level, the system must implement or re-optimize OCCT in accordance with the deadlines specified in § 141.81, and any other applicable requirements of this subpart.
(ii) If the system is at or below both the lead and copper action levels, the system must monitor for lead and copper at the tap no less frequently than
once every three years using the reduced number of sampling sites specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(7)
Pre-existing waivers.
Waivers approved by the State in writing prior to the compliance date specified in § 141.80(a)(3) are still in effect if the system has demonstrated that it is both free of lead-containing and copper-containing materials, as required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section and that its 90th percentile lead levels and 90th percentile copper levels meet the criteria of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, and the system does not meet the waiver ineligibility criteria of paragraph (g)(5) of this section.
(h)
Publicly accessible tap monitoring results used in the 90th percentile calculation.
Unless done by the State, all water systems must make the tap monitoring results, including data used in the 90th percentile calculation under § 141.80(c)(3), publicly accessible within 60 days of the end of the tap sampling period. Under this paragraph (h), water systems are not required to make the addresses of tap sampling sites publicly accessible.
(1) Large water systems must make the tap monitoring results and associated data publicly accessible in a digital format.
(2) Small and medium water systems must make the tap monitoring results and associated data publicly accessible in either a print or digital format.
(3) Water systems must certify to the State, in writing, compliance with this paragraph (h) in accordance with § 141.90(a)(2)(iii) and must retain monitoring data in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements under § 141.91.

(i) Distribution system samples collected at water taps must be representative of water quality throughout the distribution system, considering the number of persons served, the different sources of water, the different treatment methods employed by the system, and seasonal variability. Sites selected for sampling in the distribution system under this section can be the same as or different from tap sampling sites targeted for lead and copper sampling under § 141.86(a). Systems may consider selecting sites also used for total coliform sampling under § 141.21(a)(1). Sites selected for sampling in the distribution system under this section must be included in the site sample plan specified under § 141.90(a)(1). The site sample plan must be updated prior to changes to the sampling locations.
(ii) Samples collected in the distribution system must be analyzed for the following parameters, when applicable, as specified:
(A) pH;
(B) Alkalinity;
(C) Orthophosphate (as PO
4
), when an inhibitor containing an orthophosphate compound is used;
(D) Silica, when an inhibitor containing a silicate compound is used; and
(E) Any parameters specified by the State under § 141.82(a)(1) or (f)(6).
(2)
Entry point samples for water quality parameters.
(i) Samples collected at the entry point(s) to the distribution system must be from locations representative of each source water after treatment. If a system draws water from more than one source water and the source waters are combined before distribution, the system must sample at an entry point to the distribution system during periods of normal operating conditions when water is representative of all sources typically being used.
(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section for ground water systems, the following parameters must be measured at each entry
point to the distribution system, when applicable, as specified:
(A) pH;
(B) When alkalinity is adjusted as part of corrosion control, a reading of the dosage rate of the chemical used to adjust alkalinity, and the alkalinity concentration;
(C) When a corrosion inhibitor is used as part of corrosion control, a reading of the dosage rate of the inhibitor used, and the concentration of orthophosphate (as PO
4
) or silica (whichever is applicable); and
(D) Any parameters specified by the State under § 141.82(a)(1) or (f)(6).

(ii)
Samples at entry points.
(A) Systems without installed or re-optimized OCCT and without State-designated optimal water quality parameters required to collect entry point samples must collect a minimum of two entry point samples for each applicable water quality parameter at each entry point to the distribution system at least once during each monitoring period specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(B) Systems with installed OCCT or re-optimized OCCT and/or State-designated optimal water quality parameters required to collect entry point samples, including as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, must collect one entry point sample for each applicable water quality parameter at each entry point to the distribution system at least once every two weeks during each monitoring period the system is required to conduct sampling as specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) and (c) of this section.
(2)
Initial sampling for water systems.
A large water system without corrosion control treatment must begin monitoring for water quality parameters as specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section during the first two six-month monitoring periods beginning no later than January 1 of the calendar year after the system either becomes a large water system or exceeds the practical quantitation limit for lead. Any medium water system without corrosion control treatment that exceeds the lead action level or the copper action level must begin monitoring for applicable distribution system and entry point water quality parameters as specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) for two consecutive six-month monitoring periods beginning the month immediately following the end of the tap monitoring period in which the action level exceedance occurred. Any small water system that exceeds the lead or copper action level must begin monitoring for applicable distribution system and entry point water quality parameters as specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) for two consecutive six-month monitoring periods beginning the month immediately following the end of the tap monitoring period in which the action level exceedance occurred. Systems must continue monitoring as described by paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section.
(i) At sites in the distribution system, collect two samples for:
(A) pH; and
(B) Alkalinity.
(ii) At each entry point to the distribution system, collect all the applicable parameters listed in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
(3)
Monitoring after installation of OCCT or re-optimized OCCT.
(i) A system that modifies or installs OCCT pursuant to § 141.81(d)(5) or (e)(5) and is required to conduct follow-up monitoring for lead or copper pursuant to § 141.81(d)(6) or (e)(6) must monitor for applicable distribution system and entry point water quality parameters as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section every six months until the State designates new water quality parameter values for OCCT pursuant to § 141.82(f). Water systems must collect these samples at a regular frequency throughout the six-month monitoring period to reflect seasonal variability.
(ii) Any ground water system can limit entry point sampling described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to those entry points that are representative of water quality and treatment conditions throughout the system. If water from untreated ground water sources mixes with water from treated ground water sources, the system must monitor for water quality parameters both at representative entry points receiving treatment and representative entry points receiving no treatment. Prior to the start of any monitoring under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), the water system must provide to the State, written information and documentation identifying the selected entry points, including information on seasonal variability, sufficient to demonstrate that the sites are representative of water quality and treatment conditions throughout the system.
(iii) States may require small water systems with corrosion control treatment for which the State has not designated optimal water quality parameters that do not exceed the lead action level or copper action level to conduct water quality parameter monitoring as described in this paragraph (b) or the State can develop its own water quality parameter monitoring structure for these systems.
(4)
Monitoring by systems with State-designated optimal water quality parameter values for OCCT.
Monitoring must occur at a regular frequency throughout the monitoring period to reflect seasonal variability and be consistent with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(i) Medium water systems with corrosion control treatment and all large water systems must sample for the applicable water quality parameters designated by the State and determine compliance with the requirements of § 141.82(g) every six months with the first six-month monitoring period to begin on either January 1 or July 1, whichever comes first, after the State specifies the optimal values under § 141.82(f).
(ii) A small water system with corrosion control treatment that exceeds the lead action level or copper action level must begin monitoring during the standard six-month tap monitoring period immediately following the tap monitoring period in which the action level exceedance(s) occurs and continue monitoring until the water system no longer exceeds the lead action level and/or copper action level and meets the State-designated optimal water quality parameters in two consecutive six-month tap monitoring periods under § 141.86(c). For any small water system that is subject to a reduced monitoring frequency pursuant to § 141.86(d) at the time of the action level exceedance, the start of the six-month monitoring period under this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) must coincide with the start of the tap monitoring period under § 141.86(c).
(iii) Compliance with State-designated optimal water quality parameter values must be determined as specified under § 141.82(g).
(iv) States have the discretion to require systems described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section to continue to monitor optimal water quality parameters.
(c)
Reduced monitoring.
(1) A medium or large water system that maintains the range of values for the water quality parameters reflecting OCCT specified by the State under § 141.82(f) and does not exceed the lead action level or copper action level in either of the two
consecutive six-month monitoring periods under paragraph (b)(4) of this section must collect two distribution system samples for applicable water quality parameters specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section from each of the minimum number of sites listed in table 2 to this paragraph (c)(1) during each six-month monitoring period. These water systems must collect these samples at a regular frequency throughout the six-month monitoring period to reflect seasonal variability. A system meeting the requirements of this paragraph (c)(1) must continue to monitor at the entry point(s) to the distribution system as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Systems with sites added as a result of the Distribution System and Site Assessment requirements in § 141.82(j) must continue to sample at the added sites up to a maximum of not more than twice the minimum number of sites specified in table 1 to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

(2)(i) A water system that maintains the range of values for the water quality parameters reflecting OCCT specified by the State under § 141.82(f) and does not exceed the lead action level or copper action level during three consecutive years of monitoring may reduce the frequency with which it collects distribution system samples for applicable water quality parameters specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section from each of the minimum number of sites listed in table 2 to paragraph (c)(1) of this section from every six months to annually. This sampling must begin during the calendar year immediately following the end of the monitoring period in which the third consecutive year of six-month monitoring occurs.
(ii) A water system may reduce the frequency with which it collects distribution system samples for applicable water quality parameters specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to every year if it demonstrates during two consecutive monitoring periods that its tap water lead level at the 90th percentile is less than or equal to the practical quantitation limit for lead of 0.005 mg/L, that its tap water copper level at the 90th percentile is less than or equal to 0.65 mg/L as calculated in accordance with § 141.80(c)(3), and that it also has maintained the range of values for the water quality parameters reflecting OCCT specified by the State under § 141.82(f).
(3) A water system that conducts sampling at taps for water quality parameters annually must collect these samples at a regular frequency throughout the year to reflect seasonal variability.
(4) A water system monitoring at a reduced frequency that fails to operate at or within the range of values for the optimal water quality parameters designated by the State in § 141.82(f) for more than nine cumulative days, as specified in § 141.82(g), in any six-month period under paragraph (b)(4) of this section must resume distribution system sampling in accordance with the number and frequency requirements in paragraph (b)(4). Such a system may resume annual monitoring for water quality parameters in the distribution system at the reduced number of sites specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section after it has completed two subsequent consecutive six-month rounds of monitoring that meet the criteria of paragraph (c)(1) of this section and/or may resume annual monitoring for water quality parameters in the distribution system at the reduced number of sites after it demonstrates through subsequent rounds of monitoring that it meets the criteria of either paragraph (c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(5) Any water system monitoring at a reduced frequency that exceeds the lead action level or copper action level must resume standard water quality parameter monitoring beginning with the six-month period immediately following the tap monitoring period in
which the action level exceedance(s) occurs. When the water system no longer exceeds the lead action level and/or copper action level and meets the State-designated optimal water quality parameters in two consecutive six-month tap monitoring periods, the system may then reduce monitoring in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(d)
Additional monitoring by systems.
The results of any monitoring conducted in addition to the minimum requirements of this section must be considered by the water system and the State in determining concentrations of water quality parameters under this section or § 141.82.
[89 FR 86652, Oct. 30, 2024]
§ 141.88
Monitoring requirements for lead and copper in source water.
(a)
Sample location, collection methods, and number of samples.
(1) A water system that fails to meet the lead or copper action level on the basis of tap samples collected in accordance with § 141.86 shall collect lead and copper source water samples in accordance with the following requirements regarding sample location, number of samples, and collection methods:
(i) Groundwater systems shall take a minimum of one sample at every entry point to the distribution system after any application of treatment or in the distribution system at a point which is representative of each source after treatment (hereafter called a sampling point). The system shall take one sample at the same sampling point unless conditions make another sampling point more representative of each source or treatment plant.
(ii) Surface water systems shall take a minimum of one sample at every entry point to the distribution system after any application of treatment or in the distribution system at a point which is representative of each source after treatment (hereafter called a sampling point). The system shall take each sample at the same sampling point unless conditions make another sampling point more representative of each source or treatment plant.

# Note to paragraph (
a

# )(1)(
ii

# ):
For the purposes of this paragraph, surface water systems include systems with a combination of surface and ground sources.
(iii) If a system draws water from more than one source and the sources are combined before distribution, the system must sample at an entry point to the distribution system during periods of normal operating conditions (
i.e.,
when water is representative of all sources being used).
(iv) The State may reduce the total number of samples which must be analyzed by allowing the use of compositing. Compositing of samples must be done by certified laboratory personnel. Composite samples from a maximum of five samples are allowed, provided that if the lead concentration in the composite sample is greater than or equal to 0.001 mg/L or the copper concentration is greater than or equal to 0.160 mg/L, then either:
(A) A follow-up sample shall be taken and analyzed within 14 days at each sampling point included in the composite; or
(B) If duplicates of or sufficient quantities from the original samples from each sampling point used in the composite are available, the system may use these instead of resampling.
(2) Where the results of sampling indicate an exceedance of maximum permissible source water levels established under § 141.83(b)(4), the State may require that one additional sample be collected as soon as possible after the initial sample was taken (but not to exceed two weeks) at the same sampling point. If a State-required confirmation sample is taken for lead or copper, then the results of the initial and confirmation sample shall be averaged in determining compliance with the State-specified maximum permissible levels. Any sample value below the detection limit shall be considered to be zero. Any value above the detection limit but below the PQL shall either be considered as the measured value or be considered one-half the PQL.
(b)
Monitoring frequency after system exceeds tap water action level.
Any system which exceeds the lead or copper action level at the tap for the first time or for the first time after an addition of a new source or installation of source water treatment required under
§ 141.83(b)(2) shall collect one source water sample from each entry point to the distribution system no later than six months after the end of the tap sampling period during which the lead or copper action level was exceeded. For tap sampling periods that are annual or less frequent, the end of the tap sampling period is September 30 of the calendar year in which the sampling occurs, or if the State has established an alternate monitoring period, the last day of that period. If the State determines that source water treatment is not required under § 141.83(b)(2), the state may waive source water monitoring, for any subsequent lead or copper action level exceedance at the tap, in accordance with the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(1) The State may waive source water monitoring for lead or copper action level exceedance at the tap under the following conditions:
(i) The water system has already conducted source water monitoring following a previous action level exceedance;
(ii) The State has determined that source water treatment is not required; and
(iii) The system has not added any new water sources.
(2) [Reserved]
(c)
Monitoring frequency after installation of source water treatment and addition of new source.
(1) Any system which installs source water treatment pursuant to § 141.83(a)(3) shall collect one source water sample from each entry point to the distribution system during two consecutive six-month monitoring periods by the deadline specified in § 141.83(a)(4).
(2) Any system which adds a new source shall collect one source water sample from each entry point to the distribution system until the system demonstrates that finished drinking water entering the distribution system has been maintained below the maximum permissible lead and copper concentrations specified by the State in § 141.83(b)(4) or the State determines that source water treatment is not needed.
(d)
Monitoring frequency after State specifies maximum permissible source water levels.
(1) A system shall monitor at the frequency specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, in cases where the State specifies maximum permissible source water levels under § 141.83(b)(4).
(i) A water system using only groundwater shall collect samples once during the three-year compliance period (as that term is defined in § 141.2) in effect when the applicable State determination under paragraph (d)(1) of this section is made. Such systems shall collect samples once during each subsequent compliance period. Triennial samples shall be collected every third calendar year.
(ii) A water system using surface water (or a combination of surface and ground water) shall collect samples once during each calendar year, the first annual monitoring period to begin during the year in which the applicable State determination is made under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(2) A system is not required to conduct source water sampling for lead and/or copper if the system meets the action level for the specific contaminant in tap water samples during the entire source water sampling period applicable to the system under paragraph (d)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section.
(e)
Reduced monitoring frequency.
(1) A water system using only groundwater may reduce the monitoring frequency for lead and copper in source water to once during each nine-year compliance cycle (as that term is defined in § 141.2) provided that the samples are collected no later than every ninth calendar year and if the system meets the following criteria:
(i) The system demonstrates that finished drinking water entering the distribution system has been maintained below the maximum permissible lead and copper concentrations specified by the State in § 141.83(b)(4) during at least three consecutive monitoring periods under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(ii) [Reserved]
(2) A water system using surface water (or a combination of surface water and groundwater) may reduce the monitoring frequency in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to once during each nine-year compliance cycle (as that term is defined in § 141.2) provided
that the samples are collected no later than every ninth calendar year and if the system meets the following criteria:
(i) The system demonstrates that finished drinking water entering the distribution system has been maintained below the maximum permissible lead and copper concentrations specified by the State in § 141.83(b)(4) for at least three consecutive years'
(ii) [Reserved]
(3) A water system that uses a new source of water is not eligible for reduced monitoring for lead and/or copper until concentrations in samples collected from the new source during three consecutive monitoring periods are below the maximum permissible lead and copper concentrations specified by the State in § 141.83(a)(5).

§ 141.90
Reporting requirements.
All water systems shall report all of the following information to the State in accordance with this section.
(a)
Reporting requirements for tap monitoring for lead and copper and for distribution system and entry point monitoring for water quality parameters.
(1) By the start of a system's first lead and copper tap monitoring period in § 141.86(c) and (d), water systems must submit the following to the State:
(i) A site sample plan, including a list of tap sample site locations for lead and copper sampling identified from the inventory in § 141.84(a), and a list of tap sampling sites and entry point to the distribution system sites for water quality parameter monitoring selected under § 141.87(a)(1) and (2). Changes to the site sample plan require systems to
submit an updated site sample plan to the State before the start of the next tap sampling period conducted by the system. The State may require modifications to the site sample plan as necessary.
(A) Water systems with lead, galvanized requiring replacement, and/or lead status unknown service lines in the service line inventory conducted under § 141.84(a) and (b) must evaluate the tap sampling locations for lead and copper used in their sampling pool prior to the start of each tap sampling period, beginning with the compliance date specified in § 141.80(a)(3). Evaluations that result in changes to the site sample plan require systems to submit an updated site sample plan to the State prior to each tap sampling period conducted by the system.
(B) A water system that cannot identify enough sampling sites with premise plumbing made of lead and/or served by lead service lines to meet the minimum number of sample sites required in § 141.86(c)(1) or (d)(1), as required under § 141.86(a)(3), must submit documentation, including documentation of applicable customer refusals for sampling, in support of the conclusion that there are an insufficient number of available sites with premise plumbing made of lead and/or served by lead service lines, prior to the next tap sampling period.
(ii) A copy of the sample collection instructions that are provided to individuals who are sampling, which meets the requirements of § 141.86(b). If the water system seeks to modify its sample collection instructions specified in this paragraph (a)(1)(ii), it must submit the updated version of the instructions to the State for review prior to the next tap sampling period.
(2) Notwithstanding the requirements of § 141.31(a), a water system must report the information specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section, for all lead and copper tap samples specified in § 141.86 and for all water quality parameter distribution system and entry point samples specified in § 141.87, within the first 10 days following the end of each applicable sampling period specified in §§ 141.86 and 141.87, unless the State has specified an earlier reporting requirement. For tap sampling periods with a duration less than six months, the end of the sampling period is the last date samples can be collected as specified in § 141.86.
(i) The results of all tap samples for lead and copper collected during the tap sampling period, including results for both first- and fifth-liter samples collected at lead service line sites, the location of each site, and the site selection criteria under § 141.86(a)(3) and (4) used as the basis for which the site was selected for the water system's sampling pool;
(ii) Documentation for each tap water lead or copper sample for which the water system requests invalidation pursuant to § 141.86(f);
(iii) With the exception of initial tap sampling conducted pursuant to § 141.86(c)(2)(i), a certification that the results of monitoring from the tap monitoring period before the applicable tap monitoring period described in this paragraph (a)(2) were made publicly accessible, as specified in § 141.86(h);
(iv) The 90th percentile lead and copper concentrations calculated from lead and copper tap water samples collected during each tap sampling period in accordance with § 141.80(c)(3), unless the State calculates the water system's 90th percentile lead and copper levels under paragraph (h) of this section;
(v) With the exception of initial tap sampling conducted pursuant to § 141.86(c)(2)(i), the water system must identify any site which was not sampled during the tap monitoring period previous to the applicable tap monitoring period described in this paragraph (a)(2), and include an explanation of why sampling sites have changed;
(vi) The results of all tap samples for water quality parameters that are required to be collected under § 141.87(b) through (d);
(vii) The results of all samples collected at the entry point(s) to the distribution system for applicable water quality parameters under § 141.87(b) through (d); and
(viii) The number of sites from which the system requested customer participation for sampling during the tap sampling period and the customer was either non-responsive after two attempts or refused to participate.
(3) For a non-transient non-community water system, or a community water system meeting the criteria of § 141.85(b)(8), that does not have enough taps that can provide first liter or first-and fifth-liter paired samples meeting the six-hour minimum stagnation time, the water system must either:
(i) Provide written documentation identifying standing times and locations for samples that do not meet the six-hour minimum stagnation time to make up a system's sampling pool in order to meet the minimum number of sites to sample as required in § 141.86(b)(3) by the start of the system's first applicable tap monitoring period under § 141.86(c), or if there are changes to the documentation, prior to the next tap sampling period, unless the State has waived prior approval of sample sites not meeting the six-hour stagnation time selected by the water system pursuant to § 141.86(b)(3); or
(ii) If the State has waived prior approval of sample sites not meeting the six-hour stagnation time selected by the system, identify, in writing, each site that did not meet the six-hour minimum stagnation time and the length of standing time for that particular substitute sample collected pursuant to § 141.86(b)(3) and include this information with the lead and copper tap sample results required to be submitted pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
(4) At a time specified by the State, or if no specific time is designated, as early as possible but no later than six months prior to the addition of a new source or any long-term change in water treatment, a water system must submit written documentation describing the addition of a new source or long-term change in treatment to the State. Systems may not implement the addition of a new source or long-term treatment change without State approval. The State must review and approve the addition of a new source or a long-term change in water treatment before it can be implemented by the water system. The State may require any such water system to take actions before or after the addition of a new source or long-term treatment change to ensure that the water system will operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment, such as additional water quality parameter monitoring, additional lead or copper tap sampling, and re-evaluating corrosion control treatment. Examples of long-term treatment changes include but are not limited to the addition of a new treatment process or modification of an existing treatment process. Examples of modifications include switching secondary disinfectants, switching coagulants (
e.g.,
alum to ferric chloride), and switching corrosion inhibitor products (
e.g.,
orthophosphate to blended phosphate). Long-term treatment changes can also include dose changes to existing chemicals if the system is planning long-term changes to its finished water pH or residual inhibitor concentration. Long-term treatment changes would not include chemical dose fluctuations associated with daily raw water quality changes where a new source has not been added.
(5) Any system serving 3,300 or fewer persons applying for a monitoring waiver under § 141.86(g), or subject to a waiver granted pursuant to § 141.86(g)(3), must provide the following information to the State in writing by the specified deadline:

[89 FR 86659, Oct. 30, 2024]
§ 141.93
Small water system compliance flexibility.
Small community water systems serving 3,300 or fewer persons and all non-transient non-community water systems that exceed the lead action level, but do not exceed the copper action level, may elect to use this provision in lieu of the corrosion control treatment requirements otherwise applicable to small systems and non-transient non-community water systems in § 141.81(a)(3), if approved by the State. This compliance flexibility is not available to water systems where the State has obtained primacy for this subpart and the State does not adopt regulations to provide compliance flexibility consistent with this section.
(a) Small community water systems and non-transient non-community water systems that elect to use this section must:
(1) For water systems with corrosion control, collect water quality parameters in accordance with § 141.87 and, if the system has not re-optimized OCCT in accordance with § 141.81(d), evaluate compliance options in paragraphs (c)(1)
and (2) of this section and corrosion control treatment under § 141.81(d)(1). Water systems with corrosion control treatment in place must continue to operate and maintain optimal corrosion control treatment until the State determines, in writing, that it is no longer necessary, and meet any requirements that the State determines to be appropriate before implementing a State approved alternative compliance option described in this section.
(2) For systems without corrosion control, collect water quality parameters in accordance with § 141.87 and, if the system has not installed OCCT in accordance with § 141.81(e), evaluate compliance options in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section and corrosion control treatment under § 141.81(e)(1).
(b) The system must make a compliance option recommendation to the State within six months of the end of the tap sampling period in which the lead action level exceedance occurred. Within six months of the recommendation by the water system, the State must approve or disapprove the recommendation. If the State disapproves the recommendation, the State may designate the other compliance alternative as an option for the system. If the State does not designate the other compliance alternative as an option for the system, the system must comply with the otherwise applicable corrosion control treatment requirements under § 141.81(d) for systems with corrosion control or § 141.81(e) for systems without corrosion control treatment. Water systems must follow the schedules in § 141.81(d) or (e), beginning with step 3 in § 141.81(d)(3) or (e)(3) unless the State specifies optimal corrosion control treatment pursuant to either § 141.81(d)(2) or (e)(2), as applicable. If the system fails to implement the approved alternative compliance option, or the State revokes approval for the alternative compliance option, then the system must follow the requirements for small and non-transient non-community water systems as described under § 141.81(a)(3).
(c)(1)
Alternative compliance option: point-of-use devices.
A water system that elects the compliance option in this paragraph (c)(1), must install, maintain, and monitor POU devices in each household and each building served by the water system.
(i)(A) A community water system must install a minimum of one POU device (at one tap) in every household and at every tap that is used for cooking and/or drinking in every non-residential building in its distribution system on a schedule specified by the State, but not to exceed one year after State approval.
(B) A non-transient non-community water system must provide a POU device to every tap that is used for cooking and/or drinking on a schedule specified by the State, but not to exceed three months.
(ii) The POU device must be independently certified by a third party to meet the American National Standards Institute standard applicable to the specific type of POU unit to reduce lead in drinking water.
(iii) The POU device must be maintained by the water system in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations or on a more frequent schedule if required by the State to ensure continued effective filtration, including but not limited to changing filter cartridges and resolving any operational issues. The POU device must be equipped with mechanical warnings to ensure that consumers are automatically notified of operational problems. The water system must provide documentation to the State to certify maintenance of the POU devices, unless the State waives this requirement, in accordance with § 141.90(j)(1).
(iv) The water system must monitor, in accordance with this paragraph (c)(1)(iv), one-third of the POU devices each year and all POU devices must be monitored within a three-year cycle. First liter tap samples collected under this section must be taken after water passes through the POU device to assess its performance. Samples must be one liter in volume and have had a minimum 6-hour stagnation time. All samples must be at or below 0.010 mg/L. Water systems must report the results from the tap sampling no later than 10 days after the end of the tap sampling period in accordance with § 141.90(j)(1). If a sample exceeds 0.010 mg/L, the water system must notify the persons served by the POU device,
and/or building management no later than one business day of receiving the tap sample results. The system must document and take corrective action at each site where the sample result exceeds the lead action level. Corrective action must be completed within 30 days. If the corrective action is not completed within 30 days, the system must provide documentation to the State within 30 days explaining why it was unable to correct the issue.
(v) The water system must provide public education to consumers to inform them of proper use of POU devices.
(A)
Content.
All small community water systems serving 3,300 or fewer persons and non-transient non-community water systems that are approved to implement POU devices under this paragraph (c)(1) must provide public education materials to inform users how to properly use POU devices to maximize the units' effectiveness in reducing lead levels in drinking water. Public education materials must meet the requirements of § 141.85(a)(1)(ii) through (iv).
(B)
Timing.
Water systems must provide the public education materials at the time of POU device delivery.
(C)
Delivery.
Water systems must provide the public education materials in person, by mail, or by another method approved by the State, to persons at locations where the system has delivered POU devices.
(vi) The water system must operate and maintain the POU devices even if the system is at or below the action level in future tap monitoring periods until the system receives State approval to select the other compliance flexibility option or follow § 141.81(d) or (e) and the system has fully implemented it.
(2)
Alternative compliance option: replacement of lead-bearing plumbing.
A water system that has control over all plumbing in its buildings, and is not served by lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or unknown service lines, must replace all plumbing that does not meet the definition of “lead free” in section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended by the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act and any future amendments applicable at the time of replacement. The replacement of all lead-bearing plumbing must occur on a schedule established by the State but not to exceed one year. Water systems must provide certification to the State that all lead-bearing material has been replaced in accordance with § 141.90(j)(2).

§ 141.100
Criteria and procedures for public water systems using point-of-entry devices.
(a) Public water systems may use point-of-entry devices to comply with maximum contaminant levels only if they meet the requirements of this section.
(b) It is the responsibility of the public water system to operate and maintain the point-of-entry treatment system.
(c) The public water system must develop and obtain State approval for a monitoring plan before point-of-entry devices are installed for compliance. Under the plan approved by the State, point-of-entry devices must provide health protection equivalent to central water treatment. “Equivalent” means that the water would meet all national primary drinking water regulations and would be of acceptable quality similar to water distributed by a well-operated central treatment plant. In addition to the VOCs, monitoring must include physical measurements and observations such as total flow treated and mechanical condition of the treatment equipment.
(d) Effective technology must be properly applied under a plan approved by the State and the microbiological safety of the water must be maintained.
(1) The State must require adequate certification of performance, field testing, and, if not included in the certification process, a rigorous engineering design review of the point-of-entry devices.
(2) The design and application of the point-of-entry devices must consider the tendency for increase in heterotrophic bacteria concentrations in water treated with activated carbon. It may be necessary to use frequent backwashing, post-contactor disinfection, and Heterotrophic Plate Count monitoring to ensure that the microbiological safety of the water is not compromised.
(e)
All consumers shall be protected.
Every building connected to the system must have a point-of-entry device installed, maintained, and adequately monitored. The State must be assured that every building is subject to treatment and monitoring, and that the rights and responsibilities of the public water system customer convey with title upon sale of property.

The calibration curve must encompass the regulatory minimum reporting level (MRL) concentration. Data may be reported for concentrations lower than the regulatory MRL as long as the precision and accuracy criteria are met by analyzing an MRL check standard at the lowest reporting limit chosen by the laboratory. The laboratory must verify the accuracy of the calibration curve at the MRL concentration by analyzing an MRL check standard with a concentration less than or equal to 110% of the MRL with each batch of samples. The measured concentration for the MRL check standard must be ±50% of the expected value, if any field sample in the batch has a concentration less than 5 times the regulatory MRL. Method requirements to analyze higher concentration check standards and meet tighter acceptance criteria for them must be met in addition to the MRL check standard requirement.

SUVA is equal to the UV absorption at 254nm (UV
254
) (measured in m-
1
divided by the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (measured as mg/L). In order to determine SUVA, it is necessary to separately measure UV
254
and DOC. When determining SUVA, systems must use the methods stipulated in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section to measure DOC and the method stipulated in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section to measure UV
254
. SUVA must be determined on water prior to the addition of disinfectants/oxidants by the system. DOC and UV
254
samples used to determine a SUVA value must be taken at the same time and at the same location.
(i)
Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC).

One sample per treatment plant per three year monitoring cycle at distribution system location reflecting maximum residence time during month of warmest water temperature, with the three-year cycle beginning on January 1 following quarter in which system qualifies for reduced monitoring.
(iii)
Monitoring requirements for source water TOC.
In order to qualify for reduced monitoring for TTHM and HAA5 under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, subpart H systems not monitoring under the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section must take monthly TOC samples every 30 days at a location prior to any treatment, beginning April 1, 2008 or earlier, if specified by the State. In addition to meeting other criteria for reduced monitoring in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the source water TOC running annual average must be ≤4.0 mg/L (based on the most recent four quarters of monitoring) on a continuing basis at each treatment plant to reduce or remain on reduced monitoring for TTHM and HAA5. Once qualified for reduced monitoring for TTHM and HAA5 under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, a system may reduce source water TOC monitoring to quarterly TOC samples taken every 90 days at a location prior to any treatment.
(iv) Systems on a reduced monitoring schedule may remain on that reduced schedule as long as the average of all samples taken in the year (for systems which must monitor quarterly) or the result of the sample (for systems which must monitor no more frequently than annually) is no more than 0.060 mg/L and 0.045 mg/L for TTHMs and HAA5, respectively. Systems that do not meet these levels must resume monitoring at the frequency identified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (minimum monitoring frequency column) in the quarter immediately following the monitoring period in which the system exceeds 0.060 mg/L or 0.045 mg/L for TTHMs and HAA5, respectively. For systems using only ground water not under the direct influence of surface water and serving fewer than 10,000 persons, if either the TTHM annual average is
0.080 mg/L or the HAA5 annual average is
0.060 mg/L, the system must go to the increased monitoring identified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (sample location column) in the quarter immediately following the monitoring period in which the system exceeds 0.080 mg/L or 0.060 mg/L for TTHMs or HAA5 respectively.
(v) Systems on increased monitoring may return to routine monitoring if, after at least one year of monitoring their TTHM annual average is ≤0.060 mg/L and their HAA5 annual average is ≤0.045 mg/L.
(vi) The State may return a system to routine monitoring at the State's discretion.
(2)
Chlorite.
Community and nontransient noncommunity water systems using chlorine dioxide, for disinfection or oxidation, must conduct monitoring for chlorite.
(i)
Routine monitoring
—(A)
Daily monitoring.
Systems must take daily samples at the entrance to the distribution system. For any daily sample that exceeds the chlorite MCL, the system must take additional samples in the distribution system the following day at the locations required by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, in addition to the sample required at the entrance to the distribution system.
(B)
Monthly monitoring.
Systems must take a three-sample set each month in the distribution system. The system must take one sample at each of the following locations: near the first customer, at a location representative of average residence time, and at a location reflecting maximum residence time in the distribution system. Any additional routine sampling must be conducted in the same manner (as three-sample sets, at the specified locations). The system may use the results of additional monitoring conducted under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section to meet the requirement for monitoring in this paragraph.
(ii)
Additional monitoring.
On each day following a routine sample monitoring result that exceeds the chlorite MCL at the entrance to the distribution system, the system is required to take three chlorite distribution system samples at the following locations: as close to the first customer as possible, in a location representative of average residence time, and as close to the end of the distribution system as possible (reflecting maximum residence time in the distribution system).
(iii)
Reduced monitoring.
(A) Chlorite monitoring at the entrance to the distribution system required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section may not be reduced.
(B) Chlorite monitoring in the distribution system required by paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section may be reduced to one three-sample set per quarter after one year of monitoring where no individual chlorite sample taken in the distribution system under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section has exceeded the chlorite MCL and the system has not been required to conduct monitoring under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The system may remain on the reduced monitoring schedule until either any of the three individual chlorite samples taken quarterly in the distribution system under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section exceeds the chlorite MCL or the system is required to conduct monitoring under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, at which time the system must revert to routine monitoring.
(3)
Bromate
—(i)
Routine monitoring.
Community and nontransient noncommunity systems using ozone, for disinfection or oxidation, must take one sample per month for each treatment plant in the system using ozone. Systems must take samples monthly at the entrance to the distribution system while the ozonation system is operating under normal conditions.
(ii)
Reduced monitoring.
(A) Until March 31, 2009, systems required to analyze for bromate may reduce monitoring from monthly to quarterly, if the system's average source water bromide concentration is less than 0.05 mg/L based on representative monthly bromide measurements for one year. The system may remain on reduced bromate monitoring until the running annual average source water bromide concentration, computed quarterly, is equal to or greater than 0.05 mg/L based on representative monthly measurements. If the running annual average source water bromide concentration is ≥0.05 mg/L, the system must resume routine monitoring required by paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section in the following month.
(B) Beginning April 1, 2009, systems may no longer use the provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section to qualify for reduced monitoring. A system required to analyze for bromate may reduce monitoring from monthly to quarterly, if the system's running annual average bromate concentration is ≤0.0025 mg/L based on monthly bromate measurements under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section for the most recent four quarters, with samples analyzed using Method 317.0 Revision 2.0, 326.0 or 321.8. If a system has qualified for reduced bromate monitoring under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, that system may remain on reduced monitoring as long as the running annual average of quarterly bromate samples ≤0.0025 mg/L based on samples analyzed using Method 317.0 Revision 2.0, 326.0, or 321.8. If the running annual average bromate concentration is
0.0025 mg/L, the system must resume routine monitoring required by paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.
(c)
Monitoring requirements for disinfectant residuals
—(1)
Chlorine and chloramines
—(i)
Routine monitoring.
Until March 31, 2016, community and non-transient non-community water
systems that use chlorine or chloramines must measure the residual disinfectant level in the distribution system at the same point in the distribution system and at the same time as total coliforms are sampled, as specified in § 141.21. Beginning April 1, 2016, community and non-transient non-community water systems that use chlorine or chloramines must measure the residual disinfectant level in the distribution system at the same point in the distribution system and at the same time as total coliforms are sampled, as specified in §§ 141.854 through 141.858. Subpart H systems of this part may use the results of residual disinfectant concentration sampling conducted under § 141.74(b)(6)(i) for unfiltered systems or § 141.74(c)(3)(i) for systems which filter, in lieu of taking separate samples.
(ii)
Reduced monitoring.
Monitoring may not be reduced.
(2)
Chlorine dioxide
—(i)
Routine monitoring.
Community, nontransient noncommunity, and transient noncommunity water systems that use chlorine dioxide for disinfection or oxidation must take daily samples at the entrance to the distribution system. For any daily sample that exceeds the MRDL, the system must take samples in the distribution system the following day at the locations required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, in addition to the sample required at the entrance to the distribution system.
(ii)
Additional monitoring.
On each day following a routine sample monitoring result that exceeds the MRDL, the system is required to take three chlorine dioxide distribution system samples. If chlorine dioxide or chloramines are used to maintain a disinfectant residual in the distribution system, or if chlorine is used to maintain a disinfectant residual in the distribution system and there are no disinfection addition points after the entrance to the distribution system (
i.e.
, no booster chlorination), the system must take three samples as close to the first customer as possible, at intervals of at least six hours. If chlorine is used to maintain a disinfectant residual in the distribution system and there are one or more disinfection addition points after the entrance to the distribution system (
i.e.
, booster chlorination), the system must take one sample at each of the following locations: as close to the first customer as possible, in a location representative of average residence time, and as close to the end of the distribution system as possible (reflecting maximum residence time in the distribution system).
(iii)
Reduced monitoring.
Chlorine dioxide monitoring may not be reduced.
(d)
Monitoring requirements for disinfection byproduct precursors (DBPP)
—(1)
Routine monitoring.
Subpart H systems which use conventional filtration treatment (as defined in § 141.2) must monitor each treatment plant for TOC no later than the point of combined filter effluent turbidity monitoring and representative of the treated water. All systems required to monitor under this paragraph (d)(1) must also monitor for TOC in the source water prior to any treatment at the same time as monitoring for TOC in the treated water. These samples (source water and treated water) are referred to as paired samples. At the same time as the source water sample is taken, all systems must monitor for alkalinity in the source water prior to any treatment. Systems must take one paired sample and one source water alkalinity sample per month per plant at a time representative of normal operating conditions and influent water quality.
(2)
Reduced monitoring.
Subpart H systems with an average treated water TOC of less than 2.0 mg/L for two consecutive years, or less than 1.0 mg/L for one year, may reduce monitoring for both TOC and alkalinity to one paired sample and one source water alkalinity sample per plant per quarter. The system must revert to routine monitoring in the month following the quarter when the annual average treated water TOC ≥2.0 mg/L.
(e)
Bromide.
Systems required to analyze for bromate may reduce bromate monitoring from monthly to once per quarter, if the system demonstrates that the average source water bromide concentration is less than 0.05 mg/L based upon representative monthly measurements for one year. The system must continue bromide monitoring to remain on reduced bromate monitoring.
(f)
Monitoring plans.
Each system required to monitor under this subpart must develop and implement a monitoring plan. The system must maintain the plan and make it available for inspection by the State and the general public no later than 30 days following the applicable compliance dates in § 141.130(b). All Subpart H systems serving more than 3300 people must submit a copy of the monitoring plan to the State no later than the date of the first report required under § 141.134. The State may also require the plan to be submitted by any other system. After review, the State may require changes in any plan elements. The plan must include at least the following elements.
(1) Specific locations and schedules for collecting samples for any parameters included in this subpart.
(2) How the system will calculate compliance with MCLs, MRDLs, and treatment techniques.
(3) If approved for monitoring as a consecutive system, or if providing water to a consecutive system, under the provisions of § 141.29, the sampling plan must reflect the entire distribution system.
[63 FR 69466, Dec. 16, 1998, as amended at 66 FR 3776, Jan. 16, 2001; 69 FR 38856, June 29, 2004; 71 FR 482, Jan. 4, 2006; 78 FR 10348, Feb. 13, 2013]
§ 141.133
Compliance requirements.
(a)
General requirements.
(1) Where compliance is based on a running annual average of monthly or quarterly samples or averages and the system fails to monitor for TTHM, HAA5, or bromate, this failure to monitor will be treated as a monitoring violation for the entire period covered by the annual average. Where compliance is based on a running annual average of monthly or quarterly samples or averages and the system failure to monitor makes it impossible to determine compliance with MRDLs for chlorine and chloramines, this failure to monitor will be treated as a monitoring violation for the entire period covered by the annual average.
(2) All samples taken and analyzed under the provisions of this subpart must be included in determining compliance, even if that number is greater than the minimum required.
(3) If, during the first year of monitoring under § 141.132, any individual quarter's average will cause the running annual average of that system to exceed the MCL for total trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids (five), or bromate; or the MRDL for chlorine or chloramine, the system is out of compliance at the end of that quarter.
(b)
Disinfection byproducts
—(1)
TTHMs and HAA5.
(i) For systems monitoring quarterly, compliance with MCLs in § 141.64 must be based on a running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly, of quarterly arithmetic averages of all samples collected by the system as prescribed by § 141.132(b)(1).
(ii) For systems monitoring less frequently than quarterly, systems demonstrate MCL compliance if the average of samples taken that year under the provisions of § 141.132(b)(1) does not exceed the MCLs in § 141.64. If the average of these samples exceeds the MCL, the system must increase monitoring to once per quarter per treatment plant and such a system is not in violation of the MCL until it has completed one year of quarterly monitoring, unless the result of fewer than four quarters of monitoring will cause the running annual average to exceed the MCL, in which case the system is in violation at the end of that quarter. Systems required to increase monitoring frequency to quarterly monitoring must calculate compliance by including the sample which triggered the increased monitoring plus the following three quarters of monitoring.
(iii) If the running annual arithmetic average of quarterly averages covering any consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and must notify the public pursuant to § 141.32 or § 141.202, whichever is effective for your system, in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to § 141.134.
(iv) If a PWS fails to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, compliance with the MCL for the last four-quarter compliance period must be based on an average of the available data.
(2)
Bromate.
Compliance must be based on a running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly, of
monthly samples (or, for months in which the system takes more than one sample, the average f all samples taken during the month) collected by the system as prescribed by § 141.132(b)(3). If the average of samples covering any consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and must notify the public pursuant to subpart Q, in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to § 141.134. If a PWS fails to complete 12 consecutive months' monitoring, compliance with the MCL for the last four-quarter compliance period must be based on an average of the available data.
(3)
Chlorite.
Compliance must be based on an arithmetic average of each three sample set taken in the distribution system as prescribed by § 141.132(b)(2)(i)(B) and § 141.132(b)(2)(ii). If the arithmetic average of any three sample set exceeds the MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL and must notify the public pursuant to subpart Q, in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to § 141.134.
(c)
Disinfectant residuals
—(1)
Chlorine and chloramines.
(i) Compliance must be based on a running annual arithmetic average, computed quarterly, of monthly averages of all samples collected by the system under § 141.132(c)(1). If the average covering any consecutive four-quarter period exceeds the MRDL, the system is in violation of the MRDL and must notify the public pursuant to subpart Q, in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to § 141.134.
(ii) In cases where systems switch between the use of chlorine and chloramines for residual disinfection during the year, compliance must be determined by including together all monitoring results of both chlorine and chloramines in calculating compliance. Reports submitted pursuant to § 141.134 must clearly indicate which residual disinfectant was analyzed for each sample.
(2)
Chlorine dioxide.
(i)
Acute violations.
Compliance must be based on consecutive daily samples collected by the system under § 141.132(c)(2). If any daily sample taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceeds the MRDL, and on the following day one (or more) of the three samples taken in the distribution system exceed the MRDL, the system is in violation of the MRDL and must take immediate corrective action to lower the level of chlorine dioxide below the MRDL and must notify the public pursuant to the procedures for acute health risks in subpart Q in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to § 141.134. Failure to take samples in the distribution system the day following an exceedance of the chlorine dioxide MRDL at the entrance to the distribution system will also be considered an MRDL violation and the system must notify the public of the violation in accordance with the provisions for acute violations under subpart Q in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to § 141.134.
(ii)
Nonacute violations.
Compliance must be based on consecutive daily samples collected by the system under § 141.132(c)(2). If any two consecutive daily samples taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceed the MRDL and all distribution system samples taken are below the MRDL, the system is in violation of the MRDL and must take corrective action to lower the level of chlorine dioxide below the MRDL at the point of sampling and will notify the public pursuant to the procedures for nonacute health risks in subpart Q in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to § 141.134. Failure to monitor at the entrance to the distribution system the day following an exceedance of the chlorine dioxide MRDL at the entrance to the distribution system is also an MRDL violation and the system must notify the public of the violation in accordance with the provisions for nonacute violations under § 141.32(e)(78) in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to § 141.134.
(d)
Disinfection byproduct precursors (DBPP).
Compliance must be determined as specified by § 141.135(c). Systems may begin monitoring to determine whether Step 1 TOC removals can be met 12 months prior to the compliance date for the system. This monitoring is not required and failure to monitor during this period is not a violation. However, any system that does not monitor during this period, and then determines in the first 12 months
after the compliance date that it is not able to meet the Step 1 requirements in § 141.135(b)(2) and must therefore apply for alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements, is not eligible for retroactive approval of alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements as allowed pursuant to § 141.135(b)(3) and is in violation. Systems may apply for alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements any time after the compliance date. For systems required to meet Step 1 TOC removals, if the value calculated under § 141.135(c)(1)(iv) is less than 1.00, the system is in violation of the treatment technique requirements and must notify the public pursuant to subpart Q of this part, in addition to reporting to the State pursuant to § 141.134.

[63 FR 69466, Dec. 16, 1998, as amended at 66 FR 3778, Jan. 16, 2001; 66 FR 9903, Feb. 12, 2001]
§ 141.135
Treatment technique for control of disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors.
(a)
Applicability.
(1) Subpart H systems using conventional filtration treatment (as defined in § 141.2) must operate with enhanced coagulation or enhanced softening to achieve the TOC percent removal levels specified in paragraph (b) of this section unless the system meets at least one of the alternative compliance criteria listed in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section.
(2)
Alternative compliance criteria for enhanced coagulation and enhanced softening systems.
Subpart H systems using conventional filtration treatment may use the alternative compliance criteria in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section to comply with this section in lieu of complying with paragraph (b) of this section. Systems must still comply with monitoring requirements in § 141.132(d).
(i) The system's source water TOC level, measured according to § 141.131(d)(3), is less than 2.0 mg/L, calculated quarterly as a running annual average.
(ii) The system's treated water TOC level, measured according to § 141.131(d)(3), is less than 2.0 mg/L, calculated quarterly as a running annual average.
(iii) The system's source water TOC level, measured according to § 141.131(d)(3), is less than 4.0 mg/L, calculated quarterly as a running annual average; the source water alkalinity, measured according to § 141.131(d)(1), is greater than 60 mg/L (as CaCO
3
), calculated quarterly as a running annual average; and either the TTHM and HAA5 running annual averages are no greater than 0.040 mg/L and 0.030 mg/L, respectively; or prior to the effective date for compliance in § 141.130(b), the system has made a clear and irrevocable financial commitment not later than the effective date for compliance in § 141.130(b) to use of technologies that will limit the levels of TTHMs and HAA5 to no more than 0.040 mg/L and 0.030 mg/L, respectively. Systems must submit evidence of a clear and irrevocable financial commitment, in addition to a schedule containing milestones and periodic progress reports for installation and operation of appropriate technologies, to the State for approval not later than the effective date for compliance in § 141.130(b). These technologies must be installed and operating not later than June 30, 2005. Failure to install and operate these technologies by the date in the approved schedule will constitute a violation of National Primary Drinking Water Regulations.
(iv) The TTHM and HAA5 running annual averages are no greater than 0.040 mg/L and 0.030 mg/L, respectively, and the system uses only chlorine for primary disinfection and maintenance of a residual in the distribution system.
(v) The system's source water SUVA, prior to any treatment and measured monthly according to § 141.131(d)(4), is less than or equal to 2.0 L/mg-m, calculated quarterly as a running annual average.
(vi) The system's finished water SUVA, measured monthly according to § 141.131(d)(4), is less than or equal to 2.0 L/mg-m, calculated quarterly as a running annual average.
(3)
Additional alternative compliance criteria for softening systems.
Systems practicing enhanced softening that cannot achieve the TOC removals required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section may use the alternative compliance criteria in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section in lieu of complying with paragraph (b) of this section. Systems must still comply with monitoring requirements in § 141.132(d).
(i) Softening that results in lowering the treated water alkalinity to less than 60 mg/L (as CaCO
3
), measured monthly according to § 141.131(d)(1) and calculated quarterly as a running annual average.
(ii) Softening that results in removing at least 10 mg/L of magnesium hardness (as CaCO
3
), measured monthly according to § 141.131(d)(6) and calculated quarterly as a running annual average.
(b)
Enhanced coagulation and enhanced softening performance requirements.
(1) Systems must achieve the percent reduction of TOC specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section between the source water and the combined filter effluent, unless the State approves
a system's request for alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(2) Required Step 1 TOC reductions, indicated in the following table, are based upon specified source water parameters measured in accordance with § 141.131(d). Systems practicing softening are required to meet the Step 1 TOC reductions in the far-right column (Source water alkalinity
120 mg/L) for the specified source water TOC:

Softening system meeting one of the alternative compliance criteria in paragraph (a)(3) of this section are not required to operate with enhanced softening.
3
System practicing softening must meet the TOC removal requirements in this column.
(3) Subpart H conventional treatment systems that cannot achieve the Step 1 TOC removals required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section due to water quality parameters or operational constraints must apply to the State, within three months of failure to achieve the TOC removals required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for approval of alternative minimum TOC (Step 2) removal requirements submitted by the system. If the State approves the alternative minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements, the State may make those requirements retroactive for the purposes of determining compliance. Until the State approves the alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements, the system must meet the Step 1 TOC removals contained in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(4)
Alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements.
Applications made to the State by enhanced coagulation systems for approval of alternate minimum TOC removal (Step 2) requirements under paragraph (b)(3) of this section must include, at a minimum, results of bench- or pilot-scale testing conducted under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. The submitted bench- or pilot-scale testing must be used to determine the alternate enhanced coagulation level.
(i)
Alternate enhanced coagulation level is defined as
coagulation at a coagulant dose and pH as determined by the method described in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (v) of this section such that an incremental addition of 10 mg/L of alum (or equivalent amount of ferric salt) results in a TOC removal of ≤0.3 mg/L. The percent removal of TOC at this point on the “TOC removal versus coagulant dose” curve is then defined as the minimum TOC removal required for the system. Once approved by the State, this minimum requirement supersedes the minimum TOC removal required by the table in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. This requirement will be effective until such time as the State approves a new value based on the results of a new bench- and pilot-scale test. Failure to achieve State-set alternative minimum TOC removal levels is a violation of National Primary Drinking Water Regulations.
(ii) Bench- or pilot-scale testing of enhanced coagulation must be conducted by using representative water samples and adding 10 mg/L increments of alum (or equivalent amounts of ferric salt) until the pH is reduced to a level less than or equal to the enhanced coagulation Step 2 target pH shown in the following table:
Enhanced Coagulation Step 2 target pH

6.3
120-240
7.0
240
7.5
(iii) For waters with alkalinities of less than 60 mg/L for which addition of small amounts of alum or equivalent addition of iron coagulant drives the pH below 5.5 before significant TOC removal occurs, the system must add necessary chemicals to maintain the pH between 5.3 and 5.7 in samples until the TOC removal of 0.3 mg/L per 10 mg/L alum added (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant) is reached.
(iv) The system may operate at any coagulant dose or pH necessary (consistent with other NPDWRs) to achieve the minimum TOC percent removal approved under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(v) If the TOC removal is consistently less than 0.3 mg/L of TOC per 10 mg/L of incremental alum dose at all dosages of alum (or equivalent addition of iron coagulant), the water is deemed to contain TOC not amenable to enhanced coagulation. The system may then apply to the State for a waiver of enhanced coagulation requirements.
(c)
Compliance calculations.
(1) Subpart H systems other than those identified in paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section must comply with requirements contained in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section. Systems must calculate compliance quarterly, beginning after the system has collected 12 months of data, by determining an annual average using the following method:
(i) Determine actual monthly TOC percent removal, equal to:
(1−(treated water TOC/source water TOC)) × 100
(ii) Determine the required monthly TOC percent removal (from either the table in paragraph (b)(2) of this section or from paragraph (b)(3) of this section).
(iii) Divide the value in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section by the value in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(iv) Add together the results of paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section for the last 12 months and divide by 12.
(v) If the value calculated in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section is less than 1.00, the system is not in compliance with the TOC percent removal requirements.
(2) Systems may use the provisions in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (v) of this section in lieu of the calculations in paragraph (c)(1)(i) through (v) of this section to determine compliance with TOC percent removal requirements.
(i) In any month that the system's treated or source water TOC level, measured according to § 141.131(d)(3), is less than 2.0 mg/L, the system may assign a monthly value of 1.0 (in lieu of the value calculated in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section) when calculating compliance under the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(ii) In any month that a system practicing softening removes at least 10 mg/L of magnesium hardness (as CaCO
3
), the system may assign a monthly value of 1.0 (in lieu of the value calculated in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section) when calculating compliance under the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(iii) In any month that the system's source water SUVA, prior to any treatment and measured according to § 141.131(d)(4), is ≤2.0 L/mg-m, the system may assign a monthly value of 1.0 (in lieu of the value calculated in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section) when calculating compliance under the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(iv) In any month that the system's finished water SUVA, measured according to § 141.131(d)(4), is ≤2.0 L/mg-m, the system may assign a monthly value of 1.0 (in lieu of the value calculated in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section) when calculating compliance under the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(v) In any month that a system practicing enhanced softening lowers alkalinity below 60 mg/L (as CaCO
3
), the system may assign a monthly value of 1.0 (in lieu of the value calculated in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section) when calculating compliance under the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(3) Subpart H systems using conventional treatment may also comply with
the requirements of this section by meeting the criteria in paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section.

§ 141.151
Purpose and applicability of this subpart.
(a) This subpart establishes the minimum requirements for the content of reports that community water systems must deliver to their customers. These reports must contain information on the quality of the water delivered by the systems and characterize the risks (if any) from exposure to contaminants detected in the drinking water in an accurate and understandable manner. This subpart also includes requirements for systems serving more than 100,000 persons to develop and annually update a plan for providing assistance to consumers with limited English proficiency.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 141.3, this subpart applies only to community water systems.
(c) For the purpose of this subpart,
customers
are defined as billing units or service connections to which water is delivered by a community water system. For the purposes of this subpart,
consumers
are defined as people served by the water system, including customers, and people that do not receive a bill.
(d) For the purpose of this subpart, detected means: at or above the levels prescribed by § 141.23(a)(4) for inorganic contaminants, at or above the levels prescribed by § 141.24(f)(7) for the contaminants listed in § 141.61(a), at or above the levels prescribed by § 141.24(h)(18) for the contaminants listed in § 141.61(c) (except PFAS), at or above the levels prescribed by § 141.131(b)(2)(iv) for the contaminants or contaminant groups listed in § 141.64, at or above the levels prescribed by § 141.25(c) for radioactive contaminants, and at or above the levels prescribed in § 141.902(a)(5) for PFAS listed in § 141.61(c).
(e) A State that has primary enforcement responsibility may adopt by rule, after notice and comment, alternative requirements for the form and content of the reports. The alternative requirements must provide the same type and amount of information as required by §§ 141.153 and 141.154, and must be designed to achieve an equivalent level of public information and education as would be achieved under this subpart.
(f) For purpose of this subpart, the term “primacy agency” refers to the State or Tribal government entity that has jurisdiction over, and primary enforcement responsibility for, public water systems, even if that government does not have interim or final primary enforcement responsibility for this part. Where the State or tribe does not have primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems, the term “primacy agency” refers to the appropriate EPA regional office.

Beginning January 1, 2027, community water systems must comply with 40 CFR 141.151 through 141.156 (except § 141.153(8)(h)(i)), as codified on July 1, 2024. Beginning November 1, 2027, community water systems must comply with 40 CFR 141.151 through 141.156, as codified on July 1, 2025.
(b) Each existing community water system must deliver reports according to § 141.155 by July 1 each year. Each report delivered by July 1 must contain
data collected during the previous calendar year, or the most recent calendar year before the previous calendar year.
(c) A new community water system must deliver its first report by July 1 of the year after its first full calendar year in operation.
(d) A community water system that sells water to another community water system must deliver the applicable information required in § 141.153 to the buyer system:
(1) By April 1, 2027, and annually thereafter; or
(2) On a date mutually agreed upon by the seller and the purchaser, and specifically included in a contract between the parties; and
(3) A community water system that sells water to another community water system that is required to provide reports biannually according to § 141.155(i) must provide the applicable information required in § 141.155(j) by October 1, 2027, to the buyer system, and annually thereafter, or a date mutually agreed upon by the seller and the purchaser, included in a contract between the parties.
[63 FR 44526, Aug. 19, 1998, as amended at 89 FR 46008, May 24, 2024; 89 FR 86662, Oct. 30, 2024]
§ 141.153
Content of the reports.
(a) Each community water system must provide to its customers a report(s) that contains the information specified in this section, § 141.154, and include a summary as specified in § 141.156.
(b) Information on the source of the water delivered:
(1) Each report must identify the source(s) of the water delivered by the community water system by providing information on:
(i) The type of the water: e.g., surface water, ground water; and
(ii) The commonly used name (if any) and location of the body (or bodies) of water.
(2) If a source water assessment has been completed, the report must notify consumers of the availability of this information, the year it was completed or most recently updated, and the means to obtain it. In addition, systems are encouraged to highlight in the report significant sources of contamination in the source water area if they have readily available information. Where a system has received a source water assessment from the primacy agency, the report must include a brief summary of the system's susceptibility to potential sources of contamination, using language provided by the primacy agency or written by the operator.
(c)
Definitions.
(1) Each report must include the following definitions:
(i)
Maximum Contaminant Level Goal or MCLG:
The level of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health. MCLGs allow for a margin of safety.
(ii)
Maximum Contaminant Level or MCL:
The highest level of a contaminant that is allowed in drinking water. MCLs are set as close to the MCLGs as feasible using the best available treatment technology.
(iii)
Contaminant:
Any physical, chemical, biological, or radiological substance or matter in water.
(2) A report for a community water system operating under a variance or an exemption issued under § 1415 or 1416 of SDWA must include the following definition:
Variances and Exemptions:
State or EPA permission not to meet an MCL or a treatment technique under certain conditions.
(3) A report that contains data on contaminants that EPA regulates using any of the following terms must include the applicable definitions:
(i)
Treatment Technique:
A required process intended to reduce the level of a contaminant in drinking water.
(ii)
Action Level:
The concentration of a contaminant which, if exceeded, triggers treatment or other requirements which a water system must follow.
(iii)
Maximum residual disinfectant level goal or MRDLG:
The level of a drinking water disinfectant below which there is no known or expected risk to health. MRDLGs do not reflect the benefits of the use of disinfectants to control microbial contaminants.
(iv)
Maximum residual disinfectant level or MRDL:
The highest level of a disinfectant allowed in drinking water. There is convincing evidence that addition of a disinfectant is necessary for control of microbial contaminants.
(v)
Hazard Index or HI.
The Hazard Index is an approach that determines the health concerns associated with mixtures of certain PFAS in finished drinking water. Low levels of multiple PFAS that individually would not likely result in adverse health effects may pose health concerns when combined in a mixture. The Hazard Index MCL represents the maximum level for mixtures of PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and/or PFBS allowed in water delivered by a public water system. A Hazard Index greater than 1 requires a system to take action.
(4) A report that contains information regarding a Level 1 or Level 2 Assessment required under Subpart Y of this part must include the applicable definitions:
(i)
Level 1 Assessment:
A Level 1 assessment is a study of the water system to identify potential problems and determine (if possible) why total coliform bacteria have been found in our water system.
(ii)
Level 2 Assessment:
A Level 2 assessment is a very detailed study of the water system to identify potential problems and determine (if possible) why an
E. coli
MCL violation has occurred and/or why total coliform bacteria have been found in our water system on multiple occasions.
(5) Systems must use the following definitions for the terms listed below if the terms are used in the report unless the system obtains written approval from the state to use an alternate definition:
(i)
Pesticide:
Generally, any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest.
(ii)
Herbicide:
Any chemical(s) used to control undesirable vegetation.
(d)
Information on detected contaminants.
(1) This sub-section specifies the requirements for information to be included in each report for contaminants subject to mandatory monitoring (except
Cryptosporidium
). It applies to:
(i) Contaminants subject to a MCL, action level, maximum residual disinfectant level, or treatment technique (regulated contaminants); and
(ii) Contaminants for which monitoring is required by § 141.40 (unregulated contaminants).
(2) The data relating to these contaminants must be presented in the reports in a manner that is clear and understandable for consumers. For example, the data may be displayed in one table or in several adjacent tables. Any additional monitoring results which a community water system chooses to include in its report must be displayed separately.
(3) The data must be derived from data collected to comply with EPA and State monitoring and analytical requirements during the previous calendar year, or the most recent calendar year before the previous calendar year except that:
(i) Where a system is allowed to monitor for regulated contaminants less often than once a year, the contaminant data section must include the date and results of the most recent sampling and the report must include a brief statement indicating that the data presented in the report are from the most recent testing done in accordance with the regulations. No data older than 5 years need be included.
(ii) [Reserved]
(4) For each detected regulated contaminant (listed in appendix A to this subpart), the contaminant data section(s) must contain:
(i) The MCL for that contaminant expressed as a number equal to or greater than 1.0 (as provided in appendix A to this subpart);
(ii) The MCLG for that contaminant expressed in the same units as the MCL;
(iii) If there is no MCL for a detected contaminant, the contaminant data section(s) must indicate that there is a treatment technique, or specify the action level, applicable to that contaminant, and the report must include the definitions for treatment technique and/or action level, as appropriate, specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section;
(iv) For contaminants subject to an MCL, except turbidity and
E. coli,
the contaminant data section(s) must contain the highest contaminant level used to determine compliance with an NPDWR and the range of detected levels, as follows:
(A) When compliance with the MCL is determined annually or less frequently: The highest detected level at any sampling point and the range of detected levels expressed in the same units as the MCL.
(B) When compliance with the MCL is determined by calculating a running annual average of all samples taken at a monitoring location: the highest average of any of the monitoring locations and the range of individual sample results for all monitoring locations expressed in the same units as the MCL. For the MCLs for TTHM and HAA5 in § 141.64(b)(2), systems must include the highest locational running annual average for TTHM and HAA5 and the range of individual sample results for all monitoring locations expressed in the same units as the MCL. If more than one location exceeds the TTHM or HAA5 MCL, the system must include the locational running annual averages for all locations that exceed the MCL.

# Note to paragraph (
d

# )(4)(
iv

# ):
When rounding of results to determine compliance with the MCL is allowed by the regulations, rounding should be done prior to multiplying the results by the factor listed in appendix A of this subpart.
(v) For turbidity.
(A) When it is reported pursuant to § 141.13: The highest average monthly value.
(B) When it is reported pursuant to the requirements of § 141.71: the highest monthly value. The report should include an explanation of the reasons for measuring turbidity.

(vi) For lead and copper: the 90th percentile concentration of the most recent round(s) of sampling, the number of sampling sites exceeding the action level, and the range of tap sampling results;
(vii)-(viii) [Reserved]
(ix) The likely source(s) of detected contaminants to the best of the operator's knowledge. Specific information regarding contaminants may be available in sanitary surveys and source water assessments, and should be used when available to the operator. If the operator lacks specific information on the likely source, the report must include one or more of the typical sources for that contaminant listed in appendix A to this subpart that is most applicable to the system; and
(x) For
E. coli
analytical results under subpart Y: The total number of
E. coli
positive samples;
(5) If a community water system distributes water to its customers from multiple hydraulically independent distribution systems that are fed by different raw water sources, the contaminant data section(s) should differentiate contaminant data for each service area and the report should identify each separate distribution system. For example, if displayed in a table, it should contain a separate column for each service area. Alternatively, systems could produce separate reports tailored to include data for each service area.
(6) The detected contaminant data section(s) must clearly identify any data indicating violations of MCLs, MRDLs, or treatment techniques, and the report must contain a clear and readily understandable explanation of the violation including: the length of the violation, the potential adverse health effects, and actions taken by the system to address the violation. To describe the potential health effects, the system must use the relevant language of appendix A to this subpart.
(7) For detected unregulated contaminants for which monitoring is required, the reports must present the average and range at which the contaminant was detected. The report must include a brief explanation of the reasons for monitoring for unregulated contaminants such as:
(i) Unregulated contaminant monitoring helps EPA to determine where certain contaminants occur and whether the Agency should consider regulating those contaminants in the future.

(8) For systems that exceeded the lead action level in § 141.80(c), the detected contaminant data section must clearly identify the exceedance if any corrective action has been required by the Administrator or the State during the monitoring period covered by the report. The report must include a clear and readily understandable explanation of the exceedance, the steps consumers can take to reduce their exposure to lead in drinking water, and a description of any corrective actions the system has or will take to address the exceedance.
(e) Information on
Cryptosporidium,
radon, and other contaminants:
(1) If the system has performed any monitoring for
Cryptosporidium
which indicates that
Cryptosporidium
may be present in the source water or the finished water, the report must include:
(i) A summary of the results of the monitoring; and
(ii) An explanation of the significance of the results.
(2) If the system has performed any monitoring for radon which indicates that radon may be present in the finished water, the report must include:
(i) The results of the monitoring; and
(ii) An explanation of the significance of the results.
(3) If the system has performed additional monitoring which indicates the presence of other contaminants in the finished water, EPA strongly encourages systems to report any results which may indicate a health concern. To determine if results may indicate a health concern, EPA recommends that systems find out if EPA has proposed an NPDWR or issued a health advisory for that contaminant by contacting the Agency by calling the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) or an alternative method identified on the website
epa.gov/safewater.
EPA considers detects above a proposed MCL or health advisory level to indicate possible health concerns. For such contaminants, EPA recommends that the report include:
(i) The results of the monitoring; and
(ii) An explanation of the significance of the results noting the existence of a health advisory or a proposed regulation.
(f) Compliance with NPDWR. In addition to the requirements of paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the report must note any violation that occurred during the period covered by the report of a requirement listed below, and include a clear and readily understandable explanation of the violation, any potential adverse health effects, and the steps the system has taken to correct the violation.
(1) Monitoring and reporting of compliance data;
(2) Filtration and disinfection prescribed by subpart H of this part. For systems which have failed to install adequate filtration or disinfection equipment or processes, or have had a failure of such equipment or processes which constitutes a violation, the report must include the following language as part of the explanation of potential adverse health effects: Inadequately treated water may contain disease-causing organisms. These organisms include bacteria, viruses, and parasites which can cause symptoms such as nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and associated headaches.
(3) Lead and copper control requirements prescribed by subpart I of this part. For systems that fail to take one or more actions prescribed by §§ 141.80 through 141.93, the report must include the applicable language of appendix A to this subpart for lead, copper, or both.
(4) Treatment techniques for Acrylamide and Epichlorohydrin prescribed by subpart K of this part. For systems that violate the requirements of subpart K of this part, the report must include the relevant language from appendix A to this subpart.
(5) Recordkeeping of compliance data.
(6) Special monitoring requirements prescribed by §§ 141.40 and 141.41; and
(7) Violation of the terms of a variance, an exemption, or an administrative or judicial order.
(g) Variances and Exemptions. If a system is operating under the terms of a variance or an exemption issued under § 1415 or 1416 of SDWA, the report must contain:
(1) An explanation of the reasons for the variance or exemption;
(2) The date on which the variance or exemption was issued;
(3) A brief status report on the steps the system is taking to install treatment, find alternative sources of water, or otherwise comply with the terms and schedules of the variance or exemption; and
(4) A notice of any opportunity for public input in the review, or renewal, of the variance or exemption.
(h) Additional information:
(1) The report must contain a brief explanation regarding contaminants which may reasonably be expected to be found in drinking water including bottled water. This explanation may include the language of paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section or systems may use their own comparable language. The report also must include the language of paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section.
(i) Both tap water and bottled water come from rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs, and wells. As water travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material. The water can also pick up and transport substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity. These substances are also called contaminants.
(ii) Contaminants are any physical, chemical, biological, or radiological substance or matter in water. Contaminants that may be present in source water include:
(A)
Microbial contaminants,
such as viruses and bacteria, which may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock operations, and wildlife.
(B)
Inorganic contaminants,
such as salts and metals, which can occur naturally in the soil or groundwater or may result from urban stormwater runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining, or farming.
(C)
Pesticides and herbicides,
which may come from a variety of sources such as agriculture, urban stormwater runoff, and residential uses.
(D)
Organic chemical contaminants,
including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, which are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum production, and can also come from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff, and septic systems.
(E)
Radioactive contaminants,
which can occur naturally or be the result of oil and gas production and mining activities.
(iii) To protect public health, the Environmental Protection Agency prescribes regulations which limit the amount of certain contaminants in tap water provided by public water systems. The Food and Drug Administration regulations establish limits for contaminants in bottled water which must provide the same protection for public health.
(iv) Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily mean that water poses a health risk. More information about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by contacting the Environmental Protection Agency by calling the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) or visiting the website
epa.gov/safewater.
(2) The report must include the telephone number of the owner, operator, or designee of the community water system as a source of additional information concerning the report. If a system uses a website or social media to share additional information, EPA recommends including information about how to access such media platforms in the report.
(3) In communities with a large proportion of consumers with limited English proficiency, as determined by the Primacy Agency, the report must contain information in the appropriate language(s) regarding the importance of the report and either contain information where such consumers may obtain a translated copy of the report, or assistance in the appropriate language(s), or the report must be in the appropriate language(s).
(4) The report must include information (e.g., time and place of regularly scheduled board meetings) about opportunities for public participation in decisions that may affect the quality of the water.
(5) The systems may include such additional information as they deem necessary for public education consistent with, and not detracting from, the purpose of the report.
(6) Systems required to comply with subpart S of this part.
(i) Any ground water system that receives notice from the State of a significant deficiency or notice from a laboratory of a fecal indicator-positive ground water source sample that is not invalidated by the State under § 141.402(d) must inform its customers of any significant deficiency that is uncorrected at the time of the next reporting period or of any fecal indicator-positive ground water source sample in the next report or 6-month update according to § 141.155. The system must continue to inform the public annually until the State determines that particular significant deficiency is corrected or the fecal contamination in the ground water source is addressed under § 141.403(a). Each report must include the following elements:
(A) The nature of the particular significant deficiency or the source of the fecal contamination (if the source is known) and the date the significant deficiency was identified by the State or the dates of the fecal indicator-positive ground water source samples;
(B) If the fecal contamination in the ground water source has been addressed under § 141.403(a) and the date of such action;

) During the past year we failed to correct all identified defects that were found during the assessment.
(ii) Any system required to conduct a Level 2 assessment due to an
E. coli
MCL violation must include in the report the text found in paragraphs (h)(7)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, and health effects language in appendix A to this subpart, filling in the blanks accordingly and the text found in paragraphs (h)(7)(ii)(C)(1) and (2) of this section, if appropriate. Systems may use an alternative statement with equivalent information for paragraphs (h)(7)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section, if approved by the primacy agency.
(A) We found
E. coli
bacteria, indicating the need to look for potential problems in water treatment or distribution. When this occurs, we are required to conduct assessment(s), also known as a Level 2 assessment, to identify problems and to correct any problems that were found during these assessments.
(B) We were required to complete a detailed assessment of our water system, also known as a Level 2 assessment, because we found
E. coli
in our water system. In addition, we were required to take [INSERT NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS] corrective actions and we completed [INSERT NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS] of these actions.
(C) Any system that has failed to complete the required assessment or correct all identified sanitary defects, is in violation of the treatment technique requirement and must also include one or both of the following statements, as appropriate:
(
1
) We failed to conduct the required assessment.
(
2
) We failed to correct all defects that were identified during the assessment that we conducted.
(iii) If a system detects
E. coli
and has violated the
E. coli MCL,
in addition to completing the table as required in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the system must include one or more of the following statements to describe any noncompliance, as applicable:
(A) We had an
E. coli
-positive repeat sample following a total coliform-positive routine sample.
(B) We had a total coliform-positive repeat sample following an
E. coli
-positive routine sample.
(C) We failed to take all required repeat samples following an
E. coli
-positive routine sample.
(D) We failed to test for
E. coli
when any repeat sample tested positive for total coliform.
(iv) If a system detects
E. coli
and has not violated the
E. coli MCL,
in addition to completing the table as required in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the system may include a statement that explains that although they have detected
E. coli,
they are not in violation of the
E. coli
MCL.
(8) Systems required to comply with subpart I of this part.
(i) The report must notify consumers that complete lead tap sampling data are available for review and must include information on how to access the data.
(ii) The report must include a statement that a service line inventory (including inventories where the publicly accessible inventory consists of a written statement that there are no lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service lines, known lead connectors or connectors of unknown material) has been prepared and include instructions to access the publicly accessible service line inventory. If the service line inventory is available online, the report must include the direct link to the inventory.
(iii) For systems with lead, galvanized requiring replacement, or lead status unknown service lines in the system's inventory pursuant to § 141.84(a) and (b), the report must include information on how to obtain a copy of the service line replacement
plan or a direct link to the plan if the system is required to make the service line replacement plan available online.
(iv) The report must contain a plainly worded explanation of the corrosion control efforts the system is taking in accordance with subpart I of this part. Corrosion control efforts consist of treatment (
e.g.,

§ 141.154
Required additional health information.
(a) All reports must prominently display the following language: Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised persons such as persons with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers. EPA/CDC guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by
Cryptosporidium
and other microbial contaminants are available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) or on EPA's website
epa.gov/safewater.
(b) A system that detects arsenic above 0.005 mg/L and up to and including 0.010 mg/L:
(1) Must include in its report a short informational statement about arsenic, using language such as: Arsenic is known to cause cancer in humans. Arsenic also may cause other health effects such as skin damage and circulatory problems. [NAME OF UTILITY] meets the EPA arsenic drinking water standard, also known as a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL). However, you should know that EPA's MCL
for arsenic balances the scientific community's understanding of arsenic-related health effects and the cost of removing arsenic from drinking water. The highest concentration of arsenic found in [YEAR] was [INSERT MAX ARSENIC LEVEL per § 141.153(d)(4)(iv)] ppb.
(2) May use an alternative educational statement in the CCR if approved by the Primacy Agency.
(c) A system which detects nitrate at levels above 5 mg/l, but below the MCL:
(1) Must include a short informational statement about the impacts of nitrate on children using language such as: Even though [NAME OF UTILITY] meets the EPA nitrate drinking water standard, also known as a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL), if you are caring for an infant and using tap water to prepare formula, you may want to use alternate sources of water or ask for advice from your health care provider. Nitrate levels above 10 ppm pose a particularly high health concern for infants under 6 months of age and can interfere with the capacity of the infant's blood to carry oxygen, resulting in a serious illness. Symptoms of serious illness include shortness of breath and blueness of the skin, known as “blue baby syndrome.” Nitrate levels in drinking water can increase for short periods of time due to high levels of rainfall or agricultural activity, therefore we test for nitrate [INSERT APPLICABLE SAMPLING FREQUENCY]. The highest level for nitrate found during [YEAR] was [INSERT MAX NITRATE LEVEL per § 141.153(d)(4)(iv)] ppm.
(2) May use an alternative educational statement in the CCR if approved by the Primacy Agency.
(d) Every report must include the following lead-specific information:
(1) A short informational statement about lead in drinking water and its effects on children. The statement must include the information in figure 1 to this paragraph (d)(1):

# Figure 1 to Paragraph (d)(1)
Lead can cause serious health effects in people of all ages, especially pregnant people, infants (both formula-fed and breastfed), and young children. Lead in drinking water is primarily from materials and parts used in service lines and in home plumbing. [INSERT NAME OF SYSTEM] is responsible for providing high quality drinking water and removing lead pipes but cannot control the variety of materials used in the plumbing in your home. Because lead levels may vary over time, lead exposure is possible even when your tap sampling results do not detect lead at one point in time. You can help protect yourself and your family by identifying and removing lead materials within your home plumbing and taking steps to reduce your family's risk. Using a filter, certified by an American National Standards Institute accredited certifier to reduce lead, is effective in reducing lead exposures. Follow the instructions provided with the filter to ensure the filter is used properly. Use only cold water for drinking, cooking, and making baby formula. Boiling water does not remove lead from water. Before using tap water for drinking, cooking, or making baby formula, flush your pipes for several minutes. You can do this by running your tap, taking a shower, doing laundry or a load of dishes. If you have a lead service line or galvanized requiring replacement service line, you may need to flush your pipes for a longer period. If you are concerned about lead in your water and wish to have your water tested, contact [INSERT NAME OF SYSTEM and CONTACT INFORMATION]. Information on lead in drinking water, testing methods, and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available at
https://www.epa.gov/safewater/lead.
(2) May use an alternative educational statement in the CCR if approved by the Primacy Agency.

# Subpart P—Enhanced Filtration and Disinfection—Systems Serving 10,000 or More People

# Source:
63 FR 69516, Dec. 16, 1998, unless otherwise noted.
§ 141.170
General requirements.
(a) The requirements of this subpart P constitute national primary drinking water regulations. These regulations establish requirements for filtration and disinfection that are in addition to criteria under which filtration and disinfection are required under subpart H of this part. The requirements of this subpart are applicable to subpart H systems serving at least 10,000 people, beginning January 1, 2002 unless otherwise specified in this subpart. The regulations in this subpart establish or extend treatment technique requirements in lieu of maximum contaminant levels for the following contaminants:
Giardia lamblia,
viruses, heterotrophic plate count bacteria,
Legionella, Cryptosporidium,
and turbidity. Each subpart H system serving at least 10,000 people must provide treatment of its source water that complies with these treatment technique requirements and are in addition to those identified in § 141.70. The treatment technique requirements consist of installing and properly operating water treatment processes which reliably achieve:
(1) At least 99 percent (2-log) removal of
Cryptosporidium
between a point where the raw water is not subject to recontamination by surface water runoff and a point downstream before or at the first customer for filtered systems, or
Cryptosporidium
control under the watershed control plan for unfiltered systems.
(2) Compliance with the profiling and benchmark requirements under the provisions of § 141.172.
(b) A public water system subject to the requirements of this subpart is considered to be in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if:
(1) It meets the requirements for avoiding filtration in §§ 141.71 and 141.171 and the disinfection requirements in §§ 141.72 and 141.172; or
(2) It meets the applicable filtration requirements in either § 141.73 or § 141.173 and the disinfection requirements in §§ 141.72 and 141.172.
(c) Systems are not permitted to begin construction of uncovered finished water storage facilities beginning February 16, 1999.
(d) Subpart H systems that did not conduct optional monitoring under § 141.172 because they served fewer than 10,000 persons when such monitoring was required, but serve more than 10,000 persons prior to January 1, 2005 must comply with §§ 141.170, 141.171, 141.173, 141.174, and 141.175. These systems must also consult with the State to establish a disinfection benchmark. A system that decides to make a significant change to its disinfection practice, as described in § 141.172(c)(1)(i) through (iv) must consult with the State prior to making such change.
[63 FR 69516, Dec. 16, 1998, as amended at 66 FR 3779, Jan. 16, 2001; 67 FR 1836, Jan. 14, 2002; 69 FR 38856, June 29, 2004]
§ 141.171
Criteria for avoiding filtration.
In addition to the requirements of § 141.71, a public water system subject to the requirements of this subpart that does not provide filtration must meet all of the conditions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(a)
Site-specific conditions.
In addition to site-specific conditions in § 141.71(b), systems must maintain the watershed control program under § 141.71(b)(2) to minimize the potential for contamination by
Cryptosporidium
oocysts in the source water. The watershed control program must, for
Cryptosporidium
:
(1) Identify watershed characteristics and activities which may have an adverse effect on source water quality; and
(2) Monitor the occurrence of activities which may have an adverse effect on source water quality.
(b) During the onsite inspection conducted under the provisions of § 141.71(b)(3), the State must determine whether the watershed control program established under § 141.71(b)(2) is adequate to limit potential contamination by
Cryptosporidium
oocysts. The adequacy of the program must be based
on the comprehensiveness of the watershed review; the effectiveness of the system's program to monitor and control detrimental activities occurring in the watershed; and the extent to which the water system has maximized land ownership and/or controlled land use within the watershed.
§ 141.172
Disinfection profiling and benchmarking.
(a)
Determination of systems required to profile.
A public water system subject to the requirements of this subpart must determine its TTHM annual average using the procedure in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and its HAA5 annual average using the procedure in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The annual average is the arithmetic average of the quarterly averages of four consecutive quarters of monitoring.
(1) The TTHM annual average must be the annual average during the same period as is used for the HAA5 annual average.
(i) Those systems that collected data under the provisions of subpart M (Information Collection Rule) must use the results of the samples collected during the last four quarters of required monitoring under § 141.142.
(ii) Those systems that use “grandfathered” HAA5 occurrence data that meet the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section must use TTHM data collected at the same time under the provisions of §§ 141.12 and 141.30.
(iii) Those systems that use HAA5 occurrence data that meet the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section must use TTHM data collected at the same time under the provisions of §§ 141.12 and 141.30.
(2) The HAA5 annual average must be the annual average during the same period as is used for the TTHM annual average.
(i) Those systems that collected data under the provisions of subpart M (Information Collection Rule) must use the results of the samples collected during the last four quarters of required monitoring under § 141.142.
(ii) Those systems that have collected four quarters of HAA5 occurrence data that meets the routine monitoring sample number and location requirements for TTHM in §§ 141.12 and 141.30 and handling and analytical method requirements of § 141.142(b)(1) may use those data to determine whether the requirements of this section apply.
(iii) Those systems that have not collected four quarters of HAA5 occurrence data that meets the provisions of either paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section by March 16, 1999 must either:
(A) Conduct monitoring for HAA5 that meets the routine monitoring sample number and location requirements for TTHM in §§ 141.12 and 141.30 and handling and analytical method requirements of § 141.142(b)(1) to determine the HAA5 annual average and whether the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section apply. This monitoring must be completed so that the applicability determination can be made no later than March 31, 2000, or
(B) Comply with all other provisions of this section as if the HAA5 monitoring had been conducted and the results required compliance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(3) The system may request that the State approve a more representative annual data set than the data set determined under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section for the purpose of determining applicability of the requirements of this section.
(4) The State may require that a system use a more representative annual data set than the data set determined under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section for the purpose of determining applicability of the requirements of this section.
(5) The system must submit data to the State on the schedule in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (v) of this section.
(i) Those systems that collected TTHM and HAA5 data under the provisions of subpart M (Information Collection Rule), as required by paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(2)(i) of this section, must submit the results of the samples collected during the last 12 months of required monitoring under § 141.142 not later than December 31, 1999.
(ii) Those systems that have collected four consecutive quarters of HAA5 occurrence data that meets the routine monitoring sample number and location for TTHM in §§ 141.12 and 141.30
and handling and analytical method requirements of § 141.142(b)(1), as allowed by paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section, must submit those data to the State not later than April 16, 1999. Until the State has approved the data, the system must conduct monitoring for HAA5 using the monitoring requirements specified under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
(iii) Those systems that conduct monitoring for HAA5 using the monitoring requirements specified by paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, must submit TTHM and HAA5 data not later than March 31, 2000.
(iv) Those systems that elect to comply with all other provisions of this section as if the HAA5 monitoring had been conducted and the results required compliance with this section, as allowed under paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, must notify the State in writing of their election not later than December 31, 1999.
(v) If the system elects to request that the State approve a more representative annual data set than the data set determined under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the system must submit this request in writing not later than December 31, 1999.
(6) Any system having either a TTHM annual average ≥0.064 mg/L or an HAA5 annual average ≥0.048 mg/L during the period identified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section must comply with paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Disinfection profiling.
(1) Any system that meets the criteria in paragraph (a)(6) of this section must develop a disinfection profile of its disinfection practice for a period of up to three years.
(2) The system must monitor daily for a period of 12 consecutive calendar months to determine the total logs of inactivation for each day of operation, based on the CT99.9 values in Tables 1.1-1.6, 2.1, and 3.1 of § 141.74(b), as appropriate, through the entire treatment plant. This system must begin this monitoring not later than April 1, 2000. As a minimum, the system with a single point of disinfectant application prior to entrance to the distribution system must conduct the monitoring in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section. A system with more than one point of disinfectant application must conduct the monitoring in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section for each disinfection segment. The system must monitor the parameters necessary to determine the total inactivation ratio, using analytical methods in § 141.74(a), as follows:
(i) The temperature of the disinfected water must be measured once per day at each residual disinfectant concentration sampling point during peak hourly flow.
(ii) If the system uses chlorine, the pH of the disinfected water must be measured once per day at each chlorine residual disinfectant concentration sampling point during peak hourly flow.
(iii) The disinfectant contact time(s) (“T”) must be determined for each day during peak hourly flow.
(iv) The residual disinfectant concentration(s) (“C”) of the water before or at the first customer and prior to each additional point of disinfection must be measured each day during peak hourly flow.
(3) In lieu of the monitoring conducted under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section to develop the disinfection profile, the system may elect to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. In addition to the monitoring conducted under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section to develop the disinfection profile, the system may elect to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
(i) A PWS that has three years of existing operational data may submit those data, a profile generated using those data, and a request that the State approve use of those data in lieu of monitoring under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section not later than March 31, 2000. The State must determine whether these operational data are substantially equivalent to data collected under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. These data must also be representative of
Giardia lamblia
inactivation through the entire treatment plant and not just of certain treatment segments. Until the State approves this request, the
system is required to conduct monitoring under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(ii) In addition to the disinfection profile generated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a PWS that has existing operational data may use those data to develop a disinfection profile for additional years. Such systems may use these additional yearly disinfection profiles to develop a benchmark under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. The State must determine whether these operational data are substantially equivalent to data collected under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section. These data must also be representative of inactivation through the entire treatment plant and not just of certain treatment segments.
(4) The system must calculate the total inactivation ratio as follows:
(i) If the system uses only one point of disinfectant application, the system may determine the total inactivation ratio for the disinfection segment based on either of the methods in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) or (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section.
(A) Determine one inactivation ratio (CTcalc/CT
99.9
) before or at the first customer during peak hourly flow.
(B) Determine successive CTcalc/CT
99.9
values, representing sequential inactivation ratios, between the point of disinfectant application and a point before or at the first customer during peak hourly flow. Under this alternative, the system must calculate the total inactivation ratio by determining (CTcalc/CT
99.9
) for each sequence and then adding the (CTcalc/CT
99.9
) values together to determine (Σ (CTcalc/CT
99.9
)).
(ii) If the system uses more than one point of disinfectant application before the first customer, the system must determine the CT value of each disinfection segment immediately prior to the next point of disinfectant application, or for the final segment, before or at the first customer, during peak hourly flow. The (CTcalc/CT
99.9
) value of each segment and (Σ(CTcalc/CT
99.9
)) must be calculated using the method in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.
(iii) The system must determine the total logs of inactivation by multiplying the value calculated in paragraph (b)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section by 3.0.
(5) A system that uses either chloramines or ozone for primary disinfection must also calculate the logs of inactivation for viruses using a method approved by the State.
(6) The system must retain disinfection profile data in graphic form, as a spreadsheet, or in some other format acceptable to the State for review as part of sanitary surveys conducted by the State.
(c)
Disinfection benchmarking.
(1) Any system required to develop a disinfection profile under the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and that decides to make a significant change to its disinfection practice must consult with the State prior to making such change. Significant changes to disinfection practice are:
(i) Changes to the point of disinfection;
(ii) Changes to the disinfectant(s) used in the treatment plant;
(iii) Changes to the disinfection process; and
(iv) Any other modification identified by the State.
(2) Any system that is modifying its disinfection practice must calculate its disinfection benchmark using the procedure specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (ii) of this section.
(i) For each year of profiling data collected and calculated under paragraph (b) of this section, the system must determine the lowest average monthly
Giardia lamblia
inactivation in each year of profiling data. The system must determine the average
Giardia lamblia
inactivation for each calendar month for each year of profiling data by dividing the sum of daily
Giardia lamblia
of inactivation by the number of values calculated for that month.
(ii) The disinfection benchmark is the lowest monthly average value (for systems with one year of profiling data) or average of lowest monthly average values (for systems with more than one year of profiling data) of the monthly logs of
Giardia lamblia
inactivation in each year of profiling data.
(3) A system that uses either chloramines or ozone for primary disinfection must also calculate the disinfection benchmark for viruses using a method approved by the State.
(4) The system must submit information in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section to the State as part of its consultation process.
(i) A description of the proposed change;
(ii) The disinfection profile for
Giardia lamblia
(and, if necessary, viruses) under paragraph (b) of this section and benchmark as required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and
(iii) An analysis of how the proposed change will affect the current levels of disinfection.

§ 141.173
Filtration.
A public water system subject to the requirements of this subpart that does not meet all of the criteria in this subpart and subpart H of this part for avoiding filtration must provide treatment consisting of both disinfection, as specified in § 141.72(b), and filtration treatment which complies with the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section or § 141.73 (b) or (c) by December 31, 2001.
(a)
Conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration.
(1) For systems using conventional filtration or direct filtration, the turbidity level of representative samples of a system's filtered water must be less than or equal to 0.3 NTU in at least 95 percent of the measurements taken each month, measured as specified in § 141.74(a) and (c).
(2) The turbidity level of representative samples of a system's filtered water must at no time exceed 1 NTU, measured as specified in § 141.74(a) and (c).
(3) A system that uses lime softening may acidify representative samples prior to analysis using a protocol approved by the State.
(b)
Filtration technologies other than conventional filtration treatment, direct filtration, slow sand filtration, or diatomaceous earth filtration.
A public water system may use a filtration technology not listed in paragraph (a) of this section or in § 141.73(b) or (c) if it demonstrates to the State, using pilot plant studies or other means, that the alternative filtration technology, in combination with disinfection treatment that meets the requirements of § 141.72(b), consistently achieves 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivation of
Giardia lamblia
cysts and 99.99 percent removal and/or inactivation of viruses, and 99 percent removal of
Cryptosporidium
oocysts, and the State approves the use of the filtration technology. For each approval, the State will set turbidity performance requirements that the system must meet at least 95 percent of the time and that the system may not exceed at any time at a level that consistently achieves 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivation of
Giardia lamblia
cysts, 99.99 percent removal and/or inactivation of viruses, and 99 percent removal of
Cryptosporidium
oocysts.

§ 141.174
Filtration sampling requirements.
(a) Monitoring requirements for systems using filtration treatment. In addition to monitoring required by § 141.74, a public water system subject to the requirements of this subpart that provides conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration must conduct continuous monitoring of turbidity for each individual filter using an approved method in § 141.74(a) and must calibrate turbidimeters using the procedure specified by the manufacturer. Systems must record the results of individual filter monitoring every 15 minutes.
(b) If there is a failure in the continuous turbidity monitoring equipment, the system must conduct grab sampling every four hours in lieu of continuous monitoring, but for no more than five working days following the failure of the equipment.
§ 141.175
Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
In addition to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements in § 141.75, a public water system subject to the requirements of this subpart that provides conventional filtration treatment
or direct filtration must report monthly to the State the information specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section beginning January 1, 2002. In addition to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements in § 141.75, a public water system subject to the requirements of this subpart that provides filtration approved under § 141.173(b) must report monthly to the State the information specified in paragraph (a) of this section beginning January 1, 2002. The reporting in paragraph (a) of this section is in lieu of the reporting specified in § 141.75(b)(1).
(a) Turbidity measurements as required by § 141.173 must be reported within 10 days after the end of each month the system serves water to the public. Information that must be reported includes:
(1) The total number of filtered water turbidity measurements taken during the month.
(2) The number and percentage of filtered water turbidity measurements taken during the month which are less than or equal to the turbidity limits specified in § 141.173(a) or (b).
(3) The date and value of any turbidity measurements taken during the month which exceed 1 NTU for systems using conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration, or which exceed the maximum level set by the State under § 141.173(b).
(b) Systems must maintain the results of individual filter monitoring taken under § 141.174 for at least three years. Systems must report that they have conducted individual filter turbidity monitoring under § 141.174 within 10 days after the end of each month the system serves water to the public. Systems must report individual filter turbidity measurement results taken under § 141.174 within 10 days after the end of each month the system serves water to the public only if measurements demonstrate one or more of the conditions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. Systems that use lime softening may apply to the State for alternative exceedance levels for the levels specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section if they can demonstrate that higher turbidity levels in individual filters are due to lime carryover only and not due to degraded filter performance.
(1) For any individual filter that has a measured turbidity level of greater than 1.0 NTU in two consecutive measurements taken 15 minutes apart, the system must report the filter number, the turbidity measurement, and the date(s) on which the exceedance occurred. In addition, the system must either produce a filter profile for the filter within 7 days of the exceedance (if the system is not able to identify an obvious reason for the abnormal filter performance) and report that the profile has been produced or report the obvious reason for the exceedance.
(2) For any individual filter that has a measured turbidity level of greater than 0.5 NTU in two consecutive measurements taken 15 minutes apart at the end of the first four hours of continuous filter operation after the filter has been backwashed or otherwise taken offline, the system must report the filter number, the turbidity, and the date(s) on which the exceedance occurred. In addition, the system must either produce a filter profile for the filter within 7 days of the exceedance (if the system is not able to identify an obvious reason for the abnormal filter performance) and report that the profile has been produced or report the obvious reason for the exceedance.
(3) For any individual filter that has a measured turbidity level of greater than 1.0 NTU in two consecutive measurements taken 15 minutes apart at any time in each of three consecutive months, the system must report the filter number, the turbidity measurement, and the date(s) on which the exceedance occurred. In addition, the system must conduct a self-assessment of the filter within 14 days of the exceedance and report that the self-assessment was conducted. The self assessment must consist of at least the following components: assessment of filter performance; development of a filter profile; identification and prioritization of factors limiting filter performance; assessment of the applicability of corrections; and preparation of a filter self-assessment report.
(4) For any individual filter that has a measured turbidity level of greater
than 2.0 NTU in two consecutive measurements taken 15 minutes apart at any time in each of two consecutive months, the system must report the filter number, the turbidity measurement, and the date(s) on which the exceedance occurred. In addition, the system must arrange for the conduct of a comprehensive performance evaluation by the State or a third party approved by the State no later than 30 days following the exceedance and have the evaluation completed and submitted to the State no later than 90 days following the exceedance.
(c)
Additional reporting requirements.
(1) If at any time the turbidity exceeds 1 NTU in representative samples of filtered water in a system using conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration, the system must inform the State as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the next business day.
(2) If at any time the turbidity in representative samples of filtered water exceeds the maximum level set by the State under § 141.173(b) for filtration technologies other than conventional filtration treatment, direct filtration, slow sand filtration, or diatomaceous earth filtration, the system must inform the State as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the next business day.

# Subpart Q—Public Notification of Drinking Water Violations

# Source:
65 FR 26035, May 4, 2000, unless otherwise noted.
§ 141.201
General public notification requirements.
Public water systems in States with primacy for the public water system supervision (PWSS) program must comply with the requirements in this subpart no later than May 6, 2002 or on the date the State-adopted rule becomes effective, whichever comes first. Public water systems in jurisdictions where EPA directly implements the PWSS program must comply with the requirements in this subpart on October 31, 2000. Prior to these dates, public water systems must continue to comply with the public notice requirements in § 141.32 of this part. The term “primacy agency” is used in this subpart to refer to either EPA or the State or the Tribe in cases where EPA, the State, or the Tribe exercises primary enforcement responsibility for this subpart.
(a)
Who must give public notice?
Each owner or operator of a public water system (community water systems, non-transient non-community water systems, and transient non-community water systems) must give notice for all violations of national primary drinking water regulations (NPDWR) and for other situations, as listed in Table 1. The term “NPDWR violations” is used in this subpart to include violations of the maximum contaminant level (MCL), maximum residual disinfection level (MRDL), treatment technique (TT), monitoring requirements, and testing procedures in this part 141. Appendix A to this subpart identifies the tier assignment for each specific violation or situation requiring a public notice.
Table 1 to § 141.201—Violation Categories and Other Situations Requiring a Public Notice
(1) NPDWR violations:
(i) Failure to comply with an applicable maximum contaminant level (MCL) or maximum residual disinfectant level (MRDL).
(ii) Failure to comply with a prescribed treatment technique (TT).
(iii) Failure to perform water quality monitoring, as required by the drinking water regulations.
(iv) Failure to comply with testing procedures as prescribed by a drinking water regulation.
(2) Variance and exemptions under sections 1415 and 1416 of SDWA:
(i) Operation under a variance or an exemption.
(ii) Failure to comply with the requirements of any schedule that has been set under a variance or exemption.
(3) Special public notices:
(i) Occurrence of a waterborne disease outbreak or other waterborne emergency.
(ii) Exceedance of the nitrate MCL by non-community water systems (NCWS), where granted permission by the primacy agency under 141.11(d) of this part.
(iii) Exceedance of the secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL) for fluoride.
(iv) Availability of unregulated contaminant monitoring data.
(v) Other violations and situations determined by the primacy agency to require a public notice under this subpart, not already listed in Appendix A.
(vi) Exceedance of the lead action level.
(b)
What type of public notice is required for each violation or situation?
Public notice requirements are divided into three tiers, to take into account the seriousness of the violation or situation and of any potential adverse health effects that may be involved. The public notice requirements for each violation or situation listed in Table 1 of this section are determined by the tier to which it is assigned. Table 2 of this section provides the definition of each tier. Appendix A of this part identifies the tier assignment for each specific violation or situation.
Table 2 to § 141.201—Definition of Public Notice Tiers
(1)
Tier 1 public notice
—required for NPDWR violations and situations with significant potential to have serious adverse effects on human health as a result of short-term exposure.
(2)
Tier 2 public notice
—required for all other NPDWR violations and situations with potential to have serious adverse effects on human health.
(3)
Tier 3 public notice
—required for all other NPDWR violations and situations not included in Tier 1 and Tier 2.
(c)
Who must be notified?
(1) Each public water system must provide public notice to persons served by the water system, in accordance with this subpart. Public water systems that sell or otherwise provide drinking water to other public water systems (
i.e.
, to consecutive systems) are required to give public notice to the owner or operator of the consecutive system; the consecutive system is responsible for providing public notice to the persons it serves.
(2) If a public water system has a violation in a portion of the distribution system that is physically or hydraulically isolated from other parts of the distribution system, the primacy agency may allow the system to limit distribution of the public notice to only persons served by that portion of the system which is out of compliance. Permission by the primacy agency for limiting distribution of the notice must be granted in writing.
(3) A copy of the notice must also be sent to the primacy agency and the Administrator (as applicable) in accordance with the requirements of § 141.31(d).

(4) Violation of the MRDL for chlorine dioxide, as defined in § 141.65(a), when one or more samples taken in the distribution system the day following an exceedance of the MRDL at the entrance of the distribution system exceed the MRDL, or when the water system does not take the required samples in the distribution system, as specified in § 141.133(c)(2)(i);
(5) Violation of the turbidity MCL under § 141.13(b), where the primacy agency determines after consultation that a Tier 1 notice is required or where consultation does not take place within 24 hours after the system learns of the violation;
(6) Violation of the Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR), Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (IESWTR) or Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT1ESWTR) treatment technique requirement resulting from a single exceedance of the maximum allowable turbidity limit (as identified in appendix A), where the primacy agency determines after consultation that a Tier 1 notice is required or where consultation does not take place within 24 hours after the system learns of the violation;
(7) Occurrence of a waterborne disease outbreak, as defined in § 141.2, or other waterborne emergency (such as a failure or significant interruption in key water treatment processes, a natural disaster that disrupts the water supply or distribution system, or a chemical spill or unexpected loading of possible pathogens into the source water that significantly increases the potential for drinking water contamination);
(8) Detection of
E. coli
, enterococci, or coliphage in source water samples as specified in § 141.402(a) and § 141.402(b);
(9) Other violations or situations with significant potential to have serious adverse effects on human health as a result of short-term exposure, as determined by the primacy agency either in its regulations or on a case-by-case basis.
(10) Exceedance of the Action Level for lead as specified in § 141.80(c).
(b)
When is the Tier 1 public notice to be provided?
What additional steps are required? Public water systems must:
(1) Provide a public notice as soon as practical but no later than 24 hours after the system learns of the violation or situation requiring Tier 1 public notice;
(2) Initiate consultation with the primacy agency as soon as practical, but no later than 24 hours after the public water system learns of the violation or situation, to determine additional public notice requirements; and
(3) Comply with any additional public notification requirements (including any repeat notices or direction on the duration of the posted notices) that are established as a result of the consultation with the primacy agency. Such requirements may include the timing, form, manner, frequency, and content of repeat notices (if any) and other actions designed to reach all persons served.
(c)
What is the form and manner of the public notice?
Public water systems must provide the notice within 24 hours in a form and manner reasonably calculated to reach all persons served. The form and manner used by the public water system are to fit the specific situation, but must be designed to reach residential, transient, and non-transient users of the water system. In order to reach all persons served, water systems are to use, at a minimum, one or more of the following forms of delivery:
(1) Appropriate broadcast media (such as radio and television);
(2) Posting of the notice in conspicuous locations throughout the area served by the water system;
(3) Hand delivery of the notice to persons served by the water system; or
(4) Another delivery method approved in writing by the primacy agency.
[65 FR 26035, May 4, 2000, as amended at 67 FR 1836, Jan. 14, 2002; 71 FR 65652, Nov. 8, 2006; 78 FR 10350, Feb. 13, 2013; 86 FR 4309, Jan. 15, 2021; 89 FR 86663, Oct. 30, 2024]
§ 141.203
Tier 2 Public Notice
—Form, manner, and frequency of notice.
(a)
Which violations or situations require a Tier 2 public notice?
Table 1 of this section lists the violation categories and other situations requiring a Tier 2 public notice. Appendix A to this subpart identifies the tier assignment for each specific violation or situation.
Table 1 to § 141.203—Violation Categories and Other Situations Requiring a Tier 2 Public Notice
(1) All violations of the MCL, MRDL, and treatment technique requirements, except where a Tier 1 notice is required under § 141.202(a) or where the primacy agency determines that a Tier 1 notice is required;
(2) Violations of the monitoring and testing procedure requirements, where the primacy agency determines that a Tier 2 rather than a Tier 3 public notice is required, taking into account potential health impacts and persistence of the violation; and
(3) Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of any variance or exemption in place.
(4) Failure to take corrective action or failure to maintain at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer under § 141.403(a).
(b)
When is the Tier 2 public notice to be provided?
(1) Public water systems must provide the public notice as soon as practical, but no later than 30 days after the system learns of the violation. If the public notice is posted, the notice must remain in place for as long as the violation or situation persists, but in no case for less than seven days, even if the violation or situation is resolved. The primacy agency may, in appropriate circumstances, allow additional time for the initial notice of up to three months from the date the system learns of the violation. It is not appropriate for the primacy agency to grant an extension to the 30-day deadline for any unresolved violation or to allow across-the-board extensions by rule or policy for other violations or situations requiring a Tier 2 public notice. Extensions granted by the primacy agency must be in writing.
(2) The public water system must repeat the notice every three months as long as the violation or situation persists, unless the primacy agency determines that appropriate circumstances warrant a different repeat notice frequency. In no circumstance may the repeat notice be given less frequently than once per year. It is not appropriate for the primacy agency to allow less frequent repeat notice for an MCL or treatment technique violation under the Total Coliform Rule or subpart Y of this part or a treatment technique violation under the Surface Water Treatment Rule or Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule. It is also not appropriate for the primacy agency to allow through its rules or policies across-the-board reductions in the repeat notice frequency for other ongoing violations requiring a Tier 2 repeat notice. Primacy agency determinations allowing repeat notices to be given less frequently than once every three months must be in writing.
(3) For the turbidity violations specified in this paragraph, public water systems must consult with the primacy agency as soon as practical but no later than 24 hours after the public water system learns of the violation, to determine whether a Tier 1 public notice under § 141.202(a) is required to protect public health. When consultation does not take place within the 24-hour period, the water system must distribute a Tier 1 notice of the violation within the next 24 hours (
i.e.,
no later than 48 hours after the system learns of the violation), following the requirements under § 141.202(b) and (c). Consultation with the primacy agency is required for:
(i) Violation of the turbidity MCL under § 141.13(b); or
(ii) Violation of the SWTR, IESWTR or LT1ESWTR treatment technique requirement resulting from a single exceedance of the maximum allowable turbidity limit.
(c)
What is the form and manner of the Tier 2 public notice?
Public water systems must provide the initial public notice and any repeat notices in a form and manner that is reasonably calculated to reach persons served in the required time period. The form and manner of the public notice may vary
based on the specific situation and type of water system, but it must at a minimum meet the following requirements:
(1) Unless directed otherwise by the primacy agency in writing, community water systems must provide notice by:
(i) Mail or other direct delivery to each customer receiving a bill and to other service connections to which water is delivered by the public water system; and
(ii) Any other method reasonably calculated to reach other persons regularly served by the system, if they would not normally be reached by the notice required in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Such persons may include those who do not pay water bills or do not have service connection addresses (e.g., house renters, apartment dwellers, university students, nursing home patients, prison inmates, etc.). Other methods may include: Publication in a local newspaper; delivery of multiple copies for distribution by customers that provide their drinking water to others (e.g., apartment building owners or large private employers); posting in public places served by the system or on the Internet; or delivery to community organizations.
(2) Unless directed otherwise by the primacy agency in writing, non-community water systems must provide notice by:
(i) Posting the notice in conspicuous locations throughout the distribution system frequented by persons served by the system, or by mail or direct delivery to each customer and service connection (where known); and
(ii) Any other method reasonably calculated to reach other persons served by the system if they would not normally be reached by the notice required in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Such persons may include those served who may not see a posted notice because the posted notice is not in a location they routinely pass by. Other methods may include: Publication in a local newspaper or newsletter distributed to customers; use of E-mail to notify employees or students; or, delivery of multiple copies in central locations (e.g., community centers).
[65 FR 26035, May 4, 2000, as amended at 67 FR 1836, Jan. 14, 2002; 71 FR 65652, Nov. 8, 2006; 78 FR 10350, Feb. 13, 2013]

(1) Public water systems must provide the public notice not later than one year after the public water system learns of the violation or situation or begins operating under a variance or exemption. Following the initial notice, the public water system must repeat the notice annually for as long as the violation, variance, exemption, or other situation persists. If the public notice is posted, the notice must remain in place for as long as the violation, variance, exemption, or other situation persists, but in no case less than
seven days (even if the violation or situation is resolved).
(2) Instead of individual Tier 3 public notices, a public water system may use an annual report detailing all violations and situations that occurred during the previous twelve months, as long as the timing requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are met.
(c)
What is the form and manner of the Tier 3 public notice?
Public water systems must provide the initial notice and any repeat notices in a form and manner that is reasonably calculated to reach persons served in the required time period.

(ii) Any other method reasonably calculated to reach other persons regularly served by the system, if they would not normally be reached by the notice required in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. Such persons may include those who do not pay water bills or do not have service connection addresses (e.g., house renters, apartment dwellers, university students, nursing home patients, prison inmates, etc.). Other methods may include: Publication in a local newspaper; delivery of multiple copies for distribution by customers that provide their drinking water to others (e.g., apartment building owners or large private employers); posting in public places or on the Internet; or delivery to community organizations.
(2) Unless directed otherwise by the primacy agency in writing, non-community water systems must provide notice by:
(i) Posting the notice in conspicuous locations throughout the distribution system frequented by persons served by the system, or by mail or direct delivery to each customer and service connection (where known); and
(ii) Any other method reasonably calculated to reach other persons served by the system, if they would not normally be reached by the notice required in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Such persons may include those who may not see a posted notice because the notice is not in a location they routinely pass by. Other methods may include: Publication in a local newspaper or newsletter distributed to customers; use of E-mail to notify employees or students; or, delivery of multiple copies in central locations (e.g., community centers).
(d)
In what situations may the Consumer Confidence Report be used to meet the Tier 3 public notice requirements?
For community water systems, the Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) required under Subpart O of this part may be used as a vehicle for the initial Tier 3 public notice and all required repeat notices, as long as:
(1) The CCR is provided to persons served no later than 12 months after the system learns of the violation or situation as required under § 141.204(b);
(2) The Tier 3 notice contained in the CCR follows the content requirements under § 141.205; and
(3) The CCR is distributed following the delivery requirements under § 141.204(c).
[65 FR 26035, May 4, 2000; 65 FR 38629, June 21, 2000, as amended at 78 FR 10350, Feb. 13, 2013]

§ 141.208
Special notice for exceedance of the SMCL for fluoride.
(a)
When is the special notice to be given?
Community water systems that exceed the fluoride secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL) of 2 mg/l as specified in § 143.3 (determined by the last single sample taken in accordance with § 141.23), but do not exceed the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 4 mg/l for fluoride (as specified in § 141.62), must provide the public notice in paragraph (c) of this section to persons served. Public notice must be provided as soon as practical but no later than 12 months from the day the water system learns of the exceedance. A copy of the notice must also be sent to all new billing units and new customers at the time service begins and to the State public health officer. The public water system must repeat the notice at least annually for as long as the SMCL is exceeded. If the public notice is posted, the notice must remain in place for as long as the SMCL is exceeded, but in no case less than seven days (even if the exceedance is eliminated). On a case-by-case basis, the primacy agency may require an initial notice sooner than 12 months and repeat notices more frequently than annually.
(b)
What is the form and manner of the special notice?
The form and manner of the public notice (including repeat notices) must follow the requirements for a Tier 3 public notice in § 141.204(c) and (d)(1) and (d)(3).
(c)
What mandatory language must be contained in the special notice?
The notice must contain the following language, including the language necessary to fill in the blanks:
This is an alert about your drinking water and a cosmetic dental problem that might affect children under nine years of age. At low levels, fluoride can help prevent cavities, but children drinking water containing more than 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) of fluoride may develop cosmetic discoloration of their permanent teeth (dental fluorosis). The drinking water provided by your community water system [
name
] has a fluoride concentration of [
insert value
] mg/l.
Dental fluorosis, in its moderate or severe forms, may result in a brown staining and/or pitting of the permanent teeth. This problem occurs only in developing teeth, before they erupt from the gums. Children under nine should be provided with alternative sources
of drinking water or water that has been treated to remove the fluoride to avoid the possibility of staining and pitting of their permanent teeth. You may also want to contact your dentist about proper use by young children of fluoride-containing products. Older children and adults may safely drink the water.
Drinking water containing more than 4 mg/L of fluoride (the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's drinking water standard) can increase your risk of developing bone disease. Your drinking water does not contain more than 4 mg/l of fluoride, but we're required to notify you when we discover that the fluoride levels in your drinking water exceed 2 mg/l because of this cosmetic dental problem.
For more information, please call [name of water system contact] of [name of community water system] at [phone number].

Cryptosporidium
and for failure to determine bin classification or mean
Cryptosporidium
level.
(a)
When is the special notice for repeated failure to monitor to be given?
The owner or operator of a community or non-community water system that is required to monitor source water under § 141.701 must notify persons served by the water system that monitoring has not been completed as specified no later than 30 days after the system has failed to collect any 3 months of monitoring as specified in § 141.701(c). The notice must be repeated as specified in § 141.203(b).
(b)
When is the special notice for failure to determine bin classification or mean Cryptosporidium level to be given?
The owner or operator of a community or non-community water system that is required to determine a bin classification under § 141.710, or to determine mean
Cryptosporidium
level under § 141.712, must notify persons served by the water system that the determination has not been made as required no later than 30 days after the system has failed report the determination as specified in § 141.710(e) or § 141.712(a), respectively. The notice must be repeated as specified in § 141.203(b). The notice is not required if the system is complying with a State-approved schedule to address the violation.
(c)
What is the form and manner of the special notice?
The form and manner of the public notice must follow the requirements for a Tier 2 public notice prescribed in § 141.203(c). The public notice must be presented as required in § 141.205(c).
(d)
What mandatory language must be contained in the special notice?
The notice must contain the following language, including the language necessary to fill in the blanks.
(1) The special notice for repeated failure to conduct monitoring must contain the following language:
We are required to monitor the source of your drinking water for
Cryptosporidium.
Results of the monitoring are to be used to determine whether water treatment at the (treatment plant name) is sufficient to adequately remove
Cryptosporidium
from your drinking water. We are required to complete this monitoring and make this determination by (required bin determination date). We “did not monitor or test” or “did not complete all monitoring or testing” on schedule and, therefore, we may not be able to determine by the required date what treatment modifications, if any, must be made to ensure adequate
Cryptosporidium
removal. Missing this deadline may, in turn, jeopardize our ability to have the required treatment modifications, if any, completed by the deadline required, (date).
For more information, please call (name of water system contact) of (name of water system) at (phone number).
(2) The special notice for failure to determine bin classification or mean
Cryptosporidium
level must contain the following language:
We are required to monitor the source of your drinking water for
Cryptosporidium
in order to determine by (date) whether water treatment at the (treatment plant name) is sufficient to adequately remove
Cryptosporidium
from your drinking water. We have not made this determination by the required date. Our failure to do this may jeopardize our ability to have the required treatment modifications, if any, completed by the required deadline of (date). For more information, please call (name of water system contact) of (name of water system) at (phone number).
(3) Each special notice must also include a description of what the system is doing to correct the violation and when the system expects to return to compliance or resolve the situation.

1. Violations and other situations not listed in this table (e.g., failure to prepare Consumer Confidence Reports), do not require notice, unless otherwise determined by the primacy agency. Primacy agencies may, at their option, also require a more stringent public notice tier (e.g., Tier 1 instead of Tier 2 or Tier 2 instead of Tier 3) for specific violations and situations listed in this Appendix, as authorized under § 141.202(a) and § 141.203(a).
2. MCL—Maximum contaminant level, MRDL—Maximum residual disinfectant level, TT—Treatment technique
3. The term Violations of National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR) is used here to include violations of MCL, MRDL, treatment technique, monitoring, and testing procedure requirements.
4. Failure to test for fecal coliform or E. coli is a Tier 1 violation if testing is not done after any repeat sample tests positive for coliform. All other total coliform monitoring and testing procedure violations are Tier 3.
5. Systems that violate the turbidity MCL of 5 NTU based on an average of measurements over two consecutive days must consult with the primacy agency within 24 hours after learning of the violation. Based on this consultation, the primacy agency may subsequently decide to elevate the violation to Tier 1. If a system is unable to make contact with the primacy agency in the 24-hour period, the violation is automatically elevated to Tier 1.
6. Systems with treatment technique violations involving a single exceedance of a maximum turbidity limit under the Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR), the Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (IESWTR), or the Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT1ESWTR) are required to consult with the primacy agency within 24 hours after learning of the violation. Based on this consultation, the primacy agency may subsequently decide to elevate the violation to Tier 1. If a system is unable to make contact with the primacy agency in the 24-hour period, the violation is automatically elevated to Tier 1.

69477) (§§ 141.170-141.171, 141.173-141.174) become effective January 1, 2002 for Subpart H systems (surface water systems and ground water systems under the direct influence of surface water) serving at least 10,000 persons. However, § 141.172 has some requirements that become effective as early as April 16, 1999. The Surface Water Treatment Rule remains in effect for systems serving at least 10,000 persons even after 2002; the Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule adds additional requirements and does not in many cases supersede the SWTR.
8. The arsenic MCL citations are effective January 23, 2006. Until then, the citations are § 141.11(b) and § 141.23(n).
9. The uranium MCL Tier 2 violation citations are effective December 8, 2003 for all community water systems.
10. The uranium Tier 3 violation citations are effective December 8, 2000 for all community water systems.
11. The arsenic Tier 3 violation MCL citations are effective January 23, 2006. Until then, the citations are § 141.23(a), (l).
12. Failure to take a confirmation sample within 24 hours for nitrate or nitrite after an initial sample exceeds the MCL is a Tier 1 violation. Other monitoring violations for nitrate are Tier 3.
13. Subpart H community and non-transient non-community systems serving ≥10,000 must comply with new DBP MCLs, disinfectant MRDLs, and related monitoring requirements beginning January 1, 2002. All other community and non-transient non-community systems must meet the MCLs and MRDLs beginning January 1, 2004. Subpart H transient non-community systems serving 10,000 or more persons and using chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant or oxidant must comply with the chlorine dioxide MRDL beginning January 1, 2002. Subpart H transient non-community systems serving fewer than 10,000 persons and using only ground water not under the direct influence of surface water and using chlorine dioxide as a disinfectant or oxidant must comply with the chlorine dioxide MRDL beginning January 1, 2004.
14. §§ 141.64(b)(1) 141.132(a)-(b) apply until §§ 141.620-141.630 take effect under the schedule in § 141.620(c).
15. Failure to monitor for chlorine dioxide at the entrance to the distribution system the day after exceeding the MRDL at the entrance to the distribution system is a Tier 2 violation.
16. If any daily sample taken at the entrance to the distribution system exceeds the MRDL for chlorine dioxide and one or more samples taken in the distribution system the next day exceed the MRDL, Tier 1 notification is required. Failure to take the required samples in the distribution system after the MRDL is exceeded at the entry point also triggers Tier 1 notification.
17. Some water systems must monitor for certain unregulated contaminants listed in § 141.40.
18. This citation refers to §§ 1415 and 1416 of the Safe Drinking Water Act. §§ 1415 and 1416 require that “a schedule prescribed. . . for a public water system granted a variance [or exemption] shall require compliance by the system. . .”
19. In addition to §§ 1415 and 1416 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, 40 CFR 142.307 specifies the items and schedule milestones that must be included in a variance for small systems.
20. Other waterborne emergencies require a Tier 1 public notice under § 141.202(a) for situations that do not meet the definition of a waterborne disease outbreak given in 40 CFR 141.2 but that still have the potential to have serious adverse effects on health as a result of short-term exposure. These could include outbreaks not related to treatment deficiencies, as well as situations that have the potential to cause outbreaks, such as failures or significant interruption in water treatment processes, natural disasters that disrupt the water supply or distribution system, chemical spills, or unexpected loading of possible pathogens into the source water.
21. Primacy agencies may place other situations in any tier they believe appropriate, based on threat to public health.
22. Failure to collect three or more samples for
Cryptosporidium
analysis is a Tier 2 violation requiring special notice as specified in § 141.211. All other monitoring and testing procedure violations are Tier 3.
23. Systems that violate the Hazard Index MCL and one or more individual MCLs based on the same contaminants may issue one notification to satisfy the public notification requirements for multiple violations pursuant to § 141.203.

8. There are various regulations that set turbidity standards for different types of systems, including 40 CFR 141.13, the 1989 Surface Water Treatment Rule (SWTR), the 1998 Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (IESWTR) and the 2002 Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT1ESWTR). For systems subject to the IESWTR (systems serving at least 10,000 people, using surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface water), that use conventional filtration or direct filtration, after January 1, 2002, the turbidity level of a system's combined filter effluent may not exceed 0.3 NTU in at least 95 percent of monthly measurements, and the turbidity level of a system's combined filter effluent must not exceed 1 NTU at any time. Systems subject to the IESWTR using technologies other than conventional, direct, slow sand, or diatomaceous earth filtration must meet turbidity limits set by the primacy agency. For systems subject to the LT1ESWTR (systems serving fewer than 10,000 people, using surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface water) that use conventional filtration or direct filtration, after January 1, 2005, the turbidity level of a system's combined filter effluent may not exceed 0.3 NTU in at least 95 percent of monthly measurements, and the turbidity level of a system's combined filter effluent must not exceed 1 NTU at any time. Systems subject to the LT1ESWTR using technologies other than conventional, direct, slow sand, or diatomaceous earth filtration must meet turbidity limits set by the primacy agency.
9. The bacteria detected by heterotrophic plate count (HPC) are not necessarily harmful. HPC is simply an alternative method of determining disinfectant residual levels. The number of such bacteria is an indicator of whether there is enough disinfectant in the distribution system.

(3) Treatment technique requirements, described in § 141.403, that apply to ground water systems that have fecally contaminated source waters, as determined by source water monitoring conducted under § 141.402, or that have significant deficiencies that are identified by the State or that are identified by EPA under SDWA section 1445. A ground water system with fecally contaminated source water or with significant deficiencies subject to the treatment technique requirements of this subpart must implement one or more of the following corrective action options: correct all significant deficiencies; provide an alternate source of water; eliminate the source of contamination; or provide treatment that reliably achieves at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer.
(4) Ground water systems that provide at least 4-log treatment of viruses (using inactivation, removal, or a State-approved combination of 4-log virus inactivation and removal) before or at the first customer are required to conduct compliance monitoring to demonstrate treatment effectiveness, as described in § 141.403(b).
(5) If requested by the State, ground water systems must provide the State with any existing information that will enable the State to perform a hydrogeologic sensitivity assessment. For the purposes of this subpart, “hydrogeologic sensitivity assessment” is a determination of whether ground water systems obtain water from hydrogeologically sensitive settings.
(d)
Compliance date.
Ground water systems must comply, unless otherwise noted, with the requirements of this subpart beginning December 1, 2009.
§ 141.401
Sanitary surveys for ground water systems.
(a) Ground water systems must provide the State, at the State's request, any existing information that will enable the State to conduct a sanitary survey.
(b) For the purposes of this subpart, a “sanitary survey,” as conducted by the State, includes but is not limited to, an onsite review of the water source(s) (identifying sources of contamination by using results of source water assessments or other relevant information where available), facilities, equipment, operation, maintenance, and monitoring compliance of a public water system to evaluate the adequacy of the system, its sources and operations and the distribution of safe drinking water.
(c) The sanitary survey must include an evaluation of the applicable components listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (8) of this section:
(1) Source,
(2) Treatment including corrosion control treatment and water quality parameters as applicable;
(3) Distribution system,
(4) Finished water storage,
(5) Pumps, pump facilities, and controls,
(6) Monitoring, reporting, and data verification,

(ii) If approved by the State, systems with more than one ground water source may meet the requirements of this paragraph (a)(2) by sampling a representative ground water source or sources. If directed by the State, systems must submit for State approval a triggered source water monitoring plan that identifies one or more ground water sources that are representative of each monitoring site in the system's sample siting plan under § 141.21(a) until March 31, 2016, or under § 141.853 beginning April 1, 2016, and that the system intends to use for representative sampling under this paragraph.
(iii) Until March 31, 2016, a ground water system serving 1,000 or fewer people may use a repeat sample collected from a ground water source to meet both the requirements of § 141.21(b) and to satisfy the monitoring requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section for that ground water source only if the State approves the use of
E. coli
as a fecal indicator for source water monitoring under this paragraph (a). If the repeat sample collected from the ground water source is
E. coli
-positive, the system must comply with paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(iv) Beginning April 1, 2016, a ground water system serving 1,000 or fewer people may use a repeat sample collected from a ground water source to meet both the requirements of subpart Y and to satisfy the monitoring requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section for that ground water source only if the State approves the use of
E. coli
as a fecal indicator for source water monitoring under this paragraph (a) and approves the use of a single sample for meeting both the triggered source water monitoring requirements in this paragraph (a) and the repeat monitoring requirements in § 141.858. If the repeat sample collected from the ground water source is
E. coli
- positive, the system must comply with paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(3)
Additional requirements.
If the State does not require corrective action under § 141.403(a)(2) for a fecal indicator-positive source water sample collected under paragraph (a)(2) of this section that is not invalidated under paragraph (d) of this section, the system must collect five additional source water samples from the same source within 24 hours of being notified of the fecal indicator-positive sample.
(4)
Consecutive and wholesale systems.

(1) A ground water system may obtain State invalidation of a fecal indicator-positive ground water source sample collected under paragraph (a) of this section only under the conditions specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) The system provides the State with written notice from the laboratory that improper sample analysis occurred; or
(ii) The State determines and documents in writing that there is substantial evidence that a fecal indicator-positive ground water source sample is not related to source water quality.
(2) If the State invalidates a fecal indicator-positive ground water source sample, the ground water system must collect another source water sample under paragraph (a) of this section within 24 hours of being notified by the State of its invalidation decision and have it analyzed for the same fecal indicator using the analytical methods in paragraph (c) of this section. The State may extend the 24-hour time limit on a case-by-case basis if the system cannot collect the source water sample within 24 hours due to circumstances beyond its control. In the case of an extension, the State must specify how much time the system has to collect the sample.
(e)
Sampling location.
(1) Any ground water source sample required under paragraph (a) of this section must be collected at a location prior to any treatment of the ground water source unless the State approves a sampling location after treatment.
(2) If the system's configuration does not allow for sampling at the well itself, the system may collect a sample at a State-approved location to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of
this section if the sample is representative of the water quality of that well.
(f)
New sources.
If directed by the State, a ground water system that places a new ground water source into service after November 30, 2009, must conduct assessment source water monitoring under paragraph (b) of this section. If directed by the State, the system must begin monitoring before the ground water source is used to provide water to the public.
(g)
Public notification.
A ground water system with a ground water source sample collected under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section that is fecal indicator-positive and that is not invalidated under paragraph (d) of this section, including consecutive systems served by the ground water source, must conduct public notification under § 141.202.
(h)
Monitoring violations.
Failure to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)-(f) of this section is a monitoring violation and requires the ground water system to provide public notification under § 141.204.

# Source:
67 FR 1839, Jan. 14, 2002, unless otherwise noted.

# General Requirements
§ 141.500
General requirements.
The requirements of this subpart constitute national primary drinking water regulations. These regulations establish requirements for filtration and disinfection that are in addition to criteria under which filtration and disinfection are required under subpart H of this part. The regulations in this subpart establish or extend treatment technique requirements in lieu of maximum contaminant levels for the following contaminants:
Giardia lamblia,
viruses, heterotrophic plate count bacteria,
Legionella, Cryptosporidium
and turbidity. The treatment technique requirements consist of installing and properly operating water treatment processes which reliably achieve:
(a) At least 99 percent (2 log) removal of
Cryptosporidium
between a point where the raw water is not subject to
recontamination by surface water runoff and a point downstream before or at the first customer for filtered systems, or
Cryptosporidium
control under the watershed control plan for unfiltered systems; and
(b) Compliance with the profiling and benchmark requirements in §§ 141.530 through 141.544.
§ 141.501
Who is subject to the requirements of subpart T?
You are subject to these requirements if your system:
(a) Is a public water system;
(b) Uses surface water or GWUDI as a source; and
(c) Serves fewer than 10,000 persons.
§ 141.502
When must my system comply with these requirements?
You must comply with these requirements in this subpart beginning January 1, 2005, except where otherwise noted.
[69 FR 38856, June 29, 2004]
§ 141.503
What does subpart T require?
There are seven requirements of this subpart, and you must comply with all requirements that are applicable to your system. These requirements are:
(a) You must cover any finished water reservoir that you began to construct on or after March 15, 2002 as described in §§ 141.510 and 141.511;
(b) If your system is an unfiltered system, you must comply with the updated watershed control requirements described in §§ 141.520-141.522;
(c) If your system is a community or non-transient non-community water systems you must develop a disinfection profile as described in §§ 141.530-141.536;
(d) If your system is considering making a significant change to its disinfection practices, you must develop a disinfection benchmark and consult with the State for approval of the change as described in §§ 141.540-141.544;
(e) If your system is a filtered system, you must comply with the combined filter effluent requirements as described in §§ 141.550-141.553;
(f) If your system is a filtered system that uses conventional or direct filtration, you must comply with the individual filter turbidity requirements as described in §§ 141.560-141.564; and
(g) You must comply with the applicable reporting and recordkeeping requirements as described in §§ 141.570 and 141.571.

# Finished Water Reservoirs
§ 141.510
Is my system subject to the new finished water reservoir requirements?
All subpart H systems which serve fewer than 10,000 are subject to this requirement.
§ 141.511
What is required of new finished water reservoirs?
If your system begins construction of a finished water reservoir on or after March 15, 2002 the reservoir must be covered. Finished water reservoirs for which your system began construction prior to March 15, 2002 are not subject to this requirement.

# Additional Watershed Control Requirements for Unfiltered Systems
§ 141.520
Is my system subject to the updated watershed control requirements?
If you are a subpart H system serving fewer than 10,000 persons which does not provide filtration, you must continue to comply with all of the filtration avoidance criteria in § 141.71, as well as the additional watershed control requirements in § 141.521.
§ 141.521
What updated watershed control requirements must my unfiltered system implement to continue to avoid filtration?
Your system must take any additional steps necessary to minimize the potential for contamination by
Cryptosporidium
oocysts in the source water. Your system's watershed control program must, for
Cryptosporidium
:
(a) Identify watershed characteristics and activities which may have an adverse effect on source water quality; and
(b) Monitor the occurrence of activities which may have an adverse effect on source water quality.
§ 141.522
How does the State determine whether my system's watershed control requirements are adequate?
During an onsite inspection conducted under the provisions of § 141.71(b)(3), the State must determine whether your watershed control program is adequate to limit potential contamination by
Cryptosporidium
oocysts. The adequacy of the program must be based on the comprehensiveness of the watershed review; the effectiveness of your program to monitor and control detrimental activities occurring in the watershed; and the extent to which your system has maximized land ownership and/or controlled land use within the watershed.

# Disinfection Profile
§ 141.530
What is a disinfection profile and who must develop one?
A disinfection profile is a graphical representation of your system's level of
Giardia lamblia
or virus inactivation measured during the course of a year. If you are a subpart H community or non-transient non-community water system which serves fewer than 10,000 persons, your system must develop a disinfection profile unless your State determines that your system's profile is unnecessary. Your State may approve the use of a more representative data set for disinfection profiling than the data set required under §§ 141.532-141.536.
[67 FR 1839, Jan. 14, 2002, as amended at 69 FR 38856, June 29, 2004]
§ 141.531
What criteria must a State use to determine that a profile is unnecessary?
States may only determine that a system's profile is unnecessary if a system's TTHM and HAA5 levels are below 0.064 mg/L and 0.048 mg/L, respectively. To determine these levels, TTHM and HAA5 samples must be collected after January 1, 1998, during the month with the warmest water temperature, and at the point of maximum residence time in your distribution system. Your State may approve a more representative TTHM and HAA5 data set to determine these levels.
[67 FR 1839, Jan. 14, 2002, as amended at 69 FR 38856, June 29, 2004]
§ 141.532
How does my system develop a disinfection profile and when must it begin?
A disinfection profile consists of three steps:
(a) First, your system must collect data for several parameters from the plant as discussed in § 141.533 over the course of 12 months. If your system serves between 500 and 9,999 persons you must begin to collect data no later than July 1, 2003. If your system serves fewer than 500 persons you must begin to collect data no later than January 1, 2004.
(b) Second, your system must use this data to calculate weekly log inactivation as discussed in §§ 141.534 and 141.535; and
(c) Third, your system must use these weekly log inactivations to develop a disinfection profile as specified in § 141.536.
§ 141.533
What data must my system collect to calculate a disinfection profile?
Your system must monitor the following parameters to determine the total log inactivation using the analytical methods in § 141.74 (a), once per week on the same calendar day, over 12 consecutive months:
(a) The temperature of the disinfected water at each residual disinfectant concentration sampling point during peak hourly flow;
(b) If your system uses chlorine, the pH of the disinfected water at each residual disinfectant concentration sampling point during peak hourly flow;
(c) The disinfectant contact time(s) (“T”) during peak hourly flow; and
(d) The residual disinfectant concentration(s) (“C”) of the water before or at the first customer and prior to each additional point of disinfection during peak hourly flow.
§ 141.534
How does my system use this data to calculate an inactivation ratio?
Use the tables in § 141.74(b)(3)(v) to determine the appropriate CT99.9 value. Calculate the total inactivation ratio as follows, and multiply the value by 3.0 to determine log inactivation of
Giardia lamblia:
If your system * * *
Your system must determine * * *
(a) Uses only one point of disinfectant application
(1) One inactivation ratio (CTcalc/CT
99.9
) before or at the first customer during peak hourly flow
or
(2) Successive CTcalc/CT
99.9
values, representing sequential inactivation ratios, between the point of disinfectant application and a point before or at the first customer during peak hourly flow. Under this alternative, your system must calculate the total inactivation ratio by determining (CTcalc/CT
99.9
) for each sequence and then adding the (CTcalc/CT
99.9
) values together to determine (ΣCTcalc/CT
99.9
).
(b) Uses more than one point of disinfectant application before the first customer
The (CTcalc/CT
99.9
) value of each disinfection segment immediately prior to the next point of disinfectant application, or for the final segment, before or at the first customer, during peak hourly flow using the procedure specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
[67 FR 1839, Jan. 14, 2002, as amended at 69 FR 38856, June 29, 2004]
§ 141.535
What if my system uses chloramines, ozone, or chlorine dioxide for primary disinfection?
If your system uses chloramines, ozone, or chlorine dioxide for primary disinfection, you must also calculate the logs of inactivation for viruses and develop an additional disinfection profile for viruses using methods approved by the State.
§ 141.536
My system has developed an inactivation ratio; what must we do now?
Each log inactivation serves as a data point in your disinfection profile. Your system will have obtained 52 measurements (one for every week of the year). This will allow your system and the State the opportunity to evaluate how microbial inactivation varied over the course of the year by looking at all 52 measurements (your Disinfection Profile). Your system must retain the Disinfection Profile data in graphic form, such as a spreadsheet, which must be available for review by the State as part of a sanitary survey. Your system must use this data to calculate a benchmark if you are considering changes to disinfection practices.

# Disinfection Benchmark
§ 141.540
Who has to develop a disinfection benchmark?
If you are a subpart H system required to develop a disinfection profile under §§ 141.530 through 141.536, your system must develop a Disinfection Benchmark if you decide to make a significant change to your disinfection practice. Your system must consult with the State for approval before you can implement a significant disinfection practice change.
§ 141.541
What are significant changes to disinfection practice?
Significant changes to disinfection practice include:
(a) Changes to the point of disinfection;
(b) Changes to the disinfectant(s) used in the treatment plant;
(c) Changes to the disinfection process; or
(d) Any other modification identified by the State.
§ 141.542
What must my system do if we are considering a significant change to disinfection practices?
If your system is considering a significant change to its disinfection practice, your system must calculate a disinfection benchmark(s) as described in §§ 141.543 and 141.544 and provide the benchmark(s) to your State. Your system may only make a significant disinfection practice change after consulting with the State for approval. Your system must submit the following information to the State as part of the consultation and approval process:
(a) A description of the proposed change;
(b) The disinfection profile for
Giardia lamblia
(and, if necessary, viruses) and disinfection benchmark;
(c) An analysis of how the proposed change will affect the current levels of disinfection; and
(d) Any additional information requested by the State.
§ 141.543
How is the disinfection benchmark calculated?
If your system is making a significant change to its disinfection practice, it must calculate a disinfection benchmark using the procedure specified in the following table.
To calculate a disinfection benchmark your system must perform the following steps
Step 1: Using the data your system collected to develop the Disinfection Profile, determine the average
Giardia lamblia
inactivation for each calendar month by dividing the sum of all
Giardia lamblia
inactivations for that month by the number of values calculated for that month.
Step 2: Determine the lowest monthly average value out of the twelve values. This value becomes the disinfection benchmark.
§ 141.544
What if my system uses chloramines, ozone, or chlorine dioxide for primary disinfection?
If your system uses chloramines, ozone or chlorine dioxide for primary disinfection your system must calculate the disinfection benchmark from the data your system collected for viruses to develop the disinfection profile in addition to the
Giardia lamblia
disinfection benchmark calculated under § 141.543. This viral benchmark must be calculated in the same manner used to calculate the
Giardia lamblia
disinfection benchmark in § 141.543.

# Combined Filter Effluent Requirements
§ 141.550
Is my system required to meet subpart T combined filter effluent turbidity limits?
All subpart H systems which serve populations fewer than 10,000, are required to filter, and utilize filtration other than slow sand filtration or diatomaceous earth filtration must meet the combined filter effluent turbidity requirements of §§ 141.551-141.553. If your system uses slow sand or diatomaceous earth filtration you are not required to meet the combined filter effluent turbidity limits of subpart T, but you must continue to meet the combined filter effluent turbidity limits in § 141.73.
§ 141.551
What strengthened combined filter effluent turbidity limits must my system meet?
Your system must meet two strengthened combined filter effluent turbidity limits.
(a) The first combined filter effluent turbidity limit is a “95th percentile” turbidity limit that your system must meet in at least 95 percent of the turbidity measurements taken each month. Measurements must continue to be taken as described in § 141.74(a) and (c). Monthly reporting must be completed according to § 141.570. The following table describes the required limits for specific filtration technologies.
If your system consists of * * *
Your 95th percentile turbidity value is * * *
(1) Conventional Filtration or Direct Filtration
0.3 NTU.
(2) All other “Alternative” Filtration
A value determined by the State (not to exceed 1 NTU) based on the demonstration described in § 141.552.
(b) The second combined filter effluent turbidity limit is a “maximum” turbidity limit which your system may at no time exceed during the month. Measurements must continue to be taken as described in § 141.74(a) and (c). Monthly reporting must be completed according to § 141.570. The following table describes the required limits for specific filtration technologies.
If your system consists of * * *
Your maximum turbidity value is * * *
(1) Conventional Filtration or Direct Filtration
1 NTU.
(2) All other “Alternative Filtration”
A value determined by the State (not to exceed 5 NTU) based on the demonstration as described in § 141.552.
[67 FR 1839, Jan. 14, 2002, as amended at 69 FR 38856, June 29, 2004]
§ 141.552
My system consists of “alternative filtration” and is required to conduct a demonstration—what is required of my system and how does the State establish my turbidity limits?
(a) If your system consists of alternative filtration(filtration other than slow sand filtration, diatomaceous earth filtration, conventional filtration, or direct filtration) you are required to conduct a demonstration (see tables in § 141.551). Your system must demonstrate to the State, using pilot plant studies or other means, that your system's filtration, in combination with disinfection treatment, consistently achieves:
(1) 99 percent removal of
Cryptosporidium
oocysts;
(2) 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivation of
Giardia lamblia
cysts; and
(3) 99.99 percent removal and/or inactivation of viruses.
(b) [Reserved]
§ 141.553
My system practices lime softening—is there any special provision regarding my combined filter effluent?
If your system practices lime softening, you may acidify representative combined filter effluent turbidity samples prior to analysis using a protocol approved by the State.

# Individual Filter Turbidity Requirements
§ 141.560
Is my system subject to individual filter turbidity requirements?
If your system is a subpart H system serving fewer than 10,000 people and utilizing conventional filtration or direct filtration, you must conduct continuous monitoring of turbidity for each individual filter at your system. The following requirements apply to continuous turbidity monitoring:
(a) Monitoring must be conducted using an approved method in § 141.74(a);
(b) Calibration of turbidimeters must be conducted using procedures specified by the manufacturer;
(c) Results of turbidity monitoring must be recorded at least every 15 minutes;
(d) Monthly reporting must be completed according to § 141.570; and
(e) Records must be maintained according to § 141.571.
§ 141.561
What happens if my system's turbidity monitoring equipment fails?
If there is a failure in the continuous turbidity monitoring equipment, your system must conduct grab sampling every four hours in lieu of continuous monitoring until the turbidimeter is back on-line. Your system has 14 days to resume continuous monitoring before a violation is incurred.
§ 141.562
My system only has two or fewer filters—is there any special provision regarding individual filter turbidity monitoring?
Yes, if your system only consists of two or fewer filters, you may conduct continuous monitoring of combined filter effluent turbidity in lieu of individual filter effluent turbidity monitoring. Continuous monitoring must meet the same requirements set forth in § 141.560(a) through (d) and § 141.561.
§ 141.563
What follow-up action is my system required to take based on continuous turbidity monitoring?
Follow-up action is required according to the following tables:
If * * *
Your system must * * *
(a) The turbidity of an individual filter (or the turbidity of combined filter effluent (CFE) for systems with 2 filters that monitor CFE in lieu of individual filters) exceeds 1.0 NTU in two consecutive recordings 15 minutes apart
Report to the State by the 10th of the following month and include the filter number(s), corresponding date(s), turbidity value(s) which exceeded 1.0 NTU, and the cause (if known) for the exceedance(s).
If a system was required to report to the State * * *
Your system must * * *
(b) For three months in a row and turbidity exceeded 1.0 NTU in two consecutive recordings 15 minutes apart at the same filter (or CFE for systems with 2 filters that monitor CFE in lieu of individual filters)
Conduct a self-assessment of the filter(s) within 14 days of the day the filter exceeded 1.0 NTU in two consecutive measurements for the third straight month unless a CPE as specified in paragraph (c) of this section was required. Systems with 2 filters that monitor CFE in lieu of individual filters must conduct a self assessment on both filters. The self-assessment must consist of at least the following components: assessment of filter performance; development of a filter profile; identification and prioritization of factors limiting filter performance; assessment of the applicability of corrections; and preparation of a filter self-assessment report.
(c) For two months in a row and turbidity exceeded 2.0 NTU in 2 consecutive recordings 15 minutes apart at the same filter (or CFE for systems with 2 filters that monitor CFE in lieu of individual filters)
Arrange to have a comprehensive performance evaluation (CPE) conducted by the State or a third party approved by the State not later than 60 days following the day the filter exceeded 2.0 NTU in two consecutive measurements for the second straight month. If a CPE has been completed by the State or a third party approved by the State within the 12 prior months or the system and State are jointly participating in an ongoing Comprehensive Technical Assistance (CTA) project at the system, a new CPE is not required. If conducted, a CPE must be completed and submitted to the State no later than 120 days following the day the filter exceeded 2.0 NTU in two consecutive measurements for the second straight month.
[67 FR 1839, Jan. 14, 2002, as amended at 69 FR 38856, June 29, 2004]
§ 141.564
My system practices lime softening—is there any special provision regarding my individual filter turbidity monitoring?
If your system utilizes lime softening, you may apply to the State for alternative turbidity exceedance levels for the levels specified in the table in § 141.563. You must be able to demonstrate to the State that higher turbidity levels are due to lime carryover only, and not due to degraded filter performance.

Systems on quarterly monitoring must take dual sample sets every 90 days at each monitoring location, except for subpart H systems serving 500-3,300. Ground water systems serving 500-9,999 on annual monitoring must take dual sample sets at each monitoring location. All other systems on annual monitoring and subpart H systems serving 500-3,300 are required to take individual TTHM and HAA5 samples (instead of a dual sample set) at the locations with the highest TTHM and HAA5 concentrations, respectively. For systems serving fewer than 500 people, only one location with a dual sample set per monitoring period is needed if the highest TTHM and HAA5 concentrations occur at the same location and month.
(c) You must recommend subpart V compliance monitoring locations based on standard monitoring results, system specific study results, and subpart L compliance monitoring results. You must follow the protocol in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(8) of this section. If required to monitor at more than eight locations, you must repeat the protocol as necessary. If you do not have existing subpart L compliance monitoring results or if you do not have enough existing subpart L compliance monitoring results, you must repeat the protocol, skipping the provisions of paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(7) of this section as necessary, until you have identified the required total number of monitoring locations.
(1) Location with the highest TTHM LRAA not previously selected as a subpart V monitoring location.
(2) Location with the highest HAA5 LRAA not previously selected as a subpart V monitoring location.
(3) Existing subpart L average residence time compliance monitoring location (maximum residence time compliance monitoring location for ground water systems) with the highest HAA5 LRAA not previously selected as a subpart V monitoring location.
(4) Location with the highest TTHM LRAA not previously selected as a subpart V monitoring location.
(5) Location with the highest TTHM LRAA not previously selected as a subpart V monitoring location.
(6) Location with the highest HAA5 LRAA not previously selected as a subpart V monitoring location.
(7) Existing subpart L average residence time compliance monitoring location (maximum residence time compliance monitoring location for ground water systems) with the highest TTHM LRAA not previously selected as a subpart V monitoring location.
(8) Location with the highest HAA5 LRAA not previously selected as a subpart V monitoring location.
(d) You may recommend locations other than those specified in paragraph
(c) of this section if you include a rationale for selecting other locations. If the State approves the alternate locations, you must monitor at these locations to determine compliance under subpart V of this part.
(e) Your recommended schedule must include subpart V monitoring during the peak historical month for TTHM and HAA5 concentration, unless the State approves another month. Once you have identified the peak historical month, and if you are required to conduct routine monitoring at least quarterly, you must schedule subpart V compliance monitoring at a regular frequency of every 90 days or fewer.

71 FR 488, Jan. 4, 2006, unless otherwise noted.
§ 141.620
General requirements.
(a)
General.
The requirements of subpart V of this part constitute national primary drinking water regulations. The regulations in this subpart establish monitoring and other requirements for achieving compliance with maximum contaminant levels based on locational running annual averages (LRAA) for total trihalomethanes (TTHM) and haloacetic acids (five)(HAA5), and for achieving compliance with maximum residual disinfectant residuals for chlorine and chloramine for certain consecutive systems.
(b)
Applicability.
You are subject to these requirements if your system is a community water system or a nontransient noncommunity water system that uses a primary or residual disinfectant other than ultraviolet light or delivers water that has been treated with a primary or residual disinfectant other than ultraviolet light.
(c)
Schedule.
You must comply with the requirements in this subpart on the schedule in the following table based on your system type.
If you are this type of system
You must comply with subpart V monitoring by:
1
Systems that are not part of a combined distribution system and systems that serve the largest population in the combined distribution system
(1) System serving ≥100,000
April 1, 2012.
(2) System serving 50,000-99,999
October 1, 2012.
(3) System serving 10,000-49,999
October 1, 2013.
(4) System serving
10,000
October 1, 2013 if no
Cryptosporidium
monitoring is required under § 141.701(a)(4) or
October 1, 2014 if
Cryptosporidium
monitoring is required under § 141.701(a)(4) or (a)(6).
Other systems that are part of a combined distribution system
(5) Consecutive system or wholesale system
—at the same time as the system with the earliest compliance date in the combined distribution system.
1
The State may grant up to an additional 24 months for compliance with MCLs and operational evaluation levels if you require capital improvements to comply with an MCL.
(6) Your monitoring frequency is specified in § 141.621(a)(2).
(i) If you are required to conduct quarterly monitoring, you must begin monitoring in the first full calendar quarter that includes the compliance date in the table in this paragraph (c).
(ii) If you are required to conduct monitoring at a frequency that is less than quarterly, you must begin monitoring in the calendar month recommended in the IDSE report prepared under § 141.601 or § 141.602 or the calendar month identified in the subpart V monitoring plan developed under § 141.622 no later than 12 months after the compliance date in this table.
(7) If you are required to conduct quarterly monitoring, you must make compliance calculations at the end of the fourth calendar quarter that follows the compliance date and at the end of each subsequent quarter (or earlier if the LRAA calculated based on fewer than four quarters of data would
cause the MCL to be exceeded regardless of the monitoring results of subsequent quarters). If you are required to conduct monitoring at a frequency that is less than quarterly, you must make compliance calculations beginning with the first compliance sample taken after the compliance date.
(8) For the purpose of the schedule in this paragraph (c), the State may determine that the combined distribution system does not include certain consecutive systems based on factors such as receiving water from a wholesale system only on an emergency basis or receiving only a small percentage and small volume of water from a wholesale system. The State may also determine that the combined distribution system does not include certain wholesale systems based on factors such as delivering water to a consecutive system only on an emergency basis or delivering only a small percentage and small volume of water to a consecutive system.
(d)
Monitoring and compliance
—(1)
Systems required to monitor quarterly.
To comply with subpart V MCLs in § 141.64(b)(2), you must calculate LRAAs for TTHM and HAA5 using monitoring results collected under this subpart and determine that each LRAA does not exceed the MCL. If you fail to complete four consecutive quarters of monitoring, you must calculate compliance with the MCL based on the average of the available data from the most recent four quarters. If you take more than one sample per quarter at a monitoring location, you must average all samples taken in the quarter at that location to determine a quarterly average to be used in the LRAA calculation.
(2)
Systems required to monitor yearly or less frequently.
To determine compliance with subpart V MCLs in § 141.64(b)(2), you must determine that each sample taken is less than the MCL. If any sample exceeds the MCL, you must comply with the requirements of § 141.625. If no sample exceeds the MCL, the sample result for each monitoring location is considered the LRAA for that monitoring location.
(e)
Violation.
You are in violation of the monitoring requirements for each quarter that a monitoring result would be used in calculating an LRAA if you fail to monitor.
[71 FR 488, Jan. 4, 2006; 71 FR 4645, Jan. 27, 2006]
§ 141.621
Routine monitoring.
(a)
Monitoring.
(1) If you submitted an IDSE report, you must begin monitoring at the locations and months you have recommended in your IDSE report submitted under § 141.605 following the schedule in § 141.620(c), unless the State requires other locations or additional locations after its review. If you submitted a 40/30 certification under § 141.603 or you qualified for a very small system waiver under § 141.604 or you are a nontransient noncommunity water system serving
10,000, you must monitor at the location(s) and dates identified in your monitoring plan in § 141.132(f), updated as required by § 141.622.
(2) You must monitor at no fewer than the number of locations identified in this paragraph (a)(2).

Systems on quarterly monitoring must take dual sample sets every 90 days at each monitoring location, except for subpart H systems serving 500-3,300. Ground water systems serving 500-9,999 on annual monitoring must take dual sample sets at each monitoring location. All other systems on annual monitoring and subpart H systems serving 500-3,300 are required to take individual TTHM and HAA5 samples (instead of a dual sample set) at the locations with the highest TTHM and HAA5 concentrations, respectively. For systems serving fewer than 500 people, only one location with a dual sample set per monitoring period is needed if the highest TTHM and HAA5 concentrations occur at the same location and month.
(3) If you are an undisinfected system that begins using a disinfectant other than UV light after the dates in subpart U of this part for complying with the Initial Distribution System Evaluation requirements, you must consult with the State to identify compliance monitoring locations for this subpart. You must then develop a monitoring plan under § 141.622 that includes those monitoring locations.
(b)
Analytical methods.
You must use an approved method listed in § 141.131 for TTHM and HAA5 analyses in this subpart. Analyses must be conducted by laboratories that have received certification by EPA or the State as specified in § 141.131.
[71 FR 488, Jan. 4, 2006, as amended at 74 FR 30958, June 29, 2009]
§ 141.622
Subpart V monitoring plan.
(a)(1) You must develop and implement a monitoring plan to be kept on file for State and public review. The monitoring plan must contain the elements in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) of this section and be complete no later than the date you conduct your initial monitoring under this subpart.
(i) Monitoring locations;
(ii) Monitoring dates;
(iii) Compliance calculation procedures; and
(iv) Monitoring plans for any other systems in the combined distribution system if the State has reduced monitoring requirements under the State authority in § 142.16(m).
(2) If you were not required to submit an IDSE report under either § 141.601 or § 141.602, and you do not have sufficient subpart L monitoring locations to identify the required number of subpart V compliance monitoring locations indicated in § 141.605(b), you must identify additional locations by alternating selection of locations representing high TTHM levels and high HAA5 levels until the required number of compliance monitoring locations have been identified. You must also provide the rationale for identifying the locations as having high levels of TTHM or HAA5. If you have more subpart L monitoring locations than required for subpart V compliance monitoring in § 141.605(b), you must identify which locations you will use for subpart V compliance monitoring by alternating selection of locations representing high TTHM levels and high HAA5 levels until the required number of subpart V compliance monitoring locations have been identified.
(b) If you are a subpart H system serving
3,300 people, you must submit a copy of your monitoring plan to the State prior to the date you conduct your initial monitoring under this subpart, unless your IDSE report submitted under subpart U of this part contains all the information required by this section.
(c) You may revise your monitoring plan to reflect changes in treatment, distribution system operations and layout (including new service areas), or other factors that may affect TTHM or HAA5 formation, or for State-approved reasons, after consultation with the State regarding the need for changes and the appropriateness of changes. If you change monitoring locations, you must replace existing compliance monitoring locations with the lowest LRAA with new locations that reflect the current distribution system locations with expected high TTHM or HAA5 levels. The State may also require modifications in your monitoring plan. If you are a subpart H system
serving
3,300 people, you must submit a copy of your modified monitoring plan to the State prior to the date you are required to comply with the revised monitoring plan.
§ 141.623
Reduced monitoring.
(a) You may reduce monitoring to the level specified in the table in this paragraph (a) any time the LRAA is ≤0.040 mg/L for TTHM and ≤0.030 mg/L for HAA5 at all monitoring locations. You may only use data collected under the provisions of this subpart or subpart L of this part to qualify for reduced monitoring. In addition, the source water annual average TOC level, before any treatment, must be ≤4.0 mg/L at each treatment plant treating surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface water, based on monitoring conducted under either § 141.132(b)(1)(iii) or § 141.132(d).

Systems on quarterly monitoring must take dual sample sets every 90 days.
(b) You may remain on reduced monitoring as long as the TTHM LRAA ≤0.040 mg/L and the HAA5 LRAA ≤0.030 mg/L at each monitoring location (for systems with quarterly reduced monitoring) or each TTHM sample ≤0.060 mg/L and each HAA5 sample ≤0.045 mg/L (for systems with annual or less frequent monitoring). In addition, the source water annual average TOC level, before any treatment, must be ≤4.0 mg/L at each treatment plant treating surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface water, based on monitoring conducted under either § 141.132(b)(1)(iii) or § 141.132(d).
(c) If the LRAA based on quarterly monitoring at any monitoring location exceeds either 0.040 mg/L for TTHM or 0.030 mg/L for HAA5 or if the annual (or less frequent) sample at any location exceeds either 0.060 mg/L for TTHM or 0.045 mg/L for HAA5, or if the source water annual average TOC level, before any treatment,
4.0 mg/L at any treatment plant treating surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface water, you must resume routine monitoring under § 141.621 or begin increased monitoring if § 141.625 applies.
(d) The State may return your system to routine monitoring at the State's discretion.
§ 141.624
Additional requirements for consecutive systems.
If you are a consecutive system that does not add a disinfectant but delivers water that has been treated with a primary or residual disinfectant other than ultraviolet light, you must comply with analytical and monitoring requirements for chlorine and chloramines in §§ 141.131 (c) and 141.132(c)(1) and the compliance requirements in § 141.133(c)(1) beginning April 1, 2009, unless required earlier by the State, and report monitoring results under § 141.134(c).
§ 141.625
Conditions requiring increased monitoring.
(a) If you are required to monitor at a particular location annually or less frequently than annually under § 141.621 or § 141.623, you must increase monitoring to dual sample sets once per quarter (taken every 90 days) at all locations if a TTHM sample is
0.080 mg/L or a HAA5 sample is
0.060 mg/L at any location.
(b) You are in violation of the MCL when the LRAA exceeds the subpart V MCLs in § 141.64(b)(2), calculated based on four consecutive quarters of monitoring (or the LRAA calculated based on fewer than four quarters of data if the MCL would be exceeded regardless of the monitoring results of subsequent quarters). You are in violation of the monitoring requirements for each quarter that a monitoring result would be used in calculating an LRAA if you fail to monitor.
(c) You may return to routine monitoring once you have conducted increased monitoring for at least four consecutive quarters and the LRAA for every monitoring location is ≤0.060 mg/L for TTHM and ≤0.045 mg/L for HAA5.
§ 141.626
Operational evaluation levels.
(a) You have exceeded the operational evaluation level at any monitoring location where the sum of the two previous quarters' TTHM results plus twice the current quarter's TTHM result, divided by 4 to determine an average, exceeds 0.080 mg/L, or where the sum of the two previous quarters' HAA5 results plus twice the current quarter's HAA5 result, divided by 4 to determine an average, exceeds 0.060 mg/L.
(b)(1) If you exceed the operational evaluation level, you must conduct an operational evaluation and submit a written report of the evaluation to the State no later than 90 days after being notified of the analytical result that
causes you to exceed the operational evaluation level. The written report must be made available to the public upon request.
(2) Your operational evaluation must include an examination of system treatment and distribution operational practices, including storage tank operations, excess storage capacity, distribution system flushing, changes in sources or source water quality, and treatment changes or problems that may contribute to TTHM and HAA5 formation and what steps could be considered to minimize future exceedances.
(i) You may request and the State may allow you to limit the scope of your evaluation if you are able to identify the cause of the operational evaluation level exceedance.
(ii) Your request to limit the scope of the evaluation does not extend the schedule in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for submitting the written report. The State must approve this limited scope of evaluation in writing and you must keep that approval with the completed report.
§ 141.627
Requirements for remaining on reduced TTHM and HAA5 monitoring based on subpart L results.
You may remain on reduced monitoring after the dates identified in § 141.620(c) for compliance with this subpart only if you qualify for a 40/30 certification under § 141.603 or have received a very small system waiver under § 141.604, plus you meet the reduced monitoring criteria in § 141.623(a), and you do not change or add monitoring locations from those used for compliance monitoring under subpart L of this part. If your monitoring locations under this subpart differ from your monitoring locations under subpart L of this part, you may not remain on reduced monitoring after the dates identified in § 141.620(c) for compliance with this subpart.
§ 141.628
Requirements for remaining on increased TTHM and HAA5 monitoring based on subpart L results.
If you were on increased monitoring under § 141.132(b)(1), you must remain on increased monitoring until you qualify for a return to routine monitoring under § 141.625(c). You must conduct increased monitoring under § 141.625 at the monitoring locations in the monitoring plan developed under § 141.622 beginning at the date identified in § 141.620(c) for compliance with this subpart and remain on increased monitoring until you qualify for a return to routine monitoring under § 141.625(c).

(iv) Whether, based on § 141.64(b)(2) and this subpart, the MCL was violated at any monitoring location.
(v) Any operational evaluation levels that were exceeded during the quarter and, if so, the location and date, and the calculated TTHM and HAA5 levels.
(2) If you are a subpart H system seeking to qualify for or remain on reduced TTHM/HAA5 monitoring, you must report the following source water TOC information for each treatment plant that treats surface water or
ground water under the direct influence of surface water to the State within 10 days of the end of any quarter in which monitoring is required:
(i) The number of source water TOC samples taken each month during last quarter.
(ii) The date and result of each sample taken during last quarter.
(iii) The quarterly average of monthly samples taken during last quarter or the result of the quarterly sample.
(iv) The running annual average (RAA) of quarterly averages from the past four quarters.
(v) Whether the RAA exceeded 4.0 mg/L.
(3) The State may choose to perform calculations and determine whether the MCL was exceeded or the system is eligible for reduced monitoring in lieu of having the system report that information

concentration of greater than 0.01 oocysts/L in § 141.712.
(3) If a system chooses to provide the level of treatment in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable, rather than start source water monitoring, the system must notify the State in writing no later than the date the system is otherwise required to submit a sampling schedule for monitoring under § 141.702. Alternatively, a system may choose to stop sampling at any point after it has initiated monitoring if it notifies the State in writing that it will provide this level of treatment. Systems must install and operate technologies to provide this level of treatment by the applicable treatment compliance date in § 141.713.
(e)
Plants operating only part of the year.
Systems with subpart H plants that operate for only part of the year must conduct source water monitoring in accordance with this subpart, but with the following modifications:
(1) Systems must sample their source water only during the months that the plant operates unless the State specifies another monitoring period based on plant operating practices.
(2) Systems with plants that operate less than six months per year and that monitor for
Cryptosporidium
must collect at least six
Cryptosporidium
samples per year during each of two years of monitoring. Samples must be evenly spaced throughout the period the plant operates.
(f)(1)
New sources.

(3) The system must begin a second round of source water monitoring no later than 6 years following initial bin classification under § 141.710 or determination of the mean
Cryptosporidium
level under § 141.712, as applicable.
(g) Failure to collect any source water sample required under this section in accordance with the sampling schedule, sampling location, analytical method, approved laboratory, and reporting requirements of §§ 141.702 through 141.706 is a monitoring violation.
(h)
Grandfathering monitoring data.
Systems may use (grandfather) monitoring data collected prior to the applicable monitoring start date in paragraph (c) of this section to meet the initial source water monitoring requirements in paragraph (a) of this section. Grandfathered data may substitute for an equivalent number of months at the end of the monitoring period. All data submitted under this paragraph must meet the requirements in § 141.707.
§ 141.702

(4) Systems must submit sampling schedules for the second round of source water monitoring § 141.701(b) to the State.
(5) If EPA or the State does not respond to a system regarding its sampling schedule, the system must sample at the reported schedule.
(b) Systems must collect samples within two days before or two days after the dates indicated in their sampling schedule (
i.e.
, within a five-day period around the schedule date) unless one of the conditions of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section applies.
(1) If an extreme condition or situation exists that may pose danger to the sample collector, or that cannot be avoided and causes the system to be unable to sample in the scheduled five-day period, the system must sample as close to the scheduled date as is feasible unless the State approves an alternative sampling date. The system must submit an explanation for the delayed sampling date to the State concurrent with the shipment of the sample to the laboratory.
(2)(i) If a system is unable to report a valid analytical result for a scheduled sampling date due to equipment failure, loss of or damage to the sample, failure to comply with the analytical method requirements, including the quality control requirements in § 141.704, or the failure of an approved laboratory to analyze the sample, then the system must collect a replacement sample.
(ii) The system must collect the replacement sample not later than 21 days after receiving information that an analytical result cannot be reported for the scheduled date unless the system demonstrates that collecting a replacement sample within this time frame is not feasible or the State approves an alternative resampling date. The system must submit an explanation for the delayed sampling date to the State concurrent with the shipment of the sample to the laboratory.
(c) Systems that fail to meet the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section for any source water sample required under § 141.701 must revise their sampling schedules to add dates for collecting all missed samples. Systems must submit the revised schedule to the State for approval prior to when the system begins collecting the missed samples.
§ 141.703
Sampling locations.
(a) Systems required to conduct source water monitoring under § 141.701 must collect samples for each plant that treats a surface water or GWUDI source. Where multiple plants draw water from the same influent, such as the same pipe or intake, the State may approve one set of monitoring results to be used to satisfy the requirements of § 141.701 for all plants.
(b)(1) Systems must collect source water samples prior to chemical treatment, such as coagulants, oxidants and disinfectants, unless the system meets the condition of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(2) The State may approve a system to collect a source water sample after chemical treatment. To grant this approval, the State must determine that collecting a sample prior to chemical treatment is not feasible for the system and that the chemical treatment is unlikely to have a significant adverse effect on the analysis of the sample.

(i) Systems may composite samples from each source into one sample prior to analysis. The volume of sample from each source must be weighted according to the proportion of the source in the total plant flow at the time the sample is collected.
(ii) Systems may analyze samples from each source separately and calculate a weighted average of the analysis results for each sampling date. The weighted average must be calculated by multiplying the analysis result for each source by the fraction the source contributed to total plant flow at the time the sample was collected and then summing these values.
(f)
Additional Requirements.
Systems must submit a description of their sampling location(s) to the State at the same time as the sampling schedule required under § 141.702. This description must address the position of the sampling location in relation to the system's water source(s) and treatment processes, including pretreatment, points of chemical treatment, and filter backwash recycle. If the State does not respond to a system regarding sampling location(s), the system must sample at the reported location(s).

Systems serving at least 10,000 people must report this information to EPA unless the State approves reporting to the State rather than EPA. Systems serving fewer than 10,000 people must report this information to the State.
(1) Systems must report that they intend to submit previously collected monitoring results for grandfathering. This report must specify the number of previously collected results the system will submit, the dates of the first and last sample, and whether a system will conduct additional source water monitoring to meet the requirements of § 141.701(a). Systems must report this information no later than the date the sampling schedule under § 141.702 is required.
(2) Systems must report previously collected monitoring results for grandfathering, along with the associated documentation listed in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section, no later than two months after the applicable date listed in § 141.701(c).
(i) For each sample result, systems must report the applicable data elements in § 141.706.
(ii) Systems must certify that the reported monitoring results include all results the system generated during the time period beginning with the first reported result and ending with the final reported result. This applies to samples that were collected from the sampling location specified for source water monitoring under this subpart, not spiked, and analyzed using the laboratory's routine process for the analytical methods listed in this section.
(iii) Systems must certify that the samples were representative of a plant's source water(s) and the source water(s) have not changed. Systems must report a description of the sampling location(s), which must address the position of the sampling location in relation to the system's water source(s) and treatment processes, including points of chemical addition and filter backwash recycle.
(iv) For
Cryptosporidium
samples, the laboratory or laboratories that analyzed the samples must provide a letter certifying that the quality control criteria specified in the methods listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section were met for each sample batch associated with the reported results. Alternatively, the laboratory may provide bench sheets and sample examination report forms for each field, matrix spike, IPR, OPR, and method blank sample associated with the reported results.
(g) If the State determines that a previously collected data set submitted for grandfathering was generated during source water conditions that were not normal for the system, such as a drought, the State may disapprove the data. Alternatively, the State may approve the previously collected data if the system reports additional source water monitoring data, as determined by the State, to ensure that the data set used under § 141.710 or § 141.712 represents average source water conditions for the system.
(h) If a system submits previously collected data that fully meet the number of samples required for initial source water monitoring under § 141.701(a) and some of the data are rejected due to not meeting the requirements of this section, systems must conduct additional monitoring to replace rejected data on a schedule the State approves. Systems are not required to begin this additional monitoring until two months after notification that data have been rejected and additional monitoring is necessary.

# Disinfection Profiling and Benchmarking Requirements
§ 141.708
Requirements when making a significant change in disinfection practice.
(a) Following the completion of initial source water monitoring under § 141.701(a), a system that plans to make a significant change to its disinfection practice, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, must develop disinfection profiles and calculate disinfection benchmarks for
Giardia lamblia
and viruses as described in § 141.709. Prior to changing the disinfection practice, the system must notify the State and must include in this notice the information in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) A completed disinfection profile and disinfection benchmark for
Giardia lamblia
and viruses as described in § 141.709.
(2) A description of the proposed change in disinfection practice.
(3) An analysis of how the proposed change will affect the current level of disinfection.
(b) Significant changes to disinfection practice are defined as follows:
(1) Changes to the point of disinfection;
(2) Changes to the disinfectant(s) used in the treatment plant;
(3) Changes to the disinfection process; or
(4) Any other modification identified by the State as a significant change to disinfection practice.
§ 141.709
Developing the disinfection profile and benchmark.
(a) Systems required to develop disinfection profiles under § 141.708 must follow the requirements of this section. Systems must monitor at least weekly for a period of 12 consecutive months to determine the total log inactivation for
Giardia lamblia
and viruses. If systems monitor more frequently, the monitoring frequency must be evenly spaced. Systems that operate for fewer than 12 months per year must monitor weekly during the period of operation. Systems must determine log inactivation for
Giardia lamblia
through the entire plant, based on CT
99.9
values in Tables 1.1 through 1.6, 2.1 and 3.1 of § 141.74(b) as applicable. Systems must determine log inactivation for viruses through the entire treatment plant based on a protocol approved by the State.
(b) Systems with a single point of disinfectant application prior to the entrance to the distribution system must conduct the monitoring in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. Systems with more than one point of disinfectant application must conduct the monitoring in paragraphs (b)(1)
through (4) of this section for each disinfection segment. Systems must monitor the parameters necessary to determine the total inactivation ratio, using analytical methods in § 141.74(a).
(1) For systems using a disinfectant other than UV, the temperature of the disinfected water must be measured at each residual disinfectant concentration sampling point during peak hourly flow or at an alternative location approved by the State.
(2) For systems using chlorine, the pH of the disinfected water must be measured at each chlorine residual disinfectant concentration sampling point during peak hourly flow or at an alternative location approved by the State.
(3) The disinfectant contact time(s) (t) must be determined during peak hourly flow.
(4) The residual disinfectant concentration(s) (C) of the water before or at the first customer and prior to each additional point of disinfectant application must be measured during peak hourly flow.
(c) In lieu of conducting new monitoring under paragraph (b) of this section, systems may elect to meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) Systems that have at least one year of existing data that are substantially equivalent to data collected under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section may use these data to develop disinfection profiles as specified in this section if the system has neither made a significant change to its treatment practice nor changed sources since the data were collected. Systems may develop disinfection profiles using up to three years of existing data.
(2) Systems may use disinfection profile(s) developed under § 141.172 or §§ 141.530 through 141.536 in lieu of developing a new profile if the system has neither made a significant change to its treatment practice nor changed sources since the profile was developed. Systems that have not developed a virus profile under § 141.172 or §§ 141.530 through 141.536 must develop a virus profile using the same monitoring data on which the
Giardia lamblia
profile is based.
(d) Systems must calculate the total inactivation ratio for
Giardia lamblia
as specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) Systems using only one point of disinfectant application may determine the total inactivation ratio for the disinfection segment based on either of the methods in paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(i) Determine one inactivation ratio (CTcalc/CT
99.9
) before or at the first customer during peak hourly flow.
(ii) Determine successive CTcalc/CT
99.9
values, representing sequential inactivation ratios, between the point of disinfectant application and a point before or at the first customer during peak hourly flow. The system must calculate the total inactivation ratio by determining (CTcalc/CT
99.9
) for each sequence and then adding the (CTcalc/CT
99.9
) values together to determine (Σ (CTcalc/CT
99.9
)).
(2) Systems using more than one point of disinfectant application before the first customer must determine the CT value of each disinfection segment immediately prior to the next point of disinfectant application, or for the final segment, before or at the first customer, during peak hourly flow. The (CTcalc/CT
99.9
) value of each segment and (Σ (CTcalc/CT
99.9
)) must be calculated using the method in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
(3) The system must determine the total logs of inactivation by multiplying the value calculated in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section by 3.0.
(4) Systems must calculate the log of inactivation for viruses using a protocol approved by the State.
(e) Systems must use the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section to calculate a disinfection benchmark.
(1) For each year of profiling data collected and calculated under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, systems must determine the lowest mean monthly level of both
Giardia lamblia
and virus inactivation. Systems must determine the mean
Giardia lamblia
and virus inactivation for each calendar month for each year of profiling data by dividing the sum of daily or weekly
Giardia lamblia
and
virus log inactivation by the number of values calculated for that month.
(2) The disinfection benchmark is the lowest monthly mean value (for systems with one year of profiling data) or the mean of the lowest monthly mean values (for systems with more than one year of profiling data) of
Giardia lamblia
and virus log inactivation in each year of profiling data.

(1) A system may conduct source water monitoring that reflects a different intake location (either in the same source or for an alternate source) or a different procedure for the timing or level of withdrawal from the source (alternative source monitoring). If the State approves, a system may determine its bin classification under § 141.710 based on the alternative source monitoring results.
(2) If systems conduct alternative source monitoring under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, systems must also monitor their current plant intake concurrently as described in § 141.701.
(3) Alternative source monitoring under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must meet the requirements for source monitoring to determine bin classification, as described in §§ 141.701 through 141.706. Systems must report the alternative source monitoring results to the State, along with supporting information documenting the operating conditions under which the samples were collected.
(4) If a system determines its bin classification under § 141.710 using alternative source monitoring results that reflect a different intake location or a different procedure for managing the timing or level of withdrawal from the source, the system must relocate the intake or permanently adopt the withdrawal procedure, as applicable, no later than the applicable treatment compliance date in § 141.713.
§ 141.717
Pre-filtration treatment toolbox components.
(a)
Presedimentation.
Systems receive 0.5-log
Cryptosporidium
treatment credit for a presedimentation basin during any month the process meets the criteria in this paragraph.
(1) The presedimentation basin must be in continuous operation and must treat the entire plant flow taken from a surface water or GWUDI source.
(2) The system must continuously add a coagulant to the presedimentation basin.
(3) The presedimentation basin must achieve the performance criteria in paragraph (3)(i) or (ii) of this section.
(i) Demonstrates at least 0.5-log mean reduction of influent turbidity. This reduction must be determined using daily turbidity measurements in the presedimentation process influent and effluent and must be calculated as follows: log
10
(monthly mean of daily influent turbidity)−log
10
(monthly mean of daily effluent turbidity).
(ii) Complies with State-approved performance criteria that demonstrate at least 0.5-log mean removal of micron-sized particulate material through the presedimentation process.
(b)
Two-stage lime softening.
Systems receive an additional 0.5-log
Cryptosporidium
treatment credit for a two-stage lime softening plant if chemical addition and hardness precipitation occur in two separate and sequential softening stages prior to filtration. Both softening stages must treat the entire plant flow taken from a surface water or GWUDI source.
(c)
Bank filtration.
Systems receive
Cryptosporidium
treatment credit for bank filtration that serves as pretreatment to a filtration plant by meeting the criteria in this paragraph. Systems using bank filtration when they begin source water monitoring under § 141.701(a) must collect samples as described in § 141.703(d) and are not eligible for this credit.
(1) Wells with a ground water flow path of at least 25 feet receive 0.5-log treatment credit; wells with a ground water flow path of at least 50 feet receive 1.0-log treatment credit. The ground water flow path must be determined as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(2) Only wells in granular aquifers are eligible for treatment credit. Granular aquifers are those comprised of sand, clay, silt, rock fragments, pebbles or larger particles, and minor cement. A system must characterize the aquifer at the well site to determine aquifer properties. Systems must extract a core from the aquifer and demonstrate that in at least 90 percent of the core length, grains less than 1.0 mm in diameter constitute at least 10 percent of the core material.
(3) Only horizontal and vertical wells are eligible for treatment credit.
(4) For vertical wells, the ground water flow path is the measured distance from the edge of the surface water body under high flow conditions (determined by the 100 year floodplain elevation boundary or by the floodway, as defined in Federal Emergency Management Agency flood hazard maps) to the well screen. For horizontal wells, the ground water flow path is the measured distance from the bed of the river under normal flow conditions to the closest horizontal well lateral screen.
(5) Systems must monitor each wellhead for turbidity at least once every four hours while the bank filtration process is in operation. If monthly average turbidity levels, based on daily maximum values in the well, exceed 1 NTU, the system must report this result to the State and conduct an assessment within 30 days to determine the cause of the high turbidity levels in the well. If the State determines that microbial removal has been compromised, the State may revoke treatment credit until the system implements corrective actions approved by the State to remediate the problem.
(6) Springs and infiltration galleries are not eligible for treatment credit
under this section, but are eligible for credit under § 141.718(c).
(7)
Bank filtration demonstration of performance.
The State may approve
Cryptosporidium
treatment credit for bank filtration based on a demonstration of performance study that meets the criteria in this paragraph. This treatment credit may be greater than 1.0-log and may be awarded to bank filtration that does not meet the criteria in paragraphs (c)(1)-(5) of this section.

Cryptosporidium
or a surrogate for
Cryptosporidium
and related hydrogeologic and water quality parameters during the full range of operating conditions.
(ii) The study must include sampling both from the production well(s) and from monitoring wells that are screened and located along the shortest flow path between the surface water source and the production well(s).
§ 141.718
Treatment performance toolbox components.
(a)
Combined filter performance.
Systems using conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration treatment receive an additional 0.5-log
Cryptosporidium
treatment credit during any month the system meets the criteria in this paragraph. Combined filter effluent (CFE) turbidity must be less than or equal to 0.15 NTU in at least 95 percent of the measurements. Turbidity must be measured as described in § 141.74(a) and (c).
(b)
Individual filter performance.
Systems using conventional filtration treatment or direct filtration treatment receive 0.5-log
Cryptosporidium
treatment credit, which can be in addition to the 0.5-log credit under paragraph (a) of this section, during any month the system meets the criteria in this paragraph. Compliance with these criteria must be based on individual filter turbidity monitoring as described in § 141.174 or § 141.560, as applicable.
(1) The filtered water turbidity for each individual filter must be less than or equal to 0.15 NTU in at least 95 percent of the measurements recorded each month.
(2) No individual filter may have a measured turbidity greater than 0.3 NTU in two consecutive measurements taken 15 minutes apart.
(3) Any system that has received treatment credit for individual filter performance and fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section during any month does not receive a treatment technique violation under § 141.711(c) if the State determines the following:
(i) The failure was due to unusual and short-term circumstances that could not reasonably be prevented through optimizing treatment plant design, operation, and maintenance.
(ii) The system has experienced no more than two such failures in any calendar year.
(c)
Demonstration of performance.
The State may approve
Cryptosporidium
treatment credit for drinking water treatment processes based on a demonstration of performance study that meets the criteria in this paragraph. This treatment credit may be greater than or less than the prescribed treatment credits in § 141.711 or §§ 141.717 through 141.720 and may be awarded to treatment processes that do not meet the criteria for the prescribed credits.
(1) Systems cannot receive the prescribed treatment credit for any toolbox box option in §§ 141.717 through 141.720 if that toolbox option is included in a demonstration of performance study for which treatment credit is awarded under this paragraph.
(2) The demonstration of performance study must follow a State-approved protocol and must demonstrate the level of
Cryptosporidium
reduction the treatment process will achieve under the full range of expected operating conditions for the system.
(3) Approval by the State must be in writing and may include monitoring and treatment performance criteria that the system must demonstrate and report on an ongoing basis to remain eligible for the treatment credit. The State may designate such criteria where necessary to verify that the conditions under which the demonstration of performance credit was approved are maintained during routine operation.
§ 141.719
Additional filtration toolbox components.
(a)
Bag and cartridge filters.
Systems receive
Cryptosporidium
treatment credit of up to 2.0-log for individual bag or cartridge filters and up to 2.5-log for bag or cartridge filters operated in series by meeting the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) through (10) of this section. To be eligible for this credit, systems must report the results of challenge testing that meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) through (9) of this section to the State. The filters must treat the entire plant flow taken from a subpart H source.
(1) The
Cryptosporidium
treatment credit awarded to bag or cartridge filters must be based on the removal efficiency demonstrated during challenge testing that is conducted according to the criteria in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(9) of this section. A factor of safety equal to 1-log for individual bag or cartridge filters and 0.5-log for bag or cartridge filters in series must be applied to challenge testing results to determine removal credit. Systems may use results from challenge testing conducted prior to January 5, 2006 if the prior testing was consistent with the criteria specified in paragraphs (a)(2) through (9) of this section.
(2) Challenge testing must be performed on full-scale bag or cartridge filters, and the associated filter housing or pressure vessel, that are identical in material and construction to the filters and housings the system will use for removal of
Cryptosporidium.
Bag or cartridge filters must be challenge tested in the same configuration that the system will use, either as individual filters or as a series configuration of filters.
(3) Challenge testing must be conducted using
Cryptosporidium
or a surrogate that is removed no more efficiently than
Cryptosporidium.
The microorganism or surrogate used during challenge testing is referred to as the challenge particulate. The concentration of the challenge particulate must be determined using a method capable of discreetly quantifying the specific microorganism or surrogate used in the test; gross measurements such as turbidity may not be used.
(4) The maximum feed water concentration that can be used during a challenge test must be based on the detection limit of the challenge particulate in the filtrate (
i.e.
, filtrate detection limit) and must be calculated using the following equation:
Maximum Feed Concentration = 1 × 10
4
× (Filtrate Detection Limit)
(5) Challenge testing must be conducted at the maximum design flow rate for the filter as specified by the manufacturer.
(6) Each filter evaluated must be tested for a duration sufficient to reach 100 percent of the terminal pressure drop, which establishes the maximum pressure drop under which the filter may be used to comply with the requirements of this subpart.
(7) Removal efficiency of a filter must be determined from the results of the challenge test and expressed in terms of log removal values using the following equation:
LRV = LOG
10
(C
f
)−LOG
10
(C
p
)
Where:
LRV = log removal value demonstrated during challenge testing; C
f
= the feed concentration measured during the challenge test; and C
p
= the filtrate concentration measured during the challenge test. In applying this equation, the same units must be used for the feed and filtrate concentrations. If the challenge particulate is not detected in the filtrate, then the term C
p
must be set equal to the detection limit.
(8) Each filter tested must be challenged with the challenge particulate during three periods over the filtration cycle: within two hours of start-up of a new filter; when the pressure drop is between 45 and 55 percent of the terminal pressure drop; and at the end of the cycle after the pressure drop has reached 100 percent of the terminal pressure drop. An LRV must be calculated for each of these challenge periods for each filter tested. The LRV for the filter (LRV
filter
) must be assigned the value of the minimum LRV observed during the three challenge periods for that filter.
(9) If fewer than 20 filters are tested, the overall removal efficiency for the filter product line must be set equal to the lowest LRV
filter
among the filters
tested. If 20 or more filters are tested, the overall removal efficiency for the filter product line must be set equal to the 10th percentile of the set of LRV
filter
values for the various filters tested. The percentile is defined by (i/(n + 1)) where i is the rank of n individual data points ordered lowest to highest. If necessary, the 10th percentile may be calculated using linear interpolation.
(10) If a previously tested filter is modified in a manner that could change the removal efficiency of the filter product line, challenge testing to demonstrate the removal efficiency of the modified filter must be conducted and submitted to the State.
(b)
Membrane filtration.
(1) Systems receive
Cryptosporidium
treatment credit for membrane filtration that meets the criteria of this paragraph. Membrane cartridge filters that meet the definition of membrane filtration in § 141.2 are eligible for this credit. The level of treatment credit a system receives is equal to the lower of the values determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) The removal efficiency demonstrated during challenge testing conducted under the conditions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(ii) The maximum removal efficiency that can be verified through direct integrity testing used with the membrane filtration process under the conditions in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(2)
Challenge testing.
The membrane used by the system must undergo challenge testing to evaluate removal efficiency, and the system must report the results of challenge testing to the State. Challenge testing must be conducted according to the criteria in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section. Systems may use data from challenge testing conducted prior to January 5, 2006 if the prior testing was consistent with the criteria in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section.
(i) Challenge testing must be conducted on either a full-scale membrane module, identical in material and construction to the membrane modules used in the system's treatment facility, or a smaller-scale membrane module, identical in material and similar in construction to the full-scale module. A module is defined as the smallest component of a membrane unit in which a specific membrane surface area is housed in a device with a filtrate outlet structure.
(ii) Challenge testing must be conducted using
Cryptosporidium
oocysts or a surrogate that is removed no more efficiently than
Cryptosporidium
oocysts. The organism or surrogate used during challenge testing is referred to as the challenge particulate. The concentration of the challenge particulate, in both the feed and filtrate water, must be determined using a method capable of discretely quantifying the specific challenge particulate used in the test; gross measurements such as turbidity may not be used.
(iii) The maximum feed water concentration that can be used during a challenge test is based on the detection limit of the challenge particulate in the filtrate and must be determined according to the following equation:
Maximum Feed Concentration = 3.16 × 10
6
× (Filtrate Detection Limit)
(iv) Challenge testing must be conducted under representative hydraulic conditions at the maximum design flux and maximum design process recovery specified by the manufacturer for the membrane module. Flux is defined as the throughput of a pressure driven membrane process expressed as flow per unit of membrane area. Recovery is defined as the volumetric percent of feed water that is converted to filtrate over the course of an operating cycle uninterrupted by events such as chemical cleaning or a solids removal process (
i.e.
, backwashing).
(v) Removal efficiency of a membrane module must be calculated from the challenge test results and expressed as a log removal value according to the following equation:
LRV = LOG
10
(C
f
) − LOG
10
(C
p
)
Where:
LRV = log removal value demonstrated during the challenge test; C
f
= the feed concentration measured during the challenge test; and C
p
= the filtrate concentration measured during the challenge test. Equivalent units must be used for the feed and filtrate concentrations.
If the challenge particulate is not detected in the filtrate, the term C
p
is set equal to the detection limit for the purpose of calculating the LRV. An LRV must be calculated for each membrane module evaluated during the challenge test.
(vi) The removal efficiency of a membrane filtration process demonstrated during challenge testing must be expressed as a log removal value (LRV
C-Test
). If fewer than 20 modules are tested, then LRV
C-Test
is equal to the lowest of the representative LRVs among the modules tested. If 20 or more modules are tested, then LRV
C-Test
is equal to the 10th percentile of the representative LRVs among the modules tested. The percentile is defined by (i/(n + 1)) where i is the rank of n individual data points ordered lowest to highest. If necessary, the 10th percentile may be calculated using linear interpolation.
(vii) The challenge test must establish a quality control release value (QCRV) for a non-destructive performance test that demonstrates the
Cryptosporidium
removal capability of the membrane filtration module. This performance test must be applied to each production membrane module used by the system that was not directly challenge tested in order to verify
Cryptosporidium
removal capability. Production modules that do not meet the established QCRV are not eligible for the treatment credit demonstrated during the challenge test.
(viii) If a previously tested membrane is modified in a manner that could change the removal efficiency of the membrane or the applicability of the non-destructive performance test and associated QCRV, additional challenge testing to demonstrate the removal efficiency of, and determine a new QCRV for, the modified membrane must be conducted and submitted to the State.
(3)
Direct integrity testing.
Systems must conduct direct integrity testing in a manner that demonstrates a removal efficiency equal to or greater than the removal credit awarded to the membrane filtration process and meets the requirements described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section. A direct integrity test is defined as a physical test applied to a membrane unit in order to identify and isolate integrity breaches (
i.e.
, one or more leaks that could result in contamination of the filtrate).
(i) The direct integrity test must be independently applied to each membrane unit in service. A membrane unit is defined as a group of membrane modules that share common valving that allows the unit to be isolated from the rest of the system for the purpose of integrity testing or other maintenance.
(ii) The direct integrity method must have a resolution of 3 micrometers or less, where resolution is defined as the size of the smallest integrity breach that contributes to a response from the direct integrity test.
(iii) The direct integrity test must have a sensitivity sufficient to verify the log treatment credit awarded to the membrane filtration process by the State, where sensitivity is defined as the maximum log removal value that can be reliably verified by a direct integrity test. Sensitivity must be determined using the approach in either paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section as applicable to the type of direct integrity test the system uses.
(A) For direct integrity tests that use an applied pressure or vacuum, the direct integrity test sensitivity must be calculated according to the following equation:
LRV
DIT
= LOG
10
(Q
p
/(VCF × Q
breach
))
Where:
LRV
DIT
= the sensitivity of the direct integrity test; Q
p
= total design filtrate flow from the membrane unit; Q
breach
= flow of water from an integrity breach associated with the smallest integrity test response that can be reliably measured, and VCF = volumetric concentration factor. The volumetric concentration factor is the ratio of the suspended solids concentration on the high pressure side of the membrane relative to that in the feed water.
(B) For direct integrity tests that use a particulate or molecular marker, the direct integrity test sensitivity must be calculated according to the following equation:
LRV
DIT
= LOG
10
(C
f
)−LOG
10
(C
p
)
Where:
LRV
DIT
= the sensitivity of the direct integrity test; C
f
= the typical feed concentration of the marker used in the test; and C
p
= the filtrate concentration of the marker from an integral membrane unit.
(iv) Systems must establish a control limit within the sensitivity limits of the direct integrity test that is indicative of an integral membrane unit capable of meeting the removal credit awarded by the State.
(v) If the result of a direct integrity test exceeds the control limit established under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the system must remove the membrane unit from service. Systems must conduct a direct integrity test to verify any repairs, and may return the membrane unit to service only if the direct integrity test is within the established control limit.
(vi) Systems must conduct direct integrity testing on each membrane unit at a frequency of not less than once each day that the membrane unit is in operation. The State may approve less frequent testing, based on demonstrated process reliability, the use of multiple barriers effective for
Cryptosporidium
, or reliable process safeguards.
(4)
Indirect integrity monitoring.
Systems must conduct continuous indirect integrity monitoring on each membrane unit according to the criteria in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (v) of this section. Indirect integrity monitoring is defined as monitoring some aspect of filtrate water quality that is indicative of the removal of particulate matter. A system that implements continuous direct integrity testing of membrane units in accordance with the criteria in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (v) of this section is not subject to the requirements for continuous indirect integrity monitoring. Systems must submit a monthly report to the State summarizing all continuous indirect integrity monitoring results triggering direct integrity testing and the corrective action that was taken in each case.
(i) Unless the State approves an alternative parameter, continuous indirect integrity monitoring must include continuous filtrate turbidity monitoring.
(ii) Continuous monitoring must be conducted at a frequency of no less than once every 15 minutes.
(iii) Continuous monitoring must be separately conducted on each membrane unit.
(iv) If indirect integrity monitoring includes turbidity and if the filtrate turbidity readings are above 0.15 NTU for a period greater than 15 minutes (
i.e.
, two consecutive 15-minute readings above 0.15 NTU), direct integrity testing must immediately be performed on the associated membrane unit as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (v) of this section.
(v) If indirect integrity monitoring includes a State-approved alternative parameter and if the alternative parameter exceeds a State-approved control limit for a period greater than 15 minutes, direct integrity testing must immediately be performed on the associated membrane units as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (v) of this section.
(c)
Second stage filtration.
Systems receive 0.5-log
Cryptosporidium
treatment credit for a separate second stage of filtration that consists of sand, dual media, GAC, or other fine grain media following granular media filtration if the State approves. To be eligible for this credit, the first stage of filtration must be preceded by a coagulation step and both filtration stages must treat the entire plant flow taken from a surface water or GWUDI source. A cap, such as GAC, on a single stage of filtration is not eligible for this credit. The State must approve the treatment credit based on an assessment of the design characteristics of the filtration process.
(d)
Slow sand filtration (as secondary filter).
Systems are eligible to receive 2.5-log
Cryptosporidium
treatment credit for a slow sand filtration process that follows a separate stage of filtration if both filtration stages treat entire plant flow taken from a surface water or GWUDI source and no disinfectant residual is present in the influent water to the slow sand filtration process. The State must approve the treatment credit based on an assessment of the design characteristics of the filtration process. This paragraph does not apply to treatment credit
awarded to slow sand filtration used as a primary filtration process.

§ 141.720
Inactivation toolbox components.
(a)
Calculation of CT values.
(1) CT is the product of the disinfectant contact time (T, in minutes) and disinfectant concentration (C, in milligrams per liter). Systems with treatment credit for chlorine dioxide or ozone under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section must calculate CT at least once each day, with both C and T measured during peak hourly flow as specified in §§ 141.74(a) through (b).
(2) Systems with several disinfection segments in sequence may calculate CT for each segment, where a disinfection segment is defined as a treatment unit process with a measurable disinfectant residual level and a liquid volume. Under this approach, systems must add the
Cryptosporidium
CT values in each segment to determine the total CT for the treatment plant.

Site-specific study.
The State may approve alternative chlorine dioxide or ozone CT values to those listed in paragraph (b) of this section on a site-specific basis. The State must base this approval on a site-specific study a system conducts that follows a State-approved protocol.
(d)
Ultraviolet light.
Systems receive
Cryptosporidium, Giardia lamblia,
and virus treatment credits for ultraviolet (UV) light reactors by achieving the corresponding UV dose values shown in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Systems must validate and monitor UV reactors as described in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section to demonstrate
that they are achieving a particular UV dose value for treatment credit.
(1)
UV dose table.
The treatment credits listed in this table are for UV light at a wavelength of 254 nm as produced by a low pressure mercury vapor lamp. To receive treatment credit for other lamp types, systems must demonstrate an equivalent germicidal dose through reactor validation testing, as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The UV dose values in this table are applicable only to post-filter applications of UV in filtered systems and to unfiltered systems.

Reactor validation testing.
Systems must use UV reactors that have undergone validation testing to determine the operating conditions under which the reactor delivers the UV dose required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section (
i.e.

(1) Health effects language to be used when public notice is initiated due to the detection of total coliforms only (not
E. coli
) in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section:
Coliform are bacteria that are naturally present in the environment and are used as an indicator that other, potentially harmful, bacteria may be present. Coliforms were found in [INSERT NUMBER OF SAMPLES DETECTED] samples collected and this is a warning of potential problems. If human pathogens are present, they can cause short-term health effects, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. They may pose a special health risk for infants, young children, some of the elderly, and people with severely compromised immune systems.
(2) Health effects language to be used when public notice is initiated due to any
E. coli
-positive routine, repeat, or follow-up sample in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section:
E. coli
are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes. Microbes in these wastes can cause short-term health effects, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. They may pose a special health risk for infants, young children, some of the elderly, and people with severely compromised immune systems.
(3) Health effects language to be used when public notice is initiated due to a failure to conduct routine monitoring or routine disinfection and flushing in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or when there is a failure to conduct repeat or follow-up sampling in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section; or in accordance with paragraph (a)(6) of this section, when the air carrier becomes aware of a non-
E. coli
-positive event that is the result of water that was boarded from a watering point not in accordance with FDA regulations (21 CFR part 1240, subpart E), or that does not meet NPDWRs applicable to transient non-community water systems, or that is otherwise determined to be unsafe due to non-compliance with the procedures specified in § 141.804(b)(6):
Because [REQUIRED MONITORING AND ANALYSIS WAS NOT CONDUCTED], [REQUIRED DISINFECTION AND FLUSHING WAS NOT CONDUCTED] [WATER WAS BOARDED FROM A WATERING POINT NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH FDA REGULATIONS (21 CR 1240 SUBPART E)], or [OTHER APPROPRIATE EXPLANATION], we cannot be sure of the quality of the drinking water at this time. However, drinking water contaminated with human pathogens can cause short-term health effects, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. They may pose a special health risk for infants, young children, some of the elderly, and people with severely compromised immune systems.
(4) Health effects language to be used when public notice is initiated due to a failure to conduct required follow-up monitoring in response to a sample result that is
E. coli
-positive in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section; or in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section, when the air carrier becomes aware of an
E. coli
-positive event that is the result of water that was boarded from a watering point not in accordance with FDA regulations (21 CFR part 1240, subpart E), or that does not meet NPDWRs applicable to transient non-community water systems, or that is otherwise determined to be unsafe due to non-compliance with the procedures specified in § 141.804(b)(6):
Because required follow-up monitoring and analysis was not conducted after the aircraft water system tested positive for
E. coli,
we cannot be sure of the quality of the drinking water at this time.
E. coli
are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes. Microbes in these wastes can cause short-term health effects, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. They may pose a special health risk for infants, young children, some of the elderly, and people with severely compromised immune systems.
OR
Water was boarded that is contaminated with
E. coli
because [WATER WAS BOARDED FROM A WATERING POINT NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH FDA REGULATIONS (21 CR 1240 SUBPART E)], or [OTHER APPROPRIATE EXPLANATION].
E. coli
are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes. Microbes in these wastes can cause short-term health effects, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. They may pose a special health risk for infants, young children, some of the elderly, and people with severely compromised immune systems.

§ 141.853
General monitoring requirements for all public water systems.
(a)
Sample siting plans.
(1) Systems must develop a written sample siting plan that identifies sampling sites and a sample collection schedule that are representative of water throughout the distribution system not later than March 31, 2016. These plans are subject to State review and revision. Systems must collect total coliform samples according to the written sample siting plan. Monitoring required by §§ 141.854 through 141.858 may take place at a customer's premise, dedicated sampling station, or other designated compliance sampling location. Routine and repeat sample sites and any sampling
points necessary to meet the requirements of subpart S must be reflected in the sampling plan.
(2) Systems must collect samples at regular time intervals throughout the month, except that systems that use only ground water and serve 4,900 or fewer people may collect all required samples on a single day if they are taken from different sites.
(3) Systems must take at least the minimum number of required samples even if the system has had an
E. coli
MCL violation or has exceeded the coliform treatment technique triggers in § 141.859(a).
(4) A system may conduct more compliance monitoring than is required by this subpart to investigate potential problems in the distribution system and use monitoring as a tool to assist in uncovering problems. A system may take more than the minimum number of required routine samples and must include the results in calculating whether the coliform treatment technique trigger in § 141.859(a)(1)(i) and (ii) has been exceeded only if the samples are taken in accordance with the existing sample siting plan and are representative of water throughout the distribution system.
(5) Systems must identify repeat monitoring locations in the sample siting plan. Unless the provisions of paragraphs (a)(5)(i) or (a)(5)(ii) of this section are met, the system must collect at least one repeat sample from the sampling tap where the original total coliform-positive sample was taken, and at least one repeat sample at a tap within five service connections upstream and at least one repeat sample at a tap within five service connections downstream of the original sampling site. If a total coliform-positive sample is at the end of the distribution system, or one service connection away from the end of the distribution system, the system must still take all required repeat samples. However, the State may allow an alternative sampling location in lieu of the requirement to collect at least one repeat sample upstream or downstream of the original sampling site. Except as provided for in paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section, systems required to conduct triggered source water monitoring under § 141.402(a) must take ground water source sample(s) in addition to repeat samples required under this subpart.
(i) Systems may propose repeat monitoring locations to the State that the system believes to be representative of a pathway for contamination of the distribution system. A system may elect to specify either alternative fixed locations or criteria for selecting repeat sampling sites on a situational basis in a standard operating procedure (SOP) in its sample siting plan. The system must design its SOP to focus the repeat samples at locations that best verify and determine the extent of potential contamination of the distribution system area based on specific situations. The State may modify the SOP or require alternative monitoring locations as needed.
(ii) Ground water systems serving 1,000 or fewer people may propose repeat sampling locations to the State that differentiate potential source water and distribution system contamination (e.g., by sampling at entry points to the distribution system). A ground water system with a single well required to conduct triggered source water monitoring may, with written State approval, take one of its repeat samples at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring under § 141.402(a) if the system demonstrates to the State's satisfaction that the sample siting plan remains representative of water quality in the distribution system. If approved by the State, the system may use that sample result to meet the monitoring requirements in both § 141.402(a) and this section.
(A) If a repeat sample taken at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring is
E. coli
-positive, the system has violated the
E. coli
MCL and must also comply with § 141.402(a)(3). If a system takes more than one repeat sample at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring, the system may reduce the number of additional source water samples required under § 141.402(a)(3) by the number of repeat samples taken at that location that were not
E. coli
-positive.
(B) If a system takes more than one repeat sample at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring under § 141.402(a), and more than one repeat sample is
E. coli
-positive, the system has violated the
E. coli
MCL and must also comply with § 141.403(a)(1).
(C) If all repeat samples taken at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring are
E. coli
-negative and a repeat sample taken at a monitoring location other than the one required for triggered source water monitoring is
E. coli
-positive, the system has violated the
E. coli
MCL, but is not required to comply with § 141.402(a)(3).
(6) States may review, revise, and approve, as appropriate, repeat sampling proposed by systems under paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section. The system must demonstrate that the sample siting plan remains representative of the water quality in the distribution system. The State may determine that monitoring at the entry point to the distribution system (especially for undisinfected ground water systems) is effective to differentiate between potential source water and distribution system problems.
(b)
Special purpose samples.
Special purpose samples, such as those taken to determine whether disinfection practices are sufficient following pipe placement, replacement, or repair, must not be used to determine whether the coliform treatment technique trigger has been exceeded. Repeat samples taken pursuant to § 141.858 are not considered special purpose samples, and must be used to determine whether the coliform treatment technique trigger has been exceeded.
(c)
Invalidation of total coliform samples.
A total coliform-positive sample invalidated under this paragraph (c) of this section does not count toward meeting the minimum monitoring requirements of this subpart.
(1) The State may invalidate a total coliform-positive sample only if the conditions of paragraph (c)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section are met.
(i) The laboratory establishes that improper sample analysis caused the total coliform-positive result.
(ii) The State, on the basis of the results of repeat samples collected as required under § 141.858(a), determines that the total coliform-positive sample resulted from a domestic or other non-distribution system plumbing problem. The State cannot invalidate a sample on the basis of repeat sample results unless all repeat sample(s) collected at the same tap as the original total coliform-positive sample are also total coliform-positive, and all repeat samples collected at a location other than the original tap are total coliform-negative (e.g., a State cannot invalidate a total coliform-positive sample on the basis of repeat samples if all the repeat samples are total coliform-negative, or if the system has only one service connection).
(iii) The State has substantial grounds to believe that a total coliform-positive result is due to a circumstance or condition that does not reflect water quality in the distribution system. In this case, the system must still collect all repeat samples required under § 141.858(a), and use them to determine whether a coliform treatment technique trigger in § 141.859 has been exceeded. To invalidate a total coliform-positive sample under this paragraph, the decision and supporting rationale must be documented in writing, and approved and signed by the supervisor of the State official who recommended the decision. The State must make this document available to EPA and the public. The written documentation must state the specific cause of the total coliform-positive sample, and what action the system has taken, or will take, to correct this problem. The State may not invalidate a total coliform-positive sample solely on the grounds that all repeat samples are total coliform-negative.
(2) A laboratory must invalidate a total coliform sample (unless total coliforms are detected) if the sample produces a turbid culture in the absence of gas production using an analytical method where gas formation is examined (e.g., the Multiple-Tube Fermentation Technique), produces a turbid culture in the absence of an acid reaction in the Presence-Absence (P-A) Coliform Test, or exhibits confluent
growth or produces colonies too numerous to count with an analytical method using a membrane filter (e.g., Membrane Filter Technique). If a laboratory invalidates a sample because of such interference, the system must collect another sample from the same location as the original sample within 24 hours of being notified of the interference problem, and have it analyzed for the presence of total coliforms. The system must continue to re-sample within 24 hours and have the samples analyzed until it obtains a valid result. The State may waive the 24-hour time limit on a case-by-case basis. Alternatively, the State may implement criteria for waiving the 24-hour sampling time limit to use in lieu of case-by-case extensions.
§ 141.854
Routine monitoring requirements for non-community water systems serving 1,000 or fewer people using only ground water.
(a)
General.
(1) The provisions of this section apply to non-community water systems using only ground water (except ground water under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in § 141.2) and serving 1,000 or fewer people.
(2) Following any total coliform-positive sample taken under the provisions of this section, systems must comply with the repeat monitoring requirements and
E. coli
analytical requirements in § 141.858.
(3) Once all monitoring required by this section and § 141.858 for a calendar month has been completed, systems must determine whether any coliform treatment technique triggers specified in § 141.859 have been exceeded. If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must complete assessments as required by § 141.859.
(4) For the purpose of determining eligibility for remaining on or qualifying for quarterly monitoring under the provisions of paragraphs (f)(4) and (g)(2), respectively, of this section for transient non-community water systems, the State may elect to not count monitoring violations under § 141.860(c)(1) of this part if the missed sample is collected no later than the end of the monitoring period following the monitoring period in which the sample was missed. The system must collect the make-up sample in a different week than the routine sample for that monitoring period and should collect the sample as soon as possible during the monitoring period. The State may not use this provision under paragraph (h) of this section. This authority does not affect the provisions of §§ 141.860(c)(1) and 141.861(a)(4) of this part.
(b)
Monitoring frequency for total coliforms.
Systems must monitor each calendar quarter that the system provides water to the public, except for seasonal systems or as provided under paragraphs (c) through (h) and (j) of this section. Seasonal systems must meet the monitoring requirements of paragraph (i) of this section.
(c)
Transition to subpart Y.
(1) Systems, including seasonal systems, must continue to monitor according to the total coliform monitoring schedules under § 141.21 that were in effect on March 31, 2016, unless any of the conditions for increased monitoring in paragraph (f) of this section are triggered on or after April 1, 2016, or unless otherwise directed by the State.
(2) Beginning April 1, 2016, the State must perform a special monitoring evaluation during each sanitary survey to review the status of the system, including the distribution system, to determine whether the system is on an appropriate monitoring schedule. After the State has performed the special monitoring evaluation during each sanitary survey, the State may modify the system's monitoring schedule, as necessary, or it may allow the system to stay on its existing monitoring schedule, consistent with the provisions of this section. The State may not allow systems to begin less frequent monitoring under the special monitoring evaluation unless the system has already met the applicable criteria for less frequent monitoring in this section. For seasonal systems on quarterly or annual monitoring, this evaluation must include review of the approved sample siting plan, which must designate the time period(s) for monitoring based on site-specific considerations (e.g., during periods of highest demand or highest vulnerability to contamination). The seasonal system
must collect compliance samples during these time periods.
(d)
Annual site visits.
Beginning no later than calendar year 2017, systems on annual monitoring, including seasonal systems, must have an initial and recurring annual site visit by the State that is equivalent to a Level 2 assessment or an annual voluntary Level 2 assessment that meets the criteria in § 141.859(b) to remain on annual monitoring. The periodic required sanitary survey may be used to meet the requirement for an annual site visit for the year in which the sanitary survey was completed.
(e)
Criteria for annual monitoring.
Beginning April 1, 2016, the State may reduce the monitoring frequency for a well-operated ground water system from quarterly routine monitoring to no less than annual monitoring, if the system demonstrates that it meets the criteria for reduced monitoring in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section, except for a system that has been on increased monitoring under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section. A system on increased monitoring under paragraph (f) of this section must meet the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section to go to quarterly monitoring and must meet the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section to go to annual monitoring.
(1) The system has a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12 months;
(2) The most recent sanitary survey shows that the system is free of sanitary defects or has corrected all identified sanitary defects, has a protected water source, and meets approved construction standards; and
(3) The State has conducted an annual site visit within the last 12 months and the system has corrected all identified sanitary defects. The system may substitute a Level 2 assessment that meets the criteria in § 141.859(b) for the State annual site visit.
(f)
Increased monitoring requirements for systems on quarterly or annual monitoring.
A system on quarterly or annual monitoring that experiences any of the events identified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(4) of this section must begin monthly monitoring the month following the event. A system on annual monitoring that experiences the event identified in paragraphs (f)(5) of this section must begin quarterly monitoring the quarter following the event. The system must continue monthly or quarterly monitoring until the requirements in paragraph (g) of this section for quarterly monitoring or paragraph (h) of this section for annual monitoring are met. A system on monthly monitoring for reasons other than those identified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(4) of this section is not considered to be on increased monitoring for the purposes of paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.
(1) The system triggers a Level 2 assessment or two Level 1 assessments under the provisions of § 141.859 in a rolling 12-month period.
(2) The system has an
E. coli
MCL violation.
(3) The system has a coliform treatment technique violation.
(4) The system has two subpart Y monitoring violations or one subpart Y monitoring violation and one Level 1 assessment under the provisions of § 141.859 in a rolling 12-month period for a system on quarterly monitoring.
(5) The system has one subpart Y monitoring violation for a system on annual monitoring.
(g)
Requirements for returning to quarterly monitoring.
The State may reduce the monitoring frequency for a system on monthly monitoring triggered under paragraph (f) of this section to quarterly monitoring if the system meets the criteria in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section.
(1) Within the last 12 months, the system must have a completed sanitary survey or a site visit by the State or a voluntary Level 2 assessment by a party approved by the State, be free of sanitary defects, and have a protected water source; and
(2) The system must have a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12 months.
(h)
Requirements for systems on increased monitoring to qualify for annual monitoring.
The State may reduce the monitoring frequency for a system on increased monitoring under paragraph (f) of this section if the system meets
the criteria in paragraph (g) of this section plus the criteria in paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section.
(1) An annual site visit by the State and correction of all identified sanitary defects. The system may substitute a voluntary Level 2 assessment by a party approved by the State for the State annual site visit in any given year.
(2) The system must have in place or adopt one or more additional enhancements to the water system barriers to contamination in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (h)(2)(v) of this section.
(i) Cross connection control, as approved by the State.
(ii) An operator certified by an appropriate State certification program or regular visits by a circuit rider certified by an appropriate State certification program.
(iii) Continuous disinfection entering the distribution system and a residual in the distribution system in accordance with criteria specified by the State.
(iv) Demonstration of maintenance of at least a 4-log removal or inactivation of viruses as provided for under § 141.403(b)(3).
(v) Other equivalent enhancements to water system barriers as approved by the State.
(i)
Seasonal systems.
(1) Beginning April 1, 2016, all seasonal systems must demonstrate completion of a State-approved start-up procedure, which may include a requirement for startup sampling prior to serving water to the public.
(2) A seasonal system must monitor every month that it is in operation unless it meets the criteria in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section to be eligible for monitoring less frequently than monthly beginning April 1, 2016, except as provided under paragraph (c) of this section.
(i) Seasonal systems monitoring less frequently than monthly must have an approved sample siting plan that designates the time period for monitoring based on site-specific considerations (e.g., during periods of highest demand or highest vulnerability to contamination). Seasonal systems must collect compliance samples during this time period.
(ii) To be eligible for quarterly monitoring, the system must meet the criteria in paragraph (g) of this section.
(iii) To be eligible for annual monitoring, the system must meet the criteria under paragraph (h) of this section.
(3) The State may exempt any seasonal system from some or all of the requirements for seasonal systems if the entire distribution system remains pressurized during the entire period that the system is not operating, except that systems that monitor less frequently than monthly must still monitor during the vulnerable period designated by the State.
(j)
Additional routine monitoring the month following a total coliform-positive sample.
Systems collecting samples on a quarterly or annual frequency must conduct additional routine monitoring the month following one or more total coliform-positive samples (with or without a Level 1 treatment technique trigger). Systems must collect at least three routine samples during the next month, except that the State may waive this requirement if the conditions of paragraph (j)(1), (2), or (3) of this section are met. Systems may either collect samples at regular time intervals throughout the month or may collect all required routine samples on a single day if samples are taken from different sites. Systems must use the results of additional routine samples in coliform treatment technique trigger calculations under § 141.859(a).
(1) The State may waive the requirement to collect three routine samples the next month in which the system provides water to the public if the State, or an agent approved by the State, performs a site visit before the end of the next month in which the system provides water to the public. Although a sanitary survey need not be performed, the site visit must be sufficiently detailed to allow the State to determine whether additional monitoring and/or any corrective action is needed. The State cannot approve an employee of the system to perform this site visit, even if the employee is an agent approved by the State to perform sanitary surveys.
(2) The State may waive the requirement to collect three routine samples
the next month in which the system provides water to the public if the State has determined why the sample was total coliform-positive and has established that the system has corrected the problem or will correct the problem before the end of the next month in which the system serves water to the public. In this case, the State must document this decision to waive the following month's additional monitoring requirement in writing, have it approved and signed by the supervisor of the State official who recommends such a decision, and make this document available to the EPA and public. The written documentation must describe the specific cause of the total coliform-positive sample and what action the system has taken and/or will take to correct this problem.
(3) The State may not waive the requirement to collect three additional routine samples the next month in which the system provides water to the public solely on the grounds that all repeat samples are total coliform-negative. If the State determines that the system has corrected the contamination problem before the system takes the set of repeat samples required in § 141.858, and all repeat samples were total coliform-negative, the State may waive the requirement for additional routine monitoring the next month.
§ 141.855
Routine monitoring requirements for community water systems serving 1,000 or fewer people using only ground water.
(a)
General.
(1) The provisions of this section apply to community water systems using only ground water (except ground water under the direct influence of surface water, as defined in § 141.2) and serving 1,000 or fewer people.
(2) Following any total coliform-positive sample taken under the provisions of this section, systems must comply with the repeat monitoring requirements and
E. coli
analytical requirements in § 141.858.
(3) Once all monitoring required by this section and § 141.858 for a calendar month has been completed, systems must determine whether any coliform treatment technique triggers specified in § 141.859 have been exceeded. If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must complete assessments as required by § 141.859.
(b)
Monitoring frequency for total coliforms.
The monitoring frequency for total coliforms is one sample/month, except as provided for under paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section.
(c)
Transition to subpart Y.
(1) All systems must continue to monitor according to the total coliform monitoring schedules under § 141.21 that were in effect on March 31, 2016, unless any of the conditions in paragraph (e) of this section are triggered on or after April 1, 2016, or unless otherwise directed by the State.
(2) Beginning April 1, 2016, the State must perform a special monitoring evaluation during each sanitary survey to review the status of the system, including the distribution system, to determine whether the system is on an appropriate monitoring schedule. After the State has performed the special monitoring evaluation during each sanitary survey, the State may modify the system's monitoring schedule, as necessary, or it may allow the system to stay on its existing monitoring schedule, consistent with the provisions of this section. The State may not allow systems to begin less frequent monitoring under the special monitoring evaluation unless the system has already met the applicable criteria for less frequent monitoring in this section.
(d)
Criteria for reduced monitoring.
(1) The State may reduce the monitoring frequency from monthly monitoring to no less than quarterly monitoring if the system is in compliance with State-certified operator provisions and demonstrates that it meets the criteria in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iii) of this section. A system that loses its certified operator must return to monthly monitoring the month following that loss.
(i) The system has a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12 months.
(ii) The most recent sanitary survey shows the system is free of sanitary defects (or has an approved plan and schedule to correct them and is in compliance with the plan and the schedule), has a protected water source and
meets approved construction standards.
(iii) The system meets at least one of the following criteria:
(A) An annual site visit by the State that is equivalent to a Level 2 assessment or an annual Level 2 assessment by a party approved by the State and correction of all identified sanitary defects (or an approved plan and schedule to correct them and is in compliance with the plan and schedule).
(B) Cross connection control, as approved by the State.
(C) Continuous disinfection entering the distribution system and a residual in the distribution system in accordance with criteria specified by the State.
(D) Demonstration of maintenance of at least a 4-log removal or inactivation of viruses as provided for under § 141.403(b)(3).
(E) Other equivalent enhancements to water system barriers as approved by the State.
(2) [Reserved]
(e)
Return to routine monthly monitoring requirements.
Systems on quarterly monitoring that experience any of the events in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(4) of this section must begin monthly monitoring the month following the event. The system must continue monthly monitoring until it meets the reduced monitoring requirements in paragraph (d) of this section.
(1) The system triggers a Level 2 assessment or two Level 1 assessments in a rolling 12-month period.
(2) The system has an
E. coli
MCL violation.
(3) The system has a coliform treatment technique violation.
(4) The system has two subpart Y monitoring violations in a rolling 12-month period.
(f)
Additional routine monitoring the month following a total coliform-positive sample.
Systems collecting samples on a quarterly frequency must conduct additional routine monitoring the month following one or more total coliform-positive samples (with or without a Level 1 treatment technique trigger). Systems must collect at least three routine samples during the next month, except that the State may waive this requirement if the conditions of paragraph (f)(1), (2), or (3) of this section are met. Systems may either collect samples at regular time intervals throughout the month or may collect all required routine samples on a single day if samples are taken from different sites. Systems must use the results of additional routine samples in coliform treatment technique trigger calculations.
(1) The State may waive the requirement to collect three routine samples the next month in which the system provides water to the public if the State, or an agent approved by the State, performs a site visit before the end of the next month in which the system provides water to the public. Although a sanitary survey need not be performed, the site visit must be sufficiently detailed to allow the State to determine whether additional monitoring and/or any corrective action is needed. The State cannot approve an employee of the system to perform this site visit, even if the employee is an agent approved by the State to perform sanitary surveys.
(2) The State may waive the requirement to collect three routine samples the next month in which the system provides water to the public if the State has determined why the sample was total coliform-positive and has established that the system has corrected the problem or will correct the problem before the end of the next month in which the system serves water to the public. In this case, the State must document this decision to waive the following month's additional monitoring requirement in writing, have it approved and signed by the supervisor of the State official who recommends such a decision, and make this document available to the EPA and the public. The written documentation must describe the specific cause of the total coliform-positive sample and what action the system has taken and/or will take to correct this problem.
(3) The State may not waive the requirement to collect three additional routine samples the next month in which the system provides water to the public solely on the grounds that all repeat samples are total coliform-negative. If the State determines that the
system has corrected the contamination problem before the system takes the set of repeat samples required in § 141.858, and all repeat samples were total coliform-negative, the State may waive the requirement for additional routine monitoring the next month.
§ 141.856
Routine monitoring requirements for subpart H public water systems serving 1,000 or fewer people.
(a)
General.
(1) The provisions of this section apply to subpart H public water systems of this part serving 1,000 or fewer people.

(c)
Unfiltered subpart H systems.
A subpart H system of this part that does not practice filtration in compliance with subparts H, P, T, and W must collect at least one total coliform sample near the first service connection each day the turbidity level of the source water, measured as specified in § 141.74(b)(2), exceeds 1 NTU. When one or more turbidity measurements in any day exceed 1 NTU, the system must collect this coliform sample within 24 hours of the first exceedance, unless the State determines that the system, for logistical reasons outside the system's control, cannot have the sample analyzed within 30 hours of collection and identifies an alternative sample collection schedule. Sample results from this coliform monitoring must be included in determining whether the coliform treatment technique trigger in § 141.859 has been exceeded.
(d)
Reduced monitoring.
Systems may not reduce monitoring, except for non-community water systems using only ground water (and not ground water under the direct influence of surface water) serving 1,000 or fewer people in some months and more than 1,000 persons in other months. In months when more than 1,000 persons are served, the systems must monitor at the frequency specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In months when 1,000 or fewer people are served, the State may reduce the monitoring frequency, in writing, to a frequency allowed under § 141.854 for a similarly situated system that always serves 1,000 or fewer people, taking into account the provisions in § 141.854(e) through (g).
§ 141.858
Repeat monitoring and
E. coli
requirements.
(a)
Repeat monitoring.
(1) If a sample taken under §§ 141.854 though 141.857 is total coliform-positive, the system must collect a set of repeat samples within 24 hours of being notified of the positive result. The system must collect no fewer than three repeat samples for each total coliform-positive sample found. The State may extend the 24-hour limit on a case-by-case basis if the system has a logistical problem in collecting the repeat samples within 24 hours that is beyond its control. Alternatively, the State may implement criteria for the system to use in lieu of case-by-case extensions. In the case of an extension, the State must specify how much time the system has to collect the repeat samples. The State cannot waive the requirement for a system to collect repeat samples in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.
(2) The system must collect all repeat samples on the same day, except that the State may allow a system with a single service connection to collect the required set of repeat samples over a three-day period or to collect a larger volume repeat sample(s) in one or more sample containers of any size, as long as the total volume collected is at least 300 ml.
(3) The system must collect an additional set of repeat samples in the manner specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section if one or more repeat samples in the current set of repeat samples is total coliform-positive. The system must collect the additional set of repeat samples within
24 hours of being notified of the positive result, unless the State extends the limit as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The system must continue to collect additional sets of repeat samples until either total coliforms are not detected in one complete set of repeat samples or the system determines that a coliform treatment technique trigger specified in § 141.859(a) has been exceeded as a result of a repeat sample being total coliform-positive and notifies the State. If a trigger identified in § 141.859 is exceeded as a result of a routine sample being total coliform-positive, systems are required to conduct only one round of repeat monitoring for each total coliform-positive routine sample.
(4) After a system collects a routine sample and before it learns the results of the analysis of that sample, if it collects another routine sample(s) from within five adjacent service connections of the initial sample, and the initial sample, after analysis, is found to contain total coliforms, then the system may count the subsequent sample(s) as a repeat sample instead of as a routine sample.
(5) Results of all routine and repeat samples taken under §§ 141.854 through 141.858 not invalidated by the State must be used to determine whether a coliform treatment technique trigger specified in § 141.859 has been exceeded.
(b)
Escherichia coli (E. coli) testing.
(1) If any routine or repeat sample is total coliform-positive, the system must analyze that total coliform-positive culture medium to determine if
E. coli
are present. If
E. coli
are present, the system must notify the State by the end of the day when the system is notified of the test result, unless the system is notified of the result after the State office is closed and the State does not have either an after-hours phone line or an alternative notification procedure, in which case the system must notify the State before the end of the next business day.
(2) The State has the discretion to allow a system, on a case-by-case basis, to forgo
E. coli
testing on a total coliform-positive sample if that system assumes that the total coliform-positive sample is
E. coli
-positive. Accordingly, the system must notify the State as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the provisions of § 141.63(c) apply.
§ 141.859
Coliform treatment technique triggers and assessment requirements for protection against potential fecal contamination.
(a)
Treatment technique triggers.
Systems must conduct assessments in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section after exceeding treatment technique triggers in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.
(1) Level 1 treatment technique triggers.
(i) For systems taking 40 or more samples per month, the system exceeds 5.0% total coliform-positive samples for the month.
(ii) For systems taking fewer than 40 samples per month, the system has two or more total coliform-positive samples in the same month.
(iii) The system fails to take every required repeat sample after any single total coliform-positive sample.
(2) Level 2 treatment technique triggers.
(i) An
E. coli
MCL violation, as specified in § 141.860(a).
(ii) A second Level 1 trigger as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, within a rolling 12-month period, unless the State has determined a likely reason that the samples that caused the first Level 1 treatment technique trigger were total coliform-positive and has established that the system has corrected the problem.
(iii) For systems with approved annual monitoring, a Level 1 trigger in two consecutive years.
(b)
Requirements for assessments.
(1) Systems must ensure that Level 1 and 2 assessments are conducted in order to identify the possible presence of sanitary defects and defects in distribution system coliform monitoring practices. Level 2 assessments must be conducted by parties approved by the State.
(2) When conducting assessments, systems must ensure that the assessor evaluates minimum elements that include review and identification of inadequacies in sample sites; sampling protocol; sample processing; atypical events that could affect distributed water quality or indicate that distributed water quality was impaired;
changes in distribution system maintenance and operation that could affect distributed water quality (including water storage); source and treatment considerations that bear on distributed water quality, where appropriate (e.g., small ground water systems); and existing water quality monitoring data. The system must conduct the assessment consistent with any State directives that tailor specific assessment elements with respect to the size and type of the system and the size, type, and characteristics of the distribution system.
(3)
Level 1 assessments.
A system must conduct a Level 1 assessment consistent with State requirements if the system exceeds one of the treatment technique triggers in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(i) The system must complete a Level 1 assessment as soon as practical after any trigger in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In the completed assessment form, the system must describe sanitary defects detected, corrective actions completed, and a proposed timetable for any corrective actions not already completed. The assessment form may also note that no sanitary defects were identified. The system must submit the completed Level 1 assessment form to the State within 30 days after the system learns that it has exceeded a trigger.
(ii) If the State reviews the completed Level 1 assessment and determines that the assessment is not sufficient (including any proposed timetable for any corrective actions not already completed), the State must consult with the system. If the State requires revisions after consultation, the system must submit a revised assessment form to the State on an agreed-upon schedule not to exceed 30 days from the date of the consultation.
(iii) Upon completion and submission of the assessment form by the system, the State must determine if the system has identified a likely cause for the Level 1 trigger and, if so, establish that the system has corrected the problem, or has included a schedule acceptable to the State for correcting the problem.
(4)
Level 2 assessments.
A system must ensure that a Level 2 assessment consistent with State requirements is conducted if the system exceeds one of the treatment technique triggers in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The system must comply with any expedited actions or additional actions required by the State in the case of an
E. coli
MCL violation.
(i) The system must ensure that a Level 2 assessment is completed by the State or by a party approved by the State as soon as practical after any trigger in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The system must submit a completed Level 2 assessment form to the State within 30 days after the system learns that it has exceeded a trigger. The assessment form must describe sanitary defects detected, corrective actions completed, and a proposed timetable for any corrective actions not already completed. The assessment form may also note that no sanitary defects were identified.
(ii) The system may conduct Level 2 assessments if the system has staff or management with the certification or qualifications specified by the State unless otherwise directed by the State.
(iii) If the State reviews the completed Level 2 assessment and determines that the assessment is not sufficient (including any proposed timetable for any corrective actions not already completed), the State must consult with the system. If the State requires revisions after consultation, the system must submit a revised assessment form to the State on an agreed-upon schedule not to exceed 30 days.
(iv) Upon completion and submission of the assessment form by the system, the State must determine if the system has identified a likely cause for the Level 2 trigger and determine whether the system has corrected the problem, or has included a schedule acceptable to the State for correcting the problem.
(c)
Corrective action.
Systems must correct sanitary defects found through either Level 1 or 2 assessments conducted under paragraph (b) of this section. For corrections not completed by the time of submission of the assessment form, the system must complete the corrective action(s) in compliance with a timetable approved by the State in consultation with the system. The
system must notify the State when each scheduled corrective action is completed.
(d)
Consultation.
At any time during the assessment or corrective action phase, either the water system or the State may request a consultation with the other party to determine the appropriate actions to be taken. The system may consult with the State on all relevant information that may impact on its ability to comply with a requirement of this subpart, including the method of accomplishment, an appropriate timeframe, and other relevant information.
§ 141.860
Violations.

Monitoring requirements.
(a)
General requirements.
(1) Systems must take all samples during normal operating conditions at all entry points to the distribution system.
(2) If the system draws water from more than one source and the sources are combined before distribution, the system must sample at an entry point to the distribution system during periods of representative operating conditions.
(3) Systems must use only data collected under the provisions of this subpart to qualify for reduced monitoring.
(4) All new systems that begin operation after, or systems that use a new source of water after April 26, 2027, must demonstrate compliance with the MCLs within a period of time specified by the State. A system must also comply with initial sampling frequencies required by the State to ensure that the system can demonstrate compliance with the MCLs. Compliance monitoring frequencies must be conducted in accordance with the requirements in this section.
(5) For purposes of this section, the trigger levels are defined as shown in the following table.

(6) Based on initial monitoring results, for each sampling point at which a regulated PFAS listed in § 141.61(c) is detected at a level greater than or
equal to the trigger level, the system must monitor quarterly for all regulated PFAS beginning April 26, 2027, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(7) For purposes of this section, each water system must ensure that all results provided by a laboratory are reported to the State and used for determining the required sampling frequencies. This includes values below the practical quantitation levels defined in § 141.903(f)(1)(iv); zero must not be used in place of reported values.
(b)
Monitoring requirements for PFAS
—(1)
Initial monitoring.
(i) Groundwater CWS and NTNCWS serving greater than 10,000 persons and all surface water CWS and NTNCWS must take four consecutive samples 2 to 4 months apart within a 12-month period (quarterly samples) for each regulated PFAS listed in § 141.61(c).
(ii) All groundwater CWS and NTNCWS serving 10,000 or fewer persons must take two samples for each regulated PFAS listed in § 141.61(c) five to seven months apart within a 12-month period.
(iii) All groundwater under the direct influence of surface water (GWUDI) CWS and NTNCWS must follow the surface water CWS and NTNCWS monitoring schedule in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(iv) All systems that use both surface water and groundwater must apply the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section depending on the source(s) of water provided at a given entry point to the distribution system (EPTDS). If the EPTDS provides surface water, the requirements for a surface water CWS/NTNCWS apply. If the EPTDS provides groundwater, the requirements for a groundwater CWS/NTNCWS apply, based on system size. If an EPTDS provides a blend of surface water and groundwater, the requirements for a surface water system apply. For systems that change the source water type at an EPTDS during the initial monitoring period (
i.e.,
one part of the year it is surface water and the remaining part of the year it is groundwater), the sampling requirements for a surface water system apply.
(v) Systems must monitor at a frequency indicated in the following table, though a State may require more frequent monitoring on a system-specific basis:
Table 2 to Paragraph
(b)(1)(v)
—Initial Monitoring Requirements
Type of system
Minimum monitoring frequency
Sample location
Groundwater CWS and NTNCWS serving greater than 10,000 persons, all surface water CWS and NTNCWS, and all GWUDI systems
Four consecutive quarters of samples per entry point to the distribution system (EPTDS) within a 12-month period, unless the exception in paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section applies. Samples must be taken two to four months apart
Sampling point for EPTDS.
Groundwater CWS and NTNCWS serving 10,000 or fewer persons
Two consecutive samples per EPTDS within a 12-month period, unless the exception in paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section applies. Samples must be taken five to seven months apart
Sampling point for EPTDS.
(vi) A State may accept data that has been previously acquired by a water system to count toward the initial monitoring requirements if the data meet the requirements of § 141.901(b)(1), samples were collected starting on or after January 1, 2019, and otherwise meet the timing requirements specified in table 2 to paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section. For the purposes of satisfying initial monitoring requirements, acceptable data may be reported to a concentration no greater than the MCLs. However, a system is only eligible for triennial monitoring at the start of the compliance monitoring period if the system demonstrates that concentrations in all samples it uses to satisfy the initial monitoring requirements are below the trigger levels as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
(vii) If systems have multiple years of data, the most recent data must be used.
(viii) For systems using previously acquired data that have fewer than the
number of samples required in a continuous 12-month period for initial monitoring as listed in table 2 to paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section: All surface water systems, GWUDI systems, and groundwater systems serving greater than 10,000 persons must collect in a calendar year one sample in each quarter that was not represented, two to four months apart from the months with available data; All groundwater systems serving 10,000 or fewer persons must collect one sample in the month that is five to seven months apart from the month in which the previous sample was taken.
(ix) In determining the most recent data to report, a system must include all results provided by a laboratory whether above or below the practical quantitation levels. These results must be used for the purposes of determining the frequency with which a system must monitor at that sampling point at the start of the compliance monitoring period.
(x) States may delete results of obvious sampling errors. If the State deletes a result because of an obvious sampling error and the system fails to collect another sample this is a monitoring violation as described in § 141.905(c).
(xi) Initial monitoring requirements, including reporting results to the State, must be completed by April 26, 2027.
(2)
Compliance monitoring.
(i) Based on initial monitoring results, at the start of the monitoring period that begins on April 26, 2027, systems may reduce monitoring at each sampling point at which all reported sample concentrations were below all trigger levels defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, unless otherwise provided for by the State. At eligible sampling points, each water system must analyze one sample for all regulated PFAS during each three-year monitoring period, at a time specified by the State, in the quarter in which the highest analytical result was detected during the most recent round of quarterly or semi-annual monitoring. If a sampling point is not eligible for triennial monitoring, then the water system must monitor quarterly at the start of the compliance monitoring period.
(ii) If, during the compliance monitoring period, a system is monitoring triennially and a PFAS listed in § 141.61(c) is detected at a level equal to or exceeding the trigger levels defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section in any sample, then the system must monitor quarterly for all regulated PFAS beginning in the next quarter at the sampling point. The triggering sample must be used as the first quarter of monitoring for the running annual average calculation.
(iii) For all source water types, a State may determine that all regulated PFAS at a sampling point are reliably and consistently below the MCL after considering, at a minimum, four consecutive quarterly samples collected during the compliance monitoring period. A sampling point that a State has determined to be reliably and consistently below the MCL is required to collect annual samples for at least the first three years after that determination is made. Annual samples must be collected in the quarter in which detected concentrations were highest during the most recent year of quarterly monitoring. If, after three consecutive years, annual samples all contain results that are below the trigger levels defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the State may allow a system to begin triennial monitoring at the sampling point. The water system must collect triennial samples in the quarter with the highest concentrations during the most recent round of quarterly sampling. If an annual sample meets or exceeds an MCL or the State determines that the result is not reliably and consistently below the MCL for all regulated PFAS, then the system must monitor quarterly for all regulated PFAS beginning in the next quarter at the sampling point.
(iv) The three different compliance monitoring sampling schedules that may be assigned and the criteria for each are summarized in the following table:
Table 3 to paragraph
(b)(2)(iv)
—Compliance Monitoring Schedules and Requirements
Sampling
frequency
Eligibility requirements
1
Sample timing requirements
Triennial
At an individual sampling point, either:
(1) All initial monitoring results demonstrate concentrations of all regulated PFAS below trigger levels;
(2) The most recent three consecutive annual monitoring results all demonstrated concentrations of all regulated PFAS below trigger levels; or
(3) The previous triennial sample demonstrated all regulated PFAS concentrations below trigger levels
Note:
After beginning compliance monitoring, a system may not transition directly from quarterly monitoring to triennial monitoring.
Sample must be collected at a time within the three-year period designated by the State, in the quarter that yielded the highest analytical result during the most recent round of quarterly sampling (or the most recent semi-annual sampling, if no quarterly sampling has occurred)
Annual
A State makes a determination that all regulated PFAS concentrations at the sampling point are reliably and consistently below PFAS MCLs, after considering, at a minimum, 4 consecutive quarterly samples collected during the compliance monitoring period
Sample must be collected at a time designated by the State, within the quarter that yielded the highest analytical result during the most recent round of quarterly sampling.
Quarterly
At an individual sampling point, either:
(1) Any regulated PFAS concentration meets or exceeds a trigger level during initial monitoring;
(2) Sampling is occurring quarterly during compliance monitoring and a State has not made a determination that all levels of regulated PFAS at the sampling point are reliably and consistently below the regulated PFAS MCLs; or
(3) A sample collected by a system required to conduct triennial monitoring contains regulated PFAS concentrations that meet or exceed trigger levels. The first of these samples meeting or exceeding the trigger level is considered the first quarterly sample
(4) A sample collected by a system required to conduct annual monitoring contains regulated PFAS concentrations that meet or exceed an MCL. The first of these samples meeting or exceeding the MCL is considered the first quarterly sample
Samples must be collected in four consecutive quarters, on dates designated by the State.
1
The monitoring frequency at a sampling point must be the same for all regulated PFAS and is determined based on the most frequent sampling required for any regulated PFAS detected at a level at or exceeding the trigger level.
(v) The State may require a confirmation sample for any sampling result. If a confirmation sample is required by the State, the system must average the result with the first sampling result and the average must be used for the determination of compliance with MCLs as specified by § 141.903. A State may delete results of obvious sampling errors from the MCL compliance calculations described in § 141.903. If the State deletes a result because of an obvious sampling error and the system fails to collect another sample this is a monitoring violation as described in § 141.905(c).
(vi) The State may increase the required monitoring frequency, where necessary, to detect variations within the system (e.g., fluctuations in concentration due to seasonal use, changes in water source).
(vii) Each public water system must monitor at the time designated by the State within each monitoring period.
(viii) When a system reduces its sampling frequency to annual or triennial sampling, the next compliance sample must be collected in the monitoring period that begins the calendar year following State approval of a reduction in monitoring frequency.
§ 141.903
Compliance requirements.
(a) Compliance with MCLs for regulated PFAS in § 141.61(c) must be determined based on the analytical results obtained at each sampling point.
(b) For systems monitoring quarterly, compliance with the MCL is determined by the running annual average at each sampling point.
(c) If a system fails to collect the required number of samples specified in § 141.902, this is a monitoring violation as described in § 141.905(c), and compliance calculations must be based on the total number of samples collected.
(d) Systems monitoring triennially whose sample result equals or exceeds the trigger level of 2.0 ng/l for either PFOS or PFOA, 5 ng/l for HFPO-DA, PFHxS, or PFNA, or a Hazard Index of 0.5 for the Hazard Index PFAS, must
begin quarterly sampling for all regulated PFAS in the next quarter at the sampling point. Systems monitoring annually whose sample result equals or exceeds the MCL of 4.0 ng/l for either PFOS or PFOA, 10 ng/l for HFPO-DA, PFHxS, or PFNA, or a Hazard Index of 1 for the Hazard Index PFAS, must begin quarterly sampling for all regulated PFAS in the next quarter at the sampling point.
(e) Except as provided in this paragraph (e), if a sample result exceeds an MCL, the system will not be considered in violation of the MCL until it has completed one year of quarterly sampling at the sampling point with the triggering sample used as the first quarter of monitoring for the running annual average calculation. However, whenever a sample result in any quarter (or quarterly average, if more than one compliance sample is available in a quarter because a confirmation sample was required by the State) causes the running annual average to exceed the MCL at a sampling point regardless of the subsequent quarterly monitoring results required to complete a full year of monitoring (e.g., the results from a single sample are more than 4 times the MCL), the system is out of compliance with the MCL immediately.
(f) Systems must calculate compliance using the following method to determine MCL compliance at each sampling point:
(1) For each PFAS regulated by an individual MCL:
(i) For systems monitoring quarterly, divide the sum of the measured quarterly concentrations for each analyte by the number of quarters samples were collected for that analyte during the consecutive quarters included in the calculation. If more than one compliance sample for that analyte is available in a quarter because a confirmation sample was required by the State, systems must average all the results in a quarter then average the quarterly averages. Rounding does not occur until the end of the calculation. If the running annual average exceeds the MCL, the system is not in compliance with the MCL requirements.
(ii) For systems monitoring annually, if the concentration measured is equal to or exceeds an MCL for regulated PFAS, the system is required to initiate quarterly monitoring for all regulated PFAS beginning in the next quarter at the sampling point, with the triggering sample result used as the first quarter of monitoring for the running annual average calculation.
(iii) For systems monitoring triennially, if the concentration measured is equal to or exceeds the trigger level, the system is required to initiate quarterly monitoring for all regulated PFAS beginning in the next quarter at the sampling point, with the triggering sample result used as the first quarter of monitoring for the running annual average calculation.
(iv) For the purpose of calculating MCL compliance, if a sample result is less than the practical quantitation level (PQL) for a regulated PFAS, in accordance with the following table, zero is used for that analyte solely to calculate the running annual average.
Table 1 to Paragraph (
f
)(1)(
iv
)—Practical Quantitation Levels (PQLs) for PFAS Contaminants
Contaminant
PQL
(in parts per trillion)
HFPO-DA
5.0
PFBS
3.0
PFHxS
3.0
PFNA
4.0
PFOA
4.0
PFOS
4.0
(2) For each PFAS regulated under the Hazard Index MCL:
(i) For systems monitoring quarterly, divide the observed sample analytical result for each analyte included in the Hazard Index by the corresponding HBWC listed in § 141.61(c) to obtain a hazard quotient for each analyte for each sampling event at each sampling point. Sum the resulting hazard quotients together to determine the Hazard Index for the quarter. If the State requires a confirmation sample for an analyte in the quarter, systems must average these results for each analyte in that quarter and then determine the hazard quotient(s) from those average values, then sum the hazard quotients. Once the Hazard Indices for the individual quarters are calculated,
they are averaged to determine a running annual average. If the running annual average Hazard Index exceeds the MCL and two or more Hazard Index analytes had an observed sample analytical result at or above the PQL in any of the quarterly samples collected to determine the running annual average, the system is in violation of the Hazard Index MCL. No rounding occurs until after the running annual average Hazard Index is calculated.
(ii) If the Hazard Index calculated using the results of an annual sample equals or exceeds the Hazard Index MCL, the system must initiate quarterly sampling for all regulated PFAS beginning in the next quarter at the sampling point, with the triggering sample result used as the first quarter of monitoring.
(iii) If the Hazard Index calculated using the results of a triennial sample equals or exceeds the Hazard Index trigger level, the system must initiate quarterly sampling for all regulated PFAS beginning in the next quarter at the sampling point, with the triggering sample result used as the first quarter of monitoring.
(iv) If a sample result is less than the practical quantitation level for a regulated PFAS, in accordance with the table 1 to paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, zero is used for that analyte solely to calculate the running annual average.
§ 141.904
Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
Systems required to sample must report to the State according to the timeframes and provisions of § 141.31 and retain records according to the provisions in § 141.33.
(a) Systems must report the information from initial monitoring specified in the following table:
Table 1 to Paragraph (
a
)—Data To Report From Initial Monitoring
If you are a . . .
You must report . . .
System monitoring for regulated PFAS under the requirements of § 141.902(b)(1) on a quarterly basis
1. All sample results, including the locations, number of samples taken at each location, dates, and concentrations reported.
2. Whether a trigger level, defined in § 141.902(a)(5), was met or exceeded in any samples.
System monitoring for regulated PFAS under the requirements of § 141.902(b)(1) less frequently than quarterly
1. All sample results, including the locations, number of samples taken at each location, dates, and concentrations reported.
2. Whether a trigger level, defined in § 141.902(a)(5), was met or exceeded in any samples.
(b) Systems must report the information collected during the compliance monitoring period specified in the following table:
Table 2 to Paragraph (
b
)—Data To Report From Compliance Monitoring
If you are a . . .
You must report . . .
System monitoring for regulated PFAS under the requirements of § 141.902(b)(2) on a quarterly basis
1. All sample results, including the locations, number of samples taken at each location, dates, and concentrations during the previous quarter.
2. The running annual average at each sampling point of all compliance samples.
3. Whether a trigger level, defined in § 141.902(a)(5), was met or exceeded in any samples.
4. Whether an MCL for a regulated PFAS in § 141.61(c) was met or exceeded in any samples.
5. Whether, based on § 141.903, an MCL was violated.
System monitoring for regulated PFAS under the requirements of § 141.902(b)(2) less frequently than quarterly
1. All sample results, including the locations, number of samples taken at each location, dates, and concentrations during the previous monitoring period.
2. Whether a trigger level, defined in § 141.902(a)(5), was met or exceeded in any samples.
3. Whether an MCL for a regulated PFAS in § 141.61(c) was met or exceeded in any samples.
4. Whether, based on § 141.903, an MCL was violated (e.g., the results from a single sample are more than 4 times the MCL).
§ 141.905
Violations.
(a) PFAS MCL violations, both for the individual PFOA, PFOS, HFPO-DA, PFHxS, and PFNA MCLs, as well as the Hazard Index MCL, as listed in § 141.61(c), are based on a running annual average, as outlined under § 141.903.
(b) Compliance with § 141.61(c) must be determined based on the analytical results obtained at each sampling point. If one sampling point is in violation of an MCL, the system is in violation of the MCL.
(c) Each failure to monitor in accordance with the requirements under § 141.902 is a monitoring violation.
(d) Failure to notify the State following a MCL violation and failure to submit monitoring data in accordance with the requirements of §§ 141.904 and 141.31 are reporting violations.
(e) Results for PFAS with individual MCLs as listed in § 141.61(c) are compared to their respective MCLs, and results for mixtures of two or more of the Hazard Index PFAS (HFPO-DA, PFBS, PFHxS, and PFNA) are compared to the Hazard Index MCL as listed in § 141.61(c). For determining compliance with the Hazard Index MCL, if only PFBS is reported at any concentration and no other regulated PFAS are in the mixture, it is not violation of the Hazard Index MCL. If only one of the other PFAS within the Hazard Index (HFPO-DA, PFHxS, and PFNA) is detected and the level of this PFAS exceeds its MCL as determined by § 141.903(f)(1)(i), only an individual MCL violation is assessed for the individual PFAS detected, and it is not a violation of the Hazard Index MCL. Exceedances of the Hazard Index caused by two or more of the Hazard Index PFAS (HFPO-DA, PFBS, PFHxS, and PFNA) and exceedances of one or more individual MCLs can result in multiple MCL exceedances. However, in this instance, for purposes of public notification under appendix A to subpart Q of this part, a PWS must only report the Hazard Index MCL exceedance.

§ 142.3
Scope.
(a) Except where otherwise provided, this part applies to each public water system in each State; except that this part shall not apply to a public water system which meets all of the following conditions:
(1) Which consists only of distribution and storage facilities (and does not have any collection and treatment facilities);
(2) Which obtains all of its water from, but is not owned or operated by, a public water system to which such regulations apply;
(3) Which does not sell water to any person; and
(4) Which is not a carrier which conveys passengers in interstate commerce.
(b) In order to qualify for primary enforcement responsibility, a State's program for enforcement of primary drinking water regulations must apply to all other public water systems in the State, except for:
(1) Public water systems on carriers which convey passengers in interstate commerce;
(2) Public water systems on Indian land with respect to which the State does not have the necessary jurisdiction or its jurisdiction is in question; or
(c) Section 1451 of the SDWA authorizes the Administrator to delegate primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems to Indian Tribes. An Indian Tribe must meet the statutory criteria at 42 U.S.C. 300j-11(b)(1)
before it is eligible to apply for Public Water System Supervision grants and primary enforcement responsibility. All primary enforcement responsibility requirements of parts 141 and 142 apply to Indian Tribes except where specifically noted.

# Subpart B—Primary Enforcement Responsibility
§ 142.10
Requirements for a determination of primary enforcement responsibility.
A State has primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems in the State during any period for which the Administrator determines, based upon a submission made pursuant to § 142.11, and submission under § 142.12, that such State, pursuant to appropriate State legal authority:
(a) Has adopted drinking water regulations which are no less stringent than the national primary drinking water regulations (NPDWRs) in effect under part 141 of this chapter;
(b) Has adopted and is implementing adequate procedures for the enforcement of such State regulations, such procedures to include:
(1) Maintenance of an inventory of public water systems.
(2) A systematic program for conducting sanitary surveys of public water systems in the State, with priority given to sanitary surveys of public water systems not in compliance with State primary drinking water regulations.
(3)(i) The establishment and maintenance of a State program for the certification of laboratories conducting analytical measurements of drinking water contaminants pursuant to the requirements of the State primary drinking water regulations including the designation by the State of a laboratory officer, or officers, certified by the Administrator, as the official(s) responsible for the State's certification program. The requirements of this paragraph may be waived by the Administrator for any State where all analytical measurements required by the State's primary drinking water regulations are conducted at laboratories operated by the State and certified by the Agency. Until such time as the Agency establishes a National quality assurance program for laboratory certification the State shall maintain an interim program for the purpose of approving those laboratories from which the required analytical measurements will be acceptable.
(ii) Upon a showing by an Indian Tribe of an intergovernmental or other agreement to have all analytical tests performed by a certified laboratory, the Administrator may waive this requirement.
(4) Assurance of the availability to the State of laboratory facilities certified by the Administrator and capable of performing analytical measurements of all contaminants specified in the State primary drinking water regulations. Until such time as the Agency establishes a National quality assurance program for laboratory certification the Administrator will approve such State laboratories on an interim basis.
(5) The establishment and maintenance of an activity to assure that the design and construction of new or substantially modified public water system facilities will be capable of compliance with the State primary drinking water regulations.
(6) Statutory or regulatory enforcement authority adequate to compel compliance with the State primary drinking water regulations in appropriate cases, such authority to include:
(i) Authority to apply State primary drinking water regulations to all public water systems in the State covered by the national primary drinking water regulations, except for interstate carrier conveyances and systems on Indian land with respect to which the
State does not have the necessary jurisdiction or its jurisdiction is in question.
(ii) Authority to sue in courts of competent jurisdiction to enjoin any threatened or continuing violation of the State primary drinking water regulations.
(iii) Right of entry and inspection of public water systems, including the right to take water samples, whether or not the State has evidence that the system is in violation of an applicable legal requirement.
(iv) Authority to require suppliers of water to keep appropriate records and make appropriate reports to the State.
(v) Authority to require public water systems to give public notice that is no less stringent than the EPA requirements in subpart Q of part 141 of this chapter and § 142.16(a).
(vi) Authority to assess civil or criminal penalties for violation of the State's primary drinking water regulations and public notification requirements, including the authority to assess daily penalties or multiple penalties when a violation continues;
(vii) Authority to require community water systems to provide consumer confidence reports as required under 40 CFR part 141, subpart O.
(c) Has established and will maintain record keeping and reporting of its activities under paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) in compliance with §§ 142.14 and 142.15;
(d)
Variances and exemptions.
(1) If it permits small system variances pursuant to Section 1415(e) of the Act, it must provide procedures no less stringent than the Act and subpart K of this part.
(2) If it permits variances (other than small system variances) or exemptions, or both, from the requirements of the State primary drinking water regulations, it shall do so under conditions and in a manner no less stringent than the requirements of Sections 1415 and 1416 of the Act. In granting these variances, the State must adopt the Administrator's findings of best available technology, treatment techniques, or other means available as specified in subpart G of this part. (States with primary enforcement responsibility may adopt procedures different from those set forth in subparts E and F of this part, which apply to the issuance of variances (other than small system variances) and exemptions by the Administrator in States that do not have primary enforcement responsibility, provided that the State procedures meet the requirements of this paragraph); and
(e) Has adopted and can implement an adequate plan for the provision of safe drinking water under emergency circumstances including, but not limited to, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and other natural disasters.
(f)(1) Has adopted authority for assessing administrative penalties unless the constitution of the State prohibits the adoption of such authority. For public water systems serving a population of more than 10,000 individuals, States must have the authority to impose a penalty of at least $1,000 per day per violation. For public water systems serving a population of 10,000 or fewer individuals, States must have penalties that are adequate to ensure compliance with the State regulations as determined by the State.
(2) As long as criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section are met, States may establish a maximum administrative penalty per violation that may be assessed on a public water system.
(g) Has adopted regulations consistent with 40 CFR part 3—(Electronic reporting) if the state receives electronic documents.
(h) An Indian Tribe shall not be required to exercise criminal enforcement jurisdiction to meet the requirements for primary enforcement responsibility.

§ 142.12
Revision of State programs.
(a)
General requirements.
Either EPA or the primacy State may initiate actions that require the State to revise its approved State primacy program. To retain primary enforcement responsibility, States must adopt all new and revised national primary drinking water regulations promulgated in part 141 of this chapter and any other requirements specified in this part.
(1) Whenever a State revises its approved primacy program to adopt new or revised Federal regulations, the State must submit a request to the Administrator for approval of the program revision, using the procedures described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. The Administrator shall approve or disapprove each State request for approval of a program revision based on the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act and of this part.
(2) For all State program revisions not covered under § 142.12(a)(1), the review procedures outlined in § 142.17(a) shall apply.
(b)
Timing of State requests for approval of program revisions to adopt new or revised Federal regulations.
(1) Complete and final State requests for approval of program revisions to adopt new or revised EPA regulations must be submitted to the Administrator not later than 2 years after promulgation of the new or revised EPA regulations, unless the State requests an extension and the Administrator has approved the request pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the State expects to submit a final State request for approval of a program revision to EPA more than 2 years after promulgation of the new or revised EPA regulations, the State shall request an extension of the deadline before the expiration of the 2-year period.
(2) The final date for submission of a complete and final State request for a program revision may be extended by EPA for up to a two-year period upon a written application by the State to the Administrator. In the extension application the State must demonstrate it is requesting the extension because it cannot meet the original deadline for reasons beyond its control despite a good faith effort to do so. The application must include a schedule for the submission of a final request by a certain time and provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the State:
(i)(A) Currently lacks the legislative or regulatory authority to enforce the new or revised requirements, or
(B) Currently lacks the program capability adequate to implement the new or revised requirements; or
(C) Is requesting the extension to group two or more program revisions in a single legislative or regulatory action; and
(ii) Is implementing the EPA requirements to be adopted by the State in its program revision pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section within the scope of its current authority and capabilities.
(3) To be granted an extension, the State must agree with EPA to meet certain requirements during the extension period, which may include the following types of activities as determined appropriate by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis:
(i) Informing public water systems of the new EPA (and upcoming State) requirements and that EPA will be overseeing implementation of the requirements until the State, if eligible for interim primacy, submits a complete and final primacy revision request to EPA, or in all other cases, until EPA approves the State program revision;
(ii) Collecting, storing and managing laboratory results, public notices, and other compliance and operation data required by the EPA regulations;
(iii) Assisting EPA in the development of the technical aspects of enforcement actions and conducting informal follow-up on violations (telephone calls, letters, etc.);
(iv) Providing technical assistance to public water systems;
(v) Providing EPA with all information prescribed by § 142.15 of this part on State reporting; and
(vi) For States whose request for an extension is based on a current lack of program capability adequate to implement the new requirements, taking steps agreed to by EPA and the State during the extension period to remedy the deficiency.
(c)
Contents of a State request for approval of a program revision.
(1) The State request for EPA approval of a program revision shall be concise and must include:
(i) The documentation necessary (pursuant to § 142.11(a)) to update the approved State primacy program, and identification of those elements of the approved State primacy program that have not changed because of the program revision. The documentation shall include a side-by-side comparison of the Federal requirements and the corresponding State authorities, including citations to the specific statutes and administrative regulations or ordinances and, wherever appropriate, judicial decisions which demonstrate adequate authority to meet the requirements of § 142.10 as they apply to the program revision.
(ii) Any additional materials that are listed in § 142.16 of this part for a specific EPA regulation, as appropriate; and
(iii) For a complete and final State request only, unless one of the conditions listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are met, a statement by the State Attorney General (or the attorney for the State primacy agency if it has independent legal counsel) or the attorney representing the Indian tribe that certifies that the laws and regulations adopted by the State or tribal ordinances to carry out the program revision were duly adopted and are enforceable. State statutes and regulations cited by the State Attorney General and tribal ordinances cited by the attorney for the Indian tribe shall be in the form of lawfully adopted State statutes and regulations or tribal ordinances at the time the certification is made and shall be fully effective by the time the request for program revision is approved by EPA. To qualify as “independent legal counsel,” the attorney signing the statement required by this section shall have full authority to independently represent the State primacy agency or tribe in court on all matters pertaining to the State or tribal program.
(2) An Attorney General's statement will be required as part of the State request for EPA approval of a program revision unless EPA specifically waives this requirement for a specific regulation at the time EPA promulgates the regulation, or by later written notice from the Administrator to the State.
(3) After EPA has received the documents required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, EPA may selectively require supplemental statements by
the State Attorney General (or the attorney for the State primacy agency if it has independent legal counsel) or the attorney representing the Indian tribe. Each supplemental statement shall address all issues concerning the adequacy of State authorities to meet the requirements of § 142.10 that have been identified by EPA after thorough examination as unresolved by the documents submitted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(d)
Procedures for review of a State request for approval of a program revision
—(1)
Preliminary request.
(i) The State may submit to the Administrator for his or her review a preliminary request for approval of each program revision, containing the information listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section,
in draft form.
