Property may be seized, if available, by any Customs officer who has reasonable cause to believe that any law or regulation enforced by Customs and Border Protection or Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been violated, by reason of which the property has become subject to seizure or forfeiture. This paragraph does not authorize seizure when seizure or forfeiture is restricted by law or regulation (see, for example, § 162.75), nor does it authorize a remedy other than seizure when seizure or forfeiture is required by law or regulation. A receipt for seized property shall be given at the time of seizure to the person from whom the property is seized.
(b)
Seizure by persons other than Customs officers.
The port director may adopt a seizure made by a person other than a Customs officer if such port director has reasonable cause to believe that the property is subject to forfeiture under the Customs laws.
(c)
Seizure by State official.
If a duly constituted State official has seized any merchandise, vessel, aircraft, vehicle, or other conveyance under provisions of the statutes of such State, such property shall not be seized by a Customs officer unless the property is voluntarily turned over to him to be proceeded against under the Federal statutes.

If it shall appear to any officer authorized to board conveyances and make seizures that there has been a violation of any law of the United States whereby a vessel, vehicle, aircraft, or other conveyance, or any merchandise on board of or imported by such vessel, vehicle, aircraft, or other conveyance is liable to forfeiture, the officer shall seize such conveyance and arrest any person engaged in such violation. Common carriers are exempted from seizure except under certain specified conditions as provided for in section 594, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1594) and section 274(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324(b)(1)).

Any person who directs, assists financially or otherwise, or is in any way concerned in any such unlawful activity shall be liable to a penalty equal to the value of the article or articles involved.
(c)
Common carrier clearance.
Unless specifically authorized by law, clearance of vessels within the common carrier exception of section 594, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1594), shall not be refused for the purpose of collecting a fine imposed upon the master or owner, unless either of them was a party to the illegal act. The Government's remedy in such cases is limited to an action against the master or owner.
(d)
Maritime Administration vessels; exemption from penalty.
(1) When a vessel owned or chartered under bareboat charter by the Maritime Administration and operated for its account becomes liable for the payment of a penalty incurred for violation of the Customs revenue or navigation laws, clearance of the vessel shall not be withheld nor shall any proceedings be taken against the vessel itself looking to the enforcement of such liability.
(2) This exemption shall not in any way be considered to relieve the master of any such vessel or other person incurring such penalties from personal liability for payment.

Proceedings by libel.
If seizure is made under a statute which provides that the property may be seized and proceeded against by libel, the summary forfeiture procedures set forth in §§ 162.45, 162.46, and 162.47 do not apply. Such cases shall be referred to the U.S. attorney.

Property not under seizure.
The basis for a claim for forfeiture value or for an assessment of a penalty relating to the forfeiture value of property not under seizure is the domestic value as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the value shall be fixed as of the date of the violation. In the case of entered merchandise, the date of the violation shall be the date of the entry, or the date of the filing of the document, or the commission of the act forming the basis of the claim, whichever is later.

Retention of property.
The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer shall retain custody of the property pending payment of the amount of the offer when the application is approved.

(4) State the name and place of residence of the person to whom any vessel or merchandise seized for forfeiture under the navigation laws belongs or is consigned, if that information is known to the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer.

Information pertaining to the Government forfeiture Web site will be posted in a conspicuous place that is accessible to the public at all customhouses and all sector offices of the U.S. Border Patrol. In CBP's sole discretion, and as circumstances warrant, additional publication for at least three successive weeks in a print medium may be provided. All known parties-in-interest will be notified in writing of the Government Web site address and the date of Internet publication (and pertinent information regarding print publication, when appropriate).

§ 162.45a
Summary forfeiture of Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances.
The Controlled Substances Act (84 Stat. 1242, 21 U.S.C. 801
et seq.
) provides that all controlled substances in Schedule I and Schedule II (as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802(6) and 812) that are possessed, transferred, sold or offered for sale in violation of the Act will be deemed contraband, seized and summarily forfeited to the United States (21 U.S.C. 881(f)). The Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951
et seq.
) incorporates by reference this contraband forfeiture provision of 21 U.S.C. 881. See 21 U.S.C. 965. Accordingly, in the case of a seizure of Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substances, the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer or his designee will contact the appropriate Drug Enforcement Administration official responsible for issuing permits authorizing the importation of such substances (see 21 CFR part 1312). If upon inquiry the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer or his designee is notified that no permit for lawful importation has been issued, he will declare the seized substances contraband and forfeited pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 881(f). Inasmuch as such substances are Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances, the notice procedures set forth in § 162.45 are inapplicable. When seized controlled substances are required as evidence in a court proceeding, they will be preserved to the extent and in the quantities necessary for that purpose.
[T.D. 00-37, 65 FR 33254, May 23, 2000]
§ 162.46
Summary forfeiture: Disposition of goods.
(a)
General.
If no petition for relief from the forfeiture is filed in accordance with the provision of part 171 of this chapter, or if a petition was filed and has been denied, and the property is not retained for official use, it shall be disposed of in accordance with section 609, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1609) or section 491(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1491(b)).
(b)
Articles required to be inspected by other Government agencies.
Before seized drugs, insecticides, seeds, plants, nursery stock, and other articles required to be inspected by other Government agencies are sold, they shall be inspected by a representative of such agency to ascertain whether or not they meet the requirements of the laws and regulations of that agency, and if found not to meet such requirements, they shall be destroyed forthwith.
(c)
Sale
—(1)
General.
If the forfeited property is cleared for sale, it shall be sold in accordance with the applicable provisions of part 127 of this chapter. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may postpone the sale of small seizures until he believes the proceeds of a consolidated sale will pay all expenses.
(2)
Transfer to another port for sale.
Property shall be moved to and sold at such other Customs port as the Commissioner of Customs may direct pursuant to the provisions of section 611, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1611), if:
(i) The laws of a State in which property is seized and forfeited prohibit the sale of such property; or
(ii) The Commissioner is of the opinion that the sale of forfeited property may be made more advantageously at another Customs port.
(d)
Destruction.
If, after summary forfeiture of property is completed, it appears that the net proceeds of sale will not be sufficient to pay the costs of
sale, the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may order destruction of the property. Any vessel or vehicle summarily forfeited for violation of any law respecting the Customs revenue may be destroyed in lieu of the sale thereof when such destruction is authorized by the Commissioner of Customs to protect the revenue.
(e)
Disposition of distilled spirits, wines, and malt liquor.
In addition to disposition by sale or destruction as provided for by this section, distilled spirits, wines, and malt liquor may be delivered:
(1) To any Government agency the Commissioner of Customs or his designee determines has a need for these articles for medical, scientific, or mechanical purposes, or for any other official purpose for which appropriated funds may be expended by a Government agency, or
(2) By gift to any charitable institution the Commissioner of Customs or his designee determines has a need for the articles for medical purposes.

Claim for property subject to summary forfeiture.
(a)
Filing of claim.
Any person desiring to claim under the provisions of section 608, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1608), seized property not exceeding $500,000 in value (however there is no limit in value of merchandise, the importation of which is prohibited, or in the value of vessels, vehicles or aircraft used to import, export, transport, or store any controlled substance, or in the amount of any monetary instruments within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 5312(a)(3), that may be seized and forfeited) and subject to summary forfeiture, shall file a claim to such property with the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer within 20 days from the date of the first publication of the notice prescribed in § 162.45.
(b)
Bond for costs.
Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the bond in the penal sum of $5,000 or 10% of the value of the claimed property, whichever is lower, but not less than $250, required by section 608, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, to be filed with a claim for seized property shall be on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.72 of this chapter.
(c)
Claimant not entitled to possession.
The filing of a claim and the giving of a bond, if required, pursuant to section 608, Tariff Act of 1930, shall not be construed to entitle the claimant to possession of the property. Such action only stops the summary forfeiture proceeding.
(d)
Report to the U.S. attorney.
When the claim and bond, if required, are filed within the 20-day period, the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer shall report the case to the U.S. attorney for the institution of condemnation proceedings.
(e)

The right of a claimant to seized property which has been destroyed or otherwise disposed of shall not be extinguished.
(2) Publication of a notice of the seizure, regardless of the disposition of the property, will be required pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1607. Claimants to seized property will be permitted to file a petition for remission of the forfeiture pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1618, and part 171 of this chapter. A claimant receiving full or partial relief from the forfeiture shall be reimbursed the difference between the value of the merchandise at the time of the seizure, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1606 and § 162.43 of this part, and any remitted forfeiture amount that the claimant is required to pay.

§ 162.74
Prior disclosure.
(a)
In general
—(1) A prior disclosure is made if the person concerned discloses the circumstances of a violation (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) of 19 U.S.C. 1592 or 19 U.S.C. 1593a, either orally or in writing to a Customs officer before, or without knowledge of, the commencement of a formal investigation of that violation, and makes a tender of any actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. A Customs officer who receives such a tender in connection with a prior disclosure shall ensure that the tender is deposited with the concerned local Customs entry officer.
(2) A person shall be accorded the full benefits of prior disclosure treatment if that person provides information orally or in writing to Customs with respect to a violation of 19 U.S.C. 1592 or 19 U.S.C. 1593a if the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer is satisfied the information was provided before, or without knowledge of, the commencement of a formal investigation, and the information provided includes substantially the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section. In the case of an oral disclosure, the disclosing party shall confirm the oral disclosure by providing a written record of the information conveyed to Customs in the oral disclosure to the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer within 10 days of the date of the oral disclosure. The concerned Fines, Penalties and Forfeiture Officer may, upon request of the disclosing party which establishes a showing of good cause, waive the oral disclosure written confirmation requirement. Failure to provide the written confirmation of the oral disclosure or obtain a waiver of the requirement may result in denial of the oral prior disclosure.
(b)
Disclosure of the circumstances of a violation.
The term “discloses the circumstances of a violation” means the act of providing to Customs a statement orally or in writing that:
(1) Identifies the class or kind of merchandise involved in the violation;
(2) Identifies the importation or drawback claim included in the disclosure by entry number, drawback claim number, or by indicating each concerned Customs port of entry and the approximate dates of entry or dates of drawback claims;
(3) Specifies the material false statements, omissions or acts including an explanation as to how and when they occurred; and
(4) Sets forth, to the best of the disclosing party's knowledge, the true and accurate information or data that should have been provided in the entry or drawback claim documents, and states that the disclosing party will provide any information or data unknown at the time of disclosure within
30 days of the initial disclosure date. Extensions of the 30-day period may be requested by the disclosing party from the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer to enable the party to obtain the information or data.
(c)
Tender of actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue.
A person who discloses the circumstances of the violation shall tender any actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue. The disclosing party may choose to make the tender either at the time of the claimed prior disclosure, or within 30 days after CBP notifies the person in writing of CBP calculation of the actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may extend the 30-day period if there is good cause to do so. The disclosing party may request that the basis for determining CBP asserted actual loss of duties, taxes or fees be reviewed by Headquarters, provided that the actual loss of duties, taxes or fees determined by CBP exceeds $100,000 and is deposited with CBP, more than 1 year remains under the statute of limitations involving the shipments covered by the claimed disclosure, and the disclosing party has complied with all other prior disclosure regulatory provisions. A grant of review is within the discretion of CBP Headquarters in consultation with the appropriate field office, and such Headquarters review shall be limited to determining issues of correct tariff classification, correct rate of duty, elements of dutiable value, and correct application of any special rules (GSP, CBI, HTS 9802, etc.). The concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer shall forward appropriate review requests to the Chief, Penalties Branch, Office of International Trade. After Headquarters renders its decision, the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer will be notified and the concerned Center director will recalculate the loss, if necessary, and notify the disclosing party of any actual loss of duties, taxes or fees increases. Any increases must be deposited within 30 days, unless the local CBP office authorizes a longer period. Any reductions of the CBP calculated actual loss of duties, or and fees shall be refunded to the disclosing party. Such Headquarters review decisions are final and not subject to appeal. Further, disclosing parties requesting and obtaining such a review waive their right to contest either administratively or judicially the actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue finally calculated by CBP under this procedure. Failure to tender the actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue finally calculated by CBP shall result in denial of the prior disclosure.
(d)
Effective time and date of prior disclosure
—(1) If the documents that provide the disclosing information are sent by registered or certified mail, return-receipt requested, and are received by Customs, the disclosure shall be deemed to have been made at the time of mailing.
(2) If the documents are sent by other methods, including in-person delivery, the disclosure shall be deemed to have been made at the time of receipt by Customs. If the documents are delivered in person, the person delivering the documents will, upon request, be furnished a receipt from Customs stating the time and date of receipt.
(3) The provision of information that is not in writing but that qualifies for prior disclosure treatment pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be deemed to have occurred at the time that Customs was provided with information that substantially complies with the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(e)
Addressing and filing prior disclosure
—(1) A written prior disclosure should be addressed to the Commissioner of Customs, have conspicuously printed on the face of the envelope the words “prior disclosure,” and be presented to a Customs officer at the Customs port of entry of the disclosed violation.
(2) In the case of a prior disclosure involving violations at multiple ports of entry, the disclosing party may orally disclose or provide copies of the disclosure to all concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officers. In accordance with internal Customs procedures, the officers will then seek consolidation of the disposition and handling of the disclosure. In the event
that the claimed “multi-port” disclosure is made to a Customs officer other than the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer, the disclosing party must identify all ports involved to enable the concerned Customs officer to refer the disclosure to the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer for consolidation of the proceedings.
(f)
Verification of disclosure.
Upon receipt of a prior disclosure, the Customs officer shall notify Customs Office of Investigations of the disclosure. In the event the claimed prior disclosure is made to a Customs officer other than the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer, it is incumbent upon the Customs officer to provide a copy of the disclosure to the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer. The disclosing party may request, in the oral or written prior disclosure, that the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer request that the Office of Investigations withhold the initiation of disclosure verification proceedings until after the party has provided the information or data within the time limits specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. It is within the discretion of the concerned Fines, Penalties and Forfeitures Officer to grant or deny such requests.
(g)
Commencement of a formal investigation.
A formal investigation of a violation is considered to be commenced with regard to the disclosing party on the date recorded in writing by the Customs Service as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received that caused the Customs Service to believe that a possibility of a violation existed. In the event that a party affirmatively asserts a prior disclosure (
i.e.
, identified or labeled as a prior disclosure) and is denied prior disclosure treatment on the basis that Customs had commenced a formal investigation of the disclosed violation, and Customs initiates a penalty action against the disclosing party involving the disclosed violation, a copy of a “writing” evidencing the commencement of a formal investigation of the disclosed violation shall be attached to any required prepenalty notice issued to the disclosing party pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1592 or 19 U.S.C. 1593a.
(h)
Scope of the disclosure and expansion of a formal investigation.
A formal investigation is deemed to have commenced as to additional violations not included or specified by the disclosing party in the party's original prior disclosure on the date recorded in writing by the Customs Service as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received that caused the Customs Service to believe that a possibility of such additional violations existed. Additional violations not disclosed or covered within the scope of the party's prior disclosure that are discovered by Customs as a result of an investigation and/or verification of the prior disclosure shall not be entitled to treatment under the prior disclosure provisions.
(i)
Knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation
—(1) A disclosing party who claims lack of knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation has the burden to prove that lack of knowledge. A person shall be presumed to have had knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation of a violation if before the claimed prior disclosure of the violation a formal investigation has been commenced and:
(i) Customs, having reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation of 19 U.S.C. 1592 or 19 U.S.C. 1593a, so informed the person of the type of or circumstances of the disclosed violation; or
(ii) A Customs Special Agent, having properly identified himself or herself and the nature of his or her inquiry, had, either orally or in writing, made an inquiry of the person concerning the type of or circumstances of the disclosed violation; or
(iii) A Customs Special Agent, having properly identified himself or herself and the nature of his or her inquiry, requested specific books and/or records of the person relating to the disclosed violation; or
(iv) Customs issues a prepenalty or penalty notice to the disclosing party pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1592 or 19 U.S.C. 1593a relating to the type of or circumstances of the disclosed violation; or
(v) The merchandise that is the subject of the disclosure was seized; or
(vi) In the case of violations involving merchandise accompanying persons entering the United States or commercial merchandise inspected in connection with entry, the person has received oral or written notification of Customs finding of a violation.
(2) The presumption of knowledge may be rebutted by evidence that, notwithstanding the foregoing notice, inquiry or request, the person did not have knowledge that an investigation had commenced with respect to the disclosed information.
(j)
Prior disclosure using sampling.
(1) A private party may use statistical sampling to “disclose the circumstances of a violation” and for calculation of lost duties, taxes, and fees or lost revenue for purposes of prior disclosure, provided that the statistical sampling satisfies the criteria in 19 CFR 163.11(c)(3). The prior disclosure must include an explanation of the sampling plan and methodology that meets with CBP's approval. The time period, scope, and any sampling plan employed by the private party, as well as the execution and results of the self-review, are subject to CBP review and approval. In accordance with 19 CFR 163.11(c)(1), in circumstances where the private party and CBP have discussed and accepted the sampling plan and its methodology, or adjustments to it, the private party submitting a prior disclosure employing sampling under this paragraph may not contest the validity of the sampling plan or its methodology, and challenges of the sampling itself will be limited to computational and clerical errors after CBP conducts its review and makes a determination. This is not a waiver of the private party's right to later contest substantive issues it may properly raise under applicable regulations, as provided in 19 CFR 163.11(c)(1).
(2) If a private party submits a prior disclosure claim employing sampling, CBP may review other transactions from the same time period and scope that are the subject of the prior disclosure.

(c) Any applicable internal revenue tax shall also be demanded unless the merchandise is to be, or has been, forfeited.

(1) The claimant has a possessory interest in the property;
(2) The claimant has sufficient ties to the community to provide assurance that the property will be available at the time of trial;
(3) The continued possession of the property by Customs pending the final disposition of forfeiture proceedings will cause substantial hardship to the claimant, such as preventing an individual from working, or leaving an individual homeless; and
(4) The claimant's likely hardship from the continued possession by Customs of the seized property outweighs the risk that the property will be destroyed, damaged, lost, concealed, or transferred if it is returned to the claimant during the pendency of the proceedings.
(b)
Exceptions.
Immediate release of seized property under paragraph (a) of this section will not apply if the seized property:

(c)
Request for release.
A claimant seeking release of property under this section must request possession of the property from the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer who issued the notice of seizure. The request need not be made in any particular form, but must be in writing and set forth the basis on which the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section have been met. The request may be filed at any time during which the property remains under seizure.
(d)
Granting request for release.
The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may release the property if it is determined to be appropriate under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.

Denial of or failure to act on request for release.
If the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer denies the request for release or fails to make a decision on the request by the 15th calendar day after the date the request is received by Customs, the claimant may file a petition in the district court in which the complaint has been filed, or, if no complaint has been filed, in the U.S. district court in which the seizure warrant was issued or in the U.S. district court for the district in which the property was seized.

All persons listed in § 163.2 must maintain all records required by law and regulation for the required retention periods and as original records, whether paper or electronic, unless alternative storage methods have been adopted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The records, whether in their original format or under an alternative storage method, must be capable of being retrieved upon lawful request or demand by CBP.
(b)
Alternative method of storage
—(1)
General.
Any of the persons listed in § 163.2 may maintain any records, other than records required to be maintained as original records under laws and regulations administered by other Federal government agencies, in an alternative format, provided that the person gives advance written notification of such alternative storage method to the Regulatory Audit, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 2001 Cross Beam Dr., Charlotte, North Carolina 28217, and provided further that the Director of Regulatory Audit, Charlotte office does not instruct the person in writing as provided herein that certain described records may not be maintained in an alternative format. The written notice to the Director of Regulatory Audit, Charlotte office must be provided at least 30 calendar days before implementation of the alternative storage method, must identify the type of alternative storage method to be used, and must state that the alternative storage method complies with the standards set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If an alternative storage method covers records that pertain to goods under CBP seizure or detention or that relate to a matter that is currently the subject of an inquiry or investigation or administrative or court proceeding, the appropriate CBP office may instruct the person in writing that those records must be maintained as original records and therefore may not be converted to an alternative format until specific written authorization is received from that CBP office. A written instruction to a person under this paragraph may be issued during the 30-day advance notice period prescribed in this section or at any time thereafter, must describe the records in question with reasonable specificity but need not identify the underlying basis for the instruction, and shall not preclude application of the planned alternative storage method to other records not described therein.

Standards for alternative storage methods.
Methods commonly used in standard business practice for storage of records include, but are not limited to, machine readable data, CD ROM, and microfiche. Methods that are in compliance with generally accepted business standards will generally satisfy CBP requirements, provided that the method used allows for retrieval of records requested within a reasonable time after the request and provided that adequate provisions exist to prevent alteration, destruction, or deterioration of the records. The following standards must be applied by recordkeepers when using alternative storage methods:
(i) Operational and written procedures are in place to ensure that the imaging and/or other media storage process preserves the integrity, readability, and security of the information contained in the original records. The procedures must include a standardized retrieval process for such records. Vendor specifications/documentation and benchmark data must be available for CBP review;
(ii) There is an effective labeling, naming, filing, and indexing system;
(iii) Except in the case of packing lists (
see
§ 163.4(b)(2)), entry records must be maintained by the importer in their original formats for a period of 120 calendar days from the end of the release or conditional release period, whichever is later, or, if a demand for return to CBP custody has been issued, for a period of 120 calendar days either from the date the goods are redelivered
or from the date specified in the demand as the latest redelivery date if redelivery has not taken place. Customs brokers who are not serving as the importer of record and who maintain separate electronic records are exempted from this requirement. This exemption does not apply to any document that is required by law to be maintained as a paper record.
(iv) An internal testing of the system must be performed on a yearly basis;
(v) The recordkeeper must have the capability to make, and must bear the cost of, hard-copy reproductions of alternatively stored records that are required by CBP for audit, inquiry, investigation, or inspection of such records; and
(vi) The recordkeeper must retain and keep available one working copy and one back-up copy of the records stored in a secure location for the required periods as provided in § 163.4.
(3)
Changes to alternative storage procedures.
No changes to alternative recordkeeping procedures may be made without first notifying the Director of Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, Customs and Border Protection, 2001 Cross Beam Drive, Charlotte, North Carolina 28217. The notification must be in writing and must be provided to the director at least 30 calendar days before implementation of the change.
(4)
Penalties.
All persons listed in § 163.2 who use alternative storage methods for records and who fail to maintain or produce the records in accordance with this part are subject to penalties pursuant to § 163.6 for entry records or sanctions pursuant to §§ 163.9 and 163.10 for other records.
(5)
Failure to comply with alternative storage requirements.
If a person listed in § 163.2 uses an alternative storage method for records that is not in compliance with the conditions and requirements of this section, CBP may issue a written notice informing the person of the facts giving rise to the notice and directing that the alternative storage method must be discontinued in 30 calendar days unless the person provides written notice to the issuing CBP office within that time period that explains, to CBP's satisfaction, how compliance has been achieved. Failure to timely respond to CBP will result in CBP requiring discontinuance of the alternative storage method until a written statement explaining how compliance has been achieved has been received and accepted by CBP.
[T.D. 98-56, 63 FR 32946, June 16, 1998, as amended by CBP Dec. 12-12, 77 FR 33966, June 8, 2012]
§ 163.6
Production and examination of entry and other records and witnesses; penalties.
(a)
Production of entry records.
Pursuant to written, oral, or electronic notice, any Customs officer may require the production of entry records by any person listed in § 163.2(a) who is required under this part to maintain such records, even if the entry records were required at the time of entry. Any oral demand for entry records shall be followed by a written or electronic demand. The entry records shall be produced within 30 calendar days of receipt of the demand or within any shorter period as Customs may prescribe when the entry records are required in connection with a determination regarding the admissibility or release of merchandise. Should any person from whom Customs has demanded entry records encounter a problem in timely complying with the demand, such person may submit a written or electronic request to Customs for approval of a specific additional period of time in which to produce the records; the request must be received by Customs before the applicable due date for production of the records and must include an explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the request. Customs will promptly advise the requesting person electronically or in writing either that the request is denied or that the requested additional time period, or such shorter period as Customs may deem appropriate, is approved. The mere fact that a request for additional time to produce demanded entry records was submitted under this section shall not by itself preclude the imposition of a monetary penalty or other sanction under this part for failure to timely produce the records, but no such penalty or other sanction will be imposed if the request
is approved and the records are produced before expiration of that additional period of time.
(b)
Failure to produce entry records
—(1)
Monetary penalties applicable.
The following penalties may be imposed if a person fails to comply with a lawful demand for the production of an entry record and is not excused from a penalty pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section:
(i) If the failure to comply is a result of the willful failure of the person to maintain, store, or retrieve the demanded record, such person shall be subject to a penalty, for each release of merchandise, not to exceed $100,000, or an amount equal to 75 percent of the appraised value of the merchandise, whichever amount is less; or
(ii) If the failure to comply is a result of negligence of the person in maintaining, storing, or retrieving the demanded record, such person shall be subject to a penalty, for each release of merchandise, not to exceed $10,000, or an amount equal to 40 percent of the appraised value of the merchandise, whichever amount is less.
(2)
Additional actions
—(i)
General.
In addition to any penalty imposed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, if the demanded entry record relates to the eligibility of merchandise for a column 1 special rate of duty in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), the entry of such merchandise:
(A) If unliquidated, shall be liquidated at the applicable HTSUS column 1 general rate of duty; or
(B) If liquidated within the 2-year period preceding the date of the demand, shall be reliquidated, notwithstanding the time limitation in 19 U.S.C. 1514 or 1520, at the applicable HTSUS column 1 general rate of duty.
(ii)
Exception.
Any liquidation or reliquidation under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section shall be at the applicable HTSUS column 2 rate of duty if Customs demonstrates that the merchandise should be dutiable at such rate.
(3)
Avoidance of penalties.
No penalty may be assessed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the person who fails to comply with a lawful demand for entry records can show:
(i) That the loss of the demanded record was the result of an act of God or other natural casualty or disaster beyond the fault of such person or an agent of the person;
(ii) On the basis of other evidence satisfactory to Customs, that the demand was substantially complied with;
(iii) That the record demanded was presented to and retained by Customs at the time of entry or submitted in response to an earlier demand; or
(iv) That he has been certified as a participant in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program (see § 163.12), that he is generally in compliance with the appropriate procedures and requirements of that program, and that the violation in question is his first violation and was a non-willful violation.
(4)
Penalties not exclusive.
Any penalty imposed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be in addition to any other penalty provided by law except for:
(i) A penalty imposed under 19 U.S.C. 1592 for a material omission of any information contained in the demanded record; or
(ii) Disciplinary action taken under 19 U.S.C. 1641.
(5)
Remission or mitigation of penalties.
A penalty imposed under this section may be remitted or mitigated under 19 U.S.C. 1618.
(6)
Customs summons.
The assessment of a penalty under this section shall not limit or preclude the issuance or enforcement of a summons under this part.
(c)
Examination of entry and other records
—(1)
Reasons for examination.
Customs may initiate an investigation, audit or other inquiry for the purpose of:
(i) Ascertaining the correctness of any entry, determining the liability of any person for duties, taxes and fees due or duties, taxes and fees which may be due, or determining the liability of any person for fines, penalties and forfeitures; or
(ii) Ensuring compliance with the laws and regulations administered or enforced by Customs.
(2)
Availability of records.
During the course of any investigation, audit or
other inquiry, any Customs officer, during normal business hours, and to the extent possible at a time mutually convenient to the parties, may examine, or cause to be examined, any relevant entry or other records by providing the person responsible for such records with reasonable written, oral or electronic notice that describes the records with reasonable specificity. The examination of entry records shall be subject to the notice and production procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and a failure to produce entry records may result in the imposition of penalties or the taking of other action as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(3)
Examination notice not exclusive.
In addition to, or in lieu of, issuance of an examination notice under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Customs may issue a summons pursuant to § 163.7, and seek its enforcement pursuant to §§ 163.9 and 163.10, to compel the production of any records required to be maintained and produced under this chapter.
[T.D. 98-56, 63 FR 32946, June 16, 1998; 63 FR 34808, June 26, 1998, as amended by CBP Dec. 11-20, 76 FR 65961, Oct. 25, 2011]

§ 163.11
Audit procedures.
(a)
General requirements.
In conducting an audit under 19 U.S.C. 1509(b), the CBP auditors, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f) of this section, will:
(1) Provide notice, telephonically and in writing, to the person to be audited of CBP's intention to conduct an audit and a reasonable estimate of the time to be required for the audit;
(2) Inform the person who is to be the subject of the audit, in writing and before commencement of the audit, of that person's right to an entrance conference, at which time the objectives and records requirements of the audit, and any sampling plan to be employed or offsetting that may apply, will be explained and the estimated termination date of the audit will be set. Where a decision on a sampling plan and methodology is not made at the time of the entrance conference, CBP will discuss these matters with the person being audited as soon as possible after the discovery of facts and circumstances that warrant the possible need to employ sampling;
(3) Provide a further estimate of any additional time for the audit if, during the course of the audit, it becomes apparent that additional time will be required;
(4) Schedule a closing conference upon completion of the audit on-site work to explain the preliminary results of the audit;
(5) Complete a formal written audit report within 90 calendar days following the closing conference referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section,
unless the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, CBP Headquarters, provides written notice to the person audited of the reason for any delay and the anticipated completion date; and
(6) After application of any disclosure exemptions contained in 5 U.S.C. 552, send a copy of the formal written audit report to the person audited within 30 calendar days following completion of the report.
(b)
Petition procedures for failure to conduct closing conference.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f) of this section, if the estimated or actual termination date of the audit passes without a CBP auditor providing a closing conference to explain the results of the audit, the person audited may petition in writing for a closing conference to the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. Upon receipt of the request, the director will provide for the closing conference to be held within 15 calendar days after the date of receipt.
(c)
Use of statistical sampling in calculation of loss of duties or revenue
—(1)
General.
In conducting an audit under this section, regardless of the finality of liquidation under 19 U.S.C. 1514, CBP auditors have the sole discretion to determine the time period and scope of the audit and will examine a sufficient number of transactions, as determined solely by CBP. In addition to examining all transactions to identify loss of duties, taxes, and fees under 19 U.S.C. 1592 or loss of revenue under 19 U.S.C. 1593a, or to determine compliance with any other applicable customs laws or other laws enforced by CBP, CBP auditors, at their sole discretion, may use statistical sampling methods. During the audit, CBP auditors will explain the sampling plan and how the results of the sampling will be projected over the universe of transactions for purposes of calculating lost duties, taxes, and fees or lost revenue and, where appropriate, overpayments and over-declarations eligible for offsetting under paragraph (d) of this section. The person being audited and CBP will discuss the specifics of the sampling plan before audit work under the plan is commenced. Once the sampling plan is accepted, the audited person waives the ability to contest the validity of the sampling plan or its methodology at a later date and challenges of the sampling will be limited to challenging computational and clerical errors. CBP's authority to conduct the audit or employ statistical sampling is not dependent on the audited person's acceptance of the specifics of the sampling plan. An audited person's acceptance of the sampling plan and methodology must be in writing and signed by a management official with authority to bind the company in matters of trade, imports, and/or other affairs under the customs laws, CBP regulations, or other applicable laws. The audited person may submit the signed waiver to the CBP auditor. The appropriate field director, Regulatory Audit, will sign the waiver for CBP. Where the sampling plan or methodology is subsequently adjusted or modified, at CBP's discretion, acceptance of the adjustments or modifications also must be in writing and signed. This is not a waiver of the audited person's right to later contest substantive issues, such as misclassification, undervaluation, etc., that may properly be raised under applicable regulations, including in a request for CBP Headquarters advice under 19 CFR 171.14, a request for CBP Headquarters review under 19 CFR 162.74(c), a response to a prepenalty notice issued by CBP under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b)(1) or 19 U.S.C. 1593a(b)(1), a petition submitted in response to a penalty notice issued by CBP under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b)(2) or 19 U.S.C. 1593a(b)(2) (19 CFR part 171) and 19 U.S.C. 1618, a supplemental petition submitted under 19 CFR 171.61 and 171.62, or any action commenced in a court of proper jurisdiction.
(2)
Projection.
For purposes of this section, “projection” of sampling results over the universe of transactions is the process by which the results obtained from the sample entries actually examined are applied to the universe of entries set within the time period and scope of the sampling plan to yield a reliable assessment of that which is sought to be ascertained or measured in the audit, including, but not limited to, lost duties or revenue,
or overpayments or over-declarations, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(3)
When CBP uses statistical sampling.
CBP auditors have the sole discretion to use statistical sampling techniques when:
(i) Review of 100 percent of the transactions is impossible or impractical;
(ii) The sampling plan is prepared in accordance with generally recognized sampling procedures; and
(iii) The sampling procedure is executed in accordance with that plan.
(4)
Statistical sampling by audited persons under CBP supervision.
CBP may authorize a person being audited to conduct, under CBP supervision, self-testing of its own transactions within the time period and scope of the audit as originally set or later modified by CBP at its discretion. Audited persons permitted in advance by CBP to conduct self-testing of certain transactions under CBP supervision within the time period and scope of a CBP audit may use statistical sampling methods, provided that the criteria contained in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are satisfied. CBP will determine the time period and scope of the CBP-approved and supervised self-testing and will explain any sampling plan to be employed in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The execution and results of the self-testing and the sampling plan are subject to CBP approval, and the audited person is subject to the waiver of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(5)
Statistical sampling by a private party submitting a prior disclosure.
A private party conducting an independent review of certain transactions and a calculation of lost duties, taxes, and fees or lost revenue for purposes of prior disclosure, in accordance with 19 CFR 162.74(j), may use statistical sampling, provided that the private party submits an explanation of the sampling plan and methodology employed and that the criteria in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are satisfied. Where the private party submits a prior disclosure employing statistical sampling, the time period, scope, and any sampling plan employed by the private party, as well as the execution and results of the self-review, are subject to CBP review and approval. Where CBP and the private party discuss and accept the sampling plan and methodology, or an adjustment to it, the waiver of paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies.
(d)
Offset of overpayments and over-declarations in 19 U.S.C. 1592 penalty cases
—(1)
General.
In conducting any audit authorized under 19 U.S.C. 1509 and this section for the purpose of calculating the loss of duties, taxes, and fees or monetary penalty under any provision of 19 U.S.C. 1592, CBP auditors identifying overpayments of duties or fees or over-declarations of quantities or values that are within the time period and scope of the audit, as established solely by CBP, will treat the overpayments or over-declarations on finally liquidated entries as an offset to any underpayments or under-declarations also identified on finally liquidated entries, provided that:
(i) The identified overpayments or over-declarations were not made by the person being audited for the purpose of violating any provision of law, including laws other than customs laws,
(ii) The identified underpayments or under-declarations were not made knowingly and intentionally, and
(iii) All other requirements of this paragraph (d) are met.
(2)
When audited person conducts self-testing under CBP supervision.
Offsetting will apply to self-testing conducted by an audited person under CBP supervision (
i.e.
, during a CBP audit), provided that all requirements of this paragraph (d) are met, CBP approves the self-testing in advance and, upon review of the self-testing, CBP approves its execution and results.
(3)
When a private party submits a prior disclosure.
Offsetting will apply when a private party submits a prior disclosure, provided that the prior disclosure is in accordance with 19 CFR 162.74 and CBP approves the private party's self-review, including its execution and results. CBP's Office of International Trade, Regulatory Audit will review and evaluate all such prior disclosures and approve offsetting where it is satisfied that the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1509(b)(6) and this paragraph (d) are met.
(4)
Time period and scope determined by CBP; projection when sampling employed.
In conducting an audit under paragraph (d)(1) of this section or authorizing an audited person's self-testing as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, CBP will have the sole authority to determine the time period and scope of the audit. In conducting a review of a private party's prior disclosure as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the time period and scope employed will be subject to CBP approval. In each of these circumstances, where statistical sampling is involved, CBP auditors will examine only the selected sample transactions. The results of the sample examination, with respect to properly identified overpayments and over-declarations and properly identified underpayments and under-declarations, will be projected over the universe of transactions to determine the total overpayments and over-declarations that are eligible for offsetting and to determine the total loss of duties, taxes, and fees.
(5)
Same acts, statements, omissions, or entries not required.
Offsetting may be permitted where the overpayments or over-declarations were not made by the same acts, statements, or omissions that caused the underpayments or under-declarations, and is not limited to the same entries that evidence the underpayments or under-declarations, provided that they are within the time period and scope of the audit as established by CBP and as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(6)
Limitations.
Offsetting will not be allowed with respect to specific overpayments or over-declarations made for the purpose of violating any provision of law, including laws other than customs laws. Offsetting will not be allowed with respect to overpayments or over-declarations resulting from a failure to timely claim or establish a duty allowance or preference. Offsetting will be disallowed entirely where CBP determines that any underpayments or under-declarations identified for offsetting purposes were made knowingly and intentionally.
(7)
Audit report.
Where overpayments or over-declarations have been identified in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the audit report will state whether they have been made within the time period and scope of the audit.
(8)
Disallowance determinations referred to Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures office.
Any determination that offsets will be disallowed where overpayments/over-declarations were made for the purpose of violating any law, or where underpayments or under-declarations were made knowingly and intentionally, will be made by the appropriate Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures (FP
F) office to which the issue was referred. CBP will notify the audited person of a determination whether to allow offsetting in whole or in part. The FP
F office will issue a notice of penalty under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b) and/or notice of liability for lost duties, taxes, and fees under 19 U.S.C. 1592(d) where it determines that such action is warranted. If the FP
F office issues a notice of penalty, the audited person may file a petition under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b)(2), 19 U.S.C. 1618, and 19 CFR part 171 to challenge the action.
(9)
Refunds limited.
An overpayment of duties and fees will only be credited toward a refund if the circumstances of the overpayment meet the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1520 or the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1514(a) pertaining to clerical error, mistake of fact, or other inadvertence in any entry, liquidation, or reliquidation.
(e)
Sampling not evidence of reasonable care.
The fact that entries were previously within the time period and scope of an audit conducted by CBP in which sampling was employed, in any circumstances described in this section, is not evidence of reasonable care by a violator in any subsequent action involving such entries.

§ 163.12
Recordkeeping Compliance Program.
(a)
General.
The Recordkeeping Compliance Program is a voluntary CBP program under which certified recordkeepers may be eligible for alternatives to penalties (see paragraph (d) of this section) that might be assessed under § 163.6 for failure to produce a demanded entry record. However, even where a certified recordkeeper is eligible for an alternative to a penalty, participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program has no limiting effect on the authority of CBP to use a summons, court order or other legal process to compel the production of records by that certified recordkeeper.
(b)
Certification procedures
—(1)
Who may apply.
Any person described in § 163.2(a) who is required to maintain and produce entry records under this part may apply to participate in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program.
(2)
Where to apply.
An application for certification to participate in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program must be submitted to the Regulatory Audit, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 2001 Cross Beam Dr., Charlotte, North Carolina 28217. The application must be submitted in accordance with the guidelines contained in the CBP Recordkeeping Compliance Handbook which may be obtained by downloading it from CBP's Regulatory Audit Web site located at

or by writing to the Recordkeeping Compliance Program, Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20229.
(3)
Certification requirements.
A recordkeeper may be certified as a participant in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program after meeting the general recordkeeping requirements established under this section or after negotiating an alternative program suited to the needs of the recordkeeper and CBP. To be certified, a recordkeeper must be in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. CBP will take into account the size and nature of the importing business and the volume of imports and CBP workload constraints prior to granting certification. In order to be certified, a recordkeeper must meet the applicable requirements set forth in the CBP Recordkeeping Compliance Handbook and must be able to demonstrate that it:
(i) Understands the legal requirements for recordkeeping, including the nature of the records required to be maintained and produced and the time periods relating thereto;
(ii) Has in place procedures to explain the recordkeeping requirements to those employees who are involved in the preparation, maintenance and production of required records;
(iii) Has in place procedures regarding the preparation and maintenance of required records, and the production of such records to CBP;
(iv) Has designated a dependable individual or individuals to be responsible for recordkeeping compliance under the program and whose duties include maintaining familiarity with the recordkeeping requirements of CBP;
(v) Has a record maintenance procedure acceptable to CBP for original records or has an alternative records maintenance procedure adopted in accordance with § 163.5(b); and
(vi) Has procedures for notifying CBP of any occurrence of a variance from, or violation of, the requirements of the Recordkeeping Compliance Program or negotiated alternative program, as well as procedures for taking corrective action when notified by CBP of violations or problems regarding such program. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “variance” means a deviation from the Recordkeeping Compliance Program that does not involve a failure to maintain or produce records or a failure to meet the requirements set forth in this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “violation” means a deviation from the Recordkeeping Compliance Program that involves a failure to maintain or produce records or a failure to meet the requirements set forth in this section.
(c)
Application review and approval and certification process
—(1)
Review of applications.
The Charlotte regulatory audit field office will process the application and will coordinate and consult,
as may be necessary, with the appropriate CBP Headquarters and field officials. The Charlotte regulatory audit field office will review and verify the information contained in the application and may initiate an on-site verification prior to approval and certification. If an on-site visit is warranted, the Charlotte regulatory audit field office will inform the applicant. If additional information is necessary to process the application, the applicant will be notified. CBP requests for information not submitted with the application or for additional explanation of details will cause a delay in the application approval and certification of applicants and may result in the suspension of the application approval and certification process until the requested information is received by CBP.
(2)
Approval and certification.
If, upon review, CBP determines that the application should be approved and that certification should be granted, the Director of the Charlotte regulatory audit field office will issue the certification with all the applicable conditions stated therein.
(d)
Alternatives to penalties
—(1)
General.
If a certified participant in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program does not produce a demanded entry record for a specific release or provide the information contained in the demanded entry record by acceptable alternate means, CBP will, in lieu of a monetary penalty provided for in § 163.6(b), issue a written notice of violation to the person as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, provided that the certified participant is generally in compliance with the procedures and requirements of the program and provided that the violation was not a willful violation and was not a repeat violation. A willful failure to produce demanded entry records or repeated failures to produce demanded entry records may result in the issuance of penalties under § 163.6(b) and removal of certification under the program (see § 163.13) until corrective action satisfactory to CBP is taken.
(2)
Contents of notice.
A notice of violation issued to a participant in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program for failure to produce a demanded entry record or information contained therein must:
(i) State that the recordkeeper has violated the recordkeeping requirements;
(ii) Identify the record or information which was demanded and not produced;
(iii) Warn the recordkeeper that future failures to produce demanded entry records or information contained therein may result in the imposition of monetary penalties and could result in the removal of the recordkeeper from the Recordkeeping Compliance Program.
(3)
Response to notice.
Within a reasonable time after receiving written notice under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the recordkeeper must notify CBP of the steps it has taken to prevent a recurrence of the violation.
[T.D. 98-56, 63 FR 32946, June 16, 1998, as amended by CBP Dec. 12-12, 77 FR 33966, June 8, 2012]

In all other cases, the removal of certification shall be effective when the program participant has received notice under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and either no appeal has been filed within the time limit prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section or all appeal procedures thereunder have been concluded by a decision that upholds the removal action. Removal of certification may subject the affected person to penalties.

Pt. 163, App.

# Appendix to Part 163—Interim (
a

# )(1)(A) List

# List of Records Required for the Entry of Merchandise

# General Information
(1) Section 508 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1508), sets forth the general recordkeeping requirements for Customs-related activities. Section 509 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1509) sets forth the procedures for the production and examination of those records (which includes, but is not limited to, any statement, declaration, document, or electronically generated or machine readable data).
(2) Section 509(a)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by title VI of Public Law 103-182, commonly referred to as the Customs Modernization Act (19 U.S.C. 1509(a)(1)(A)), requires the production, within a reasonable time after demand by the Customs Service is made (taking into consideration the number, type and age of the item demanded) if “such record is required by law or regulation for the entry of the merchandise (whether or not the Customs Service required its presentation at the time of entry).” Section 509(e) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by Public Law 103-182 (19 U.S.C. 1509(e)) requires the Customs Service to identify and publish a list of the records and entry information that is required to be maintained and produced under subsection (a)(1)(A) of section 509 (19 U.S.C. 1509(a)(1)(A)). This list is commonly referred to as “the (a)(1)(A) list.”
(3) The Customs Service has tried to identify all the presently required entry information or records on the following list. However, as automated programs and new procedures are introduced, these may change. In addition, errors and omissions to the list may be discovered upon further review by Customs officials or the trade. Pursuant to section 509(g), the failure to produce listed records or information upon reasonable demand may result in penalty action or liquidation or reliquidation at a higher rate than entered. A recordkeeping penalty may not be assessed if the listed information or records are transmitted to and retained by Customs.
(4)
Other recordkeeping requirements:
The importing community and Customs officials are reminded that the (a)(1)(A) list only pertains to records or information required for the entry of merchandise. An owner, importer, consignee, importer of record, entry filer, or other party who imports merchandise, files a drawback claim or transports or stores bonded merchandise, any agent of the foregoing, or any person whose activities require them to file a declaration or entry, is also required to make, keep and render for examination and inspection records (including, but not limited to, statements, declarations, documents and electronically generated or machine readable data) which pertain to any such activity or the information contained in the records required by the Tariff Act in connection with any such activity, and are normally kept in the ordinary course of business. While these records are not subject to administrative penalties, they are subject to examination and/or summons by Customs officers. Failure to comply could result in the imposition of significant judicially imposed penalties and denial of import privileges.
(5) The following list does not replace entry requirements, but is merely provided for information and reference. In the case of the list conflicting with regulatory or statutory requirements, the latter will govern.

# List of Records and Information Required for the Entry of Merchandise
The following records (which include, but are not limited to, any statement, declaration, document, or electronically generated or machine readable data) are required by law or regulation for the entry of merchandise and are required to be maintained and produced to Customs upon reasonable demand (whether or not Customs required their presentation at the time of entry). Information may be submitted to Customs at the time of entry in a Customs authorized electronic or paper format. Not every entry of merchandise requires all of the following information. Only those records or information applicable to the entry requirements for the merchandise in question will be required/mandatory. The list may be amended as Customs reviews its requirements and continues to implement the Customs Modernization Act. When a record or information is filed with and retained by Customs, the record is not subject to recordkeeping penalties, although the underlying backup or supporting information from which it is obtained may also be subject to the general record retention regulations and examination or summons pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508 and 1509. (All references, unless otherwise indicated, are to the current edition of title 19, Code of Federal Regulations, as amended by subsequent

§ 165.0
Scope.
This part relates to allegations by the public and requests from Federal agencies for an investigation regarding the evasion of antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders and the procedures by which CBP investigates such claims consistent with the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA), which contains Title IV-Prevention of Evasion of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Orders (short title “Enforce and Protect Act of 2015” or “EAPA”) (Pub. L. 114-125, 130 Stat. 122, 155, Feb. 24, 2016) (19 U.S.C. 4301 note). This part includes the requirements for the filing of allegations and requests for investigations, the investigation procedures, and administrative review of determinations as to evasion of AD/CVD orders under the EAPA. The procedures under this
part are not the exclusive manner by which CBP may receive allegations or requests for an investigation from Federal agencies or investigate such allegations or requests with respect to the evasion of AD/CVD orders. An investigation as described in this part, if initiated by CBP, does not preclude CBP or any other government entity from initiating any other investigation or proceeding pursuant to any other provision of law, including proceedings initiated under 19 U.S.C. 1592.

Any interested party that makes a submission to CBP in connection with an investigation under this part, including for its initiation and administrative review, may request that CBP treat any part of the submission as business confidential information except for the information specified in paragraph (c) of this section. If the requirements of this section are satisfied and the information for which protection is sought consists of trade secrets and/or commercial or financial information obtained from any person, which is privileged or confidential in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), CBP will grant business confidential treatment and issue an administrative protective order pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section.

The submitting interested party must also provide with the claimed business confidential information an explanation of why each item of bracketed information is entitled to business confidential treatment.
(2)
Public version.
An interested party filing a submission containing claimed business confidential information must also file a public version of the submission. The public version must be filed on the same date as the business confidential version and contain a summary of the bracketed information in sufficient detail to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information. If the submitting interested party claims that summarization is not possible, the claim must be accompanied by a full explanation of the reasons supporting that claim. The public version must be clearly marked as a public version on the first page.
(b)
Nonconforming submissions.
CBP will reject a submission that includes a request for business confidential treatment but does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and will not consider or place such submission on the administrative record unless the submitting interested party takes any of the actions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section within the timeframe specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(1)
Notice of rejection.
If CBP determines that the claim of confidentiality is nonconforming, it will treat the relevant portion of the submission as business confidential information until the appropriate corrective action is taken or the submission is rejected.

Certification.
In accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, when providing a public version of their submissions, interested parties must certify that the information they are providing is either their own information (
i.e.
, information from their own business records and not business confidential information of another entity) or information that was publicly obtained or in the public domain.
(e)
Information placed on the record by CBP.
Any information that CBP places on the administrative record, when obtained other than from an interested party subject to the requirements of this section, will include a public summary of the business confidential information as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, when applicable. If CBP places information on the record from parties who are not already subject to the requirements of this section, CBP will require these parties to conform to the requirements of this section and § 165.5 when filing submissions. Otherwise, such submissions may be treated as nonconforming submissions pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and/or § 165.5(b)(4).
(f)
Administrative protective order.
In each investigation where CBP has granted a request by an interested party to treat any part of its submission as business confidential information, CBP will issue an administrative protective order which will contain terms to allow the representatives of parties to the investigation to access the business confidential information.

(b)
Submissions to CBP.
The following requirements pertain to all parties who knowingly make submissions covered in this part:

Compliance with CBP time limits
—(1)
Requests for extensions.

Such requests must be submitted no less than three business days before the time limit expires unless there are extraordinary circumstances. An extraordinary circumstance is an unexpected event that could not have been prevented even if reasonable measures had been taken by the requester. It is within CBP's reasonable discretion to determine what constitutes extraordinary circumstances, what constitutes good cause, and to grant or deny a request for an extension.
(2)
Rejection of untimely submissions.
If a submission is untimely filed, CBP will not consider it or place it on the administrative record and adverse inferences may be applied, if applicable.
[81 FR 56482, Aug. 22, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 19258, March 18, 2024]
§ 165.6
Adverse inferences.
(a)
In general.
If the party to the investigation that filed an allegation, the importer, or the foreign producer or exporter of the covered merchandise fails to cooperate and comply to the best of its ability with a request for information made by CBP, CBP may apply an inference adverse to the interests of that party in selecting from among the facts otherwise available to make the determination as to evasion pursuant to § 165.27 and subpart D of this part.
(b)
Adverse inferences described.
An adverse inference used under paragraph (a) may include reliance on information derived from an allegation, a prior determination in another CBP investigation, proceeding, or action that involves evasion of AD/CVD orders, or any other available information on the administrative record.
(c)
Application.
An adverse inference described in this section may be used with respect to the importer of the covered merchandise, or the foreign producer or exporter of the covered merchandise without regard to whether another party involved in the same transaction or transactions under examination has provided the information sought by CBP, such as import or export documentation.
[81 FR 56482, Aug. 22, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 19259, Mar. 18, 2024]

Transmission by CBP.
During the course of an investigation or administrative review of a determination as to evasion under this part, CBP will consider whether the covered merchandise may pose a health or safety risk to U.S. consumers and will take into account any notification received under paragraph (a) of this section.

Technical assistance and guidance
—(1)
Availability.
CBP will provide technical assistance and guidance for the preparation of an allegation of evasion and its submission to CBP, as described in this section.
(i)
Small businesses.
Small businesses are entitled to technical assistance upon request. In general, small businesses are eligible to make such requests if they have neither adequate internal resources nor financial ability to obtain qualified outside assistance in preparing and submitting for CBP's consideration allegations of evasion. Small businesses must satisfy the applicable standards set forth in 15 U.S.C. 632 and implemented in 13 CFR part 121.
(ii)

(2)
Requests.
Requests for technical assistance may be made at any time via the email address designated on CBP's online e-Allegations system or through any other method approved or designated by CBP.
(3)
Limitations.

§ 165.12
Receipt of allegations.
(a)
Date of receipt.
The “date of receipt” of a properly filed allegation is the date on which CBP provides an acknowledgment of receipt of an allegation containing all the information and certifications required in § 165.11, together with a CBP-assigned control number, to the party that filed the allegation. CBP has 15 business days from the date of receipt to determine whether to initiate an investigation under the EAPA.
(b)
Withdrawal.
An allegation may be withdrawn by the party that filed it if that party submits a request to withdraw the allegation to the designated email address specified by CBP or through any other method approved or designated by CBP.
[81 FR 56482, Aug. 22, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 19259, Mar. 18, 2024]
§ 165.13
Consolidation of allegations.
(a)
In general.
Multiple allegations against one or more importers may be consolidated into a single investigation at CBP's discretion. Consolidations may be made at any point prior to the issuance of a determination as to evasion with respect to a particular importer. If multiple allegations are received and consolidated prior to the initiation of an investigation, then the date of receipt of the first properly filed allegation will start the time period for the deadline to initiate the investigation described in § 165.15 with respect to that allegation.
(b)
Criteria.
CBP may consolidate multiple allegations if warranted based on the consideration of certain factors. The factors that CBP may consider include, but are not limited to, whether the multiple allegations involve:

(2) Similarity of covered merchandise;
(3) Similarity of AD/CVD orders; and
(4) Overlap in time periods for entries of covered merchandise.
(c)
Notice.
Notice of consolidation will be promptly transmitted to all parties to the investigation if consolidation occurs at a point in the investigation after which they have already been notified of the ongoing investigation.

(d)
Service requirements for other parties to the investigation.
Upon notification of consolidation, parties to the consolidated investigation must serve on the newly added parties to the investigation, via an email message or through any other method approved or designated by CBP, public documents and the public versions of any documents that were previously served on parties to the unconsolidated investigation. Service must take place within five business days of the notice of consolidation.

§ 165.14
Other Federal agency requests for investigations.
(a)
Requests for investigations.
Any other Federal agency, including but not limited to the Department of Commerce or the United States International Trade Commission, may request an investigation under this part. CBP will initiate an investigation if the Federal agency has provided information that reasonably suggests that an importer has entered covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States through evasion, unless the agency submits a request to withdraw to the designated email address specified by CBP or through any other method approved or designated by CBP.
(b)
Contents of requests.

(2)
Business confidential treatment.
CBP will create a public summary of the information required by paragraphs (b)(4) and (6) of this section.

Access to investigation.
The Federal agency is not a party to the investigation. Therefore, it will neither receive
official notice of developments after CBP's receipt of the request for an investigation nor will it receive service of any documents filed by interested parties. Only the parties to the investigation will be entitled to notice and service, as well as the related rights to administrative review and judicial review.
[81 FR 56482, Aug. 22, 2016, as amended at 89 FR 19259, Mar. 18, 2024]
§ 165.15
Initiation of investigations.
(a)
Time for determination.
CBP will make a determination as to whether to initiate an investigation on or before the 15th business day after the date on which a properly filed allegation is received under § 165.12(a) or a request for an investigation is received from a Federal agency under § 165.14.
(b)
Criteria for initiation.
CBP will initiate an investigation under subpart C of this part if the following criteria are satisfied:
(1)
Nature of merchandise.
The covered merchandise described in the allegation or Federal agency request for an investigation is properly within the scope of an AD/CVD order.

# Subpart C—Disposition of Petitions

# Source:
T.D. 00-57, 65 FR 53577, Sept. 5, 2000, unless otherwise noted.
§ 171.21
Written decisions.
If a petition for relief relates to a violation of sections 592, 593A or 641, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592, 19 U.S.C. 1593a, or 19 U.S.C. 1641), the petitioner will be provided with a written statement setting forth the decision on the matter and the findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the decision is based.
§ 171.22
Decisions effective for limited time.
A decision to mitigate a penalty or to remit a forfeiture upon condition that a stated amount is paid will be effective for not more than 60 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of such decision unless the decision itself prescribes a different effective period. If payment of the stated amount or arrangements for such payment are not made, or a supplemental petition is not filed in accordance with regulation, the full penalty or claim for forfeiture will be deemed applicable and will be enforced by promptly referring the matter, after required collection action, if appropriate, to the appropriate Office of the Chief Counsel for preparation for referral to the Department of Justice unless other action has been directed by the Commissioner of Customs.
§ 171.23
Decisions not protestable.
(a)
Mitigation decision not subject to protest.
Any decision to remit a forfeiture or mitigate a penalty is not a protestable decision as defined under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1514. Any payment made in compliance with any decision to remit a forfeiture or mitigate a penalty is not a charge or exaction and therefore is not a protestable action as defined under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1514.
(b)
Payment of mitigated amount as accord and satisfaction.
Payment of a mitigated amount in compliance with an administrative decision on a petition or supplemental petition for relief will be considered an election of administrative proceedings and full disposition of the case. Payment of a mitigated amount will act as an accord and satisfaction of the Government claim. Payment of a mitigated amount will never serve as a bar to filing a supplemental petition for relief.
§ 171.24
Remission of forfeitures and payment of fees, costs or interest.
Any seizure subject to forfeiture may be remitted or mitigated pursuant to the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1618 or 31 U.S.C. 5321, as applicable. Any person who accepts a remission or mitigation decision will not be considered to have substantially prevailed in a civil forfeiture proceeding for purposes of collection of any fees, costs or interest from the Government.

The petition must be supported by satisfactory proof that the petitioner did not know of the seizure prior to the declaration or decree of forfeiture and was in such circumstances as prevented him from knowing of it.
§ 171.44
Forfeited property authorized for official use.
If forfeited property which is the subject of a claim under section 613, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1613) has been authorized for official use, retention or delivery will be regarded as the sale thereof for the purposes of section 613.

# Subpart F—Expedited Petitioning Procedures
§ 171.51
Application and definitions.
(a)
Application.
The following definitions, regulations, and criteria are designed to establish and implement procedures required by section 6079 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-690, title VI (102 Stat. 4181). They are intended to supplement existing law and procedures relative to the forfeiture of property under the identified statutory authority. The provisions of these regulations do not affect the existing legal and equitable rights and remedies of those with an interest in property seized for forfeiture, nor do these provisions relieve interested parties from their existing obligations and responsibilities in pursuing their interests through such courses of action. These regulations are intended to reflect the intent of Congress to minimize the adverse impact occasioned by the prolonged detention of property subject to forfeiture due to violations of law involving possession of personal use quantities of controlled substances. The definition of personal use quantities of controlled substance as contained herein is intended to distinguish between those quantities small in amount which are generally considered to be possessed for personal consumption and not for distribution, and those larger quantities generally considered to be subject to distribution.
(b)
Definitions.
As used in this subpart, the following terms shall have the meanings specified:
(1)
Appraised value.
“Appraised value” has the meaning given in § 162.43(a) of this chapter.
(2)
Commercial fishing industry vessel.
“Commercial fishing industry vessel” means a vessel that:
(i) Commercially engages in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish or an activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish;
(ii) Commercially prepares fish or fish products other than by gutting, decapitating, gilling, skinning, shucking, icing, freezing, or brine chilling; or
(iii) Commercially supplies, stores, refrigerates, or transports fish, fish products, or materials directly related to fishing or the preparation of fish to or from a fishing, fish processing, or fish tender vessel or fish processing facility.
(3)
Controlled substance.
“Controlled substance” has the meaning given in 21 U.S.C. 802.
(4)
Normal and customary manner.
“Normal and customary manner” means that inquiry suggested by particular facts and circumstances which would customarily be undertaken by a reasonably prudent individual in a like or similar situation. Actual knowledge of such facts and circumstances is unnecessary, and implied, imputed, or constructive knowledge is sufficient. An established norm, standard, or custom is persuasive but not conclusive or controlling in determining whether a petitioner acted in a normal and customary manner to ascertain how property would be used by another legally in possession of the property.
(5)
Owner or interested party.
“Owner or interested party” means one having a legal and possessory interest in the property seized for foreiture or one who was in legal possession of the property at the time of seizure and is entitled to legal possession at the time of granting the petition for expedited procedure.

The agreement securing such a lien must create or provide for a security interest in the collateral, describe the collateral and be signed by the debtor.
(6)
Personal use quantities.
“Personal use quantities” means possession of controlled substances in circumstances where there is no evidence of intent to distribute, or to facilitate the manufacturing, compounding, processing, delivering, importing or exporting of any controlled substance. A quantity of a controlled substance is presumed to be for personal use if the amounts possessed do not exceed the quantities set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section if there is no evidence of illicit drug trafficking or distribution such as, but not limited to the factors set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section. The possession of a narcotic, a depressant, a stimulant, a hallucinogin or a cannabis-controlled substance will be considered in excess of personal use quantities if the dosage unit amount possessed provides the same or greater equivalent efficacy as described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.
(i)
Quantities presumed to be for personal use unless evidence of illicit drug trafficking or distribution exists.
(A) One gram of a mixture of substance containing a detectable amount of heroin;

(ii)
Evidence of possession for other than personal use.
Quantities shall not be considered to be for personal use if sweepings are present or there is other evidence of possession for other than personal use such as:
(A) Evidence such as drug scales, drug distribution paraphernalia, drug records, drug packaging material, method of drug packaging, drug “cutting” agents and other equipment, that indicates an intent to process, package or distribute a controlled substance;
(B) Information from reliable sources indicating possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute;
(C) The arrest and/or conviction record of the person or persons in actual or constructive possession of the controlled substance for offenses under Federal, State or local law that indicates an intent to distribute a controlled substance;
(D) The controlled substance is related to large amounts of cash or any amount of prerecorded government funds;
(E) The controlled substance is possessed under circumstances that indicate such a controlled substance is a sample intended for distribution in anticipation of a transaction involving large quantities, or is part of a larger delivery; or

§ 171.52
Petition for expedited procedures in an administrative forfeiture proceeding.
(a)
Procedures for violations involving possession of controlled substance in personal use quantities.
The usual procedures for petitions for relief when property is seized are set forth in subpart B of this part. However, where property is seized for administrative forfeiture pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1595a due to violations involving controlled substances in personal use quantities, a petition may be filed pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section to seek expedited procedures for release of the property. A petition filed pursuant to this subpart shall also serve as a petition for relief filed under subpart B of this part. The petition may be filed by an owner or interested party.
(b)
Commercial fishing industry vessels.
Where a commercial fishing industry vessel proceeding to or from a fishing area or intermediate port of call or actually engaged in fishing operations is subject to seizure for administrative forfeiture for a violation of law involving controlled substances in personal use quantities, a summons to appear shall be issued in lieu of a physical seizure. The vessel shall report to the port designated in the summons no later than the date specified in the summons. When a commercial fishing industry vessel reports, the appropriate Customs officer shall, depending on the facts and circumstances, either issue another summons to appear at a time deemed appropriate, execute a constructive seizure agreement pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1605, or take physical custody of the vessel. When a summons to appear has been issued, the seizing agency may be authorized to institute administrative forfeiture as if the vessel had been physically seized. When a summons to appear has been issued, the owner or interested party may file
a petition for expedited procedures pursuant to subsection (a); the provisions of subsection (a) and other provisions in this subpart relating to a petition for expedited release shall apply as if the vessel had been physically seized.
(c)
Elements to be established in petition.
(1) The petition for expedited procedures shall establish that:
(i) The petitioner has a valid, good faith interest in the seized property as owner or otherwise;
(ii) The petitioner reasonably attempted to ascertain the use of the property in a normal and customary manner; and
(iii) The petitioner did not know or consent to the illegal use of the property or, in the event that the petitioner knew or should have known of the illegal use, the petitioner did what reasonably could be expected to prevent the violation.
(2) In addition, the petitioner may submit evidence to establish that he has statutory rights or defenses such that he would prevail in a judicial proceeding on the issue of forfeiture.
(d)
Manner of filing.
A petition for expedited procedures must be filed in a timely manner to be considered by Customs. To be filed in a timely manner, the petition must be received by Customs within 20 days from the date the notice of seizure was mailed, or in the case of a commercial fishing industry vessel for which a summons to appear is issued, 20 days from the original date when the vessel is required to report. The petition must be sworn to by the petitioner and signed by the petitioner or his attorney at law. If the petitioner is a corporation, the petition may be sworn to by an officer or responsible supervisory employee thereof and signed by that individual or an attorney at law representing the corporation. Both the envelope and the request must be clearly marked “PETITION FOR EXPEDITED PROCEDURES.” The petition shall be addressed to the U.S. Customs Service and filed in triplicate with the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer for the port where the property was seized, or for commercial fishing industry vessels, with the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer for the port to which the vessel was required to report.
(e)
Contents of petition.
The petition shall include the following:
(1) A complete description of the property, including identification numbers, if any, and the date and place of the violation and seizure;
(2) A description of the petitioner's interest in the property, supported by the documentation, bills of sale, contracts, mortgages, or other satisfactory documentary evidence; and
(3) A statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon by the petitioner to justify expedited return of the seized property, supported by satisfactory evidence.

§ 171.53
Ruling on petition for expedited procedures.
(a)
Final administrative determination.
Upon receipt of a petition filed pursuant to § 171.52, Customs shall determine first whether a final administrative determination of the case can be made within 21 days of the seizure. If such a final administrative determination is made within 21 days, no further action need be taken under this subpart.
(b)
Determination within 20 days.
If no such final administrative determination is made within 21 days of the seizure, Customs shall within 20 days after the receipt of the petition make a determination as follows:
(1) If Customs determines that the factors listed in § 171.52(c) have been established, it shall terminate the administrative proceedings and release the property from seizure, or in the case of a commercial fishing industry vessel for which a summons has been issued, but not yet answered, dismiss the summons. The property shall not be returned if it is evidence of a violation of law.
(2) If Customs determines that the factors listed in § 171.52(c) have not been established, it shall proceed with the administrative forfeiture.

(a)
Substitute res.
Where property is seized for administrative forfeiture for a violation involving controlled substances in personal use quantities, the owner or interested party may offer to post an amount equal to the appraised value of the property (the res) to obtain release of the property. The offer, which may be tendered at any time subsequent to seizure and up until the completion of administrative forfeiture proceedings, must be in the form of cash, irrevocable letter of credit, certified funds such as a certified check, traveler's check(s), or money order made payable to U.S. Customs. Unless the property is evidence of a violation of law or has other characteristics that particularly suit it for use in illegal activities, it will be released to the owner or interested party subsequent to tender of the substitute res.
(b)
Forfeiture of res.
If a substitute res is posted and it is determined that the property should be administratively forfeited, the res will be forfeited in lieu of the property.
[T.D. 89-86, 54 FR 37602, Sept. 11, 1989]

(b)
Notice provision.
The notice as required by section 1607 of Title 19, United States Code and applicable regulations shall be made at the earliest practicable opportunity after determining ownership of, or interest in, the seized property and shall include a statement of the applicable law under which the property is seized and a statement of the circumstances of the seizure sufficiently precise to enable an owner or interested party to identify the date, place and use or acquisition which makes the property subject to forfeiture.

§ 171.61
Time and place of filing.
If the petitioner is not satisfied with a decision of the deciding official on an original petition for relief, a supplemental petition may be filed with the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer having jurisdiction in the port where the violation occurred. Such supplemental petition must be filed within 60 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of the decision from which further relief is requested or within 60 days following an administrative or judicial decision with respect to the entries involved in a penalty case which reduces the loss of duties upon which the mitigated penalty amount was based (whichever is later) unless another time to file such a supplemental petition is prescribed in the decision. The filing of a supplemental petition may be subject to the conditions prescribed in § 171.64 of this part. A supplemental petition may be filed whether or not the mitigated penalty or forfeiture remission amount designated in the decision on the original petition is paid.
§ 171.62
Supplemental petition decision authority.
(a)
Decisions of Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officers.
Supplemental petitions filed on cases where the original decision was made by the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer, will be initially reviewed by that official. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may choose to grant more relief and issue a decision indicating that additional relief to the petitioner. If the petitioner is dissatisfied with the further relief granted or if the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer decides to grant no further relief, the supplemental petition will be forwarded to a
designated Headquarters official assigned to a field location for review and decision, except that supplemental petitions filed in cases involving violations of 19 U.S.C. 1641 where the amount of the penalty assessed exceeds $10,000 will be forwarded to the Chief, Penalties Branch, Border Security and Trade Compliance Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade.
(b)
Decisions of CBP Headquarters.
Supplemental petitions filed on cases where the original decision was made by the Chief, Penalties Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, CBP Headquarters, will be forwarded to the Director, Border Security and Trade Compliance Division, CBP Headquarters, for review and decision.

When one or more of the following mitigating factors are present, the deciding officer may, within his discretion, remit the liabilities upon payment of Between One and One-Half and Three Times the Duty or the domestic value, whichever is lower:
a. Communications with the violator are impaired because of language barrier, mental condition, or physical ailment;
b. Violator cooperates with Customs officers after discovery of the violation by providing additional information which facilitates conclusion of the case;
c. Violator is an inexperienced traveler;
d. There is contributory Customs error (for example, violator demonstrates he was given incorrect advice by a Customs officer).
3.
Aggravating Factors.
When one or more of the following aggravating factors are present, the deciding officer may, within his discretion, remit the liabilities upon payment of Between Three and Six Times the Duty (but not less than $100), or the domestic value, whichever is lower:
a. Documentary or other evidence discovered establishes violator's intent;
b. Informant provides information which tends to establish violator's intent and leads to discovery of the violation after the violator has been given an opportunity to properly declare;
c. Violator is an experienced traveler;
d. Undeclared articles are concealed to evade U.S. law;
e. There is behavior, including extreme lack of cooperation, verbal or physical abuse, or attempted escape, which tends to demonstrate a lack of respect for law and authority.
4.
Commercial Articles.
When the undeclared articles are brought in for commercial purposes, the liabilities shall be remitted upon the payment of Six Times the Duty (but not less than $100), or the domestic value, whichever is lower. Mitigating factors may be used to lower this amount to as little as Three Times the Duty; aggravating factors may be used to increase this amount up to Eight Times the Duty.
5.
Extraordinary Mitigating Factor.
a. When an individual who has been cleared through Customs without discovery of any undeclared article returns to the examination area and declares that article, the deciding officer may, within his discretion, remit the liabilities upon payment of One Times the Duty.
b. An individual who declares articles some time later (hours, days, weeks, etc.) may be treated similarly.
6.
Extraordinary Aggravating Factors.
a. When the offense is a second or subsequent violation, the deciding officer may,
within his discretion, remit the liabilities upon payment of Between Six and Eight Times the Duty (but not less than $250), or the domestic value, whichever is lower.
b. When the offense is a second or subsequent violation, and there are aggravating factors present, generally there shall either be a denial of relief or mitigation to No Less Than Eight Times the Duty or the domestic value, whichever is lower.
c. When there is evidence of an ongoing scheme to defraud the revenue involving multiple entries without declaration of articles subject to declaration, the deciding officer shall act in accordance with the preceding paragraph.
II.
Violations Involving Absolutely or Conditionally Free Articles.
For violations involving articles either entitled to entry free of duty absolutely (classifiable under a duty-free provision in Chapters 1-97, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS); (19 U.S.C. 1202)), or entry free of duty conditionally (entitled to treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (see §§ 10.171-10.178, Customs Regulations) or Chapter 98, HTSUS), the following rules apply:
1.
Mitigated Penalty for First Offense.
a. For violations which are first offense, and involve articles entitled to the benefit of GSP or Chapter 98, HTSUS, the liabilities shall be remitted upon payment of One Times the Duty which would have been due if the articles had not been entitled to the benefit.
b. For violations which are first offense, and involve absolutely duty-free articles, the liabilities shall be remitted upon payment of Between One and Five Percent of the Domestic Value, but not less than $50 (or the domestic value, whichever is less) nor more than $1,000.
2.
Mitigating Factors.
When mitigating factors such as those outlined above are present, the deciding officer may, in his discretion, reduce the mitigated amount to a lower figure.
3.
Aggravating Factors.
a. When aggravating factors such as those outlined above are present, the deciding officer may, in his discretion, remit the liabilities for conditionally free articles upon the payment of Between One and Two Times the Duty (but not less than $100), or the domestic value, whichever is lower.
b. For absolutely free articles, the deciding officer may remit the liabilities upon payment of Between Five and Ten Percent of the Domestic Value, but not less than $100.
4.
Commercial Merchandise.
The fact that undeclared duty-free articles are imported for commercial purposes may be considered an aggravating factor under section II.3. of these guidelines.
III.
Other Applicable Rules.
1. These guidelines provide a framework and procedure by which violations of 19 U.S.C. 1497 are to be analyzed. They are not mandatory in the sense that they must be absolutely applied. Customs officers varying from these guidelines must provide reasons for doing so in the case record.
2. Customs officers shall document mitigating and aggravating factors found in each case in the case file. There must be a basis shown for mitigated amounts.
3. It is intended that mitigating and aggravating factors shall be considered together and used to offset each other where appropriate.
4. The rate of duty to be used in calculating the mitigated penalty shall be the appropriate rate from Chapters 1-97, HTSUS, and not the flat rate from Chapter 98, HTSUS.
5. “Duty” means Customs duties and any internal revenue taxes which would have attached upon importation (see section 101.1(i), Customs Regulations). Therefore, multiples will also be applied to internal revenue taxes which would have been due.
6. Customs officers may, within their discretion, consider other factors not here delineated as aggravating or mitigating and apply the guidelines accordingly. These additional factors must also be documented in the case file.
7. These guidelines are not authority for admitting into the commerce of the United States articles which are conditionally or absolutely prohibited from entry.
8. The presence of one or more extraordinary aggravating factors, including but not limited to those set forth in section I.6. of these guidelines, may within the discretion of the deciding officer be a basis for denial of relief.
9. If the violator is being prosecuted criminally, the civil (19 U.S.C. 1497) liability generally is administratively settled only after completion of the prosecution or with the express approval of the appropriate U.S. attorney. Criminal prosecution of the violator, however, is insufficient grounds to delay indefinitely determination of the civil liability. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer should contact the Chief Counsel representative in the field to determine the best course of action to follow with respect to the civil liability. Chief Counsel representative will consult with the U.S. attorney and the Penalties Branch at Customs Headquarters. Because of time delay problems, all
seizures
involving criminal prosecutions must be promptly coordinated in this manner, and consideration should be given to immediate referral of the forfeiture action to the U.S.
attorney for the institution of a judicial proceeding.

Pt. 171, App. B

# Appendix B to Part 171—Customs Regulations, Guidelines for the Imposition and Mitigation of Penalties for Violations of 19 U.S.C. 1592
A monetary penalty incurred under section 592 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592; hereinafter referred to as section 592) may be remitted or mitigated under section 618 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1618), if it is determined that there are mitigating circumstances to justify remission or mitigation. The guidelines below will be used by the Customs Service in arriving at a just and reasonable assessment and disposition of liabilities arising under section 592 within the stated limitations. It is intended that these guidelines shall be applied by Customs officers in pre-penalty proceedings and in determining the monetary penalty assessed in any penalty notice. The assessed penalty or penalty amount set forth in Customs administrative disposition determined in accordance with these guidelines does not limit the penalty amount which the Government may seek in bringing a civil enforcement action pursuant to section 592(e). It should be understood that any mitigated penalty is conditioned upon payment of any actual loss of duty as well as a release by the party that indicates that the mitigation decision constitutes full accord and satisfaction. Further, mitigation decisions are not rulings within the meaning of part 177 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 177). Lastly, these guidelines may supplement, and are not intended to preclude application of, any other special guidelines promulgated by Customs.

# (A) Violations of Section 592
Without regard to whether the United States is or may be deprived of all or a portion of any lawful duty, tax or fee thereby, a violation of section 592 occurs when a person, through fraud, gross negligence, or negligence, enters, introduces, or attempts to enter or introduce any merchandise into the commerce of the United States by means of any document, electronic transmission of data or information, written or oral statement, or act that is material and false, or any omission that is material; or when a person aids or abets any other person in the entry, introduction, or attempted entry or introduction of merchandise by such means. It should be noted that the language “entry, introduction, or attempted entry or introduction” encompasses placing merchandise in-bond (e.g., filing an immediate transportation application). There is no violation if the falsity or omission is due solely to clerical error or mistake of fact, unless the error or mistake is part of a pattern of negligent conduct. Also, the unintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error generally will not constitute a pattern of negligent conduct. Nevertheless, if Customs has drawn the party's attention to the unintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error, subsequent failure to correct the error could constitute a violation of section 592. Also, the unintentional repetition of a clerical mistake over a significant period of time or involving many entries could indicate a pattern of negligent conduct and a failure to exercise reasonable care.

# (B) Definition of Materiality Under Section 592
A document, statement, act, or omission is material if it has the natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing agency action including, but not limited to a Customs action regarding: (1) Determination of the classification, appraisement, or admissibility of merchandise (e.g., whether merchandise is prohibited or restricted); (2) determination of an importer's liability for duty (including marking, antidumping, and/or countervailing duty); (3) collection and reporting of accurate trade statistics; (4) determination as to the source, origin, or quality of merchandise; (5) determination of whether an unfair trade practice has been committed under the anti-dumping or countervailing duty laws or a similar statute; (6) determination of whether an unfair act has been committed involving patent, trademark, or copyright infringement; or (7) the determination of whether any other unfair trade practice has been committed in violation of federal law. The “but for” test of materiality is inapplicable under section 592.

# (C) Degrees of Culpability Under Section 592
The three degrees of culpability under section 592 for the purposes of administrative proceedings are:
(1)
Negligence.
A violation is determined to be negligent if it results from an act or acts (of commission or omission) done through either the failure to exercise the degree of reasonable care and competence expected from a person in the same circumstances either: (a) in ascertaining the facts or in drawing inferences therefrom, in ascertaining the offender's obligations under the statute; or (b) in communicating information in a manner so that it may be understood by the recipient. As a general rule, a violation is negligent if it results from failure to exercise reasonable care and competence: (a) to ensure that statements made and information provided in connection with the importation
of merchandise are complete and accurate; or (b) to perform any material act required by statute or regulation.
(2)
Gross Negligence.
A violation is deemed to be grossly negligent if it results from an act or acts (of commission or omission) done with actual knowledge of or wanton disregard for the relevant facts and with indifference to or disregard for the offender's obligations under the statute.
(3)
Fraud.
A violation is determined to be fraudulent if a material false statement, omission, or act in connection with the transaction was committed (or omitted) knowingly,
i.e.,
was done voluntarily and intentionally, as established by clear and convincing evidence.

# (D) Discussion of Additional Terms
(1)
Duty Loss Violations.
A section 592 duty loss violation involves those cases where there has been a loss of duty including any marking, anti-dumping, or countervailing duties, or any tax and fee (e.g., merchandise processing and/or harbor maintenance fees) attributable to an alleged violation.
(2)
Non-duty Loss Violations.
A section 592 non-duty loss violation involves cases where the record indicates that an alleged violation is principally attributable to, for example, evasion of a prohibition, restriction, or other non-duty related consideration involving the importation of the merchandise.
(3)
Actual Loss of Duties.
An actual loss of duty occurs where there is a loss of duty including any marking, anti-dumping, or countervailing duties, or any tax and fee (e.g., merchandise processing and/or harbor maintenance fees) attributable to a liquidated Customs entry, and the merchandise covered by the entry has been entered or introduced (or attempted to be entered or introduced) in violation of section 592.
(4)
Potential Loss of Duties.
A potential loss of duty occurs where an entry remains unliquidated and there is a loss of duty, including any marking, anti-dumping or countervailing duties or any tax and fee (e.g., merchandise processing and/or harbor maintenance fees) attributable to a violation of section 592, but the violation was discovered prior to liquidation. In addition, a potential loss of duty exists where Customs discovers the violation and corrects the entry to reflect liquidation at the proper classification and value. In other words, the potential loss in such cases equals the amount of duty, tax and fee that would have occurred had Customs not discovered the violation prior to liquidation and taken steps to correct the entry.
(5)
Total Loss of Duty.
The total loss of duty is the sum of any actual and potential loss of duty attributable to alleged violations of section 592 in a particular case. Payment of any actual and/or potential loss of duty shall not affect or reduce the total loss of duty used for assessing penalties as set forth in these guidelines. The “multiples” set forth below in paragraph (F)(2) involving assessment and disposition of cases shall utilize the “total loss of duty” amount in arriving at the appropriate assessment or disposition.
(6)
Reasonable Care.
General Standard: All parties, including importers of record or their agents, are required to exercise reasonable care in fulfilling their responsibilities involving entry of merchandise. These responsibilities include, but are not limited to: providing a classification and value for the merchandise; furnishing information sufficient to permit Customs to determine the final classification and valuation of merchandise; taking measures that will lead to and assure the preparation of accurate documentation, and determining whether any applicable requirements of law with respect to these issues are met. In addition, all parties, including the importer, must use reasonable care to provide accurate information or documentation to enable Customs to determine if the merchandise may be released. Customs may consider an importer's failure to follow a binding Customs ruling a lack of reasonable care. In addition, unreasonable classification will be considered a lack of reasonable care (e.g., imported snow skis are classified as water skis). Failure to exercise reasonable care in connection with the importation of merchandise may result in imposition of a section 592 penalty for fraud, gross negligence or negligence.
(7)
Clerical Error.
A clerical error is an error in the preparation, assembly or submission of import documentation or information provided to Customs that results from a mistake in arithmetic or transcription that is not part of a pattern of negligence. The mere non-intentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error does not constitute a pattern of negligence. Nevertheless, as stated earlier, if Customs has drawn a party's attention to the non-intentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error, subsequent failure to correct the error could constitute a violation of section 592. Also, the unintentional repetition of a clerical mistake over a significant period of time or involving many entries could indicate a pattern of negligent conduct and a failure to exercise reasonable care.
(8)
Mistake of Fact.
A mistake of fact is a false statement or omission that is based on a bona fide erroneous belief as to the facts, so long as the belief itself did not result from negligence in ascertaining the accuracy of the facts.

# (E) Penalty Assessment
(1)
Case Initiation—Pre-penalty Notice.
(a)
Generally.
As provided in § 162.77, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 162.77), if the appropriate Customs field officer has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of section 592 has occurred and determines that further proceedings are warranted, the Customs field officer will issue to each person concerned a notice of intent to issue a claim for a monetary penalty (
i.e.,
the “pre-penalty notice”). In issuing such a pre-penalty notice, the Customs field officer will make a tentative determination of the degree of culpability and the amount of the proposed claim. Payment of any actual and/or potential loss of duty will not affect or reduce the total loss of duty used for assessing penalties as set forth in these guidelines. The “multiples” set forth in paragraphs (F)(2)(a)(i), (b)(i) and (c)(i) involving assessment and disposition of duty loss violation cases will use the amount of total loss of duty in arriving at the appropriate assessment or disposition. Further, where separate duty loss and non-duty loss violations occur on the same entry, it is within the Customs field officer's discretion to assess both duty loss and non-duty loss penalties, or only one of them. Where only one of the penalties is assessed, the Customs field officer has the discretion to select which penalty (duty loss or non-duty loss) shall be assessed. Also, where there is a violation accompanied by an incidental or nominal loss of duties, the Customs field officer may assess a non-duty loss penalty where the incidental or nominal duty loss resulted from a separate non-duty loss violation. The Customs field officer will propose a level of culpability in the pre-penalty notice that conforms to the level of culpability suggested by the evidence at the time of issuance. Moreover, the pre-penalty notice will include a statement that it is Customs practice to base its actions on the earliest point in time that the statute of limitations may be asserted (
i.e.,
the date of occurrence of the alleged violation) inasmuch as the final resolution of a case in court may be less than a finding of fraud. A pre-penalty notice that is issued to a party in a case where Customs determines a claimed prior disclosure is not valid—owing to the disclosing party's knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation of a disclosed violation—will include a copy of a written document that evidences the commencement of a formal investigation. In addition, a pre-penalty notice is not required if a violation involves a non-commercial importation or if the proposed claim does not exceed $1,000. Special guidelines relating to penalty assessment and dispositions involving “Arriving Travelers,” are set forth in section (L) below.
(b)
Pre-penalty Notice—Proposed Claim Amount
(i)
Fraud.
In general, if a violation is determined to be the result of fraud, the proposed claim ordinarily will be assessed in an amount equal to the domestic value of the merchandise. Exceptions to assessing the penalty at the domestic value may be warranted in unusual circumstances such as a case where the domestic value of the merchandise is disproportionately high in comparison to the loss of duty attributable to an alleged violation (e.g., a total loss of duty of $10,000 involving 10 entries with a total domestic value of $2,000,000). Also, it is incumbent upon the appropriate Customs field officer to consider whether mitigating factors are present warranting a reduction in the customary domestic value assessment. In all section 592 cases of this nature regardless of the dollar amount of the proposed claim, the Customs field officer will obtain the approval of the Penalties Branch at Headquarters prior to issuance of a pre-penalty notice at an amount less than domestic value.
(ii)
Gross Negligence and Negligence.
In determining the amount of the proposed claim in cases involving gross negligence and negligence, the appropriate Customs field officer will take into account the gravity of the offense, the amount of loss of duty, the extent of wrongdoing, mitigating or aggravating factors, and other factors bearing upon the seriousness of a violation, but in no case will the assessed penalty exceed the statutory ceilings prescribed in section 592. In cases involving gross negligence and negligence, penalties equivalent to the ceilings stated in paragraphs (F)(2)(b) and (c) regarding disposition of cases may be appropriate in cases involving serious violations, e.g., violations involving a high loss of duty or significant evasion of import prohibitions or restrictions. A “serious” violation need not result in a loss of duty. The violation may be serious because it affects the admissibility of merchandise or the enforcement of other laws, as in the case of quota evasions, false statements made to conceal the dumping of merchandise, or violations of exclusionary orders of the International Trade Commission.
(c)
Technical Violations.
Violations where the loss of duty is nonexistent or minimal and/or that have an insignificant impact on enforcement of the laws of the United States may justify a proposed penalty in a fixed amount not related to the value of merchandise, but an amount believed sufficient to have a deterrent effect: e.g., violations involving the subsequent sale of merchandise or vehicles entered for personal use; violations involving failure to comply with declaration or entry requirements that do not change the admissibility or entry status of merchandise or its appraised value or classification; violations involving the illegal diversion to domestic use of instruments of international traffic; and local point-to-point traffic violations. Generally, a penalty
in a fixed amount ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 is appropriate in cases where there are no prior violations of the same kind. However, fixed sums ranging from $2,000 to $10,000 may be appropriate in the case of multiple or repeated violations. Fixed sum penalty amounts are not subject to further mitigation and may not exceed the maximum amounts stated in section 592 and in these guidelines.
(d)
Statute of Limitations Considerations—Waivers.
Prior to issuance of any section 592 pre-penalty notice, the appropriate Customs field officer will calculate the statute of limitations attributable to an alleged violation. Inasmuch as section 592 cases are reviewed de novo by the Court of International Trade, the statute of limitations calculation in cases alleging fraud should assume a level of culpability of gross negligence or negligence,
i.e.,
ordinarily applying a shorter period of time for statute of limitations purposes. In accordance with section 162.78 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 162.78), if less than 1 year remains before the statute of limitations may be raised as a defense, a shortened response time may be specified in the notice—but in no case, less than 7 business days from the date of mailing. In cases of shortened response times, the Customs field officer should notify alleged violators by telephone and use all reasonable means (e.g., facsimile transmission of a copy of the notice) to expedite receipt of the notice by the alleged violators. Also in such cases, the appropriate Customs field officer should advise the alleged violator that additional time to respond to the pre-penalty notice will be granted only if an acceptable waiver of the statute of limitations is submitted to Customs. With regard to waivers of the statute of limitations, it is Customs practice to request waivers concurrently both from all potential alleged violators and their sureties.
(2)
Closure of Case or Issuance of Penalty Notice.
(a)
Case Closure.
The appropriate Customs field officer may find, after consideration of the record in the case, including any pre-penalty response/oral presentation, that issuance of a penalty notice is not warranted. In such cases, the Customs field officer will provide written notification to the alleged violator who received the subject pre-penalty notice that the case is closed.
(b)
Issuance of Penalty Notice.
In the event that circumstances warrant issuance of a notice of penalty pursuant to § 162.79 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 162.79), the appropriate Customs field officer will give consideration to all available evidence with respect to the existence of material false statements or omissions (including evidence presented by an alleged violator), the degree of culpability, the existence of a prior disclosure, the seriousness of the violation, and the existence of mitigating or aggravating factors. In cases involving fraud, the penalty notice will be in the amount of the domestic value of the merchandise unless a lesser amount is warranted as described in paragraph (E)(1)(b)(i). In general, the degree of culpability or proposed penalty amount stated in a pre-penalty notice will not be increased in the penalty notice. If, subsequent to the issuance of a pre-penalty notice and upon further review of the record, the appropriate Customs field officer determines that a higher degree of culpability exists, the original pre-penalty notice should be rescinded and a new pre-penalty notice issued that indicates the higher degree of culpability and increased proposed penalty amount. However, if less than 9 months remain before expiration of the statute of limitations or any waiver thereof by the party named in the pre-penalty notice, the higher degree of culpability and higher penalty amount may be indicated in the notice of penalty without rescinding the earlier pre-penalty notice. In such cases, the Customs field officer will consider whether a lower degree of culpability is appropriate or whether to change the information contained in the pre-penalty notice.
(c)
Statute of Limitations Considerations.
Prior to issuance of any section 592 penalty notice, the appropriate Customs field officer again shall calculate the statute of limitations attributable to the alleged violation and request a waiver(s) of the statute, if necessary. In accordance with part 171 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 171), if less than 180 days remain before the statute of limitations may be raised as a defense, a shortened response time may be specified in the notice—but in no case less than 7 business days from the date of mailing. In such cases, the Customs field officer should notify an alleged violator by telephone and use all reasonable means (e.g., facsimile transmission of a copy) to expedite receipt of the penalty notice by the alleged violator. Also, in such cases, the Customs field officer should advise an alleged violator that, if an acceptable waiver of the statute of limitations is provided, additional time to respond to the penalty notice may be granted.

# (F) Administrative Penalty Disposition
(1)
Generally.
It is the policy of the Department of the Treasury and the Customs Service to grant mitigation in appropriate circumstances. In certain cases, based upon criteria to be developed by Customs, mitigation may take an alternative form, whereby a violator may eliminate or reduce his or her section 592 penalty liability by taking action(s) to correct problems that caused the violation. In any case, in determining the administrative section 592 penalty disposition, the appropriate Customs field officer will consider the entire case record—taking into
account the presence of any mitigating or aggravating factors. All such factors should be set forth in the written administrative section 592 penalty decision. Once again, Customs emphasizes that any penalty liability which is mitigated is conditioned upon payment of any actual loss of duty in addition to that penalty as well as a release by the party that indicates that the mitigation decision constitutes full accord and satisfaction. Finally, section 592 penalty dispositions in duty-loss and non-duty-loss cases will proceed in the manner set forth below.
(2)
Dispositions.
(a)
Fraudulent Violation.
Penalty dispositions for a fraudulent violation will be calculated as follows:
(i)
Duty Loss Violation.
An amount ranging from a minimum of 5 times the total loss of duty to a maximum of 8 times the total loss of duty—but in any such case the amount may not exceed the domestic value of the merchandise. A penalty disposition greater than 8 times the total loss of duty may be imposed in a case involving an egregious violation, or a public health and safety violation, or due to the presence of aggravating factors, but again, the amount may not exceed the domestic value of the merchandise.
(ii)
Non-Duty Loss Violation.
An amount ranging from a minimum of 50 percent of the dutiable value to a maximum of 80 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise. A penalty disposition greater than 80 percent of the dutiable value may be imposed in a case involving an egregious violation, or a public health and safety violation, or due to the presence of aggravating factors, but the amount may not exceed the domestic value of the merchandise.
(b)
Grossly Negligent Violation.
Penalty dispositions for a grossly negligent violation shall be calculated as follows:
(i)
Duty Loss Violation.
An amount ranging from a minimum of 2.5 times the total loss of duty to a maximum of 4 times the total loss of duty—but in any such case, the amount may not exceed the domestic value of the merchandise.
(ii)
Non-Duty Loss Violation.
An amount ranging from a minimum of 25 percent of the dutiable value to a maximum of 40 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise—but in any such case, the amount may not exceed the domestic value of the merchandise.
(c)
Negligent Violation.
Penalty dispositions for a negligent violation shall be calculated as follows:
(i)
Duty Loss Violation.
An amount ranging from a minimum of 0.5 times the total loss of duty to a maximum of 2 times the total loss of duty but, in any such case, the amount may not exceed the domestic value of the merchandise.
(ii)
Non-Duty Loss Violation.
An amount ranging from a minimum of 5 percent of the dutiable value to a maximum of 20 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise, but, in any such case, the amount may not exceed the domestic value of the merchandise.
(d)
Authority to Cancel Claim.
Upon issuance of a penalty notice, Customs has set forth its formal monetary penalty claim. Except as provided in 19 CFR part 171, in those section 592 cases within the administrative jurisdiction of the concerned Customs field office, the appropriate Customs field officer will cancel any such formal claim whenever it is determined that an essential element of the alleged violation is not established by the agency record, including pre-penalty and penalty responses provided by the alleged violator. Except as provided in 19 CFR part 171, in those section 592 cases within Customs Headquarters jurisdiction, the appropriate Customs field officer will cancel any such formal claim whenever it is determined that an essential element of the alleged violation is not established by the agency record, and such cancellation action precedes the date of the Customs field officer's receipt of the alleged violator's petition responding to the penalty notice. On and after the date of Customs receipt of the petition responding to the penalty notice, jurisdiction over the action rests with Customs Headquarters including the authority to cancel the claim.
(e)
Remission of Claim.
If the Customs field officer believes that a claim for monetary penalty should be remitted for a reason not set forth in these guidelines, the Customs field officer should first seek approval from the Chief, Penalties Branch, Customs Service Headquarters.
(f)
Prior Disclosure Dispositions.
It is the policy of the Department of the Treasury and the Customs Service to encourage the submission of valid prior disclosures that comport with the laws, regulations, and policies governing this provision of section 592. Customs will determine the validity of the prior disclosure including whether or not the prior disclosure sets forth all the required elements of a violation of section 592. A valid prior disclosure warrants the imposition of the reduced Customs civil penalties set forth below:
(1)
Fraudulent Violation.
(a)
Duty Loss Violation.
The claim for monetary penalty shall be equal to 100 percent of the total loss of duty (
i.e.,
actual + potential) resulting from the violation. No mitigation will be afforded.
(b)
Non-Duty Loss Violation.
The claim for monetary penalty shall be equal to 10 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise in question. No mitigation will be afforded.
(2)
Gross Negligence and Negligence Violation.
(a)
Duty Loss Violation.
The claim for monetary penalty shall be equal to the interest on the actual loss of duty computed from the date of liquidation to the date of the party's tender of the actual loss of duty resulting from the violation. Customs notes that there
is no monetary penalty in these cases if the duty loss is potential in nature. Absent extraordinary circumstances, no mitigation will be afforded.
(b)
Non-Duty Loss Violation.
There is no monetary penalty in such cases and any claim for monetary penalty which had been issued prior to the decision granting prior disclosure will be remitted in full.

# (G) Mitigating Factors
The following factors will be considered in mitigation of the proposed or assessed penalty claim or the amount of the administrative penalty decision, provided that the case record sufficiently establishes their existence. The list is not all-inclusive.
(1)
Contributory Customs Error.
This factor includes misleading or erroneous advice given by a Customs official
in writing
to the alleged violator, or established by a contemporaneously created written Customs record, only if it appears that the alleged violator reasonably relied upon the information and the alleged violator fully and accurately informed Customs of all relevant facts. The concept of comparative negligence may be utilized in determining the weight to be assigned to this factor. If it is determined that the Customs error was the sole cause of the violation, the proposed or assessed penalty claim shall be canceled. If the Customs error contributed to the violation, but the violator also is culpable, the Customs error will be considered as a mitigating factor.
(2)
Cooperation with the Investigation.
To obtain the benefits of this factor, the violator must exhibit extraordinary cooperation beyond that expected from a person under investigation for a Customs violation. Some examples of the cooperation contemplated include assisting Customs officers to an unusual degree in auditing the books and records of the violator (e.g., incurring extraordinary expenses in providing computer runs solely for submission to Customs to assist the agency in cases involving an unusually large number of entries and/or complex issues). Another example consists of assisting Customs in obtaining additional information relating to the subject violation or other violations. Merely providing the books and records of the violator should not be considered cooperation justifying mitigation inasmuch as Customs has the right to examine an importer's books and records pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508-1509.
(3)
Immediate Remedial Action.
This factor includes the payment of the actual loss of duty prior to the issuance of a penalty notice and within 30 days after Customs notifies the alleged violator of the actual loss of duties attributable to the alleged violation. In appropriate cases, where the violator provides evidence that immediately after learning of the violation, substantial remedial action was taken to correct organizational or procedural defects, immediate remedial action may be granted as a mitigating factor. Customs encourages immediate remedial action to ensure against future incidents of non-compliance.
(4)
Inexperience in Importing.
Inexperience is a factor only if it contributes to the violation and the violation is not due to fraud or gross negligence.
(5)
Prior Good Record.
Prior good record is a factor only if the alleged violator is able to demonstrate a consistent pattern of importations without violation of section 592, or any other statute prohibiting false or fraudulent importation practices. This factor will not be considered in alleged fraudulent violations of section 592.
(6)
Inability to Pay the Customs Penalty.
The party claiming the existence of this factor must present documentary evidence in support thereof, including copies of income tax returns for the previous 3 years, and an audited financial statement for the most recent fiscal quarter. In certain cases, Customs may waive the production of an audited financial statement or may request alternative or additional financial data in order to facilitate an analysis of a claim of inability to pay (e.g., examination of the financial records of a foreign entity related to the U.S. company claiming inability to pay).
(7)
Customs Knowledge.
Additional relief in non-fraud cases (which also are not the subject of a criminal investigation) will be granted if it is determined that Customs had actual knowledge of a violation and, without justification, failed to inform the violator so that it could have taken earlier corrective action. In such cases, if a penalty is to be assessed involving repeated violations of the same kind, the maximum penalty amount for violations occurring after the date on which actual knowledge was obtained by Customs will be limited to two times the loss of duty in duty-loss cases or twenty percent of the dutiable value in non-duty-loss cases if the continuing violations were the result of gross negligence, or the lesser of one time the loss of duty in duty-loss cases or ten percent of dutiable value in non-duty-loss cases if the violations were the result of negligence. This factor will not be applicable when a substantial delay in the investigation is attributable to the alleged violator.

# (H) Aggravating Factors
Certain factors may be determined to be aggravating factors in calculating the amount of the proposed or assessed penalty claim or the amount of the administrative penalty decision. The presence of one or more aggravating factors may not be used to raise the level of culpability attributable to the alleged violations, but may be utilized to offset the presence of mitigating factors. The following factors will be considered “aggravating factors,” provided that the case
record sufficiently establishes their existence. The list is not exclusive.
(1) Obstructing an investigation or audit,
(2) Withholding evidence,
(3) Providing misleading information concerning the violation,
(4) Prior substantive violations of section 592 for which a final administrative finding of culpability has been made,
(5) Textile imports that have been the subject of illegal transshipment (
i.e.,
false country of origin declaration), whether or not the merchandise bears false country of origin markings,
(6) Evidence of a motive to evade a prohibition or restriction on the admissibility of the merchandise (e.g., evading a quota restriction),
(7) Failure to comply with a lawful demand for records or a Customs summons.

# (I) Offers in Compromise (“Settlement Offers”)
Parties who wish to submit a civil offer in compromise pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1617 (also known as a “settlement offer”) in connection with any section 592 claim or potential section 592 claim should follow the procedures outlined in § 161.5 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 161.5). Settlement offers do not involve “mitigation” of a claim or potential claim, but rather “compromise” an action or potential action where Customs evaluation of potential litigation risks, or the alleged violator's financial position, justifies such a disposition. In any case where a portion of the offered amount represents a tender of unpaid duties, taxes and fees, Customs letter of acceptance may identify the portion representing any such duty, tax and fee. The offered amount should be deposited at the Customs field office responsible for handling the section 592 claim or potential section 592 claim. The offered amount will be held in a suspense account pending acceptance or rejection of the offer in compromise. In the event the offer is rejected, the concerned Customs field office will promptly initiate a refund of the money deposited in the suspense account to the offeror.

# (J) Section 592(d) Demands
Section 592(d) demands for actual losses of duty ordinarily are issued in connection with a penalty action, or as a separate demand without an associated penalty action. In either case, information must be present establishing a violation of section 592(a). In those cases where the appropriate Customs field officer determines that issuance of a penalty under section 592 is not warranted (notwithstanding the presence of information establishing a violation of section 592(a)), but that circumstances do warrant issuance of a demand for payment of an actual loss of duty pursuant to section 592(d), the Customs field officer shall follow the procedures set forth in section 162.79b of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 162.79b). Except in cases where less than one year remains before the statute of limitations may be raised as a defense, information copies of all section 592(d) demands should be sent to all concerned sureties and the importer of record if such party is not an alleged violator. Also, except in cases where less than one year remains before the statute of limitations may be raised as a defense, Customs will endeavor to issue all section 592(d) demands to concerned sureties and non-violator importers of record only after default by principals.

# (K) Customs Brokers
If a customs broker commits a section 592 violation and the violation involves fraud, or the broker commits a grossly negligent or negligent violation and shares in the benefits of the violation to an extent over and above customary brokerage fees, the customs broker will be subject to these guidelines. However, if the customs broker commits either a grossly negligent or negligent violation of section 592 (without sharing in the benefits of the violation as described above), the concerned Customs field officer may proceed against the customs broker pursuant to the remedies provided under 19 U.S.C. 1641.

# (L) Arriving Travelers
(1)
Liability.
Except as set forth below, proposed and assessed penalties for violations by an arriving traveler must be determined in accordance with these guidelines.
(2)
Limitations on Liability on Non-commercial Violations.
In the absence of a referral for criminal prosecution, monetary penalties assessed in the case of an alleged first-offense, non-commercial, fraudulent violation by an arriving traveler will generally be limited as follows:
(a)
Fraud—Duty Loss Violation.
An amount ranging from a minimum of three times the loss of duty to a maximum of five times the loss of duty, provided the loss of duty is also paid;
(b)
Fraud—Non-duty Loss Violation.
An amount ranging from a minimum of 30 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise to a maximum of 50 percent of its dutiable value;
(c)
Gross Negligence—Duty Loss Violation.
An amount ranging from a minimum of 1.5 times the loss of duty to a maximum of 2.5 times the loss of duty provided the loss of duty is also paid;
(d)
Gross Negligence—Non-duty Loss Violation.
An amount ranging from a minimum of 15 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise to a maximum of 25 percent of its dutiable value;
(e)
Negligence—Duty Loss Violation.
An amount ranging from a minimum of .25
times the loss of duty to a maximum of 1.25 times the loss of duty provided that the loss of duty is also paid;
(f)
Negligence—Non-duty Loss Violation.
An amount ranging from a minimum of 2.5 percent of the dutiable value of the merchandise to a maximum of 12.5 percent of its dutiable value;
(g)
Special Assessments/Dispositions.
No penalty action under section 592 will be initiated against an arriving traveler if the violation is not fraudulent or commercial, the loss of duty is $100.00 or less, and there are no other concurrent or prior violations of section 592 or other statutes prohibiting false or fraudulent importation practices. However, all lawful duties, taxes and fees will be collected. Also, no penalty under section 592 will be initiated against an arriving traveler if the violation is not fraudulent or commercial, there are no other concurrent or prior violations of section 592, and a penalty is not believed necessary to deter future violations or to serve a law enforcement purpose.

# (M) Violations of Laws Administered by Other Federal Agencies.
Violations of laws administered by other federal agencies (such as the Food and Drug Administration, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of Agriculture, Fish and Wildlife Service) should be referred to the appropriate agency for its recommendation. Such recommendation, if promptly tendered, will be given due consideration, and may be followed provided the recommendation would not result in a disposition inconsistent with these guidelines.

# (N) Section 592 Violations by Small Entities
In compliance with the mandate of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, under appropriate circumstances, the issuance of a penalty under section 592 may be waived for businesses qualifying as small business entities.
Procedures established for small business entities regarding violations of 19 U.S.C. 1592 were published as Treasury Decision 97-46 in the
Federal Register
(62 FR 30378) on June 3, 1997.
[T.D. 00-41, 65 FR 39093, June 23, 2000]
Pt. 171, App. C

# Appendix C to Part 171—Customs Regulations Guidelines for the Imposition and Mitigation of Penalties for Violations of 19 U.S.C. 1641
The Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 promulgated numerous changes to the current statute relating to Customs brokers. The following document attempts to define that conduct which is to be proscribed and to suggest penalty amounts to be assessed for such violations. It also chronicles procedures to be followed in assessment and mitigation of penalties.

# Note:
Assessment of a monetary penalty is an alternative sanction to revocation or suspension of the broker's license or permit.

# I. Penalty Assessment Procedures—19 CFR Part 111, Subpart E
A. When a penalty against a broker is contemplated, the “appropriate Customs officer”, (
i.e.
, the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer) shall issue a written notice which advises the violator of the allegations which would warrant imposition of a penalty. The written notice shall be in a format similar to a prepenalty notice that would be issued in contemplation of assessment of a penalty under section 1592 or 1584.
B. The written notice shall inform the violator that he has 30 days to respond as to why a penalty should not be issued. See 19 CFR 111.92.
C. If no response is received from the violator, or, if after receipt of the response, it is determined that the penalty should be issued as stated in the prepenalty notice, a notice of penalty CF-5955A shall be issued formally assessing a monetary penalty against the broker.
D. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may reduce the amount of the contemplated penalty or cancel its issuance altogether if, after review of the violator's submission in response to the prepenalty notice, he is satisfied that the acts which are the basis for the penalty did not occur as charged or occurred in a manner that would permit a reduction in the contemplated penalty.
E. After issuance of a penalty notice, the petitioning provisions of part 171 of the Customs Regulations are in effect.
F. If the broker does not comply with a final mitigation decision within 60 days, the matter shall be referred to the Department of Justice for commencement of judicial action.

# II. Penalty Assessment—Conducting Customs Business Without a License (19 U.S.C. 1641(
b

# )(6))
A. No person may conduct Customs business, other than solely on behalf of that person, without a broker's license.
B. Penalty amount:
1. The maximum penalty for any one incident of conducting Customs business without a license is $10,000.
2. Total aggregate penalties for violation of this or any other section of the broker penalty statute is $30,000. As a general rule, $10,000 will be the maximum assessment for a
violation solely involving conducting Customs business without a license, without regard to the frequency of violations. In particularly aggravated circumstances, this rule shall be suspended.
C. Customs business includes:
1. Classification and valuation.
2. Payment of duties, taxes or other charges.
3. Drawback or refund of duties.
4. Filing of entries or other documents relating to issues covered by 1-3.
D. Customs business does not include:
1. Marine transactions.
2. In-bond movement or transportation of merchandise.
3. Foreign Trade Zone admissions. See C.S.D. 84-23.
E. Penalty amounts to be imposed for transacting Customs business without a license are as follows:
1. No penalty action when importation is conducted on behalf of a family member. For purposes of this subsection, “family member” is defined as a parent, child, spouse, sibling, grandparent or grandchild.
2. No penalty action against an individual who has a power of attorney to act as an unpaid agent on a non-commercial shipment. See 19 CFR 141.33.
3. A $250 penalty for:
a. First violation when transaction is non-commercial but is conducted on behalf of any business entity, or
b. First violation where the importation is commercial in nature (
i.e.
, imported merchandise is for resale)
or
where the violator is compensated for his action, e.g., an importation of raw material or parts of merchandise that is to be manufactured, refined or assembled here before resale would be a commercial entry because the merchandise eventually would be resold, albeit in another form than that which it was entered.
4. A $1,000 penalty for repeat violation involving:
a. Commercial importation.
b. Non-commercial importation made on behalf of a business entity.
c. Non-commercial importation for which compensation is received by the violator.
5. A $10,000 penalty when:
a. Violator falsely holds himself out as being a licensed Customs broker.
b. A continuing course of conduct can be shown (determined by frequency of violations or number of entries involved) which would indicate that the violator is entering merchandise for others on a regular commercial basis, e.g., if the violator has incurred numerous penalties under subsections (3) and (4) above, but the smaller penalties have had no deterrent effect, the $10,000 penalty under this subsection should be assessed in an action separate from those smaller penalties.
F. Mitigation—No mitigation will be afforded for any violation involving conducting Customs business without a license unless the violator can show an inability to pay such penalty.
G. IMPORTANT: As a general rule, a separate penalty should not be imposed for each unlawful Customs business transaction if numerous transactions occur contemporaneously. For example:
1. If an unlicensed individual files six commercial entries at one time, that should be treated as one violation. It should not be treated as six violations because the entries were presented contemporaneously.
2. If Customs discovers that an individual has conducted Customs business without a license on numerous occasions, but such individual acted without knowledge of the prohibition on such conduct, those numerous transactions should be treated as one violation for purposes of imposition of any penalty.
H.
Note:
Conducting Customs business without a license is not the same violation as conducting Customs business without a permit. The latter violation is discussed later in this appendix in the section involving Violation of Other Laws or Regulations Enforced by Customs.
I. Intent to violate the law is not an element of this violation. Reference to “intentionally transacts Customs business” in subsection 1641(b)(6) relates to the intentional transaction of the business itself, not to any intentional attempt to violate the terms of the statute.

# III. Section 1641(
d

# )(1)(A)—Making a False or Misleading Statement or an Omission as to Material Fact Which Was Required To Be Stated in Any Application for a License or Permit
A. If the license would not have been issued but for the false statement, the proper sanction would be suspension or revocation of the license. If the false or misleading statement would not have absolutely resulted in the denial, revocation or suspension of a license, then penalty sanctions are proper.
B. Material facts include but are not limited to:
1. Facts as to identity.
2. Facts as to citizenship status of an individual.
3. Facts as to moral character of an individual which relate to his fitness to conduct Customs business.
4. The organization of any corporation, association or partnership.
5. The status of the license of a license holder who is a corporate officer or partner.
C. Penalty Amount—$5,000 for each false statement, to a maximum of $30,000.
D. Examples of situations where revocation of the license is appropriate.
1. An applicant states that he is 21 years old (as required by 19 CFR 111.11) and he is
not. But for the false statement, the applicant could not meet the age requirement for a license.
2. An applicant provides an alias in the application which is a material false statement as to identity.
E. Mitigation guidelines.
1. Violation due to clerical error (clerical error as defined by 19 U.S.C. 1520(c)(1)), mitigated without payment.
2. Violation due to negligence.
a. This is defined as more than clerical error, but not an intentional violation. Examples include:
i. Failing to list a new corporate office because corporate records have not been kept current.
ii. Listing an incorrect address for a reference because applicant has failed to update his records.
b. Mitigate to $500 for each $5,000 penalty assessed.
c. This category excludes cases of harmless error,
i.e.
, a mistake which could not possibly harm the government's interests. Cases falling in this category should be mitigated in full.
3. Intentional violations—Revocation of a license which has been granted is the preferred sanction. If no license has been granted, no mitigation.

# IV. Section 1641(
d

# )(1)(B)—Broker Convicted of Certain Felonies or Misdemeanors Subsequent To Filing License Application
A. As a general rule, license revocation is the standard sanction for these violations. If the conviction occurs subsequent to the filing of an application, monetary penalties may be assessed according to the following criteria.
B. Unlawful conduct must relate to:
1. Importation or exportation of merchandise.
2. Conduct of Customs business (this shall include violations relating to taxes and duties and documents required to be filed with regard to such taxes and duties).
3. Relevant convictions would include:
a. 18 U.S.C. 1001—making a false statement to Customs or any other agency with regard to any relevant transaction.
b. 18 U.S.C. 545—unlawful importation of merchandise.
c. 18 U.S.C. 542—unlawful importation by means of a fraudulent act or omission.
d. 22 U.S.C. 2778—illegal exportation of munitions.
C. Monetary penalties may not be imposed in connection with convictions relating to conduct described in subsection 1641(d)(1)(B)(iii) including larceny, theft, robbery, extortion, counterfeiting, fraudulent concealment or conversion, embezzlement or misappropriation of funds. Either suspension or revocation is the appropriate penalty for these infractions.
D. Penalty amounts.
1. $15,000 for a misdemeanor conviction.
2. $30,000 for a felony conviction.
E. Mitigation.
1. For a misdemeanor conviction, mitigation to a lesser amount is permitted if the conviction related to Customs business and the domestic value of the merchandise involved is less than $15,000. In such case, mitigation to an amount equal to the domestic value of the merchandise is appropriate.
2. For other misdemeanor convictions, no relief.
3. Felony convictions, no relief.

# V. Section 1641(
d

# )(1)(C)—Violation of Any Law Enforced by the Customs Service or the Rules or Regulations Issued Under Any Such Provision
A. Penalties under this section may be imposed in addition to any penalty provided for under the law enforced by Customs.
Exception:
Penalties imposed against a broker under 19 U.S.C. 1592 at a culpability level of less than fraud or under 19 U.S.C. 1595a(b) shall not be imposed in addition to a broker's penalty.
B. Additional penalties under this section shall also be imposed against any broker where the other statute violated only moves against property, or the violator has demonstrated a continuing course of illegal conduct or evidence exists which indicates repeated violations of other statutes or regulations.
C. Conducting Customs business without a permit penalties should be assessed under this section.
1. The penalty notice should also cite 19 CFR 111.19 as the regulation violated. A party operating without a permit is required to apply for one under the above-noted regulation.
2. Assessment amount—$1,000 per transaction conducted without a permit.
3. Mitigation.
a. Negligence, mitigate to $250-$500 per transaction depending on the presence of mitigating factors (lack of knowledge of permit requirement).
b. Intentional, grant no relief.
c. No mitigation if permit revoked by operation of law.
4. Generally, a separate penalty should not be assessed for each non-permitted transaction if numerous transactions occurred contemporaneously. For example, if a broker files 30 entries the day after a permit expires, the 30 filings should be treated as one violation, not 30 separate violations.
D. Penalties for failure to exercise due diligence in payment, refund or deposit of monies received from clients in connection with
clients' Customs business also should be assessed under this section. This includes failure to pay over to a client, or file a written statement to a client accounting for, funds received.
1. The penalty notice should also cite 19 CFR 111.29 as the regulation violated.
2. Assessment amount—an amount equal to the value of any monies up to a maximum of $30,000, to be deposited with Customs or refunded or accounted for to a client.
3. No mitigation shall be afforded until the monies are properly paid to Customs or refunded or accounted for to the clients.
4. If any claims for liquidated damages result against the client's bond from the failure to pay monies to Customs, no mitigation from the penalty shall be granted until the claim for liquidated damages is settled
by the violating broker
either through payment of the full claim or a mitigated amount.
5. After monies are paid or accounted for and/or liquidated damages claims are settled as stated in 3. and 4. above, mitigation may be afforded. If the violator is found to be negligent, the penalty may be mitigated to an amount between 25 and 50 percent of the assessed amount, but no lower than $250. No mitigation from an intentional violation.
E. Penalties for failure to retain powers of attorney from clients to act in their names.
1. The penalty notice should also cite 19 CFR 141.46 as the regulation violated.
2. Assessment amount—$1,000 for each power of attorney not on file.
3. Mitigation—for a first offense, mitigate to an amount between $250 and $500 unless extraordinary mitigating factors are present, in which case full mitigation should be afforded. An extraordinary mitigating factor would be a fire, theft or other destruction of records beyond broker control. Subsequent offenses—no mitigation unless extraordinary mitigating factors are present.
4. Penalty should be mitigated in full if it can be established that a valid power of attorney had been issued to the broker, but it was misplaced or destroyed through clerical error or mistake.
F. If the other statute violated moves only against property, the violator shall incur a monetary penalty equal to the domestic value of such property or $30,000, whichever is less.
e.g., Violation of 22 U.S.C. 401 for unlawful exportation of merchandise results in seizure and forfeiture of the violative merchandise. There are no penalty provisions which Customs enforces against parties responsible for the seizable offense. If brokers are recalcitrant and are constantly responsible for offenses which result in seizure of merchandise, a penalty equal to the domestic value of such merchandise (in no case to exceed $30,000) should be imposed.
G. Use of a broker's importation bond to aid an importer who has had his immediate delivery privileges revoked.
1. The broker has aided his client in avoiding the immediate delivery sanctions. The penalty notice should cite 19 CFR 142.25(c) as the regulation violated. Before assessment of this penalty, the broker should be shown to have known or been negligent in not knowing of the client's sanction.
2. A penalty equal to the value of the merchandise, not to exceed $30,000, should be assessed.
3. Mitigation—The penalty shall be mitigated to an amount between 25 and 50 percent of that assessed for a first violation where negligence is shown. Any knowing violation or a subsequent negligent violation (not necessarily involving the same client) will result in no mitigation.
H. If the other statute violated provides for a personal penalty, the violator shall incur an additional monetary penalty under this section equal to such personal penalty or $30,000, whichever is less.
I. Penalties assessed under this provision are not limited to violations just involving Customs business as defined in the statute.
J. Mitigation guidelines.
1. If the other law violated moves only against property, mitigate the penalty using guidelines in effect for the other statute violated. For example, if the broker is responsible for a 401 seizure of merchandise valued at $45,000, he incurs a penalty of $30,000. The guidelines for remission of the 401 forfeiture are applicable to mitigation of the broker penalty. Thus, if the forfeiture is remitted upon payment of 5 percent of the merchandise's value, the penalty will be mitigated upon payment of a like amount.
2. If the other law violated provides for a personal penalty, mitigate the broker penalty using guidelines in effect for the other statute violated.
For example, a broker incurs a $40,000 penalty under 1592. The penalty amount represents eight times the loss of revenue because a preliminary finding of fraud is made (see section V.A. of this appendix). A penalty of $30,000, in addition to the $40,000 penalty issued under 1592, may be assessed. The 1592 penalty is later mitigated to $25,000, an amount equal to five times the loss of revenue, as the finding of fraud is upheld and it is also determined that the broker shared in the financial benefits of the violation. The broker penalty also should be mitigated to that $25,000 figure, for a total collection of $50,000.

# VI. Section 1641(
d

# )(1)(D)—Counseling, Commanding, Inducing, Procuring or Knowingly Aiding and Abetting Violations by Any Other Person of Any Law Enforced by the Customs Service
A. If the law violated by another moves only against property, a monetary penalty equal to the domestic value of such property or $30,000 whichever is less, may be imposed against the broker who counsels, commands or knowingly aids and abets such violation.
B. If the law violated provides for only a personal penalty against the actual violator, a penalty may be imposed against the broker in an amount equal to that assessed against the violator, but in no case can the penalty exceed $30,000.
C. If the broker is assessed a penalty under the statute violated by the other person, he may be assessed a penalty under this section in addition to any other penalties.
D. Examples of violations of this subsection:
1. A broker counsels a client that certain gemstones are absolutely free of duty and need not be declared upon entry into the United States. The client arrives in the United States and fails to declare a quantity of gemstones worth $45,000. A penalty of $30,000 may be imposed against the broker for such counseling. The client would incur a personal penalty of $45,000 under the provisions of title 19, United States Code, section 1497, but the penalty against the broker cannot exceed $30,000.
2. A client imports $15,000 worth of merchandise by vessel. The merchandise is unladen at the wharf but Customs has not appraised or released it. Customs informs the broker that the shipment must be held for an intensive examination. The broker informs the client that the merchandise can be moved and delivered to the consignee. The broker assures his client that he will handle all the necessary paperwork. The merchandise is moved from the wharf. The broker is subject to a $15,000 penalty for counseling and inducing his client to violate the provisions of title 19, United States Code, section 1448 and title 19, United States Code, section 1595a(b).
E. Mitigation—Follow guidelines applicable to the other penalty or forfeiture statute involved.

# VII. Section 1641(
d

# )(1)(E)—Knowingly Employing or Continuing To Employ Any Person Who Has Been Convicted of a Felony, Without Written Approval of Such Employment From the Secretary of the Treasury
A. A broker has 30 days to seek approval of the Secretary for such employment. If he seeks the approval within such time, no penalty will be assessed.
B. A $5,000 penalty for knowingly employing any convicted felon and failing to make application with the Secretary approving such employment within 30 days of the date of discovery of the felony conviction.
C. A $25,000 penalty for knowingly employing any convicted felon without seeking approval for employment.
D. A $30,000 penalty for knowingly employing any convicted felon and continuing to employ same after approval has been denied (generally revocation or suspension of the license would be appropriate under this circumstance).
E.
Example:
If a broker unknowingly employs a convicted felon and 1 year after employment discovers the existence of such a conviction, the following actions would dictate imposition of a penalty:
1. If he seeks approval of the Secretary within 30 days after discovery of the existence of the conviction, no penalty will be assessed.
2. If he seeks approval at some time after 30 days from the date of discovery, a $5,000 penalty would lie.
3. If he does not seek approval until after Customs becomes aware of the violation, a $25,000 penalty would lie.
4. If he seeks approval, but is denied, and continues to employ the convicted felon, a $30,000 penalty would lie.
F. Customs discovery of a felony conviction. If Customs discovers the felony conviction and there is no indication that the employer is aware of same, Customs may inform the employer of such conviction. Discretion should be used in divulging this information.
G. Mitigation will only be permitted from the $5,000 penalty as follows:
1. If the application for approval is submitted within 60 days, but after 30 days, mitigate to $2,000.
2. If there is no application beyond the 60-day period, no mitigation shall be granted. Continued employment will result in further penalties as described above in sections E.3 and E.4.

# VIII. Section 1641(
d

# )(1)(F)—In the Course of Customs Business, With Intent To Defraud, Knowingly Deceiving, Misleading or Threatening Any Client or Prospective Client
A. An unsubstantiated accusation by a client is inadequate basis to assess any penalty under this section of law.
B. A $30,000 penalty should be imposed for any violation of this section.
C. Mitigation—Inasmuch as evidence of intent must be shown before a penalty can be imposed, no mitigation should be permitted if a violation is found to lie. A petition for mitigation could be entertained only on the issue of whether such violation did, in fact, occur.

# IX. Section 1641(
b

# )(5)—The Failure of a Customs Broker That is Licensed as a Corporation, Association or Partnership To Have, For Any Continuous Period of 120 Days, at Least One Officer of the Corporation or Association or One Member of the Partnership Validly Licensed
A.
Important:
Violation of this section results in the revocation of the broker's license by operation of law.
B. A $10,000 penalty may be imposed pursuant to section 1641(b)(6) because the revocation by operation of law results in the broker conducting Customs business without a license. No penalty liability would be incurred specifically under section 1641(b)(5).
C. Mitigation—Grant no mitigation from any penalty incurred by a broker for conducting Customs business without a license as a result of revocation of that license by operation of law.

# X. Section 1641(
c

# )(3)—Failure of a Customs Broker Granted a Permit To Conduct Business in a Certain District to Employ, for a Continuous Period of 180 Days, at Least One Individual Who is Licensed Within the District or Region
A.
Important:
Violation of this section results in the revocation of a permit by operation of law.
B. Penalties may be imposed for violation of the provisions of 1641(d)(1)(C), violation of other laws enforced by Customs. Guidelines for imposition of penalties for conducting Customs business without a permit should be followed.
C. Mitigation—No mitigation should be permitted from any penalty imposed for failure to have a permit when the permit lapses by operation of law.

# XI. Section 1641(
b

# )(4)—Failure of a Licensed Broker To Exercise Responsible Supervision and Control Over the Customs Business That it Conducts
A. Standards of responsible supervision and control shall be issued by the Commissioner of Customs. Statutory authority to set such standards is provided by section 1641(f).

# Note:
All penalties assessed for violation of 1641(b)(4) shall also cite section 1641(d)(1)(C) as the statute violated in all notices issued to the alleged violator.
B. The following penalty amounts shall be assessed against brokers who fail to exercise responsible supervision and control over business conducted at district level.
1. A penalty of $1,000 against any broker who:
a. Continuously makes the same errors on a particular type of entry;
b. Fails to properly instruct employees about Customs business, thereby resulting in the filing of incorrect entries or the mishandling of transactions relating to Customs business;
c. Knowingly allows his entry bond to be used to effect release of merchandise in districts where he does not have a license or permit (this is imposed in addition to any penalty for conducting Customs business without a license);
d. Fails to comply with regulations or procedures but does not commit violations that would warrant any higher penalty amount as described below.
2. A penalty of $5,000 against any broker who, when requested, is unable to produce documents relating to specific Customs business which are material to that business (e.g., if the business regards an entry he should have the invoice, packing list, etc.). This requirement excludes documents not required to be kept by a broker.
3. A penalty of $5,000 against any broker who is unable to satisfy the deciding Customs official that he has a working knowledge of any operation material to his ability to render valuable service to others in the conduct of Customs business.
Examples include:
a. A working knowledge of all automated systems in use in the district;
b. A knowledge of the cash flow procedures in each district of operation;
c. Retention of copies of all surety bonds in proper form and in sufficient dollar amount;
d. Knowledge of filing systems and document record storage in each district;
e. Continuous monitoring to ensure timely payment of all obligations including duties, taxes and refunds.
4. A penalty of $5,000 against any broker who fails to exercise responsible supervision and control over the Customs business that it conducts as defined in section XI.C. of this appendix.
5. A penalty of $10,000 against any broker who is found to have failed to maintain satisfactory accounting records or records of documents filed with Customs on any matter.
C. The following factors shall be indicative of a lack of supervision or lack of working knowledge of Customs procedures (the list is not conclusive):
1. A high rate of entry rejections when compared with other brokers in the permitted district.
2. A high rate of late filing liquidated damages cases when compared with other brokers in the permitted district.
3. In the case of entry summaries filed in the broker's name, a high number of missing document cases when compared with other brokers in the permitted district.
4. An inordinate number of entries for which free entry is claimed, but no documentation supporting such claim is submitted, resulting in liquidation of the entries as dutiable.
5. Inability to assist or failure to cooperate with an audit, including failure to provide all records and any other necessary information pertaining to a broker's Customs business to assist auditors.
6. Failure to settle (including petitioning) liquidated damages claims in a timely manner.
7. Evidence to indicate that timely duty refunds to clients are not made or accounted for and adequate records of same are not kept (usually will result in penalty assessed in accordance with section B.5. above).
8. Employing a licensed individual for a minimal number of days each 120- or 180-day period (see sections 1641(b)(5) and 1641(c)(3) so as to avoid violation of the statute.
a. For purposes of imposition of penalties under this subsection, a minimal number of days shall be 10 working days for each 120-day period or 15 working days for each 180-day period.
b. It shall be presumed that temporary employment of such a licensed individual is undertaken solely to avoid revocation of a license or permit. Such minimal employment shall be
prima facie
evidence of lack of supervision.
D. Mitigation.
1. $1,000 penalties shall not be mitigated unless the broker can show that extraordinary mitigating factors are present.
2. $5,000 penalties for failure to produce documents may be mitigated to an amount between $2,000 and $3,500 if the documents are produced but not in a timely fashion. No mitigation shall be afforded if the documents are not produced, unless the broker can satisfactorily demonstrate that such failure to produce was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the broker or his client (e.g., a rupture of relations with the party responsible for generating the documents). Full mitigation shall be afforded in the case of destruction of records by events beyond a broker's control, such as theft, flood, fire or other acts of God.
3. $5,000 penalty for failure to have a working knowledge of any operation for which a broker is licensed to do business may be mitigated to a lesser amount upon a showing by the broker that steps have been taken to improve instruction and supervision of employees and an improvement in the knowledge of his operation occurs.
4. $5,000 penalty for failure to exercise responsible supervision and control may be mitigated to a lesser amount if the broker immediately corrects the problem which was the basis for the assessment and sufficiently monitors the situation to avoid recurrence.
5. $10,000 penalty for failure to maintain satisfactory accounting records will only be subject to mitigation in full if the broker can prove that satisfactory accounting records and documents records are being kept. Mitigation in a lesser degree may be afforded upon a showing by the broker that a
bona fide
attempt was made to establish a satisfactory accounting and/or recordkeeping system, or upgrade a deficient system, but such efforts proved unsuccessful or only partially effective.
6. Penalty equal to the value of monies not properly paid or accounted for.
a. If the broker shows that the monies were paid or accounted for and requisite notifications were made, albeit in an untimely fashion not to exceed 30 days after any due date, the penalty may be mitigated upon payment of 25 percent of the assessed amount, but no less than $250.
b. If the monies were paid and notifications made more than 30 days after any due date, the penalty may be mitigated upon payment of 50 percent of the assessed amount, but not less than $1,000.
c. If there is no proof of proper payment of duties, refunds, etc., no mitigation shall be granted.

# XII. Limits of Penalty Assessments
A. A broker shall be penalized a maximum of $30,000 for any violation or violations of the statute in any one penalty notice.
B. If a broker is penalized to the maximum the statute will allow and continues to commit the same violation or violations, revocation or suspension of his license would be the appropriate sanction. Barring such revocation or suspension action, he may again be penalized to the maximum the statute will allow.
C. From any one audit, the maximum aggregate penalty for all violations discovered is $30,000.

# XIII. Consolidation of Cases
Whenever multiple penalties arising from a particular fact situation or pattern are contemplated against brokers or individuals operating in different districts, the cases may be consolidated in one district. Approval for consolidation must be sought from the Trade Policy and Programs, Office of International Trade.

Pt. 171, App. D

# Appendix D to Part 171—Guidelines for the Imposition and Mitigation of Penalties for Violations of 19 U.S.C. 1593a
A monetary penalty incurred under section 593A, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1593a; hereinafter referred to as section 593A), may be remitted or mitigated under section 618, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1618; hereinafter referred to as section 618), if it is determined that there exist such mitigating circumstances as to justify remission or mitigation. The guidelines below will be used by Customs in arriving at a just and reasonable assessment and disposition of liabilities arising under section 593A within the stated limitations. It is intended that these guidelines will be applied by Customs officers in prepenalty proceedings, in determining the monetary penalty assessed in the penalty notice, and in arriving at a final penalty disposition. The assessed or mitigated penalty amount set forth in Customs administrative disposition determined in accordance with these guidelines does not limit the penalty amount which the Government may seek in bringing a civil enforcement action pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1593a(i).

# (A) Violations of Section 593A
A violation of section 593A occurs when a person, through fraud or negligence, seeks, induces, or affects, or attempts to seek, induce, or affect, the payment or credit to that person or others of any drawback claim by means of any document, written or oral statement, or electronically transmitted data or information, or act which is material and false, or any omission which is material, or aids or abets any other person in the foregoing violation. There is no violation if the falsity is due solely to clerical error or mistake of fact unless the error or mistake is part of a pattern of negligent conduct. Also, the mere nonintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error will not constitute a pattern of negligent conduct. Nevertheless, if Customs has drawn the person's attention to the nonintentional repetition by an electronic system of an initial clerical error, subsequent failure to correct the error could constitute a violation of section 593A.

# (B) Degrees of Culpability
There are two degrees of culpability under section 593A: negligence and fraud.
(1)
Negligence.
A violation is determined to be negligent if it results from an act or acts (of commission or omission) done with actual knowledge of, or wanton disregard for, the relevant facts and with indifference to, or disregard for, the offender's obligations under the statute or done through the failure to exercise the degree of reasonable care and competence expected from a person in the same circumstances in ascertaining the facts or in drawing inferences from those facts, in ascertaining the offender's obligations under the statute, or in communicating information so that it may be understood by the recipient. As a general rule, a violation is determined to be negligent if it results from the offender's failure to exercise reasonable care and competence to ensure that a statement made is correct.
(2)
Fraud.
A violation is determined to be fraudulent if the material false statement, omission or act in connection with the transaction was committed (or omitted) knowingly,
i.e.
, was done voluntarily and intentionally, as established by clear and convincing evidence.

# (C) Assessment of Penalties
(1)
Issuance of Prepenalty Notice.
As provided in § 162.77a of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 162.77a), if Customs has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of section 593A has occurred and determines that further proceedings are warranted, a notice of intent to issue a claim for a monetary penalty will be issued to the person concerned. In issuing such prepenalty notice, the appropriate Customs field officer will make a tentative determination of the degree of culpability and the amount of the proposed claim. A prepenalty notice will not be issued if the claim does not exceed $1,000.
(2)
Issuance of Penalty Notice.
After considering representations, if any, made by the person concerned pursuant to the notice issued under paragraph (C)(1), the appropriate Customs field officer will determine whether any violation described in section (A) has occurred. If a notice was issued under paragraph (C)(1) and the appropriate Customs field officer determines that there was no violation, Customs will promptly issue a written statement of the determination to the person to whom the notice was sent. If the appropriate Customs field officer determines that there was a violation, Customs will issue a written penalty claim to the person concerned. The written penalty claim will specify all changes in the information provided in the prepenalty notice issued under paragraph (C)(1). The person to whom the penalty notice is issued will have a reasonable opportunity under section 618 to make representations, both oral and written, seeking remission or mitigation of the monetary penalty. At the conclusion of any proceeding under section 618, Customs will provide to the person concerned a written statement which sets forth the final determination and the findings of fact and conclusions of law on which such determination is based.

# (D) Maximum Penalties
(1)
Fraud.
In the case of a fraudulent violation of section 593A, the monetary penalty will be in an amount not to exceed 3 times the actual or potential loss of revenue.
(2)
Negligence.
(a)
In General.
In the case of a negligent violation of section 593A, the monetary penalty will be in an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue for the first violation.
(b)
Repetitive Violations.
For the first negligent violation that is repetitive (
i.e.
, involves the same issue and the same violator), the penalty will be in an amount not to exceed 50 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue. The penalty for a second and each subsequent repetitive negligent violation will be in an amount not to exceed the actual or potential loss of revenue.
(3)
Prior Disclosure.
(a)
In General.
Subject to paragraph (D)(3)(b), if the person concerned discloses the circumstances of a violation of section 593A before, or without knowledge of the commencement of, a formal investigation of such violation, the monetary penalty assessed under this Appendix will not exceed:
(i) In the case of fraud, an amount equal to the actual or potential revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived as a result of overpayment of the claim; or
(ii) If the violation resulted from negligence, an amount equal to the interest computed on the basis of the prevailing rate of interest applied under 26 U.S.C. 6621 on the amount of actual revenue of which the United States is or may be deprived during the period that begins on the date of overpayment of the claim and ends on the date on which the person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment.
(b)
Condition Affecting Penalty Limitations.
The limitations in paragraph (D)(3)(a) on the amount of the monetary penalty to be assessed apply only if the person concerned tenders the amount of the overpayment made on the claim either at the time of the disclosure or within 30 days (or such longer period as Customs may provide) from the date of notice by Customs of its calculation of the amount of overpayment.
(c)
Burden of Proof.
The person asserting lack of knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation has the burden of proof in establishing such lack of knowledge.
(d)
Commencement of Investigation.
For purposes of this Appendix, a formal investigation of a violation is considered to be commenced with regard to the disclosing party, and with regard to the disclosed information, on the date recorded in writing by Customs as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered which caused Customs to believe that a possibility of a violation of section 593A existed.
(e)
Exclusivity.
Penalty claims under section D will be the exclusive civil remedy for any drawback-related violation of section 593A.

# (E) Deprivation of Lawful Revenue
Notwithstanding section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), if the United States has been deprived of lawful duties and taxes resulting from a violation of section 593A, Customs will require that such duties and taxes be restored whether or not a monetary penalty is assessed.

# (F) Final Disposition of Penalty Cases When the Drawback Claimant Is Not a Certified Participant in the Drawback Compliance Program
(1)
In General.
Customs will consider all information in the petition and all available evidence, taking into account any mitigating, aggravating, and extraordinary factors, in determining the final assessed penalty. All factors considered should be stated in the decision.
(2)
Penalty Disposition When There Has Been No Prior Disclosure.
(a)
Nonrepetitive Negligent Violation.
The final penalty disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 10 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue to a maximum of 20 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue.
(b)
Repetitive Negligent Violation.
(i)
First Repetitive Negligent Violation.
The final penalty disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 25 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue to a maximum of 50 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue.
(ii)
Second and Each Subsequent Repetitive Negligent Violation.
The final penalty disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 50 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue to a maximum of 100 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue.
(c)
Fraudulent Violation.
The final penalty disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 1.5 times the actual or potential loss of revenue to a maximum of 3 times the actual or potential loss of revenue.
(3)
Penalty Disposition When There Has Been a Prior Disclosure.
(a)
Negligent Violation.
The final penalty disposition will be in an amount equal to the interest determined in accordance with paragraph (D)(3)(a)(ii).
(b)
Fraudulent Violation.
The final penalty disposition will be in an amount equal to 100 percent of the actual or potential loss of revenue.
(4)
Mitigating Factors.
The following factors will be considered in mitigation of the proposed or assessed penalty claim or final penalty amount, provided that the case record
sufficiently establishes their existence. The list is not exclusive.
(a)
Contributory Customs Error.
This factor includes misleading or erroneous advice given by a Customs official in writing to the alleged violator, but this factor may be applied in such a case only if it appears that the alleged violator reasonably relied upon the written information and the alleged violator fully and accurately informed Customs of all relevant facts. The concept of comparative negligence may be utilized in determining the weight to be assigned to this factor. If the Customs error contributed to the violation, but the alleged violator is also culpable, the Customs error is to be considered as a mitigating factor. If it is determined that the Customs error was the sole cause of the violation, the proposed or assessed penalty is to be cancelled.
(b)
Cooperation With the Investigation.
To obtain the benefits of this factor, the alleged violator must exhibit cooperation beyond that expected from a person under investigation for a Customs violation. An example of the cooperation contemplated includes assisting Customs officers to an unusual degree in auditing the books and records of the alleged violator (e.g., incurring extraordinary expenses in providing computer runs solely for submission to Customs to assist the agency in cases involving an unusually large number of entries and/or complex issues). Another example consists of assisting Customs in obtaining additional information relating to the subject violation or other violations. Merely providing the books and records of the alleged violator may not be considered cooperation justifying mitigation inasmuch as Customs has the right to examine an importer's books and records pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508-1509.
(c)
Immediate Remedial Action.
This factor includes the payment of the actual loss of revenue prior to the issuance of a penalty notice and within 30 days after Customs notifies the alleged violator of the actual loss of revenue attributable to the violation. In appropriate cases, where the alleged violator provides evidence that, immediately after learning of the violation, substantial remedial action was taken to correct organizational or procedural defects, immediate remedial action may be granted as a mitigating factor. Customs encourages immediate remedial action to ensure against future incidents of non-compliance.
(d)
Prior Good Record.
Prior good record is a factor only if the alleged violator is able to demonstrate a consistent pattern of filing drawback claims without violation of section 593A, or any other statute prohibiting the making or filing of a false statement or document in connection with a drawback claim. This factor will not be considered in alleged fraudulent violations of section 593A.
(e)
Inability to Pay the Customs Penalty.
The party claiming the existence of this factor must present documentary evidence in support thereof, including copies of income tax returns for the previous 3 years and an audited financial statement for the most recent fiscal quarter. In certain cases, Customs may waive the production of an audited financial statement or may request alternative or additional financial data in order to facilitate an analysis of a claim of inability to pay (e.g., examination of the financial records of a foreign entity related to the U.S. company claiming inability to pay). In addition, the alleged violator must present information reflecting ownership and related domestic and foreign parties and must provide information reflecting its current financial condition, including books and records of account, bank statements, other tax records (for example, sales tax returns) and a list of assets with current values; if the alleged violator is a closely held corporation, similar current financial information must be provided on the shareholders, wherever they are located.
(f)
Customs Knowledge.
This factor may be used in non-fraud cases (which also are not the subject of a criminal investigation) if it is determined that Customs had actual knowledge of a violation and failed, without justification, to inform the violator so that it could have taken earlier remedial action. This factor is not applicable when a substantial delay in the investigation is attributable to the alleged violator.
(5)
Aggravating Factors.
Certain factors may be determined to be aggravating factors in calculating the amount of the proposed or assessed penalty claim or the amount of the final administrative penalty. The presence of one or more aggravating factors may not be used to raise the level of culpability attributable to the alleged violations, but may be used to offset the presence of mitigating factors. The following factors will be considered “aggravating factors”, provided that the case record sufficiently establishes their existence. The list is not exclusive.
(a) Obstructing an investigation or audit.
(b) Withholding evidence.
(c) Providing misleading information concerning the violation.
(d) Prior substantive violations of section 593A for which a final administrative finding of culpability has been made.
(e) Failure to comply with a Customs summons or lawful demand for records.

# (G) Drawback Compliance Program Participants
(1)
In General.
Special alternative procedures and penalty assessment standards apply in the case of negligent violations of section 593A committed by persons who are certified as participants in the Customs drawback compliance program and who are generally in compliance with the procedures
and requirements of that program. Provisions regarding the operation of the drawback compliance program are set forth in part 191 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR part 191).
(2)
Alternatives to Penalties.
When a participant described in paragraph (G)(1) commits a violation of section 593A, in the absence of fraud or repeated violations and in lieu of a monetary penalty, Customs will issue a written notice of the violation (warning letter).
(a)
Contents of Notice.
The notice will:
(i) State that the person has violated section 593A;
(ii) Explain the nature of the violation; and
(iii) Warn the person that future violations of section 593A may result in the imposition of monetary penalties and that repetitive violations may result in removal of certification under the drawback compliance program until the person takes corrective action that is satisfactory to Customs.
(b)
Response to Notice.
Within 30 days from the date of mailing of the written notice, the person must notify Customs in writing of the steps that have been taken to prevent a recurrence of the violation unless the person establishes to the satisfaction of Customs that no violation took place (see § 162.73a(b)(2)(ii) of the Customs Regulations, 19 CFR 162.73a(b)(2)(ii)). If the person fails to provide the required notification in a timely manner, any penalty assessed for a repetitive violation under paragraph (G)(3) will not be subject to mitigation under this Appendix.
(3)
Repetitive Violations.
(a)
In General.
A person who has been issued a written notice under paragraph (G)(2) and who subsequently commits a negligent violation that is repetitive (
i.e.
, involves the same issue), and any other person who is a participant described in paragraph (G)(1) and who commits a repetitive negligent violation, is subject to one of the following monetary penalties:
(i) An amount not to exceed 20 percent of the loss of revenue for the first repetitive violation that occurs within three years from the date of the violation of which it is repetitive;
(ii) An amount not to exceed 50 percent of the loss of revenue for the second repetitive violation that occurs within three years from the date of the first of two violations of which it is repetitive ; and
(iii) An amount not to exceed 100 percent of the loss of revenue for the third and each subsequent repetitive violation that occurs within three years from the date of the first of three or more violations of which it is repetitive.
(b)
Repetitive Violations Outside 3-Year Period.
If a participant described in paragraph (G)(1) commits a negligent violation that is repetitive but that did not occur within 3 years of the violation of which it is repetitive, the new violation will be treated as a first violation for which a written notice will be issued in accordance with paragraph (G)(2), and each repetitive violation subsequent to that violation that occurs within any 3-year period described in paragraph (G)(3)(a) will result in the assessment of the applicable monetary penalty prescribed in that paragraph.
(4)
Final Penalty Disposition When There Has Been No Prior Disclosure.
(a)
In General.
Customs will consider all information in the petition and all available evidence, taking into account any mitigating factors (see paragraph (F)(4)), aggravating factors (see paragraph (F)(5)), and extraordinary factors in determining the final assessed penalty. All factors considered should be stated in the decision.
(b)
First Repetitive Negligent Violation Within 3 Years of Violation Handled Under Paragraph (G)(2).
The final penalty disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 10 percent of the loss of revenue to a maximum of 20 percent of the loss of revenue.
(c)
Second Repetitive Negligent Violation Within 3 Years of Violation Handled Under Paragraph (G)(2) or (G)(3).
The final penalty disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 25 percent of the loss of revenue to a maximum of 50 percent of the loss of revenue.
(d)
Third and Each Subsequent Repetitive Negligent Violation Within 3 Years of Violation Handled Under Paragraph (G)(2) or (G)(3).
The final penalty disposition will be in an amount ranging from a minimum of 50 percent of the loss of revenue to a maximum of 100 percent of the loss of revenue.
(e)
Fraudulent Violations.
The final penalty disposition will be determined in the same manner as in the case of fraudulent violations committed by persons who are not participants in the drawback compliance program (see paragraph (F)(2)(c)).
(5)
Final Penalty Disposition When There Has Been A Prior Disclosure.
The final penalty disposition will be determined in the same manner as in the case of persons who are not participants in the drawback compliance program (see paragraph (F)(3)).

# (H) Violations by Small Entities
In compliance with the mandate of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, under appropriate circumstances, the issuance of a penalty under section 593A may be waived for businesses qualifying as small business entities. Procedures that were established for small business entities regarding violations of 19 U.S.C. 1592 in Treasury Decision 97-46 published in the
Federal Register
(62 FR 30378) are also applicable for small entities regarding violations of section 593A.

If a petition is not filed within the time specified, the matter will be transmitted promptly to the appropriate Office of the Chief Counsel for referral to the Department of Justice.
§ 172.4
Demand on surety.
If the principal fails to file a petition for relief or fails to comply in the prescribed time with a decision to mitigate a penalty or cancel a claim for liquidated damages issued with regard to a petition for relief, Customs will make a demand for payment on surety. The surety will then have 60 days from the date of the demand to file a petition for relief.

# Subpart B—Action on Petitions
§ 172.11
Petitions acted on by Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer.
(a)
Mitigation or cancellation authority.

(b)
When violation did not occur.
Notwithstanding any other delegation of authority, the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer is always empowered to cancel any case without payment of a mitigated or cancellation amount when he or she definitely determines that the act or omission forming the basis of any claim of penalty or claim for liquidated damages did not occur.
[T.D. 00-57, 65 FR 53578, Sept. 5, 2000, as amended by CBP Dec. 12-07, 77 FR 19534, Apr. 2, 2012]
§ 172.12
Petitions acted on at Customs Headquarters.
Upon receipt of a petition for relief filed pursuant to the provisions of section 618 or 623 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1618 or 19 U.S.C. 1623), involving fines, penalties, and claims for liquidated damages which are outside of his or her delegated authority the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer will refer that petition to the Chief, Penalties Branch, Office of International Trade Regulations and Rulings, CBP Headquarters, who is empowered, notwithstanding any other law or regulation, to mitigate penalties or cancel bond claims on such terms and conditions as, under law and in view of the circumstances, he or she deems appropriate.
[T.D. 00-57, 65 FR 53578, Sept. 5, 2000, as amended by CBP Dec. 12-07, 77 FR 19534, Apr. 2, 2012]
§ 172.13
Limitations on consideration of petitions.
(a)
Cases referred for institution of legal proceedings.
No action will be taken on any petition if the civil liability has been referred to the Department of Justice for institution of legal proceedings. The petition will be forwarded to the Department of Justice.
(b)
Delinquent sureties.
No action will be taken on any petition from a principal or surety if received after the issuance to surety of a notice to show cause pursuant to the provisions of § 113.38(c)(3) of this chapter.
§ 172.14
Headquarters advice.
The advice of the Director, Border Security and Trade Compliance Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, CBP Headquarters, may be sought in any case (except as provided in this section), without regard to delegated authority to act on a petition or offer, when a novel or complex issue concerning a ruling, policy, or procedure is presented concerning a CBP action(s) or potential CBP action(s) relating to penalties secured by bonds (including penalty-based determinations of duty except as provided in this section), claims for liquidated damages or mitigating any claim. This section does not apply to actual duty loss tenders determined by CBP pursuant to § 162.74(c) of this chapter relating to prior disclosure. The request for advice may be initiated by the bond principal, surety or any CBP officer, but must be submitted to the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer retains the authority to refuse to forward any request that fails to raise a qualifying issue and to seek legal advice from the appropriate Associate or Assistant Chief Counsel in any case.

# Subpart C—Disposition of Petitions
§ 172.21
Decisions effective for limited time.
A decision to mitigate a penalty or to cancel a claim for liquidated damages upon condition that a stated amount is paid will be effective for not more than 60 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of such decision unless the decision itself prescribes a different effective period. If payment of the stated amount is not made or a petition or a supplemental petition is not filed in accordance with regulation, the full penalty or claim for liquidated damages will be deemed applicable and will be enforced by promptly transmitting the matter, after required collection action, if appropriate, to the appropriate office of the Chief Counsel for preparation for referral to the Department of Justice unless other action has been directed by the Commissioner of Customs. Any such case may also be the basis for a sanction action commenced in accordance with regulations in this chapter.
§ 172.22
Decisions not protestable.
(a)
Mitigation decision not subject to protest.
Any decision to remit or mitigate a penalty or cancel a claim for liquidated damages upon payment of a lesser amount is not a protestable decision as defined under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1514. Any payment made in compliance with any decision to remit or mitigate a penalty or cancel a claim for liquidated damages upon payment of a lesser amount is not a charge or exaction and therefore is not a protestable action as defined under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1514.
(b)
Payment of mitigated or cancellation amount as accord and satisfaction.
Payment of a mitigated or cancellation amount in compliance with an administrative decision on a petition or supplemental petition for relief will be considered an election of administrative proceedings and full disposition of the case. Payment of a mitigated or cancellation amount will act as an accord and satisfaction of the Government claim. Payment of a mitigated or cancellation amount will never serve as a bar to filing a supplemental petition for relief.

# Subpart D—Offers in Compromise
§ 172.31
Form of offers.
Offers in compromise submitted pursuant to the provisions of section 617 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1617), must expressly state that they are being submitted in accordance with the provisions of that section. The
amount of the offer must be deposited with Customs in accordance with the provisions of § 161.5 of this chapter.
§ 172.32
Authority to accept offers.
The authority to accept offers in compromise, subject to the recommendation of the General Counsel of the Treasury or his delegee, resides with the official having authority to decide a petition for relief, except that authority to accept offers in compromise submitted with regard to penalties secured by a bond or claims for liquidated damages which are the subject of a letter to show cause issued to a surety in anticipation of possible action involving nonacceptance of bonds authorized under the provisions of part 113 of this chapter will reside with the designated Headquarters official who issued the show cause letter.
§ 172.33
Acceptance of offers in compromise.
An offer in compromise will be considered accepted only when the offeror is so notified in writing. As a condition to accepting an offer in compromise, the offeror may be required to enter into any collateral agreement or to post any security which is deemed necessary for the protection of the interest of the United States.

# Subpart E—Supplemental Petitions for Relief
§ 172.41
Time and place of filing.
If the petitioner is not satisfied with a decision of the deciding official on an original petition for relief, a supplemental petition may be filed with the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer having jurisdiction in the port where the violation occurred. The petitioner must file such a supplemental petition within 60 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of the decision from which further relief is requested or within 60 days following an administrative or judicial decision with respect to issues serving as the basis for the claim for liquidated damages (whichever is later) unless another time to file such a supplemental petition is prescribed in the decision. A supplemental petition may be filed whether or not the mitigated amount designated in the decision on the original petition is paid.
§ 172.42
Supplemental petition decision authority.
(a)
Decisions of Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officers.
Supplemental petitions filed on cases where the original decision was made by the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer, will be initially reviewed by that official. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may choose to grant more relief and issue a decision indicating additional relief to the petitioner. If the petitioner is dissatisfied with the further relief granted or if the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer decides to grant no further relief, the supplemental petition will be forwarded to a designated Headquarters official assigned to a field location for review and decision.
(b)
Decisions of CBP Headquarters.
Supplemental petitions filed on cases where the original decision was made by the Chief, Penalties Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, CBP Headquarters, will be forwarded to the Director, Border Security and Trade Compliance Division, Regulations and Rulings, for review and decision.
(c)
Authority of Executive Director.
Any authority given to any Headquarters official by this part may also be exercised by the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, or his designee.
§ 172.43
Waiver of statute of limitations.
The deciding Customs official always reserves the right to require a waiver of the statute of limitations executed by the charged party or parties as a condition precedent before accepting a supplemental petition in any case in which less than one year remains before the statute will be available as a defense to all or part of that case.

The party requesting reliquidation under this section must state, to the best of his or her knowledge, whether the entry for which correction is requested is the subject of a drawback claim, or whether the entry has been referenced on a certificate of delivery or certificate of manufacture and delivery so as to enable a party to make such entry the subject of drawback (
see
§§ 181.50(b) and 191.81(b) of this chapter).
(b)
Entries of merchandise made, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after December 18, 2004.

§ 177.0
Scope.
This part relates to the issuance of rulings to importers and other interested persons by the CBP, other than advance rulings under Article 509 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (see subpart I of part 181 of this chapter). It describes the situations in which a ruling may be requested, the procedures to be followed in requesting a ruling, the conditions under which a ruling will be issued, the effect of a ruling when it is issued, and the publication of rulings in the Customs Bulletin. The rulings issued under the provisions of this part will usually be prospective in application and, consequently, will usually not relate to specific matters or situations presently or previously under consideration by any CBP field office. Accordingly, the rulings requested under the provisions of this part should be distinguished from the administrative rulings, determinations, or decisions which may be requested under procedures set forth elsewhere in this chapter, including, but not limited to, those set forth in part 12 (relating to submissions of proof of admissibility of articles detained under section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307)), part 103 (relating to disclosure of information in Customs files), subpart C of part 152 (relating to determinations concerning the dutiable value of merchandise by Customs field officers), part 153 (relating to enforcement of the Antidumping Act, 1921, as amended), part 159 (insofar as it relates to countervailing duties), part 171 (relating to fines, penalties, and forfeitures), part 172 (relating to liquidated damages), part 174 (relating to protests), and part 175 (relating to petitions filed by American manufacturers, producers, or wholesalers pursuant to section 516 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended). Nor do the provisions of part 177 apply to requests for decisions of an operational, administrative, or investigative nature which are properly within the cognizance of a CBP Headquarters Office other than Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade.

# Subpart A—General Ruling Procedure
§ 177.1
General ruling practice and definitions.
(a)
The issuance of rulings generally
—(1)
Prospective transactions.
It is in the interest of the sound administration of the Customs and related laws that persons engaging in any transaction affected by those laws fully understand the consequences of that transaction prior to its consummation. For this reason, the Customs Service will give full and careful consideration to written requests from importers and other interested parties for rulings or information setting forth, with respect to a specifically described transaction, a definitive interpretation of applicable law, or other appropriate information. Generally, a ruling may be requested under the provisions of this part only with respect to prospective transactions—that is, transactions which are not already pending before a Customs Service office by reason of arrival, entry, or otherwise.
(2)
Current or completed transactions
—(i)
Current transactions.
A question arising in connection with a Customs transaction already before a Customs Service office will normally be resolved by that office in accordance with the principles and precedents previously announced by the Headquarters Office. If such a question cannot be resolved on the basis of clearly established rules set forth in the Customs and related laws, or in the regulations thereunder, or in applicable Treasury Decisions, rulings, opinions, or court decisions published in the Customs Bulletin, that office may be requested to forward the question to the Headquarters Office for consideration, as more fully described in § 177.11.
(ii)
Completed transactions.
A question arising in connection with an entry of merchandise which has been liquidated, or in connection with any other completed Customs transaction, may not be the subject of a ruling request.
(b)
Oral advice.
The Customs Service will not issue rulings in response to oral requests. Oral opinions or advice of Customs Service personnel are not binding on the Customs Service. However, oral inquiries may be made to Customs Service offices regarding existing rulings, the scope of such rulings, the types of transactions with respect to which the Customs Service will issue rulings, the scope of the rulings which may be issued, or the procedures to be followed in submitting ruling requests, as described in this part.
(c)
Who may request a ruling.
Except as otherwise provided in subpart I of part 181 of this chapter, a ruling may be requested under this part by any person who, as an importer or exporter of merchandise, or otherwise, has a direct and demonstrable interest in the question or questions presented in the ruling request, or by the authorized agent of such person. A “person” in this context includes an individual, corporation, partnership, association, or other entity or group.
(d)
Definitions.
(1) A “ruling” is a written statement issued by the Headquarters Office or the appropriate office of Customs as provided in this part that interprets and applies the provisions of the Customs and related laws to a specific set of facts. A “ruling letter” is a ruling issued in response to a written request therefor and set forth in a letter addressed to the person making the request or his designee. A “published ruling” is a ruling which has been published in the Customs Bulletin.
(2) An “information letter” is a written statement issued by the Customs Service that does no more than call attention to a well-established interpretation or principle of Customs law, without applying it to a specific set of facts. An information letter may be issued in response to a request for a ruling when: (i) The request suggests that general information, rather than a ruling, is actually being sought, (ii) the request is incomplete or otherwise fails to meet the requirements set forth in this part, or (iii) the ruling requested cannot be issued for any other reason, and (iv) it is believed that general information may be of some benefit to the party making the request.
(3) A “Customs transaction” is an act or activity to which the Customs and related laws apply. A “prospective” Customs transaction is one that is contemplated or is currently being undertaken and has not resulted in any arrival or the filing of any entry or other document, or in any other act to bring the transaction, or any part of it, under the jurisdiction of any Customs Service office. A “current” Customs transaction is one which is presently under consideration by a port office of the Customs Service. A “completed” Customs transaction is one which has been acted upon by a Customs Service field office and with respect to which that office has issued a determination which is final in nature, but is (or was) subject to appeal, petition, protest, or other review, as provided in the applicable Customs laws and regulations. In a series of identical, recurring transactions, each transaction shall be considered an individual transaction for purposes of this part.
(4) An “authorized agent” is a person expressly authorized by a principal to act on his behalf. A ruling requested by an attorney or other person acting as an agent must include a statement describing the authority under which the request is made. With the exception of attorneys whose authority to represent is known, any person appearing before the Customs Service as an agent in connection with a ruling request may be required to present evidence of his authority to represent the principal. The foregoing requirements will not apply to an individual representing his full-time employer, or to a bona-fide officer, director, or other qualified representative of a corporation, association, or organized group.
(5) The term “Customs and related laws,” as generally used in this part, includes any provision of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (including the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States), or the Customs Regulations, or any provision contained in other legislation (including the navigation laws),
regulations, treaties, orders, proclamations, or other agreements administered by the Customs Service.
(6) The term “Headquarters Office,” as used herein, means the Regulations and Rulings, Office of international Trade at Headquarters, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC.
[T.D. 75-186, 40 FR 31929, July 30, 1975, as amended by T.D. 80-285, 45 FR 80104, Dec. 3, 1980; T.D. 84-149, 49 FR 28699, July 16, 1984; T.D. 89-1, 53 FR 51271, Dec. 21, 1988; T.D. 89-74, 54 FR 31515, July 31, 1989; T.D. 94-1, 58 FR 69473, Dec. 30, 1993]
§ 177.2
Submission of ruling requests.
(a)
Form.
A request for a ruling should be in the form of a letter. Requests for Valuation and Carrier rulings should be addressed to the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Washington, DC 20229. The Division and Branch in the Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, to which the request should be directed may also be indicated, if known. Requests for tariff classification rulings should be addressed to the Director, National Commodity Specialist Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 201 Varick Street, Suite 501, New York, New York 10014.
(b)
Content
—(1)
Generally.
Each request for a ruling must contain a complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the transaction. Such facts include the names, addresses, and other identifying information of all interested parties (if known); the name of the port or place at which any article involved in the transaction will arrive or be entered, or which will otherwise have jurisdiction with respect to the act or activity described in the transaction; and a description of the transaction itself, appropriate in detail to the type of ruling requested.
(2)
Description of transaction
—(i)
Generally.
The Customs transaction to which the ruling request relates must be described in sufficient detail to permit the proper application of relevant customs and related laws.
(ii)
Tariff classification rulings.
(A) If the transaction involves the importation of an article for which a ruling as to its proper classification under the provisions of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States is requested, the request for a ruling should include a full and complete description of the article and whenever germane to the proper classification of the article, information as to the article's chief use in the United States, its commercial, common, or technical designation, and, where the article is composed of two or more materials, the relative quantity (by weight and by volume) and value of each. The ruling request should also note, whenever germane, the purchase price of the article, and its approximate selling price in the United States. Individual requests for rulings submitted to service port offices will be limited to five (5) merchandise items, all of which must be of the same class or kind.
(B) Rulings issued by the Director, National Commodity Specialist Division, or any service port office are limited to prospective transactions. Only the Headquarters Office will prepare final decisions under § 177.11 (Requests for Advice by Field Officers), or § 174.23 (Further Review of Protests), § 177.10 (Change of Practice), decisions under part 175 of this chapter (petitions under section 516, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended), decisions under § 177.13 (Inconsistent Customs decisions), and decisions under Policies and Procedures Manual Supplement 2126-01.
(C) The requesting party may send the request directly to the Director, Commercial and Trade Facilitation Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. The Headquarters Office retains authority to independently review all tariff classification ruling letters issued by the Director, National Commodity Specialist Division, and any service port office. If the importer or other person to whom a ruling letter is issued disagrees with the tariff classification set forth in a ruling issued by the Director, National Commodity Specialist Division, or any service port office, he may petition the Director, Commercial Rulings Division, U.S. Customs Service, Washington, DC 20229, for review of the ruling.
(iii)
Valuation rulings.
If the transaction involves the valuation of an article for Customs purposes, the request for a ruling should include all of the applicable information described in subpart C of part 152 of this chapter, and, insofar as is relevant, the information which would be required on an invoice as described in subpart F of part 141 of this chapter. The request should also describe the nature of the transaction (whether f.o.b./c.i.f., ex-factory, or some other arrangement), the relationship (if any) of the parties, whether the transaction was at arm's-length, whether there have been other sales of the same or similar merchandise in the country of exportation, whether an agency relationship exists, or any other information relevant to a determination under section 402 or 402a of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1401a, 1402).
(iv)
Carrier rulings.
If the transaction involves a vessel, the request for a ruling should include information relating to place of build and nationality of registration and, if to be used in waters under the jurisdiction of the United States, the exact place or places of intended use, if known. If the request for a ruling involves a determination as to whether or not the primary object of a contemplated voyage would be considered to be coastwise transportation in violation of 46 U.S.C. 289 (see § 4.80a of this chapter), the request should completely identify the voyage, including the proposed time of arrival at and departure from every port on the itinerary and any coordination of the voyage with special events at coastwise ports, and should be accompanied by samples, if available, of brochures, advertising, and other information that may be relevant to a determination of the primary object of the proposed voyage.
(3)
Samples.
Each request for a ruling regarding the status of an article under any Customs or related law affecting the importation or arrival of that article should be accompanied by photographs, drawings, or other pictorial representations of the article and, whenever possible, by a sample article, unless a precise description of the article is not essential to the ruling requested. Any article consisting of materials in chemical or physical combination for which a laboratory analysis has been prepared by or for the manufacturer should include a copy of that analysis. A sample submitted in connection with a request for a ruling becomes a part of the Customs Service file in the matter and will be retained until the ruling is issued or the ruling request is otherwise disposed of. If the return of the sample is desired, the ruling request should so state and should specify the desired means of return. A sample should only be submitted with the understanding that all or a part of it may be damaged or consumed in the course of examination, testing, analysis, or other actions undertaken in connection with the ruling request.
(4)
Related documents.
If the question or questions presented in the ruling request directly relate to matters set forth in any invoice, contract, agreement, or other document, a copy of the document must be submitted with the request. (Original documents should not be submitted inasmuch as any documents or exhibits furnished with the ruling request become a part of the Customs Service file in the matter and cannot be returned.) The relevant facts reflected in any documents submitted, and an explanation of their bearing on the question or questions presented, must be expressly set forth in the ruling request.
(5)
Prior or current transactions.
Each request for a ruling must state whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, the same transaction, or one identical to it, has ever been considered, or is currently being considered by any Customs Service office or whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, the issues involved have ever been considered, or are currently being considered, by the United States Court of International Trade, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom. Where the transaction described in the ruling request is but one of a series of similar and related transactions, that fact must also be stated.
(6)
Statement of position.
If the request for a ruling asks that a particular determination or conclusion be reached in the ruling letter, a statement must
be included in the request setting forth the basis for that determination or conclusion, together with a citation of all relevant supporting authority.
(7)
Privileged or confidential information.
Information which is claimed to constitute trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information regarding the business transactions of private parties the disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person making the request (or of another interested party), must be identified clearly and the reasons such information should not be disclosed, including, where applicable, the reasons the disclosure of the information would prejudice the competitive position of the person making the request (or of another interested party) must be set forth.
(c)
Signing; instructions as to reply.
The request for a ruling must be signed by a person authorized to make the request, as described in § 177.1(c). A ruling requested by a principal or authorized agent may direct that the ruling letter be addressed to the other.
(d)
Requests for immediate consideration.
The Customs Service will normally process requests for rulings in the order they are received and as expeditiously as possible. However, a request that a particular matter be given consideration ahead of its regular order, if made in writing at the time the request is submitted, or subsequent thereto, and showing a clear need for such treatment, will be given consideration as the particular circumstances warrant and permit. Requests for special consideration made by telegram will be treated in the same manner as requests made by letter, but rulings will not ordinarily be issued by telegram. In no event can any assurance be given that a particular request for a ruling will be acted upon by the time requested. However, upon request and where a clear need is shown for such action, a collect telephone call will be made to advise that the ruling letter has been issued and is being mailed.

§ 177.3
Nonconforming requests for rulings.
A person submitting a request for a ruling that does not comply with all of the provisions of this part will be so notified in writing, and the requirements that have not been met will be pointed out. Except in the case of ruling requests submitted to Area or District offices, such person will be given a period of thirty (30) days from the date of the notice (or such longer period as the notice may provide) to supply any additional information that is requested or otherwise conform the ruling request to the requirements referred to in the notice. The Customs Service file with respect to ruling requests which are not brought into compliance with the provisions of this part within the period of time allowed will be administratively closed and the request removed from active consideration until such time as the deficiencies cited in the notice are corrected. A request for a ruling that is removed from active consideration by reason of failing to comply with the provisions of this part may be treated as withdrawn. In the case of ruling requests made to Area or District offices, a failure to comply with the provisions of this part will result in the return of the ruling request with the notice specifying the deficiencies and such requests will not be considered as having been filed until such deficiencies are corrected.
[T.D. 89-74, 54 FR 31515, July 31, 1989]
§ 177.4
Oral discussion of issues.
(a)
Generally.
A person submitting a request for a ruling and desiring an opportunity to orally discuss the issue or issues involved should indicate that desire in writing at the time the ruling request is filed. Such a discussion will only be scheduled when, in the opinion of the Customs personnel by whom the ruling request is under consideration, a conference will be helpful in deciding the issue or issues involved or when a determination or conclusion contrary
to that advocated in the ruling request is contemplated. Conferences are scheduled for the purpose of affording the parties an opportunity to freely and openly discuss the matters set forth in the ruling request. Accordingly, the parties will not be bound by any argument or position advocated or agreed to, expressly or by implication, during the conference unless either party subsequently agrees to be so bound in writing. The conference will not conclude with the issuance of a ruling letter.
(b)
Time, place, and number of conferences.
If a request for a conference is granted, the person making the request will be notified of the time and place of the conference. No more than one conference with respect to the matters set forth in a ruling request will be scheduled, unless, in the opinion of the Customs personnel by whom the ruling request is under consideration, additional conferences are necessary.
(c)
Representation.
A person whose request for a conference has been granted may be accompanied at that conference by counsel or other representatives, or may designate such persons to attend the conference in his place.
(d)
Additional information presented at conferences.
It will be the responsibility of the person submitting the request for a ruling to provide for inclusion in the Customs Service file in the matter a written record setting forth any and all additional information, documents, and exhibits introduced during the conference to the extent that person considers such material relevant to the consideration of the ruling request.
[T.D. 75-186, 40 FR 31929, July 30, 1975, as amended by T.D. 80-285, 45 FR 80105, Dec. 3, 1980; T.D. 84-149, 49 FR 28699, July 16, 1984; T.D. 89-74, 54 FR 31515, July 31, 1989]
§ 177.5
Change in status of transaction.
Each person submitting a request for a ruling in connection with a Customs transaction shall immediately advise Customs in writing of any change in the status of that transaction, as defined in § 177.1(d)(3). In particular, the Customs Service office to which the request was made must be advised when any transaction described in the ruling request as prospective becomes current and under the jurisdiction of a Customs Service field office. In addition, any person engaged in a Customs transaction coming under the jurisdiction of a Customs Service field office and having previously requested a ruling with respect to that transaction shall advise the field office of that fact. The field office will normally withhold action with respect to any transaction for which a ruling has previously been requested pending the disposition of the ruling request.
[T.D. 80-285, 45 FR 80105, Dec. 3, 1980, as amended by T.D. 84-149, 49 FR 28699, July 16, 1984; T.D. 89-74, 54 FR 31516, July 31, 1989]
§ 177.6
Withdrawal of ruling requests.
Any request for a ruling may be withdrawn by the person submitting it at any time before the issuance of a ruling letter or any other final disposition of the request. All correspondence, documents, and exhibits submitted in connection with the request will be retained in the Customs Service file and will not be returned. In addition, the Headquarters Office may forward to Customs Service field offices which have or may have jurisdiction over the transaction to which the ruling request relates, its views in regard to the transaction or the issues involved therein, as well as appropriate information derived from materials in the Customs Service file.
[T.D. 80-285, 45 FR 80105, Dec. 3, 1980]
§ 177.7
Situations in which no ruling will be issued.
(a)
Generally.
No ruling letter will be issued in response to a request for a ruling which fails to comply with the provisions of this part. Moreover, no ruling letter will be issued with regard to transactions or questions which are essentially hypothetical in nature or in any instance in which it appears contrary to the sound administration of the Customs and related laws to do so. No ruling letter will be issued in regard to a completed transaction.
(b)
Pending litigation in the United States Court of International Trade.
No ruling letter will be issued with respect to any issue which is pending before the United States Court of International Trade, the United States
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom. Litigation before any other court will not preclude the issuance of a ruling letter, provided neither the Customs Service nor any of its officers or agents is named as a defendant.
[T.D. 75-186, 40 FR 31929, July 30, 1975, as amended by T.D. 85-90, 50 FR 21430, May 24, 1985]
§ 177.8
Issuance of rulings.
(a)
Ruling letters
—(1)
Generally.
The Customs Service will endeavor to issue a ruling letter setting forth a determination with respect to a specifically described Customs transaction whenever a request for such a ruling is submitted in accordance with the provisions of this part and it is in the sound administration of the Customs and related laws to do so. Otherwise, a request for a ruling will be answered by an information letter or, in those situations in which general information is likely to be of little or no value, by a letter stating that no ruling can be issued.
(2)
Submission of ruling letters to field offices.
Any person engaging in a Customs transaction with respect to which a binding tariff classification ruling letter (including pre-entry classification decisions) has been issued under this part shall ascertain that a copy of the ruling letter is attached to the documents filed with the appropriate Customs Service office in connection with that transaction, or shall otherwise indicate with the information filed for that transaction that a ruling has been received. Any person receiving a ruling setting forth the tariff classification of merchandise shall set forth such classification in the documents or information filed in connection with any subsequent entry of that merchandise; the failure to do so may result in a rejection of the entry and the imposition of such penalties as may be appropriate. A ruling received after the filing of such documents or information shall immediately be brought to the attention of the appropriate Customs Service field office.
(3)
Disclosure of ruling letters.
The ruling letter shall be based on the information set forth in the ruling request. No part of the ruling letter, including names, addresses, or information relating to the business transactions of private parties, shall be deemed to constitute privileged or confidential commercial or financial information or trade secrets exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), unless, as provided in § 177.2(b)(7), the information claimed to be exempt from disclosure is clearly identified and the reasons for the exemption are set forth. Before the issuance of the ruling letter, the person submitting the ruling request, will be notified of any decision adverse to his claim for exemption from disclosure and will, upon written request to Customs within 10 working days of the date of notification, be permitted to withdraw the ruling request. All ruling letters issued by the Customs Service will be available, upon written request, for inspection and copying by any person (with any portions determined to be exempt from disclosure deleted).
(b)
Other rulings.
The Headquarters Office may from time to time issue other rulings with respect to issues or transactions described or suggested by requests for rulings submitted under the provisions of this part, or with respect to issues or transactions otherwise brought to its attention. These rulings, which are statements of the official position of the Customs Service which are likely to be of widespread interest and application, are published in the Customs Bulletin, as described in § 177.10.
[T.D. 75-186, 40 FR 31929, July 30, 1975, as amended by T.D. 80-285, 45 FR 80105, Dec. 3, 1980; T.D. 84-149, 49 FR 28699, July 16, 1984; T.D. 89-74, 54 FR 31516, July 31, 1989]
§ 177.9
Effect of ruling letters.
(a)
Effect of ruling letters generally.
A ruling letter issued by the Customs Service under the provisions of this part represents the official position of the Customs Service with respect to the particular transaction or issue described therein and is binding on all Customs Service personnel in accordance with the provisions of this section until modified or revoked. In the absence of a change of practice or other modification or revocation which affects the principle of the ruling set
forth in the ruling letter, that principle may be cited as authority in the disposition of transactions involving the same circumstances. Generally, a ruling letter is effective on the date it is issued and may be applied to all entries which are unliquidated, or other transactions with respect to which the Customs Service has not taken final action on that date. See, however, § 177.10(e) (changes of practice published in the
Federal Register
) and § 177.12 (rulings which modify or revoke previous rulings, decisions, or treatments).
(b)
Application of rulings to transactions
—(1)
Generally.
Each ruling letter is issued on the assumption that all of the information furnished in connection with the ruling request and incorporated in the ruling letter, either directly, by reference, or by implication, is accurate and complete in every material respect. The application of a ruling letter by a Customs Service field office to the transaction to which it is purported to relate is subject to the verification of the facts incorporated in the ruling letter, a comparison of the transaction described therein to the actual transaction, and the satisfaction of any conditions on which the ruling was based. If, in the opinion of any Customs Service field office by whom the transaction is under consideration or review, the ruling letter should be modified or revoked, the findings and recommendations of that office will be forwarded to the Headquarters Office for consideration, as provided in § 177.11(b)(1)(i), prior to any final disposition with respect to the transaction by that office. Otherwise, if the transaction described in the ruling letter and the actual transaction are the same, and any and all conditions set forth in the ruling letter have been satisfied, the ruling will be applied to the transaction.
(2)
Tariff classification rulings.
Each ruling letter setting forth the proper classification of an article under the provisions of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States will be applied only with respect to transactions involving articles identical to the sample submitted with the ruling request or to articles whose description is identical to the description set forth in the ruling letter.
(3)
Valuation rulings.
Each ruling letter setting forth the proper valuation of an article under the provisions of section 402 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1401a), will be applied only with respect to transactions involving the same merchandise and like facts.
(4)
Carrier rulings.
Each ruling letter setting forth the applicability of the navigation laws to a vessel will be applied only with respect to transactions involving operations identical to those set forth in the ruling letter. Each ruling letter setting forth a determination as to whether or not the primary object of a contemplated voyage is coastwise transportation in violation of 46 U.S.C. 289 will be binding on the United States Customs Service with respect to any transaction identical to the facts and circumstances described in the ruling request and undertaken in reliance on the ruling letter.
(c)
Reliance on ruling letters by others.
Except when public notice and comment procedures apply under § 177.12, a ruling letter is subject to modification or revocation by CBP without notice to any person other than the person to whom the ruling letter was addressed. Accordingly, no other person should rely on the ruling letter or assume that the principles of that ruling will be applied in connection with any transaction other than the one described in the letter. However, any person eligible to request a ruling under § 177.1(c) may request information as to whether a previously-issued ruling letter has been modified or revoked by writing the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Washington, DC 20229, and either enclosing a copy of the ruling letter or furnishing other information sufficient to permit the ruling letter in question to be identified.

§ 177.10
Publication of decisions.
(a)
Generally.
Within 90 days after issuing any interpretive decision under the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, relating to any Customs transaction (prospective, current, or completed), the Customs Service shall publish the decision in the Customs Bulletin or otherwise make it available for public inspection. For purposes of this paragraph an interpretive decision includes any ruling letter, internal advice memorandum, or protest review decision. Disclosure is governed by 31 CFR part 1, 19 CFR part 103, and 19 CFR 177.8(a)(3).
(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Changes of practice.
Before the publication of a ruling which has the effect of changing an established and uniform practice and which results in the assessment of a higher rate of duty within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. 1315(d), notice that the practice (or prior ruling on which that practice was based) is under review will be published in the
Federal Register
and interested parties will be given an opportunity to make written submissions with respect to the correctness of the contemplated change.
(d)
Limiting rulings.
A published ruling may limit the application of a court decision to the specific article under litigation, or to an article of a specific class or kind of such merchandise, or to the particular circumstances or entries which were the subject of the litigation.
(e)
Effective dates.
Except as otherwise provided in § 177.12(e) or in the ruling itself, all rulings published under the provisions of this part will be applied immediately. If the ruling involves merchandise, it will be applicable to all unliquidated entries, except that a change of practice resulting in the assessment of a higher rate of duty or increased duties shall be effective only as to merchandise entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the 90th day after publication of the change in the
Federal Register.

§ 177.11
Requests for advice by field offices.
(a)
Generally.
Advice or guidance as to the interpretation or proper application of the Customs and related laws with respect to a specific Customs transaction may be requested by Customs Service field offices from the Headquarters Office at any time, whether the transaction is prospective, current, or completed. Advice as to the proper application of the Customs and related laws to a current transaction will be sought by a Customs Service field office whenever that office is requested to do so, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, by an importer or other person having an interest in the transaction. Advice or guidance will be furnished by the Headquarters Office as a means of assisting Customs personnel in the orderly processing of Customs transactions under consideration by them and to insure the consistent application of the Customs and related laws in the several Customs districts. Requests for advice received by the Headquarters Office will be processed as expeditiously as possible.
(b)
Certain current transactions
—(1)
When a ruling has been issued
—(i)
Requests by field offices.
If any Customs Service office has issued a ruling letter with respect to a particular Customs transaction and the Customs Service field office having jurisdiction over that transaction believes that the ruling should be modified or revoked, the field office will forward to the Headquarters Office, pursuant to § 177.9(b)(1), a request that the ruling be reconsidered. The field office will notify the importer or other person to whom the ruling letter was issued, in writing, that it has requested the Headquarters Office to reconsider the ruling.
(ii)
Requests by importers and others.
If the importer or other person to whom a ruling letter is issued disagrees with the Customs Service field office having jurisdiction over the transaction to which the ruling relates as to the proper application of the ruling to the transaction, the field office will, upon receipt of a written request submitted in accordance with the procedure set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, request advice from the Headquarters
Office as to the proper application of the ruling to the transaction. Such advice may not be requested for the purpose of seeking reconsideration of a ruling with which the importer or other person to whom the ruling letter was issued disagrees.
(2)
When no ruling has been issued.
Internal advice will be sought by a Customs Service field office with respect to a current transaction for which no ruling was requested or issued under the provisions of this part whenever a difference of opinion exists as to the interpretation or proper application of the Customs and related laws to the transaction, and the field office is requested to seek such advice by an importer or other person who would have been entitled, under § 177.1(c), to request a ruling with respect to the transaction, while prospective. The request must be submitted to the field office in writing and in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(3)
Form of request by importers and others.
An importer or other person requesting that a Customs Service field office seek advice from the Headquarters Office must make such a request, in writing, to the field office having jurisdiction over the transaction in question. The request shall contain a complete statement setting forth a description of the transaction, the specific questions presented, the applicable law, and an argument for the conclusions advocated. The statement must also specify whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the statement, the same transaction, or one identical to it, has ever been considered, or is currently being considered, by any Customs Service office. In addition, the statement should indicate at which port or ports of entry identical or substantially identical merchandise has been entered.
(4)
Review of requests by importers and others.
All requests submitted by importers and other persons under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, will be reviewed by the field office to which they are submitted. In the event a difference of opinion exists as to the description of the transaction or as to the point or points at issue, the person submitting the request will be so advised in writing. If agreement cannot be reached, both the statements of the person submitting the request and the field office will be forwarded to the Headquarters Office for consideration.
(5)
Refusal by Headquarters Office to furnish advice.
The Headquarters Office may refuse to consider the questions presented to it in the form of a request for internal advice whenever (i) the Headquarters Office determines that the period of time necessary to give adequate consideration to the questions presented would result in a withholding of action with respect to the transaction, or in any other situation, that is inconsistent with the sound administration of the Customs and related laws, and (ii) the questions presented can subsequently be raised by the importer or other interested party in the form of a protest filed in accordance with the provisions of part 174 of this chapter.
(6)
Effect of advice received from the Headquarters Office.
Advice furnished by the Headquarters Office in response to a request therefor represents the official position of the Customs Service as to the application of the Customs laws to the facts of a specific transaction. If the field office believes that the advice furnished by the Headquarters Office should be reconsidered, it shall promptly request such reconsideration. Otherwise, the advice furnished by the Headquarters Office will be applied by the field office in its disposition of the Customs transaction in question.
(7)
Publication.
Within 90 days after issuing an internal advice memorandum, the Customs Service shall publish the decision in the Customs Bulletin or otherwise make it available for public inspection. Disclosure is governed by 31 CFR part 1 and 19 CFR part 103.
(8)
Judicial review of importers' requests.
A refusal by the Headquarters Office to consider the questions raised by an importer in the form of a request for internal advice may be appealed to the Court of International Trade if the importer demonstrates to the Court that he would be irreparably harmed unless given an opportunity to obtain
judicial review prior to the importation of the merchandise.

§ 177.12
Modification or revocation of interpretive rulings, protest review decisions, and previous treatment of substantially identical transactions.
(a)
General.
An interpretive ruling, which includes an internal advice decision, issued under this part, or a holding or principle covered by a protest review decision issued under part 174 of this chapter, if found to be in error or not in accord with the current views of Customs, may be modified or revoked by an interpretive ruling issued under this section. In addition, an interpretive ruling issued under this section may have the effect of modifying or revoking the treatment previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical transactions. A modification or revocation under this section must be carried out in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, and the modification or revocation will take effect as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
(b)
Interpretive rulings or protest review decisions.
Customs may modify or revoke an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision that has been in effect for less than 60 calendar days by simply giving written notice of the modification or revocation to the person to whom the original ruling was issued or whose current transaction was the subject of the internal advice decision or, in the case of a protest review decision, to the person identified on the Customs Form 19 as the protestant or to any other person designated to receive notice of denial of a protest under § 174.30(b) of this chapter. However, when Customs contemplates the issuance of an interpretive ruling that would modify or revoke an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision which has been in effect for 60 or more calendar days, the following procedures will apply:
(1)
Publication of proposed action.
A notice proposing the modification or revocation and inviting public comment on the proposal will be published in the
Customs Bulletin.
The notice will refer to all previously issued interpretive rulings or protest review decisions that Customs has identified as being the subject of the proposed action and will invite any member of the public who has received another interpretive ruling or protest review decision involving the issue that is the subject of the proposed action to advise Customs of that fact. Interested parties will have 30 calendar days from the date of publication of the notice to submit written comments on the proposed modification or revocation and to advise Customs in writing that they are recipients of an affected interpretive ruling or protest review decision that was not identified in the notice.
(2)
Notice of final action.
In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, within 30 calendar days after the close of the public comment period, any submitted comments will be considered and a final modifying or revoking notice or notice of other appropriate final action on the proposed modification or revocation will be published in the
Customs Bulletin.
In addition, a written decision will be issued to the person to whom, or on whose transaction, the original interpretive ruling was issued or, in the case of a protest review decision, to the person identified on the Customs Form 19 as the protestant or to any other person designated to receive notice of denial of a protest under § 174.30(b) of this chapter. Publication of a final modifying or revoking notice in the
Customs Bulletin
will have the effect of modifying or revoking any interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision that involves merchandise or an issue that is substantially identical in all material respects to the merchandise or issue that is the subject of the modification or revocation, including an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review
decision that is not specifically identified in the final modifying or revoking notice.
(c)
Treatment previously accorded to substantially identical transactions
—(1)
General.
The issuance of an interpretive ruling that has the effect of modifying or revoking the treatment previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical transactions must be in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The following rules will apply for purposes of determining under this section whether a treatment was previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical transactions of a person:
(i) There must be evidence to establish that:
(A) There was an actual determination by a Customs officer regarding the facts and issues involved in the claimed treatment;
(B) The Customs officer making the actual determination was responsible for the subject matter on which the determination was made; and
(C) Over a 2-year period immediately preceding the claim of treatment, Customs consistently applied that determination on a national basis as reflected in liquidations of entries or reconciliations or other Customs actions with respect to all or substantially all of that person's Customs transactions involving materially identical facts and issues;
(ii) The determination of whether the requisite treatment occurred will be made by Customs on a case-by-case basis and will involve an assessment of all relevant factors. In particular, Customs will focus on the past transactions to determine whether there was an examination of the merchandise (where applicable) by Customs or the extent to which those transactions were otherwise reviewed by Customs to determine the proper application of the Customs laws and regulations. For purposes of establishing whether the requisite treatment occurred, Customs will give diminished weight to transactions involving small quantities or values, and Customs will give no weight whatsoever to informal entries and to other entries or transactions which Customs, in the interest of commercial facilitation and accommodation, processes expeditiously and without examination or Customs officer review;
(iii) Customs will not find that a treatment was accorded to a person's transactions if:
(A) The person's own transactions were not accorded the treatment in question over the 2-year period immediately preceding the claim of treatment;
(B) The issue in question involves the admissibility of merchandise;
(C) The person made a material false statement or material omission in connection with a Customs transaction or in connection with the review of a Customs transaction and that statement or omission affected the determination on which the treatment claim is based; or
(D) Customs advised the person regarding the manner in which the transactions should be presented to Customs and the person failed to follow that advice; and
(iv) The evidentiary burden as regards the existence of the previous treatment is on the person claiming that treatment. The evidence of previous treatment by Customs must include a list of all materially identical transactions by entry number (or other Customs assigned number), the quantity and value of merchandise covered by each transaction (where applicable), the ports of entry, the dates of final action by Customs, and, if known, the name and location of the Customs officer who made the determination on which the claimed treatment is based. In addition, in cases in which an entry is liquidated without any Customs review (for example, the entry is liquidated automatically as entered), the person claiming a previous treatment must be prepared to submit to Customs written or other appropriate evidence of the earlier actual determination of a Customs officer that the person relied on in preparing the entry and that is consistent with the liquidation of the entry.
(2)
Notice procedures
—(i) When Customs has reason to believe that a contemplated interpretive ruling would have the effect of modifying or revoking the treatment previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical
transactions, notice of the intent to modify or revoke that treatment will be published in the
Customs Bulletin
either as a separate action or in connection with a proposed modification or revocation of an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The notice will give interested parties 30 calendar days from the date of publication of the notice to submit written comments on the proposed modification or revocation and will invite any member of the public whose substantially identical transactions have been accorded the same treatment to advise Customs in writing of that fact, supported by appropriate details regarding those transactions, within that 30-day period. Within 30 calendar days after the close of the public comment period, any submitted comments will be considered, notice of the final interpretive ruling or other final action on the proposed modification or revocation will be published in the
Customs Bulletin.
Written confirmation of the applicability of a final modification or revocation will be sent to each person identified as having had substantially identical transactions that were accorded the same treatment.
(ii) If Customs is not aware prior to issuance that a contemplated interpretive ruling would have the effect of modifying or revoking the treatment previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical transactions, the interpretive ruling will be issued and generally will be effective as provided in § 177.9. However, Customs will, upon written application by a person claiming that the interpretive ruling has the effect of modifying or revoking the treatment previously accorded by Customs to his substantially identical transactions, consider delaying the effective date of the interpretive ruling with respect to that person, and continue the treatment previously accorded the substantially identical transactions, pending completion of the procedures set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(d)
Exceptions to notice requirements
—(1)
Publication and issuance not required.
The publication and issuance requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are inapplicable in circumstances in which a Customs position is modified, revoked or otherwise materially affected by operation of law or by publication pursuant to other legal authority or by other appropriate action taken by Customs in furtherance of an order, instruction or other policy decision of another governmental agency or entity pursuant to statutory or delegated authority. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following:

(i) The modifying ruling corrects a clerical error; or
(ii) The modifying or revoking ruling is directed to a ruling issued under subpart I of part 181 of this chapter relating to advance rulings under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
(e)
Effective date and application to transactions
—(1)
Rulings or decisions in effect for less than 60 days.
If an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision that is modified or revoked under this section had been in effect for less than 60 calendar days, the modifying or revoking interpretive ruling:

(ii) Will be applicable to merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on and after its date of issuance.
(2)

§ 177.13
Inconsistent CBP decisions.
(a)
Generally.
Certain decisions made by CBP officials at one field location which are inconsistent with decisions being made by CBP officials at another location may be brought to the attention of CBP Headquarters for resolution by a petition filed by an interested party. The types of decisions which may be the subject of such a petition, a description of the parties who qualify as interested parties, and the period of time in which the petition may be filed are set forth below.
(1)
Inconsistent decisions subject to petition.
The decisions which may be the subject of a petition include:
(i) Decisions described in section 514(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514(a)), made with respect to the same, or substantially similar, merchandise; and
(ii) Repeated decisions to conduct intensified inspections or examinations of merchandise at ports of entry.
(2)
Interested Parties.
The following parties will be considered interested parties entitled to file a petition under this section:
(i) Parties described in section 514(c)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514(c)(2)), as eligible to file a protest under section 514;
(ii) A port authority; and
(iii) An “interested party,” as described in section 516(a)(2) of the Tariff
Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1516(a)(2)).
(3)
Time for filing.
In the case of decisions described in section 514(a) of the Tariff Act, the petition must be filed within the time prescribed by section 514(c)(2), for filing a protest with respect to the later (or latest) of the decisions which are the subject of the petition. In the case of repeated decisions to conduct intensified inspections or examinations of merchandise at ports of entry, the petition must be filed within ninety (90) days of the later (or latest) such decision.
(b)
Petition
—(1)
Form.
The petition must be in the form of a letter addressed to the Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229-0001. Three copies of the petition should be submitted, if possible.
(2)
Content.
The petition should contain a complete description of the inconsistent decisions complained of, including the ports of entry (or other CBP office) where the decisions were made, entry numbers, and the dates (or approximate dates) such decisions were made. The information set forth in the petition must be sufficient to demonstrate the inconsistency of the decisions described and that the merchandise, or circumstances in which the allegedly inconsistent decisions were made, were substantially similar. In the case of repeated decisions regarding the inspection or examination of merchandise, the decisions must be sufficient in number to demonstrate a pattern of inconsistency not attributable to random selection. Any information which the petitioner considers to be confidential business information should be so noted pursuant to § 177.2(b)(7) of this subpart and a sanitized version of his petition should be submitted as well as the three copies requested in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Petitions which do not contain information sufficient to permit the CBP to verify that the decisions described have occurred will not be considered properly filed and will be returned to the petitioner for additional information. Only one petition will be accepted by the CBP with respect to the decisions alleged to be inconsistent.
(i)
Tariff classification decision.
In the case of decisions involving the tariff classification of merchandise, the petition should also include, with respect to each of the decisions described, the information requested in § 177.2 (b)(1) and (b)(2)(ii) of this subpart, including a sample (see § 177.2(b)(3)).
(ii)
Other subjects addressable by administrative rulings.
In the case of other decisions involving subjects which could be addressed under the administrative rulings procedure provided for in §§ 177.1 through 177.10 of this subpart, the information contained in § 177.2 (b)(1), (b)(2)(iii) and/or (b)(2)(iv), as applicable, should be also furnished for each of the decisions addressed by the petition.
(c)
Publication and public comment.
Upon receipt of a properly filed petition, notice will be published in the
Federal Register
announcing the receipt of the petition and describing the decisions alleged to be inconsistent. Public comment on the petition will be permitted for a period of fifteen (15) days after publication. Public comment regarding the proper disposition of the petition will be limited to that submitted in writing, either with the petition or in response to the
Federal Register
solicitation of public comment.
(d)
Determination of petition; distribution and publication.
Within fifteen (15) days after the close of the period for public comment referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, CBP will issue a decision to the petitioner addressing the inconsistency complained of. That decision will either conform the inconsistent decisions to the current views of CBP as to the proper tariff classification or other disposition of the subject of those decisions or explain why no inconsistency exists. Copies of the decisions to the petitioner will be transmitted directly to all ports (or other CBP offices) identified in the petition and will be distributed through the Customs Information Exchange or by other means to such other ports or offices as may be necessary to correct
any inconsistency identified. A summary of the decision will also be published in the
Federal Register
and the weekly Customs Bulletin.
(e)
Effective date.
Unless otherwise specified in the decision, a decision issued in response to a petition filed under this section will be effective immediately and, where applicable, applied to all entries for which liquidation is not final.
(f)
Effect on other procedures.
The filing of a petition under this procedure will not preclude the petitioner or any other person entitled to do so from filing a protest or a domestic interested party petition regarding the same matter under the procedures set forth in sections 514, 515 and 516 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended and parts 174 and 175 of this chapter, provided the applicable requirements set forth therein are complied with. However, the decision issued in response to the petition may serve as the basis for the disposition of any protest so filed, or as an information letter setting forth the position of the CBP pursuant to subpart A of part 175 of this chapter. The decision issued in response to a petition filed under this section is not itself a decision subject to protest under sections 514-515 of the Tariff Act and part 174 of this chapter.

# Subpart B—Government Procurement; Country-of-Origin Determinations

# Authority:
R.S. 251, as amended (19 U.S.C. 66), sec. 624, 46 Stat. 759 (19 U.S.C. 1624); Pub. L. 96-39, 93 Stat. 144.

# Source:
T.D. 83-13, 48 FR 1189, Jan. 11, 1983, unless otherwise noted.
§ 177.21
Applicability.
This subpart applies to the issuance of country-of-origin advisory rulings and final determinations relating to Government procurement under Title III, “Trade Agreements Act of 1979,” Pub. L. 96-39, 93 Stat. 144, for the purpose of granting waivers of certain “Buy American” restrictions in U.S. law or practice for products for eligible countries. This subpart is intended to be applied consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR chapter 1) and the Defense Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 2).
[T.D. 83-13, 48 FR 1189, Jan. 11, 1983, as amended by CBP Dec. 08-25, 73 FR 40727, July 16, 2008]
§ 177.22
Definitions.
(a)
Country of origin.
For the purpose of this subpart, an article is a product of a country or instrumentality only if (1) it is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of that country or instrumentality, or (2) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part of materials from another country or instrumentality, it has been substantially transformed into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was so transformed. The term “instrumentality” shall not be construed to include any agency or division of the government of a country, but may be construed to include such arrangements as the European Economic Community.
(b)
Advisory ruling.
An advisory ruling is a non-binding, non-reviewable written statement issued by the Director, Commercial and Trade Facilitation Division, Regulations and Rulings, Headquarters, U.S. Customs and Border protection, which does no more than call attention to a well established interpretation or principal of law relating to the country of origin, without applying it to a particular set of facts. CBP will issue an advisory ruling in response to a request for a final determination if:
(1) The request suggests that general information, rather than a final determination, is actually being sought,
(2) The request is incomplete or otherwise fails to meet the requirements set forth in § 177.25(a), or
(3) The ruling requested cannot be issued for any other reason, and CBP believes that the general information supplied by an advisory ruling may be of some benefit to the party making the request. An advisory ruling is not a ruling issued prior to importation under 28 U.S.C. 1581(h).
(c)
Final determination.
A final determination is a binding judicially reviewable statement issued by the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Headquarters, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in response to a written request submitted under the provisions of this subpart that interprets and applies the provisions of law and regulation relating to the country of origin to a specific set of facts. A final determination may be issued to a party-at-interest prior to actual entry of the merchandise.
(d)
Party-at-interest.
For purposes of this subpart the term party-at-interest means:
(1) A foreign manufacturer, producer, or exporter, or a United States importer of merchandise which is the subject of a final determination under this subpart,
(2) A manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler in the United States of a like product,
(3) United States members of a labor organization or other association of workers whose members are employed in the manufacture, production, or wholesale in the United States of a like product, and
(4) A trade or business association a majority of whose members manufacture, produce, or wholesale a like product in the United States.
[T.D. 83-13, 48 FR 1189, Jan. 11, 1983, as amended by T.D. 91-77, 56 FR 46115, Sept. 10, 1991]
§ 177.23
Who may request a country-of-origin advisory ruling or final determination.
A country-of-origin advisory ruling or final determination may be requested by:
(a) A foreign manufacturer, producer, or exporter, or a United States importer of merchandise,
(b) A manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler in the United States of a like product,
(c) United States members of a labor organization or other association of workers whose members are employed in the manufacture, production, or wholesale in the United States of a like product, or
(d) A trade or business association a majority of whose members manufacture, produce, or wholesale a like product in the United States.
§ 177.24
By whom request is filed.
A request may be filed by an individual or organization listed in § 177.23 or by a duly authorized attorney or agent on behalf of the individual or organization. A request filed by a corporation shall be signed by a corporate officer, and a request filed by a partnership shall be signed by a partner.
§ 177.25
Form and content of request.
(a) A request for an advisory ruling shall be in writing and shall contain such information as will enable Customs to provide the requester with the applicable principle of law or well established interpretation relating to the particular country of origin.
(b) A request for a final determination shall be in writing and shall contain the following information:
(1) The name of the requester, the requester's principal place of business, and a statement that the requester is authorized to file the request under the provisions of § 177.24;
(2) A description of the existing article for which a country-of-origin determination is requested;
(3) The country or instrumentality an article is claimed to be the product of;
(4) Such further information as will enable Customs to determine if an article is a product of a specific country or instrumentality, and;
(5) If applicable, the specific procurement for which the final determination is requested.
§ 177.26
Where request filed.
The request shall be filed with the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Headquarters, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20229.
[T.D. 83-13, 48 FR 1189, Jan. 11, 1983, as amended by T.D. 99-27, 64 FR 13677, Mar. 22, 1999]
§ 177.27
Oral discussion of issues.
Any party authorized to request a ruling under the provisions of § 177.23
may request an opportunity for oral discussion of the issues presented in the request. The oral discussion of issues will be governed by the provisions of § 177.4.
§ 177.28
Issuance of advisory rulings and final determinations.
(a) Pursuant to a request for an advisory ruling which meets the requirements of this subpart, Customs will promptly issue an advisory ruling.
(b) Pursuant to a request for a final determination which meets the requirements of this subpart, Customs will promptly issue a final determination. If the request does not meet the requirements of this subpart Customs may decline to issue a final determination or may issue instead an advisory ruling.
(c) Requests for final determinations which include the information set forth in § 177.25(b)(5) (relating to a specific procurement) will be considered by Customs before all other requests (advisory rulings and final determinations).
§ 177.29
Publication of notice of final determinations.
Notice of all final determinations shall be published in the
Federal Register
within 60 days of the date the final determination is issued.
§ 177.30
Review of final determinations.
Any party-at-interest listed in § 177.22(d) may seek judicial review of a final determination within 30 days after publication of such determination in the
Federal Register,
and may seek judicial review of a refusal to issue a final determination within 30 days after such refusal. The Court of International Trade shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review a final determination or a refusal to issue a final determination made under this subpart.
§ 177.31
Reexamination of final determinations.
A party-at-interest, other than the party-at-interest which requested and received the initial final determination, may ask Customs to consider the matter anew and issue, on an expedited basis, a new final determination. Such a request shall specifically identify the previous final determination. Upon receipt of such a request, Customs will issue a new final determination within five working days of receipt of the request unless (a) the previous final determination was the subject of a contested lawsuit timely filed in the Court of International Trade under 28 U.S.C. 1581(e) or, (b) the merchandise at issue in the initial final determination was tendered and deemed responsive to the request for proposals or an invitation for bids in a competitive procurement subject to the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a
et seq.
) and a contract under such procurement was let. Any new final determination issued under this section shall be published in accordance with § 177.29 and is reviewable under § 177.30.

An exporter or producer in the United States who completes and signs a Certificate of Origin shall maintain in the United States, for five years after the date on which the Certificate was signed, the Certificate (or copy thereof) and all other records relating to the origin of a good for which preferential tariff treatment may be claimed in Canada or Mexico, including records associated with:

If, during the course of an origin verification of a U.S. producer, the Canadian or Mexican customs administration finds that the U.S. producer has failed to maintain its records in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applied in the United States, that customs administration will so inform the U.S. producer in writing and will give the U.S. producer 60 calendar days to conform the records to those Principles. If a U.S. exporter or producer fails to maintain records or make records available to the Canadian or Mexican customs administration in accordance with the provisions of this section, or if a U.S. producer fails to conform its records to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as provided in this paragraph, the Canadian or Mexican customs administration may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good that is the subject of the verification visit.

# Subpart C—Import Requirements
§ 181.21
Filing of claim for preferential tariff treatment upon importation.
(a)
Declaration.
In connection with a claim for preferential tariff treatment, or for the exemption from the merchandise processing fee, for a good under the NAFTA, the U.S. importer must make a formal declaration that the good qualifies for such treatment. The declaration may be made by including on the entry summary, or equivalent documentation, including electronic submissions, the symbol “CA” for a good of Canada, or the symbol “MX” for a good of Mexico, as a prefix to the subheading of the HTSUS under which each qualifying good is classified. Except as otherwise provided in 19 CFR 181.22 and except in the case of a good to which Appendix 6.B to Annex 300-B of the NAFTA applies (see also 19 CFR 102.25), the declaration must be based on a complete and properly executed original Certificate of Origin, or copy thereof, which is in the possession of the importer and which covers the good being imported.
(b)
Corrected declaration.
If, after making the declaration required under paragraph (a) of this section or under § 181.32(b)(2) of this part, the U.S. importer has reason to believe that a Certificate of Origin on which a declaration was based contains information that is not correct, the importer shall within 30 calendar days after the date of discovery of the error make a corrected declaration and pay any duties that may be due. A corrected declaration shall be effected by submission of
a letter or other written statement to the CBP office where the original declaration was filed.
[T.D. 95-68, 60 FR 46364, Sept. 6, 1995, as amended by CBP Dec. 07-76, 72 FR 52782, Sept. 17, 2007]
§ 181.22
Maintenance of records and submission of Certificate by importer.
(a)
Maintenance of records.
Each importer claiming preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into the United States shall maintain in the United States, for five years after the date of entry of the good, all documentation relating to the importation of the good. Such documentation shall include a copy of the Certificate of Origin and any other relevant records as specified in § 163.1(a) of this chapter.
(b)
Submission of Certificate.
An importer who claims preferential tariff treatment on a good under § 181.21 of this part shall provide, at the request of the Center director, a copy of each Certificate of Origin pertaining to the good which is in the possession of the importer. A Certificate of Origin submitted to CBP under this paragraph or under § 181.32(b)(3) of this part:
(1) Shall be on CBP Form 434, or its electronic equivalent including privately-printed copies thereof, or on such other form as approved by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration, or, as an alternative to CBP Form 434 or such other approved form, in an approved computerized format or such other medium or format as is approved by the Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. An alternative format must contain the same information and certification set forth on CBP Form 434;
(2) Shall be signed by the exporter or by the exporter's authorized agent having knowledge of the relevant facts;
(3) Shall be completed either in the English language or in the language of the country from which the good is exported. If the Certificate is completed in a language other than English, the importer shall also provide to the Center director, upon request, a written English translation thereof;
(4) Shall be accepted by CBP for four years after the date on which the Certificate was signed by the exporter or producer; and
(5) May be applicable to:
(i) A single importation of a good into the United States, including a single shipment that results in the filing of one or more entries and a series of shipments that results in the filing of one entry; or
(ii) Multiple importations of identical goods into the United States that occur within a specified period, not exceeding 12 months, set out therein by the exporter or producer.
(c)
Acceptance of Certificate.
A Certificate of Origin shall be accepted by the Center director as valid for the purpose set forth in § 181.11(a) of this part, provided that the Certificate is completed, signed and dated in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. If the Center director determines that a Certificate is illegible or defective or has not been completed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the importer shall be given a period of not less than five working days to submit a corrected Certificate. Acceptance of a Certificate will result in the granting of preferential tariff treatment to the imported good unless, in connection with an origin verification initiated under subpart G of this part or based on a pattern of conduct within the meaning of § 181.76(c) of this part, the Center director determines that the imported good does not qualify as an originating good or should not be accorded such treatment for any other reason as specifically provided for elsewhere in this part. A Certificate shall not be accepted in connection with subsequent importations during a period referred to in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section if, based on an origin verification under subpart G of this part, the Center director determined that a previously imported identical good covered by the Certificate did not qualify as an originating good.
(d)
Certificate not required
—(1)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an importer shall not be required to have a Certificate of Origin in his possession for:
(i) An importation of a good for which the port director or Center director before January 19, 2017, or the Center director on or after January 19, 2017, has in writing waived the requirement for a Certificate of Origin because the port director or Center director is otherwise satisfied that the good qualifies for preferential tariff treatment under the NAFTA;
(ii) A non-commercial importation of a good; or
(iii) A commercial importation for which the total value of originating goods does not exceed US$2,500, provided that, unless waived by the Center director, the producer, exporter, importer or authorized agent includes on, or attaches to, the invoice or other document accompanying the shipment the following signed statement:
I hereby certify that the good covered by this shipment qualifies as an originating good for purposes of preferential tariff treatment under the NAFTA.
Check One:
( ) Producer
( ) Exporter
( ) Importer
( ) Agent
Name
Title
Address
Signature and Date
(2)
Exception.
If the Center director determines that an importation described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section forms part of a series of importations that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding a certification requirement set forth in this part, the Center director shall notify the importer in writing that for that importation the importer must have in his possession a valid Certificate of Origin to support the claim for preferential tariff treatment. The importer shall have 30 calendar days from the date of the written notice to obtain a valid Certificate, and a failure to timely obtain the Certificate will result in denial of the claim for preferential tariff treatment. For purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a “series of importations” means two or more entries covering goods arriving on the same day from the same exporter and consigned to the same person.
[T.D. 95-68, 60 FR 46364, Sept. 6, 1995, as amended by T.D. 98-56, 63 FR 32955, June 16, 1998; CBP Dec. 07-76, 72 FR 52782, Sept. 17, 2007; CBP Dec. 15-14, 80 FR 61292, Oct. 13, 2015; CBP Dec. No. 16-26, 81 FR 93026, Dec. 20, 2016]
§ 181.23
Effect of noncompliance; failure to provide documentation regarding transshipment.
(a)
Effect of noncompliance.
If the importer fails to comply with any requirement under this part, including submission of a Certificate of Origin under § 181.22(b) or submission of a corrected Certificate under § 181.22(c), the Center director may deny preferential tariff treatment to the imported good.
(b)
Failure to provide documentation regarding transshipment.
Where the requirements for preferential tariff treatment set forth elsewhere in this part are met, the Center director nevertheless may deny preferential tariff treatment to an originating good if the good is shipped through or transshipped in a country other than the United States, Canada or Mexico and the importer of the good does not provide, at the request of the Center director, copies of the customs control documents that indicate to the satisfaction of the Center director that the good remained under customs control while in such other country.

# Subpart D—Post-Importation Duty Refund Claims
§ 181.31
Right to make post-importation claim and refund duties.
Notwithstanding any other available remedy, including the right to amend an entry so long as liquidation of the entry has not become final, where a good would have qualified as an originating good when it was imported into the United States but no claim for preferential tariff treatment on that originating good was made at that time under § 181.21(a) of this part, the importer of that good may file a claim for a refund of any excess duties at any time within one year after the date of importation of the good in accordance
with the procedures set forth in § 181.32 of this part. Subject to the provisions of § 181.23 of this part, Customs may refund any excess duties by liquidation or reliquidation of the entry covering the good in accordance with § 181.33(c) of this part.
§ 181.32
Filing procedures.
(a)
Place of filing.
A post-importation claim for a refund under § 181.31 of this part shall be filed with CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically.
(b)
Contents of claim.
A post-importation claim for a refund shall be filed by presentation of the following:
(1) A written declaration stating that the good qualified as an originating good at the time of importation and setting forth the number and date of the entry covering the good;
(2) Subject to § 181.22(d) of this part, a copy of each Certificate of Origin (see § 181.11 of this part) pertaining to the good;
(3) A written statement indicating whether or not the importer of the good provided a copy of the entry summary or equivalent documentation to any other person. If such documentation was so provided, the statement shall identify each recipient by name, Customs identification number and address and shall specify the date on which the documentation was provided;
(4) A written statement indicating whether or not the importer of the good is aware of any claim for refund, waiver or reduction of duties relating to the good within the meaning of Article 303 of the NAFTA (see subpart E of this part). If the importer is aware of any such claim, the statement shall identify each claim by number and date and shall identify the person who made the claim by name, Customs identification number and address; and
(5) A written statement indicating whether or not any person has filed a protest or a petition or request for reliquidation relating to the good under any provision of law, and if any such protest or petition or request for reliquidation has been filed, the statement shall identify the protest, petition or request by number and date.
§ 181.33
Customs processing procedures.
(a)
Status determination.
After receipt of a post-importation claim under § 181.32 of this part, the Center director shall determine whether the entry covering the good has been liquidated and, if liquidation has taken place, whether the liquidation has become final.
(b)
Pending protest, petition or request for reliquidation or judicial review.
If the Center director determines that any protest or any petition or request for reliquidation relating to the good has not been finally decided, the Center director shall suspend action on the claim filed under this subpart until the decision on the protest, petition or request becomes final. If a summons involving the tariff classification or dutiability of the good is filed in the Court of International Trade, the Center director shall suspend action on the claim filed under this subpart until judicial review has been completed.
(c)
Allowance of claim
—(1)
Unliquidated entry.
If the Center director determines that a claim for a refund filed under this subpart should be allowed and the entry covering the good has not been liquidated, the Center director shall take into account the claim for refund under this subpart in connection with the liquidation of the entry.
(2)
Liquidated entry.
If the Center director determines that a claim for a refund filed under this subpart should be allowed and the entry covering the good has been liquidated, whether or not the liquidation has become final, the entry must be reliquidated in order to effect a refund of duties pursuant to this subpart. If the entry is otherwise to be reliquidated based on administrative review of a protest or petition for reliquidation or as a result of judicial review, the Center director shall reliquidate the entry taking into account the claim for refund under this subpart.
(3)
Information to be provided to Canada or Mexico.
If any information is provided to Customs pursuant to § 181.32(b) (4) or (5) of this part, that information, together with notice of the allowance of the claim and the amount of duty refunded pursuant to this subpart, shall be provided by the Center
director to the customs administration of the country from which the good was exported.
(d)
Denial of claim
—(1)
General.
The Center director may deny a claim for a refund filed under this subpart if the claim was not filed timely, if the importer has not complied with the requirements of this subpart, if the Certificate of Origin submitted under § 181.32(b)(2) of this part cannot be accepted as valid (see § 181.22(c) of this part), or if, following initiation of an origin verification under § 181.72(a) of this part, the Center director determines either that the imported good did not qualify as an originating good at the time of importation or that a basis exists upon which preferential tariff treatment may be denied under § 181.72(d), § 181.74(c) or § 181.76(c) of this part.
(2)
Unliquidated entry.
If the Center director determines that a claim for a refund filed under this subpart should be denied and the entry covering the good has not been liquidated, the Center director shall deny the claim in connection with the liquidation of the entry, and written notice of the denial and the reason therefor shall be given to the importer and, in the case of a denial on the merits, to any person who completed and signed a Certificate of Origin relating to the good. Each notice of denial given to a person who completed and signed a Certificate of Origin shall also include a statement regarding the right to file a protest against the denial under part 174 of this chapter.
(3)
Liquidated entry.
If the Center director determines that a claim for a refund filed under this subpart should be denied and the entry covering the good has been liquidated, whether or not the liquidation has become final, the claim may be denied without reliquidation of the entry. If the entry is otherwise to be reliquidated based on administrative review of a protest or petition for reliquidation or as a result of judicial review, such reliquidation may include denial of the claim filed under this subpart. In either case, the Center director shall give written notice of the denial and the reason therefor to the importer and, in the case of a denial on the merits, to any person who completed and signed a Certificate of Origin relating to the good. Each notice of denial given to a person who completed and signed a Certificate of Origin shall also include a statement regarding the right to file a protest against the denial under part 174 of this chapter.

# Subpart E—Restrictions on Drawback and Duty-Deferral Programs
§ 181.41
Applicability.
This subpart sets forth the provisions regarding drawback claims and duty-deferral programs under Article 303 of the NAFTA and applies to any good that is a “good subject to NAFTA drawback” within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. 3333. Except in the case of § 181.42(d), the provisions of this subpart apply to goods which are imported into the United States and then subsequently exported from the United States to Canada on or after January 1, 1996, or to Mexico on or after January 1, 2001. The requirements and procedures set forth in this subpart for NAFTA drawback are in addition to the general definitions, requirements and procedures for all drawback claims set forth in part 191 of this chapter, unless otherwise specifically provided in this subpart. Also, the requirements and procedures set forth in this subpart for NAFTA duty-deferral programs are in addition to the requirements and procedures for manipulation, manufacturing and smelting and refining warehouses contained in part 19 and part 144 of this chapter, for foreign trade zones under part 146 of this chapter, and for temporary importations under bond contained in part 10 of this chapter.
§ 181.42
Duties and fees not subject to drawback.
The following duties or fees which may be applicable to a good entered for consumption in the Customs territory of the United States are not subject to drawback under this subpart:
(a) Antidumping and countervailing duties;
(b) A premium offered or collected on a good with respect to quantitative import restrictions, tariff rate quotas or tariff preference levels;
(c) Fees applied under section 22 of the U.S. Agricultural Adjustment Act; and
(d) Customs duties paid or owed under unused merchandise substitution drawback. There shall be no payment of such drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2) on goods exported to Canada or Mexico on or after January 1, 1994.
§ 181.43
Eligible goods subject to drawback.
Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, drawback is authorized for an imported good that is entered for consumption and is:
(a) Subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico (see 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1));
(b) Used as a material in the production of another good that is subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico (see 19 U.S.C. 1313(a)); or
(c) Substituted by a good of the same kind and quality as defined in § 181.44(c) of this subpart and used as a material in the production of another good that is subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico (see 19 U.S.C. 1313(b)).
§ 181.44
Calculation of drawback.
(a)
General.
Except in the case of goods specified in § 181.45 of this part, drawback of the duties previously paid upon importation of a good into the United States may be granted by the United States, upon presentation of a NAFTA drawback claim under this subpart, on the lower amount of:
(1) The total duties paid or owed on the good in the United States; or
(2) The total amount of duties paid on the exported good upon subsequent importation into Canada or Mexico.
(b)
Individual relative value and duty comparison principle.
For purposes of this section, relative value shall be determined, and the comparison between the duties referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the duties referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be made, separately with reference to each individual exported good, including where two components or materials are used to produce one exported good or one component or material is divided among multiple exported goods.

# Example.
Upon importation of Chemical X into the United States, Company A entered Chemical X and paid $2.00 in duties. Company A processed Chemical X into Products Y and Z, each having the same relative value; that is, $1.00 in duty is attributable to Product Y and $1.00 in duty is attributable to Product Z. Company A exported Product Y to Canada and Canada assessed a free rate of duty. Company A exported Product Z to Mexico and Mexico assessed the equivalent of US$2.00 in duty. There is no entitlement to drawback on the export of Product Y to Canada because zero is the lesser amount when compared to the $1.00 in duty attributable to Product Y as a result of the separation of Chemical X into Products Y and Z. There would be entitlement to drawback on the export to Mexico, consisting of the $1.00 duty attributable to Product Z, because that amount is the lesser amount when comparing the duty paid to the United States and the US$ equivalent duty paid to Mexico.
(c)
Direct identification manufacturing drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a).
Upon presentation of the NAFTA drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a), in which the amount of drawback payable is based on the lesser amount of the customs duties paid on the good either to the United States or to Canada or Mexico, the amount of drawback refunded shall not exceed 99 percent of the duty paid on such imported merchandise into the United States.

# Example 1.
Upon the importation of Product X to the United States from Japan, Company A paid $2.00 in duties. Company A manufactured the imported Product X into Product Y, and subsequently exported it to Mexico. Mexico assessed the equivalent of US$11.00 in duties upon importation of Product Y. Upon presenting a drawback claim in the United States, in accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1313(a), Company A would be entitled to a refund of 99 percent of the $2.00, or $1.98. The $2.00 paid by Company A (less 1 percent) on the importation of Product X into the United States is a lesser amount of duties than the total amount of customs duties paid to Mexico (the equivalent of US$11.00) on Product Y.

# Example 2.
Upon the importation of Product X into the United States from Hong Kong, Company A entered Product X and paid $5.00 in duties. Company A manufactured Product X into Product Y, sold it to Company B in Mexico and subsequently exported it to Mexico. Company A reserved its right to drawback. Upon Product Y's importation, Company B was assessed a free rate
of duty. Company A's claim for drawback will be denied because Company A is entitled to zero drawback for the reason that, as between the duty paid in the United States and the duty paid in Mexico, the duty in Mexico was zero.
(d)
Substitution manufacturing drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b).
Upon presentation of a NAFTA drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b), on which the amount of drawback payable is based on the lesser amount of the customs duties paid on the good either to the United States or to Canada or Mexico, the amount of drawback is the same as that which would have been allowed had the substituted merchandise used in manufacture been itself imported. For purposes of drawback under this subpart, the term “same kind and quality” used in § 1313(b) (see § 191.2(x)(1) of this chapter) shall have the same meaning as the term “identical or similar good” used in Article 303 of the NAFTA except that there shall be no requirement that the good be manufactured in the same country.

# Example 1.
Upon importation of Product X from Japan to the United States, Company A paid $5.00 in duties. Company A substituted a same kind and quality domestic Product X for the Japanese Product X in its production of Product Y under its 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) drawback contract. Company A sold Product Y to Company B which subsequently exported it to Canada. On the importation of Product Y by Company B, Company B paid the equivalent of US$2.00 in duties assessed by Revenue Canada and waived its right to drawback to Company A. Company A is entitled to obtain drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) in the United States in the amount of $1.98 (or 99 percent of the US$2.00 equivalent Company B paid in duty to Canada) since that $2.00 was the lesser of the total amount of customs duties paid on the product to either Canada or the United States.

# Example 2.
Same facts as above example, but Company B paid the equivalent of US$5.00 to Revenue Canada. Company A is entitled to obtain $4.95 in drawback (a refund of 99 percent of $5.00 paid to the United States). Since the same amount of duty was assessed by each country, drawback is allowable because the drawback paid does not exceed the lesser amount paid.
(e)
Meats cured with imported salt.
Meats, whether packed or smoked, which have been cured with imported salt may be eligible for drawback in aggregate amounts of not less than $100 in duties paid on the imported salt upon exportation of the meats to Canada or Mexico (see 19 U.S.C. 1313(f)).

# Example.
Company Z produced Virginia smoked ham on its Smithfield, Virginia farm, using 4,000 pounds of imported salt in curing the meat. The salt was imported from an HTSUS Column 2 country, with a duty of $200. Upon exportation of the hams to Mexico, Company Z pays the equivalent of US$250.00 in duties to Mexico. Company Z is entitled to drawback of the full 100 percent of the $200.00 in duties it paid on the importation of the salt into the United States because that $200.00 is a lesser amount than the total amount of customs duties paid to Mexico on the exported meat.
(f)
Jet aircraft engines.
A foreign-built jet aircraft engine that has been overhauled, repaired, rebuilt, or reconditioned in the United States with the use of imported merchandise, including parts, may be eligible for drawback of duties paid on the imported merchandise in aggregate amounts of not less than $100 upon exportation of the engine to Canada or Mexico (19 U.S.C. 1313(h)).

# Example.
A Swedish-made jet aircraft engine is repaired in the United States using imported parts from Korea on which $160.00 in duties have been paid by Company W. The engine is subsequently exported to Canada by Company W and Company W pays the equivalent of US$260.00 in duties to Canada. Upon showing the country in which the engine was manufactured and a description of the processing performed thereon in the United States on Customs Form 7551, appropriately modified, Company W is entitled to the full refund of the duties paid to the United States since that $160.00 was a lesser amount than the duties paid on the engine to Canada.
(g)
Unused goods under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) that have changed in condition.
An imported good that is unused in the United States under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) and that is shipped to Canada or Mexico not in the same condition within the meaning of § 181.45(b)(1) may be eligible for drawback under this section, except when the shipment to Canada or Mexico does not constitute an exportation under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(4).

# Example.
Upon importation of Product X from Spain to the United States, the U.S. importer pays $10.00 in duties. While in the original package in the importer's warehouse, Product X becomes damaged. A Canadian purchaser buys Product X and imports it into Canada and pays the equivalent of
US$5.00 in duties assessed by Revenue Canada. The Canadian purchaser who exported Product X from the United States to Canada and who otherwise qualifies for drawback is entitled to drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) in the amount of $4.95 (99 percent of the US$5.00 equivalent in duties paid to Canada). Eligibility for full drawback of the $10.00 in U.S. duties under § 181.45(b) would be precluded because Product X, although unused, was not exported to Canada in the same condition as when imported into the United States within the meaning of § 181.45(b)(1).
[T.D. 95-68, 60 FR 46364, Sept. 6, 1995, as amended by T.D. 98-16, 63 FR 11005, Mar. 5, 1998]
§ 181.45
Goods eligible for full drawback.
(a)
Goods originating in Canada or Mexico.
A Canadian or Mexican originating good that is dutiable and is imported into the United States is eligible for drawback without regard to the limitation on drawback set forth in § 181.44 of this part if that originating good is:
(1) Subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico;
(2) Used as a material in the production of another good that is subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico; or
(3) Substituted by a good of the same kind and quality and used as a material in the production of another good that is subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico.

# Example.
Company A imports a dutiable (3 percent rate) Canadian originating good. During Company A's manufacturing process, Company A substitutes a German good of the same kind and quality (on which duty was paid at a 2.5 percent rate) in the production of another good that is subsequently exported to Canada. Company A may designate the dutiable Canadian entry and claim full drawback (99 percent) on the 3 percent duty paid under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b). (Note: NAFTA originating goods will continue to receive full drawback as they cross NAFTA borders for successive stages of production until NAFTA tariffs are fully phased out.)
(b)
Claims under 19 U.S.C 1313(j)(1) for goods in same condition.
A good imported into the United States and subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico in the same condition is eligible for drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) without regard to the limitation on drawback set forth in § 181.44 of this part.

# Example.
X imports a desk into the United States from England and pays $25.00 in duty. X immediately exports the desk to Z in Mexico and Z pays the equivalent of US$10.00 in Mexican duties. X can obtain a refund of 99 percent of the $25.00 paid upon importation of the desk into the United States.
(1)
Same condition defined.
For purposes of this subpart, a reference to a good in the “same condition” includes a good that has been subjected to any of the following operations provided that no such operation materially alters the characteristics of the good:
(i) Mere dilution with water or another substance;
(ii) Cleaning, including removal of rust, grease, paint or other coatings;
(iii) Application of preservative, including lubricants, protective encapsulation, or preservation paint;
(iv) Trimming, filing, slitting or cutting;
(v) Putting up in measured doses, or packing, repacking, packaging or repackaging; or
(vi) Testing, marking, labelling, sorting or grading.
(2)
Commingling of fungible goods
—(i)
General
—(A)
Inventory of other than all non-originating goods.
Commingling of fungible originating and non-originating goods in inventory is permissable provided that the origin of the goods and the identification of entries for designation for same condition drawback are on the basis of an approved inventory method set forth in the appendix to this part.
(B)
Inventory of the non-originating goods.
If all goods in a particular inventory are non-originating goods, identification of entries for designation for same condition drawback shall be on the basis of one of the accounting methods in § 190.14 or § 191.14 of this chapter, as appropriate.
(ii)
Exception.
Agricultural goods imported from Mexico may not be commingled with fungible agricultural goods in the United States for purposes of same condition drawback under this subpart.
(c)
Goods not conforming to sample or specifications or shipped without consent of consignee under 19 U.S.C. 1313(c).
An imported good exported to Canada or
Mexico by reason of failure of the good to conform to sample or specification or by reason of shipment of the good without the consent of the consignee is eligible for drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(c) without regard to the limitation on drawback set forth in § 181.44 of this part. Such a good must be exported or destroyed within the statutory 5-year time period and in compliance with the requirements set forth in subpart D of part 190 of this chapter or within the 3-year time period and in compliance with the requirements set forth in subpart D of part 191 of this chapter, as applicable.

# Example.

Assessment and waiver or reduction of duty
—(1)
Manipulation in warehouse.
Where a good subject to NAFTA drawback under this subpart is withdrawn from a bonded warehouse (19 U.S.C. 1562) after manipulation for exportation to Canada or Mexico or for entry into a duty-deferral program in Canada or Mexico, duty shall be assessed on the good in its condition and quantity, and at its weight, at the time of such withdrawal from the warehouse and with such additions to, or deductions from, the final appraised value as may be necessary by reason of its change in
condition. Such duty shall be paid no later than 60 calendar days after the date of exportation or of entry into the duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico, except that, upon filing of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the duty shall be waived or reduced in an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the total amount of duty payable on the good under this section or the total amount of customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico.
(2)
Bonded manufacturing warehouse.
Where a good is manufactured in a bonded warehouse (19 U.S.C. 1311) with imported materials and is then withdrawn for exportation to Canada or Mexico or for entry into a duty-deferral program in Canada or Mexico, duty shall be assessed on the materials in their condition and quantity, and at their weight, at the time of their importation into the United States. Such duty shall be paid no later than 60 calendar days after either the date of exportation or of entry into a duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico, except that, upon filing of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the duty shall be waived or reduced in an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the total amount of duty payable on the materials under this section or the total amount of customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico.

Company N imports tea into the United States and makes a Class 6 warehouse entry. Company N manufactures sweetened ice tea mix by combining the imported tea with refined cane sugar and other flavorings and packaging it in retail size canisters. Upon withdrawal of the ice tea mix from the warehouse for exportation to Canada, a Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, is filed showing $900 in estimated U.S. duties on the basis of the unmanufactured tea. Upon entry into Canada, the equivalent of US$800 is assessed on the exported ice tea mix. Company N submits to Customs a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section showing payment of the US$800 equivalent in duties to Canada. Company N will only be required to pay $100 in U.S. duties out of the $900 amount reflected on the Customs Form 7501.
(3)
Bonded smelting or refining warehouse.
For any qualifying imported metal-bearing materials (19 U.S.C. 1312), duty shall be assessed on the imported materials and the charges against the bond canceled no later than 60 calendar days after either the date of exportation of the treated materials to Canada or Mexico or the date of entry of the treated materials into a duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico, either from the bonded smelting or refining warehouse or from such other customs bonded warehouse after the transfer of the same quantity of material from a bonded smelting or refining warehouse. However, upon filing of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the duty on the imported materials shall be waived or reduced in an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the total amount of duty payable on the imported materials under this section or the total amount of customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico.

# Example.
Company Z imports 47 million pounds of electrolytic zinc which is entered into a bonded smelting and refining warehouse (Class 7) for processing. Thereafter, Company Z withdraws the merchandise for exportation to Canada and files a Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, showing $90,000 in estimated U.S. duty on the dutiable quantity of metal contained in the imported metal-bearing materials. Upon entry of the processed zinc into Canada, the equivalent of US$50,000 in duties are assessed.

For a good that is manufactured or otherwise changed in condition in a foreign trade zone (19 U.S.C. 81c(a)) and then withdrawn from the zone for exportation to Canada or Mexico or for entry into a Canadian or Mexican duty-deferral program, the duty assessed, as calculated under paragraph (b)(4)(i) or (b)(4)(ii) of this section, shall be paid no later than 60 calendar days after either the date of exportation of the good to Canada or Mexico or the date of entry of the good into a duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico, except that, upon filing of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the duty shall be waived or reduced in an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the total amount of duty payable on the good under this section or the total amount of customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico.
(i)
Nonprivileged foreign status.
In the case of a nonprivileged foreign status good, duty is assessed on the good in its condition and quantity, and at its weight, at the time of its exportation from the zone to Canada or Mexico or its entry into a duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico.

# Example.
CMG imports $1,000,000 worth of auto parts from Korea and admits them into Foreign-Trade Subzone number 00, claiming nonprivileged foreign status. (If the auto parts had been regularly entered they would have been dutiable at 4 percent, or $40,000.) CMG manufactures subcompact automobiles. Automobiles are dutiable at 2.5 percent ($25,000) if entered for consumption in the United States. CMG withdraws the automobiles from the zone and exports them to Mexico. Upon entry of the automobiles in Mexico, CMG pays the equivalent of US$20,000 in duty. Before the expiration of 60 calendar days from the date of exportation, CMG files a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section and pays $5,000 in duty to Customs representing the difference between the $25,000 which would have been paid if the automobiles had been entered for consumption from the zone and the US$20,000 equivalent paid to Mexico.
(ii)
Privileged foreign status.
In the case of a privileged foreign status good, duty is assessed on the good in its condition and quantity, and at its weight, at the time privileged status is granted in the zone.

# Example.
O
G, Inc. admits Kuwaiti crude petroleum into its zone and requests, one month later, privileged foreign status on the crude before refining the crude into motor gasoline and kerosene. Upon withdrawal of the refined goods from the zone by O
G, Inc. for exportation to Canada, a Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, is filed showing $700 in estimated duties on the imported crude petroleum (rather than on the refined goods which would have been assessed $1,200). D
O is the consignee in Canada and pays the Canadian customs duty assessment of the equivalent of US$1,500 on the goods. O
G, Inc. is entitled to a waiver of the full $700 in duties upon filing of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(5)
Temporary importation under bond.
Except in the case of a good imported from Canada or Mexico for repair or alteration, where a good, regardless of its origin, was imported temporarily free of duty for repair, alteration or processing (subheading 9813.00.05, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States) and is subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico, duty shall be assessed on the good on the basis of its condition at the time of its importation into the United States. Such duty shall be paid no later than 60 calendar days after either the date of exportation or the date of entry into a duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico, except that, upon filing of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the duty shall be waived or reduced in an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the total amount of duty payable on the good under this section or the total amount of customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico.

# Example.
Company A imports glassware under subheading 9813.00.05, HTSUS. The glassware is from France and would be dutiable under a regular consumption entry at $6,000. Company A alters the glassware by etching hotel logos on the glassware. Two weeks later, Company A sells the glassware to Company B, a Mexican company, and ships the glassware to Mexico. Company B enters the glassware and is assessed duties in an amount equivalent to US$6,200 and claims NAFTA preferential tariff treatment. Company B provides a copy of the Mexican landing certificate to Company A showing that the US$6,200 equivalent in duties was assessed but not yet paid to Mexico. If Mexico ultimately denies Company B's NAFTA claim and the Mexican duty payment becomes final, Company A, upon submission to Customs of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, is entitled to a waiver of the full $6,000 in U.S. duty.
(c)
Recordkeeping requirements.
If a person intends to claim a waiver or reduction of duty on goods under this section, that person shall maintain records concerning the value of all involved goods or materials at the time of their importation into the United States and concerning the value of the goods at the time of their exportation to Canada or Mexico or entry into a duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico, and if a person files a claim under this section for a waiver or reduction of duty on goods exported to Canada or Mexico or entered into a Canadian or Mexican duty-deferral program, that person shall maintain evidence of exportation or entry into a Canadian or Mexican duty-deferral program and satisfactory evidence of the amount of any customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico on the good (see
§ 181.47(c)). Failure to maintain adequate records will result in denial of the claim for waiver or reduction of duty.
(d)
Failure to file proper claim.
If the person identified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section fails to file a proper claim within the 60-day period specified in this section, that person, or the FTZ operator pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A)(
3
) of this section, will be liable for payment of the full duties assessed under this section and without any waiver or reduction thereof.
(e)
Subsequent claims for preferential tariff treatment.
If a claim for a refund of duties is allowed by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration under Article 502(3) of the NAFTA or under any other circumstance after duties have been waived or reduced under this section, Customs may reliquidate the entry filed under this section pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508(b)(2)(B)(iii) even after liquidation of the entry has become final.
[T.D. 96-14, 61 FR 2911, Jan. 30, 1996; 61 FR 6111, Feb. 16, 1996, as amended by CBP Dec. 15-14, 80 FR 61292, Oct. 13, 2015]
§ 181.54
Verification of claim for drawback, waiver or reduction of duties.
The allowance of a claim for drawback, waiver or reduction of duties submitted under this subpart shall be subject to such verification, including verification with the Canadian or Mexican customs administration of any documentation obtained in Canada or Mexico and submitted in connection with the claim, as Customs may deem necessary.

# Subpart F—Commercial Samples and Goods Returned After Repair or Alteration
§ 181.61
Applicability.
This subpart sets forth the rules which apply for purposes of duty-free entry of commercial samples of negligible value as provided for in Article 306 of the NAFTA and for purposes of the re-entry of goods after repair or alteration in Canada or Mexico as provided for in Article 307 of the NAFTA.
§ 181.62
Commercial samples of negligible value.
(a)
General.
Commercial samples of negligible value imported from Canada or Mexico may qualify for duty-free entry under subheading 9811.00.60, HTSUS. For purposes of this section, “commercial samples of negligible value” means commercial samples which have a value, individually or in the aggregate as shipped, of not more than US$1, or the equivalent amount in the currency of Canada or Mexico, or which are so marked, torn, perforated, or otherwise treated that they are unsuitable for sale or for use except as commercial samples.
(b)
Qualification for duty-free entry.
Commercial samples of negligible value imported from Canada or Mexico will qualify for duty-free entry under subheading 9811.00.60, HTSUS, only if:
(1) The samples are imported solely for the purpose of soliciting orders for foreign goods; and
(2) If valued over US$1, the samples are properly marked, torn, perforated or otherwise treated prior to arrival in the United States so that they are unsuitable for sale or for use except as commercial samples.
§ 181.63
[Reserved]
§ 181.64
Goods re-entered after repair or alteration in Canada or Mexico.
(a)
General.
This section sets forth the rules which apply for purposes of obtaining duty-free or reduced-duty treatment on goods returned after repair or alteration in Canada or Mexico as provided for in subheadings 9802.00.40 and 9802.00.50, HTSUS. Goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Mexico, whether or not pursuant to a warranty, and goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Canada pursuant to a warranty, are eligible for duty-free treatment, provided that the requirements of this section are met. Goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Canada other than pursuant to a warranty are subject to duty upon the value of the repairs or alterations using the applicable duty rate under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (see § 10.301 of this chapter), provided that the requirements of this section
are met. For purposes of this section, “repairs or alterations” means restoration, addition, renovation, redyeing, cleaning, resterilizing, or other treatment which does not destroy the essential characteristics of, or create a new or commercially different good from, the good exported from the United States.

# Example.
Glass mugs produced in the United States are exported to Canada for etching and tempering operations, after which they are returned to the United States for sale. The foreign operations exceed the scope of an alteration because they are manufacturing processes which create commercially different products with distinct new characteristics.
(b)
Goods not eligible for duty-free or reduced-duty treatment after repair or alteration.
The duty-free or reduced-duty treatment referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to goods which, in their condition as exported from the United States to Canada or Mexico, are incomplete for their intended use and for which the processing operation performed in Canada or Mexico constitutes an operation that is performed as a matter of course in the preparation or manufacture of finished goods.

# Example.
Unflanged metal wheel rims are exported to Canada for a flanging operation to strengthen them so as to conform to U.S. Army specifications for wheel rims; although the goods when exported from the United States are dedicated for use in the making of wheel rims, they cannot be used for that purpose until flanged. The flanging operation does not constitute a repair or alteration because that operation is necessary for the completion of the wheel rims.
(c)
Documentation
—(1)
Declarations required.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the following declarations shall be filed in connection with the entry of goods which are returned from Canada or Mexico after having been exported for repairs or alterations and which are claimed to be duty free or subject to duty only on the value of the repairs or alterations performed abroad:

Additional documentation.
The Center director may require such additional documentation as is deemed necessary to prove actual exportation of the goods from the United States for repairs or alterations, such as a foreign customs entry, a foreign customs invoice, a foreign landing certificate, bill of lading, or airway bill.
(3)
Waiver of declarations.
If the Center director concerned is satisfied, because of the nature of the goods or production of other evidence, that the goods are imported under circumstances meeting the requirements of this section, he may waive submission of the declarations provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(4)
Deposit of estimated duties to CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically.
For goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Canada other than pursuant to a warranty, the Center director shall require a deposit of estimated duties based upon the full cost or value of the repairs or alterations. The cost or value of the repairs or alterations performed in Canada other than pursuant to a warranty, which is to be set forth in the invoice and entry papers as the basis for the assessment of duty for such goods, shall be limited to the cost or value of the repairs or alterations actually performed in Canada, which shall include all domestic and foreign articles furnished for the repairs or alterations but shall not include any of the expenses incurred in the United States whether by way of engineering costs, preparation of plans or specifications, furnishing of tools or equipment for doing the repairs or alterations in Canada, or otherwise.

# Subpart G—Origin Verifications and Determinations
§ 181.71
Denial of preferential tariff treatment dependent on origin verification and determination.
Except where a Certificate of Origin either is not submitted when requested under § 181.22(b) of this part or is not acceptable and a corrected Certificate is not submitted or accepted as provided in § 181.22(c) of this part and except as otherwise provided in § 181.23 of this part and except in the case of a pattern of conduct provided for in § 181.76(c) of this part, Customs shall deny preferential tariff treatment on an imported good, or shall deny a post-importation claim for a refund filed under subpart D of this part, only after initiation of an origin verification under § 181.72(a) of this part which results in a determination that the imported good does not qualify as an originating good or should not be accorded such treatment for any other reason as specifically provided for elsewhere in this part.
§ 181.72
Verification scope and method.
(a)
General.
Subject to paragraph (e) of this section, Customs may initiate a verification in order to determine whether a good imported into the United States qualifies as an originating good for purposes of preferential tariff treatment under the NAFTA as stated on the Certificate of Origin pertaining to the good. Such a verification:
(1) May also involve a verification of the origin of a material that is used in the production of a good that is the subject of a verification under this section;
(2) May include verification of the applicable rate of duty applied to an originating good in accordance with Annex 302.2 of the NAFTA and may include a determination of whether a good is a qualifying good for purposes of Annex 703.2 of the NAFTA; and
(3) Shall be conducted only by means of one or more of the following:
(i) A verification letter which requests information from a Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer, including a Canadian or Mexican producer of
a material, and which identifies the good or material that is the subject of the verification. The verification letter may be on Customs Form 28, or its electronic equivalent, or other appropriate format and may be sent:
(A) By certified or registered mail, or by any other method that produces a confirmation of receipt by the exporter or producer; or
(B) By any other method, regardless of whether it produces proof of receipt by the exporter or producer;
(ii) A written questionnaire sent to an exporter or a producer, including a producer of a material, in Canada or Mexico. The questionnaire:
(A) May be sent by certified or registered mail, or by any other method that produces a confirmation of receipt by the exporter or producer; or
(B) May be sent by any other method, regardless of whether it produces proof of receipt by the exporter or producer; and
(C) May be completed by the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer either in the English language or in the language of the country in which that exporter or producer is located;
(iii) Visits to the premises of an exporter or a producer, including a producer of a material, in Canada or Mexico to review the types of records referred to in § 181.12 of this part and observe the facilities used in the production of the good or material; and
(iv) Any other method which results in information from a Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer, including a Canadian or Mexican producer of a material, that is relevant to the origin determination. The information so obtained may form a basis for a negative determination regarding a good (see § 181.75(b) of this part) only if the information is in writing and is signed by the exporter or producer.
(b)
Applicable accounting principles.
When conducting a verification of origin to which Generally Accepted Accounting Principles may be relevant, Customs will apply and accept the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applicable in the country in which the good is produced or in which the exporter is located.
(c)
Inquiries to importer not precluded.
Nothing in paragraph (a) of this section shall preclude Customs from directing inquiries or requests to a U.S. importer for documents or other information regarding the imported good. If such an inquiry or request involves requesting the importer to obtain and provide written information from the exporter or producer of the good or from the producer of a material that is used in the production of the good, such information shall be requested by the importer and provided to the importer by the exporter or producer only on a voluntary basis, and a failure or refusal on the part of the importer to obtain and provide such information shall not be considered a failure of the exporter or producer to provide the information and shall not constitute a ground for denying preferential tariff treatment on the good.
(d)
Failure to respond to letter or questionnaire
—(1)
Nonresponse to initial letter or questionnaire.
If the exporter or producer, including a producer of a material, fails to respond to a verification letter or questionnaire sent under paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section within 30 calendar days from the date on which the letter or questionnaire was sent, or such longer period as may be specified in the letter or questionnaire, Customs shall send a follow-up verification letter or questionnaire to that exporter or producer. The follow-up letter or questionnaire:
(i) Except where the verification letter or questionnaire only involved the origin of a material used in the production of a good and was sent to the producer of the material, may include the written determination referred to in § 181.75 of this part, provided that the information specified in paragraph (b) of that section is also included; and
(ii) Shall be sent:
(A) By certified or registered mail, or by any other method that produces a confirmation of receipt by the exporter or producer, if so requested by the customs administration of Canada or Mexico from which the good was exported; or
(B) By any method, if no request under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section has been made by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration.
(2)
Nonresponse to follow-up letter or questionnaire
—(i)
Producer of a material.
If a producer of a material fails to respond to a follow-up verification letter or questionnaire sent under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, Customs may consider the material to be non-originating for purposes of determining whether the good to which that material relates is an originating good.
(ii)
Exporter or producer of a good.
If the exporter or producer of a good fails to respond to a follow-up verification letter or questionnaire sent under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, Customs may consider the good to be non-originating and consequently may deny preferential tariff treatment on the good as follows:
(A) If the follow-up letter or questionnaire included a written determination as provided for in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section and the exporter or producer fails to respond to the follow-up letter or questionnaire within 30 calendar days or such longer period as specified therein:
(
1
) From the date on which the follow-up letter or questionnaire and written determination were received by the exporter or producer, if sent pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section; or
(
2
) From the date on which the follow-up letter or questionnaire and written determination were either received by the exporter or producer or sent by Customs, if sent in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section; or
(B) Provided that the procedures set forth in §§ 181.75 and 181.76 of this part are followed, if the follow-up letter or questionnaire does not include a written determination as provided for in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section and the exporter or producer fails to respond to the follow-up letter or questionnaire within 30 calendar days or such longer period as specified in the letter or questionnaire:
(
1
) From the date on which the follow-up letter or questionnaire was received by the exporter or producer, if sent pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section; or
(
2
) From the date on which the follow-up letter or questionnaire was either received by the exporter or producer or sent by Customs, if sent in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.
(e)
Calculation of regional value content under net cost method
—(1)
General.
Where a Canadian or Mexican producer of a good elects to calculate the regional value content of a good under the net cost method as set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in the appendix to this part, Customs may not, during the time period over which that net cost is calculated, conduct a verification under § 181.72(a) of this part with respect to the regional value content of that good.
(2)
Cost submission for motor vehicles.
Where, pursuant to General Note 12, HTSUS, and the appendix to this part, a Canadian or Mexican producer of a light duty vehicle or heavy duty vehicle, as defined in the appendix to this part, elects to average its regional value content calculation over its fiscal year, Customs may request, in writing, that the producer provide a cost submission reflecting the actual costs incurred in the production of the category of motor vehicles for which the election was made. Such a written request shall constitute a verification letter under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, and the requested cost submission shall be submitted to Customs within 180 calendar days after the close of the producer's fiscal year or within 60 days from the date on which the request was made, whichever is later.
[T.D. 95-68, 60 FR 46364, Sept. 6, 1995, as amended by T.D. 02-15, 67 FR 15482, Apr. 2, 2002; CBP Dec. 15-14, 80 FR 61292, Oct. 13, 2015]
§ 181.73
Notification of verification visit.
(a)
Written notification required.
Prior to conducting a verification visit in Canada or Mexico pursuant to § 181.72(a)(2)(iii) of this part, Customs shall give written notification of the intention to conduct the visit. Such notification shall be delivered:
(1) By certified or registered mail, or by any other method that produces a confirmation of receipt, to the address of the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited;
(2) To the customs administration of the country in which the visit is to occur; and
(3) If requested by the country in which the visit is to occur, to the embassy of that country located in the United States.
(b)
Contents of notification.
The notification referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall include:
(1) The identity of the Customs office and officer issuing the notification;
(2) The name of the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of the good, or producer of the material, whose premises are to be visited;
(3) The date and place of the proposed verification visit;
(4) The object and scope of the proposed verification visit, including specific reference to the good or material that is the subject of the verification;
(5) The names and titles of the Customs officers performing the proposed verification visit;
(6) The legal authority for the proposed verification visit; and
(7) A request that the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of the good, or producer of the material, provide its written consent for the proposed verification visit.
§ 181.74
Verification visit procedures.
(a)
Written consent required.
Prior to conducting a verification visit in Canada or Mexico pursuant to § 181.72(a)(3)(iii) of this part, CBP shall obtain the written consent of the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of the good or producer of the material whose premises are to be visited.
(b)
Written consent procedures.
The written consent provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be delivered by certified or registered mail, or by any other method that generates a reliable receipt, to the CBP officer who gave the notification provided for in § 181.73 of this part.
(c)
Failure to provide written consent or to cooperate or to maintain records.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, where a Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of a good, or a Canadian or Mexican producer of a material, has not given its written consent to a proposed verification visit within 30 calendar days of receipt of notification pursuant to § 181.73 of this part, CBP may deny preferential tariff treatment to that good, or for purposes of determining whether a good is an originating good may consider as non-originating that material, that would have been the subject of the visit, provided that, as regards the good, notice of intent to deny such treatment is given to that exporter or producer of the good and to the U.S. importer thereof prior to taking such action. A failure on the part of the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of a good, or on the part of the Canadian or Mexican producer of a material, to maintain records or provide access to such records or otherwise cooperate during the verification visit shall mean that the verification visit never took place and may be treated by CBP in the same manner as a failure to give written consent to a verification visit. However, in the case of a Canadian or Mexican producer of a good who is found during a verification visit to have not maintained records in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applied in the producer's country, CBP may deny preferential tariff treatment on the good based solely on a failure to so maintain those records only if the producer does not conform the records to those Principles within 60 calendar days after CBP informs the producer in writing of that failure.
(d)
Postponement of visit in Canada or Mexico.
Following receipt of the notification provided for in § 181.73 of this part, the Canadian or Mexican customs administration may, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification, postpone the proposed verification visit for a period not exceeding 60 calendar days from the date of such receipt by providing written notice of the postponement to the CBP officer who issued the notification of the verification visit, unless a longer period is requested and agreed to by CBP. Such a postponement shall not constitute a failure to provide written consent within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section and shall not otherwise by itself constitute a valid basis upon which CBP may:
(1) Consider a material that is used in the production of a good to be a non-originating material; or
(2) Deny preferential tariff treatment to a good.
(e)
Verification visits within the United States
—(1)
Notification and consent procedure.
When the Canadian or Mexican customs administration intends to conduct a verification visit in the United States, notification of such intent will be given, and consent will be required, as provided for under Article 506 of the NAFTA. For purposes of the required notification to CBP, such notification shall be sent to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Office of International Trade, Commercial Targeting and Enforcement, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20229.
(2)
Postponement of visit.
Following receipt of notification from the Canadian or Mexican customs administration of its intention to conduct a verification visit in the United States, CBP may, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification, postpone the proposed verification visit for a period not exceeding 60 calendar days from the date of such receipt by providing written notice of the postponement to the Canadian or Mexican customs administration.
(3)
Designation of observers.
A U.S. exporter or producer, including a producer of a material, whose good or material is the subject of a verification visit by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration shall be allowed to designate two observers to be present during the visit, subject to the following conditions:
(i) The U.S. exporter or producer shall not be required to designate observers;
(ii) There shall be no restriction on the class of persons that may be designated as observers by the U.S. exporter or producer;
(iii) The observers to be present are designated in the written consent to the proposed visit or subsequent thereto;
(iv) The observers do not participate in the verification visit in a manner other than as passive observers;
(v) The presence of observers shall in no way affect the right to have legal counsel or other advisors present during the visit;
(vi) There shall be no obligation on the part of the United States government or on the part of the Canadian or Mexican government to designate observers from its staff, even when the U.S. exporter or producer fails to, or specifically declines to, designate observers; and
(vii) The failure of the U.S. exporter or producer to designate observers shall not result in the postponement of the visit.
[T.D. 95-68, 60 FR 46364, Sept. 6, 1995, as amended by CBP Dec. 07-76, 72 FR 52783, Sept. 17, 2007]
§ 181.75
Issuance of origin determination.
(a)
General.
Except in the case of a pattern of conduct within the meaning of § 181.76(c) of this part, following receipt and analysis of the results of an origin verification initiated under § 181.72(a) of this part in regard to a good imported into the United States and prior to denying preferential tariff treatment on the import transaction which gave rise to the origin verification, Customs shall provide the exporter or producer whose good is the subject of the verification with a written determination of whether the good qualifies as an originating good. Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, the written origin determination shall be sent within 60 calendar days after conclusion of the origin verification process, unless circumstances require additional time, and shall set forth:
(1) A description of the good that was the subject of the verification together with the identifying numbers and dates of the export and import documents pertaining to the good;
(2) Subject to the provisions of § 181.131 of this part and except in the case of a negative origin determination where specific findings of fact cannot be made because of a failure to respond to a follow-up verification letter or questionnaire sent under § 181.72 of this part, a statement setting forth the findings of fact made in connection with the verification and upon which the determination is based; and
(3) With specific reference to the rules applicable to originating goods as
set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in the appendix to this part, the legal basis for the determination.
(b)
Negative origin determinations.
If Customs determines, as a result of an origin verification initiated under § 181.72(a) of this part, that the good which is the subject of the verification does not qualify as an originating good, the written determination required under paragraph (a) of this section:
(1) Shall be sent by certified or registered mail, or by any other method that produces a confirmation of receipt by the exporter or producer, if so requested by the customs administration of Canada or Mexico from which the good was exported; and
(2) Shall, in addition to the information specified in paragraph (a) of this section, set forth the following:
(i) A notice of intent to deny preferential tariff treatment on the good which is the subject of the determination;
(ii) The specific date after which preferential tariff treatment will be denied, as established in accordance with § 181.76(a)(1) of this part;
(iii) The period, established in accordance with § 181.76(a)(1) of this part, during which the exporter or producer of the good may provide written comments or additional information regarding the determination; and
(iv) A statement advising the exporter or producer of the right to file a protest under 19 U.S.C. 1514 and part 174 of this chapter:
(A) Within 90 days after notice of liquidation is provided pursuant to part 159 of this chapter; or
(B) In cases where the negative origin determination does not result in a liquidation, within 90 days after the date of issuance of the written determination.
§ 181.76
Application of origin determinations.
(a)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, an origin determination may be applied upon issuance of the determination under § 181.75 of this part.
(b)
Negative origin determinations.
In the case of a negative origin determination issued under § 181.75(b) of this part:
(1) The date on which preferential tariff treatment may be denied shall be no earlier than 30 calendar days from the date on which:
(i) Receipt of the written determination by the exporter or producer is confirmed, if a request under § 181.75(b)(1) of this part has been made; or
(ii) The written determination is sent by Customs, if no request under § 181.75(b)(1) of this part has been made; and
(2) Before denying preferential tariff treatment, Customs shall take into account any comments or additional information provided by the exporter or producer during the period established in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(c)
Cases involving a pattern of conduct.
Where multiple origin verifications initiated under § 181.72(a) of this part indicate a pattern of conduct by an exporter or producer involving false or unsupported representations on Certificates of Origin that a good imported into the United States qualifies as an originating good, Customs may deny subsequent claims for preferential tariff treatment on identical goods exported or produced by such person until that person establishes compliance with the rules applicable to originating goods as set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in this part, provided that advance written notice of the intent to deny such claims is given to the importer. For purposes of this paragraph, a “pattern of conduct” means repeated instances of false or unsupported representations by an exporter or producer as established by Customs on the basis of not fewer than two origin verifications of two or more importations of the good that result in the issuance of not fewer than two written determinations issued to that exporter or producer pursuant to § 181.75 of this part which conclude, as a finding of fact, that Certificates of Origin completed and signed by that exporter or producer with respect to identical goods contain false or unsupported representations.
(d)
Differing determinations.
Where Customs determines, either as a result of an origin verification initiated under § 181.72(a) of this part or under any other circumstance, that a certain
good imported into the United States does not qualify as an originating good based on a tariff classification or a value applied in the United States to one or more materials used in the production of the good, including a material used in the production of another material that is used in the production of the good, which differs from the tariff classification or value applied to the materials by the country from which the good was exported, the Customs determination shall not become effective until Customs provides written notification thereof both to the U.S. importer of the good and to the person who completed and signed the Certificate of Origin upon which the claim for preferential tariff treatment for the good was based.
(e)
Applicability of a determination to prior importations.
Customs shall not apply a determination made under paragraph (d) of this section to an importation made before the effective date of the determination if, prior to notification of the determination, the customs administration of the country from which the good was exported either issued an advance ruling under Article 509 of the NAFTA or any other ruling on the tariff classification or on the value of such materials, or gave consistent treatment to the entry of the materials under the tariff classification or value at issue, on which a person is entitled to rely and on which that person did in fact rely. For purposes of this paragraph, the person who received notification of the determination shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customs, in writing within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notification, that the conditions set forth herein have been met. For purposes of this paragraph:
(1) A “ruling” on which a person is entitled to rely in the case of Canada must be issued pursuant to section 43.1(1) of the Customs Act (Advance Rulings) or in accordance with Departmental Memorandum 11-11-1 (National Customs Rulings) and in the case of Mexico must be issued pursuant to Article 34 of the Codigo Fiscal de la Federacion and pursuant to Article 30 of the Ley Aduanera or the applicable provision of Mexican law related to advance rulings under Article 509 of the NAFTA; and
(2) “Consistent treatment” means the established application by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration that can be substantiated by the continued acceptance by the customs administration of the tariff classification or value of identical materials on importations of the materials into Canada or Mexico by the same importer over a period of not less than two years immediately prior to the date of signature of the Certificate of Origin for the good that is the subject of the determination referred to in paragraph (d) of this section, provided that with regard to those importations:
(i) The tariff classification or value of the materials was not the subject of a verification, review or appeal by that customs administration on the date of the determination under paragraph (d) of this section; and
(ii) The materials had not been accorded a different tariff classification or value by one or more district, regional or local offices of that customs administration on the date of the determination under paragraph (d) of this section.
(f)
Detrimental reliance.
If Customs proposes to deny preferential tariff treatment to a good pursuant to a determination made under paragraph (d) of this section, Customs shall postpone the application of the determination for a period not exceeding 90 calendar days from the date of issuance of the determination where the U.S. importer of the good, or the person who completed and signed the Certificate of Origin upon which the claim for preferential tariff treatment for the good was based, demonstrates to the satisfaction of Customs that it has relied in good faith to its detriment on the tariff classification or value applied to such materials by the customs administration of the country from which the good was exported.

# Subpart H—Penalties
§ 181.81
Applicability to NAFTA transactions.
Except as otherwise provided in § 181.82 of this part, all criminal, civil or administrative penalties which may be imposed on U.S. importers, exporters and producers for violations of the Customs and related laws and regulations shall also apply to U.S. importers, exporters and producers for violations of the laws and regulations relating to the NAFTA.
§ 181.82
Exceptions to application of penalties.
(a)
General.
A U.S. importer who makes a corrected declaration under § 181.21(b) of this part shall not be subject to civil or administrative penalties for having made an incorrect declaration, provided that the corrected declaration was voluntarily made. In addition, civil or administrative penalties provided for under the U.S. Customs laws and regulations shall not be imposed on an exporter or producer in the United States who voluntarily provides written notification pursuant to § 181.11(d) of this part with respect to the making of an incorrect certification.
(b)
“Voluntarily” defined
—(1)
General.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the making of a corrected declaration or the providing of written notification of an incorrect certification will be deemed to have been done voluntarily if:
(i) Done before the commencement of a formal investigation;
(ii) Done before any of the events specified in § 162.74(i) of this chapter have occurred;
(iii) Done within 30 calendar days after either the U.S. importer with respect to a declaration that an imported good qualified as an originating good, or the U.S. exporter or producer with respect to a certification pertaining to a good exported to Canada or Mexico, had reason to believe that the declaration or certification was not correct;
(iv) Accompanied by a written statement setting forth the information specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and
(v) In the case of a corrected declaration, accompanied or followed by a tender of any actual loss of duties in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
(2)
Cases involving fraud.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a person who acted by means of fraud in making an incorrect declaration or certification may not make a voluntary correction thereof.

(3)
Written statement.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, each corrected declaration or notification of an incorrect certification shall be accompanied by a written statement which:

(ii) Identifies each import or export transaction affected by the incorrect declaration or certification with reference to each port of importation or exportation and the approximate date of each importation or exportation. A U.S. producer who provides written notification that certain information in a Certificate of Origin is incorrect and who is unable to identify the specific export transactions under this paragraph shall provide as much information concerning those transactions as the producer, by the exercise of good faith and due diligence, is able to obtain;
(iii) Specifies the nature of the incorrect statements or omissions regarding the declaration or certification; and
(iv) Sets forth, to the best of the person's knowledge, the true and accurate information or data which should have been covered by or provided in the declaration or certification, and states that the person will provide any additional information or data which is unknown at the time of making the corrected declaration or certification within 30 calendar days or within any extension of that 30-day period as Customs may permit in order for the person to obtain the information or data.
(4)
Substantial compliance.
For purposes of this section, a person shall be deemed to have voluntarily corrected a declaration or certification even
though that person provides corrected information in a manner which does not conform to the requirements of the written statement specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, provided that:
(i) Customs is satisfied that the information was provided before the commencement of a formal investigation; and
(ii) The information provided includes, orally or in writing, substantially the same information as that specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

Tender of actual loss of duties.
A U.S. importer who makes a corrected declaration shall tender any actual loss of duties at the time of making the corrected declaration, or within 30 calendar days thereafter, or within any extension of that 30-day period as Customs may allow in order for the importer to obtain the information or data necessary to calculate the duties owed.
(6)
Applicability of prior disclosure provisions.
Where a person fails to meet the requirements of this section because the correction of the declaration or the written notification of an incorrect certification is not considered to be done voluntarily as provided in this section, that person may nevertheless qualify for prior disclosure treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1592(c)(4) and the regulations issued thereunder.
[T.D. 95-68, 60 FR 46364, Sept. 6, 1995, as amended by T.D. 99-64, 64 FR 43267, Aug. 10, 1999]

# Subpart I—Advance Ruling Procedures
§ 181.91
Applicability.
This subpart sets forth the rules which govern the issuance and application of advance rulings under Article 509 of the NAFTA and the procedures which apply for purposes of review of advance rulings under Article 510 of the NAFTA. Importers in the United States and exporters and producers located in Canada or Mexico may request and obtain an advance ruling on a NAFTA transaction only in accordance with the provisions of this subpart whenever the requested ruling involves a subject matter specified in § 181.92(b)(6) of this part. Accordingly, the provisions of this subpart shall apply in lieu of the administrative ruling provisions contained in subpart A of part 177 of this chapter except where the request for a ruling involves a subject matter not specified in § 181.92(b)(6).
§ 181.92
Definitions and general NAFTA advance ruling practice.
(a)
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart:
(1) An
advance ruling
is a written statement issued by the Headquarters Office or the National Commodity Specialist Division or by such other office as designated by the Commissioner of Customs that interprets and applies the provisions of NAFTA to a specific set of facts involving any subject matter specified in § 181.92(b)(6) of this part. An “advance ruling letter” is an advance ruling issued in response to a written request and set forth in a letter addressed to the person making the request or his designee. A “published advance ruling” is an advance ruling which has been published in full text in the Customs Bulletin.
(2) An
authorized agent
is a person expressly authorized by a principal to act on his or her behalf. An advance ruling requested by an attorney or other person acting as an agent must include a statement describing the authority under which the request is made. With the exception of attorneys whose authority to represent is known, any person appearing before Customs as an agent in connection with an advance ruling request may be required to present evidence of his or her authority to represent the principal. The foregoing requirements will not apply to an individual representing his or her full-time employer or to a bona-fide officer, director or other qualified representative of a corporation, association, or organized group.
(3) The term
Headquarters Office,
means the Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade at Headquarters, U. S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC.
(4) An
information letter
is a written statement issued by the Headquarters Office or the National Commodity Specialist Division or by such other office
as designated by the Commissioner of Customs that does no more than call attention to a well-established interpretation of principles under the NAFTA, without applying it to a specific set of facts. If Customs believes that general information may be of some benefit to the person making the request, an information letter may be issued in response to a request for an advance ruling when:
(i) The request suggests that general information, rather than an advance ruling, is actually being sought;
(ii) The request is incomplete or otherwise fails to meet the requirements set forth in this subpart; or
(iii) The requested advance ruling cannot be issued for any other reason.
(5) A
NAFTA transaction
is an act or activity to which the NAFTA provisions apply. A “prospective” NAFTA transaction is one that is merely contemplated or is currently being undertaken but has not resulted in any arrival or in the filing of any entry or entry summary or other document or in any other act so as to bring the transaction, or any part of it, under the jurisdiction of any Customs office. A “current” NAFTA transaction is one which is presently under consideration by a field office of Customs. A “completed” NAFTA transaction is one which has been acted upon by a Customs field office and with respect to which that office has issued a determination which is final in nature, but is (or was) subject to appeal, petition, protest or other review as provided in the applicable Customs laws and regulations. An “ongoing” NAFTA transaction is a series of identical, recurring transactions, consisting of current and completed transactions where future transactions are contemplated.
(6) The term
National Commodity Specialist Division
means the National Commodity Specialist Division, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, New York, New York.
(b)
General advance ruling practice.
An advance ruling may be requested under the provisions of this subpart with respect to prospective NAFTA transactions. An advance ruling will be based on the facts and circumstances presented by the requester.
(1)
Prospective NAFTA transactions.
It is in the interest of the sound administration of the NAFTA that persons engaging in any transaction affected by NAFTA fully understand the consequences of that transaction prior to its consummation. For this reason, Customs will give full and careful consideration to written requests from importers in the United States and exporters or producers in Canada or Mexico for advance rulings or information setting forth, with respect to a specifically described transaction, a definitive interpretation of applicable law or other appropriate information.
(2)
Current or ongoing NAFTA transactions.
A question arising in connection with a NAFTA transaction already before a Customs field office by reason of arrival, entry or otherwise will be resolved by that office in accordance with the principles and precedents previously announced by the Headquarters Office. If such a question cannot be resolved on the basis of clearly established rules set forth in the NAFTA or the regulations thereunder, or in applicable Treasury Decisions, rulings, opinions, or court decisions published in the Customs Bulletin, that field office may, if it believes it appropriate, forward the question to the Headquarters Office for consideration.
(3)
Completed NAFTA transactions.
A question arising in connection with an entry of merchandise which has been liquidated, or in connection with any other completed NAFTA transaction, may not be the subject of an advance ruling request under this subpart.
(4)
Oral advice.
Customs will not issue an advance ruling in response to an oral request. Oral opinions or advice of Customs personnel are not binding on Customs. However, oral inquiries may be made to Customs offices regarding existing advance rulings, the scope of such advance rulings, the types of transactions with respect to which Customs will issue advance rulings, the scope of the advance rulings which may be issued, or the procedures to be followed in submitting advance ruling requests, as prescribed in this subpart.
(5)
Who may request an advance ruling.
An advance ruling may be requested by
any of the following persons (individuals, corporations, partnerships, associations, or other entities or groups) having a direct and demonstrable interest in the question or questions presented in the advance ruling request, or by the authorized agent of any such person:
(i) An importer in the United States;
(ii) An exporter or a producer of a good in Canada or Mexico; or
(iii) A Canadian or Mexican producer of a material that is used in the production of a good imported into the United States, but only with regard to that material and only in regard to a matter described in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) through (v) and (vii) of this section.
(6)
Subject matter of advance rulings.
Customs shall issue advance rulings under this subpart concerning the following:
(i) Whether materials imported from a country other than the United States, Canada or Mexico and used in the production of a good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, as a result of production occurring entirely in the United States, Canada and/or Mexico;
(ii) Whether a good satisfies a regional value-content requirement under the transaction value method or under the net cost method as provided for in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in this part;
(iii) For purposes of determining whether a good satisfies a regional value-content requirement under General Note 12, HTSUS, and under this part, the appropriate basis or method for value to be applied by an exporter or a producer in Canada or Mexico, in accordance with the principles set forth in the appendix to this part, for calculating the transaction value of the good or of the materials used in the production of the good;
(iv) For purposes of determining whether a good satisfies a regional value-content requirement under General Note 12, HTSUS, and under this part, the appropriate basis or method for reasonably allocating costs, in accordance with the allocation methods set forth in the appendix to this part, for calculating the net cost of the good or the value of an intermediate material;
(v) Whether a good qualifies as an originating good under General Note 12, HTSUS, and under the appendix to this part;
(vi) Whether a good that re-enters the United States after having been exported from the United States to Canada or Mexico for repair or alteration qualifies for duty-free treatment in accordance with § 181.64 of this part;
(vii) Whether the proposed or actual marking of a good satisfies country of origin marking requirements under part 134 of this chapter and under the Marking Rules set forth in part 102 of this chapter;
(viii) Whether an originating good qualifies as a good of Canada or Mexico under Annex 300-B, Annex 302.2 and Chapter Seven of the NAFTA; and
(ix) Whether a good is a qualifying good under Chapter Seven of the NAFTA.
§ 181.93
Submission of advance ruling requests.
(a)
Form.
A request for an advance ruling should be written in the English language and in the form of a letter. For any subject matter specified in § 181.92(b)(6)(i), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), or (ix) of this part, the request may be directed either to the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. (Mint Annex), Washington, DC 20229, or to the National Commodity Specialist Division, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, One Penn Plaza, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10119. For any subject matter specified in § 181.92(b)(6)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this part, the request must be directed to the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. (Mint Annex), Washington, DC 20229.
(b)
Content
—(1)
General.
Each request for an advance ruling must identify the specific subject matter under § 181.92(b)(6) of this part to which the
request relates, must contain a complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the NAFTA transaction and must state that the information presented is accurate and complete. The following facts must be included: the names, addresses, and other identifying information of all interested parties (if known); the name of the port or place at which any good involved in the transaction will be imported or which will otherwise have jurisdiction with respect to the act or activity described in the transaction; and a description of the transaction itself, appropriate in detail to the subject matter of the requested advance ruling. Where the request for an advance ruling is submitted by or on behalf of the importer of the good involved in the transaction, the request must include the name and address of the exporter and, if known, producer of the good. Where the request for an advance ruling is submitted by or on behalf of the exporter of the good involved in the transaction, the request must include the name and address of the producer and importer of the good, if known. Where the request for an advance ruling is submitted by or on behalf of the producer of the good involved in the transaction, the request must include the name and address of the exporter and importer of the good, if known. In addition, where relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request for an advance ruling, and regardless of the specific nature of the advance ruling requested, the request must include:
(i) A copy of any advance ruling or other ruling with respect to the tariff classification of the good that has been issued by CBP to the person submitting the request; or
(ii) Sufficient information to enable CBP to classify the good where no advance ruling or other ruling with respect to the tariff classification of the good has been issued by CBP to the person submitting the request. Such information includes a full description of the good, including, where relevant, the composition of the good, a description of the process by which the good is manufactured, a description of the packaging in which the good is contained, the anticipated use of the good and its commercial, common or technical designation, and product literature, drawings, photographs or schematics.
(2)
Description of transaction
—(i)
General.
The prospective Customs transaction to which the advance ruling request relates must be described in sufficient detail to permit proper application of the relevant NAFTA provisions.
(ii)
Tariff change rulings
—(A)
General.
If the transaction involves the importation of a good or material for which a ruling is requested as to whether a change in tariff classification has occurred, the request should set forth: The principal or chief use of the good or material in the United States and the commercial, common, or technical designation of the good or material; if the good or material is composed of two or more substances, the relative quantity (by both weight and by volume) and value of each substance; any applicable special invoicing requirements set forth in part 141 of this chapter (if known); and any other information which may assist in determining the appropriate tariff classification of the good or material. The advance ruling request should also note, whenever germane, the purchase price of the good or material, and its approximate selling price in the United States. Each individual request for an advance ruling must be limited to five merchandise items, all of which must be of the same class or kind. Only NAFTA tariff change rulings will be issued under this subpart. Tariff classification rulings which do not involve the application of the NAFTA shall be issued under part 177 of this chapter.
(B)
Issues involving a change in tariff classification of a material.
Where the request for the advance ruling involves the application of a rule of origin that requires an assessment of whether materials used in the production of an imported good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification, the request must list each material used in the production of the good and must:
(
1
) Identify each material which is claimed to be an originating material and provide a complete description of each such material, including the basis for the claim as to originating status;
(
2
) Identify each material which is a non-originating material, or for which
the origin is unknown, and provide a complete description of each such material, including its tariff classification if known; and
(
3
) Describe all processing operations employed in the production of the good, the location of each operation and the sequence in which the operations occur.
(iii)
NAFTA rulings on regional value content.
NAFTA advance ruling requests, if involving the issue of whether a good satisfies a regional value content requirement under the transaction value method or under the net cost method, or under both methods, as provided for in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in the appendix to this part, must specify each method under which eligibility is sought. Where the transaction value method is specified, the advance ruling request must include: information sufficient to calculate the transaction value of the good in accordance with schedule II of the appendix to this part with respect to the transaction of the producer of the good, adjusted to an F.O.B. basis; information sufficient to calculate the value of each non-originating material, or material the origin of which is unknown, that is used by the producer in the production of the good in accordance with the provisions of section 7 and, where applicable, section 6(10) of the appendix to this part; a complete description of each material that is claimed to be an originating material and that is used in the production of the good, including the basis for the claim as to originating status; information sufficient to permit an examination of the factors enumerated in schedule III or VIII of the appendix to this part where the advance ruling request involves an issue of whether, with respect to the good or material under the applicable schedule, the transaction value is acceptable; and information sufficient for any other circumstance to make any determination relevant to the application of the regional value content requirement to the good. Where the net cost method is specified, the advance ruling request must include: a list of all product, period and other costs relevant to determining the total cost of the good as defined in the appendix to this part; a list of all excluded costs to be subtracted from the total cost of the good as provided in the appendix to this part; information sufficient to calculate the value of each non-originating material, or material the origin of which is unknown, that is used in the production of the good, in accordance with section 7 of the appendix to this part; the basis for any allocation of costs in accordance with schedule VII of the appendix to this part; the period over which the net cost calculation is to be made; and any other information relevant to determining the appropriate value of any cost under this part. Where the advance ruling request concerns only the calculation of an element of a regional value content formula, and with regard to the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section, the request need only contain the following: the information in paragraph (b)(1), other than the information specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii); the information in paragraph (b)(5); and any information in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) which is relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request.
(iv)
NAFTA rulings on producer materials. W
here the advance ruling request involves an issue with respect to an intermediate material under Article 402(10) of the NAFTA (see section 7(4) of the appendix to this part), the request must contain sufficient information to determine the origin and value of the material in accordance with Article 402(11) of the NAFTA (see section 7(6) of the appendix to this part). Where the advance ruling request is submitted by a Canadian or Mexican producer of a material under § 181.92(b)(5)(iii) of this part and concerns only the origin of such material, and with regard to the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section, the request need only include the following: the information in paragraph (b)(1), including any information specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) which is relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request; any information in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) which is relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request; a sample as provided for in paragraph (b)(3) if relevant to the issue that is the
subject of the request; and the information in paragraph (b)(5).
(3)
Samples.
Each request for an advance ruling should be accompanied by photographs, drawings, or other pictorial representations of the good and, whenever possible, by a sample of the good unless a precise description of the good is not essential to the advance ruling requested. Any good consisting of materials in chemical or physical combination for which a laboratory analysis has been prepared by or for the manufacturer should include a copy of that analysis, flow charts, CAS number, and related information. A sample submitted in connection with a request for an advance ruling becomes a part of the CBP file in the matter and will be retained until the advance ruling is issued or the advance ruling request is otherwise disposed of. A sample should only be submitted with the understanding that all or a part of it may be damaged or consumed in the course of examination, testing, analysis, or other actions undertaken in connection with the advance ruling request.
(4)
Related documents.
If the question or questions presented in the advance ruling request directly relate to matters set forth in any invoice, contract, agreement, or other document, a copy of the document must be submitted with the request. (Original documents should not be submitted inasmuch as any documents or exhibits furnished with the advance ruling request become a part of the CBP file in the matter and cannot be returned.) The relevant facts reflected in any documents submitted, and an explanation of their bearing on the question or questions presented, must be expressly set forth in the advance ruling request.
(5)
Prior or current transactions—(i) General.
Each request for an advance ruling must state:
(A) Whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, the same transaction or issue, or one identical to it, has ever been considered, or is currently being considered by any CBP office;
(B) Whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, the issue involved has ever been, or is currently, the subject of:
(
1
) Review by the United States Court of International Trade, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom, or review by a judicial or quasi-judicial body in Canada or Mexico;
(
2
) A verification of origin performed in the United States, Canada or Mexico;
(
3
) An administrative appeal in the United States, Canada or Mexico; or
(
4
) A request for an advance ruling under this subpart, or a request for an advance ruling in Canada or Mexico under an appropriate authority referred to in § 181.76(e)(1) of this part;
(C) The status or disposition of any matter on which an affirmative statement is made under paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section; and
(D) Whether the transaction described in the advance ruling request is but one of a series of similar and related transactions.
(ii)
Change in status of transaction.
If a prospective transaction which is the subject of an advance ruling request becomes a current transaction, the person who submitted the request shall so notify the office processing the request.
(6)
Statement of position.
If the request for an advance ruling asks that a particular determination or conclusion be reached in the advance ruling letter, a statement must be included in the request setting forth the basis for that determination or conclusion, together with a citation of all relevant supporting authority.
(7)
Privileged or confidential information.
Information which is claimed to constitute trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information regarding the business transactions of private parties the disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person making the request (or of another interested party) must be identified clearly, and the reasons such information should not be disclosed, including, where applicable, the reasons the disclosure of the information would prejudice the competitive position of the person making the request (or of another interested party), must be set forth. An advance ruling will not be
issued until all trade secret, privilege or confidentiality issues are resolved (see § 181.99(a)(3) of this part).
(c)
Signing; instruction as to reply.
The request for an advance ruling must be signed by a person authorized to make the request, as described in § 181.92(b)(5) of this part. An advance ruling requested by a principal or authorized agent may direct that the advance ruling letter be addressed to the other.
(d)
Requests for immediate consideration.
CBP will normally process requests for advance rulings in the order they are received and as expeditiously as possible, as specified in § 181.99 of this part. However, a request that a particular matter be given consideration ahead of its regular order, if made in writing at the time the request is submitted, or subsequent thereto, and showing a clear need for such treatment, will be given consideration as the particular circumstances warrant and permit. Requests for special consideration made by telegram or electronic transmission will be treated in the same manner as requests made by letter, but advance rulings will not be issued by telegram or electronic transmission. A telegram or electronic transmission must be followed up with a signed original within 14 calendar days of the submission of the telegram or electronic transmission. In no event can any assurance be given that a particular request for an advance ruling will be acted upon by the time requested.
[T.D. 95-68, 60 FR 46364, Sept. 6, 1995, as amended by T.D. 99-64, 64 FR 43267, Aug. 10, 1999; CBP Dec. 07-76, 72 FR 52783, Sept. 17, 2007; CBP Dec. 08-25, 73 FR 40727, July 16, 2008]
§ 181.94
Nonconforming requests for advance rulings.
A person submitting a request for an advance ruling that does not comply with all of the provisions of this subpart will be so notified in writing, and the requirements that have not been met will be pointed out. Such person will be given a period of 30 calendar days from the date of the notice (or such longer period as the notice may provide) to supply any additional information that is requested or otherwise conform the advance ruling request to the requirements referred to in the notice. The Customs file with respect to advance ruling requests which are not brought into compliance with the provisions of this subpart within the period of time allowed will be administratively closed and the request removed from active consideration. A request for an advance ruling that is removed from active consideration by reason of failure to comply with the provisions of this subpart may be treated as withdrawn. A failure to comply with the provisions of this subpart will result in the rejection of the advance ruling request with the notice specifying the deficiencies.
§ 181.95
Oral discussion of issues.
(a)
General.
A person submitting a request for an advance ruling and desiring an opportunity to orally discuss the issue or issues involved should indicate that desire in writing at the time the advance ruling request is filed. Such a discussion will only be scheduled when, in the opinion of the Customs personnel by whom the advance ruling request is under consideration, a conference will be helpful in deciding the issue or issues involved or when a determination or conclusion contrary to that advocated in the advance ruling request is contemplated. Conferences are scheduled for the purpose of affording the parties an opportunity to freely and openly discuss the matters set forth in the advance ruling request. Accordingly, the parties will not be bound by any argument or position advocated or agreed to, expressly or by implication, during the conference unless either party subsequently agrees to be so bound in writing. The conference will not conclude with the issuance of an advance ruling letter.
(b)
Time, place and number of conferences.
If a request for a conference is granted, the person making the request will be notified of the time and place of the conference. No more than one conference with respect to the matters set forth in an advance ruling request will be scheduled, unless, in the opinion of the Customs personnel by whom the advance ruling request is under consideration, additional conferences are necessary.
(c)
Representation.
A person whose request for a conference has been granted may be accompanied at that conference by counsel or other representatives, or may designate such persons to attend the conference in his or her place.
(d)
Additional information presented at conferences.
It will be the responsibility of the person submitting the request for an advance ruling to provide for inclusion in the Customs file in the matter a written record setting forth any and all additional information, documents, and exhibits introduced during the conference to the extent that person considers such material relevant to the consideration of the advance ruling request. Such information, documents and exhibits shall be given consideration only if received by Customs within 30 calendar days following the conference.
§ 181.96
Change in status of transaction.
Each person submitting a request for an advance ruling in connection with a NAFTA transaction must immediately advise Customs in writing of any change in the status of that transaction upon becoming aware of the change. In particular, Customs must be advised when any transaction described in the advance ruling request as prospective becomes current and under the jurisdiction of a Customs field office. In addition, any person engaged in a NAFTA transaction coming under the jurisdiction of a Customs field office who has previously requested a NAFTA advance ruling with respect to that transaction must advise the field office of that fact.
§ 181.97
Withdrawal of NAFTA advance ruling requests.
Any request for an advance ruling may be withdrawn by the person submitting it at any time before the issuance of an advance ruling letter or any other final disposition of the request. All correspondence, documents, and exhibits submitted in connection with the request will be retained in the Customs file and will not be returned. In addition, the Headquarters Office may forward, to Customs field offices which have or may have jurisdiction over the transaction to which the advance ruling request relates, its views in regard to the transaction or the issues involved therein, as well as appropriate information derived from materials in the Customs file.
§ 181.98
Situations in which no NAFTA advance ruling may be issued.
(a)
General.
No advance ruling letter will be issued in response to a request therefor which fails to comply with the provisions of this subpart. No advance ruling letter will be issued in regard to a completed transaction.
(b)
Pending matters.
Where a request for an advance ruling involves an issue that is under review in connection with an origin verification under subpart G of this part or that is the subject of an administrative review procedure provided for in subpart J of this part or in part 174 of this chapter, Customs may decline to issue the requested advance ruling. In addition, no NAFTA advance ruling letter will be issued with respect to any issue which is pending before the United States Court of International Trade, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom. Litigation before any other court will not preclude the issuance of an advance ruling letter, provided neither Customs nor any of its officers or agents is named as a party to the action.
§ 181.99
Issuance of NAFTA advance rulings or other advice.
(a)
NAFTA advance ruling letters
—(1)
General.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, Customs will, within 120 calendar days of receipt of a request, including any required information supplemental thereto, issue an advance ruling letter in the English language setting forth the position of Customs and the reasons therefor with respect to a specifically described Customs transaction whenever a request for such an advance ruling is submitted in accordance with the provisions of this subpart and it is in the sound administration of the NAFTA provisions to do so. Otherwise, a request for an advance ruling will be answered by an information letter or, in those situations in which general information is likely to be of little or no
value, by a letter stating that no advance ruling can be issued. In the course of evaluating the advance ruling request Customs may solicit supplemental information from the person requesting the advance ruling. The submission of supplemental information will extend the time for response. The time for response will also be extended if it is necessary to obtain information from other government agencies or in the form of a laboratory analysis.
(2)
Submission of NAFTA advance ruling letters to field offices.
Any importer engaging in a NAFTA transaction with respect to which an advance ruling letter has been issued under this subpart either must ensure that a copy of the advance ruling letter is attached to the documents filed with the appropriate Customs office in connection with that transaction or must otherwise indicate with the information filed for that transaction that an advance ruling has been received. Any person receiving an advance ruling stating Customs determination must set forth such determination in the documents or information filed in connection with any subsequent entry of that merchandise; failure to do so may result in a rejection of the entry and the imposition of such penalties as may be appropriate. An advance ruling received after the filing of such documents or information must immediately be brought to the attention of the appropriate Customs field office.
(3)
Disclosure of NAFTA advance ruling letters.
No part of the advance ruling letter, including names, addresses, or information relating to the business transactions of private parties, shall be deemed to constitute privileged or confidential commercial or financial information or trade secrets exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), and part 103 of this chapter, or shall be deemed to be subject to the confidentiality principle set forth in § 181.121 of this part, unless, as provided in § 181.93(b)(7) of this part, the information claimed to be exempt from disclosure is clearly identified and a valid basis for nondisclosure is set forth. Before the issuance of the advance ruling letter, the person submitting the advance ruling request will be notified of any decision adverse to his request for nondisclosure and will, upon written request to Customs within 10 working days of the date of notification, be permitted to withdraw the advance ruling request. If in the opinion of Customs an impasse exists on the issue of confidentiality and the person who submitted the advance ruling request does not withdraw the request, Customs will decline to issue the advance ruling. All advance ruling letters issued by Customs will be available, upon written request, for inspection and copying by any person (with any portions determined to be exempt from disclosure deleted).
(4)
Penalties for misrepresented or omitted material facts or for noncompliance.
If Customs determines that an issued advance ruling was based on incorrect information, the person to whom the advance ruling was issued may be subject to appropriate penalties unless that person demonstrates that he used reasonable care and acted in good faith in presenting the facts and circumstances on which the advance ruling was based. In addition, Customs may apply such measures as the circumstances may warrant in a case where a person to whom an advance ruling was issued has failed to act in accordance with the terms and conditions of the advance ruling.
(b)
Other NAFTA advice and guidance.
The Headquarters Office may on its own initiative from time to time issue other external advice and guidance with respect to issues or transactions arising under the NAFTA which come to its attention. Such NAFTA advice and guidance, which represent the official position of Customs and which are likely to be of widespread interest and application, are published in the Customs Bulletin, as described in § 181.101 of this part. Nothing in this subpart shall preclude Customs from issuing advice and guidance to its field offices concerning the application of the NAFTA.
§ 181.100
Effect of NAFTA advance ruling letters; modification and revocation.
(a)
Effect of NAFTA advance ruling letters
—(1)
General.
An advance ruling letter issued by Customs under the provisions of this subpart represents the official position of Customs with respect to the particular transaction or issue described therein and is binding on all Customs personnel in accordance with the provisions of this subpart until modified or revoked. In the absence of a change of practice or other modification or revocation which affects the principle of the advance ruling set forth in the advance ruling letter, that principle may be cited as authority in the disposition of transactions involving the same circumstances. An advance ruling letter is generally effective on the date it is issued or such later date as may be specified in the advance ruling and, commencing on its effective date, may be applied to entries for consumption and warehouse withdrawals for consumption which are unliquidated, or to other transactions with respect to which Customs has not taken final action on that date. See, however, paragraph (b) of this section (ruling letters which modify previous advance ruling letters) and § 181.101 of this part (advance ruling letters published in the Customs Bulletin).
(2)
Application of NAFTA rulings to transactions
—(i)
General.
Each NAFTA ruling letter is issued on the assumption that all of the information furnished in connection with the ruling request and incorporated in the ruling letter, either directly, by reference, or by implication, is accurate and complete in every material respect. The application of an advance ruling letter by a Customs field office to the transaction to which it is purported to relate is subject to the verification of the facts incorporated in the advance ruling letter, a comparison of the transaction described therein to the actual transaction, and the satisfaction of any conditions on which the advance ruling was based, and if the facts are materially different or a condition has not been satisfied, the treatment specified in the advance ruling will not be applied to the actual transaction. If, in the opinion of any Customs field office by whom the transaction is under consideration or review, the advance ruling letter should be modified or revoked, the findings and recommendations of that office will be forwarded to the Headquarters Office for consideration, prior to any final disposition with respect to the transaction by that office. If the transaction described in the NAFTA advance ruling letter and the actual transaction are the same, and any and all conditions set forth in the advance ruling letter have been satisfied, the advance ruling will be applied to the transaction.
(ii)
Tariff change rulings.
Each advance ruling letter concerning whether a change in tariff classification has occurred will be applied only with respect to transactions involving either articles which are identical to the sample submitted with the advance ruling request and reflect the same processing or articles which conform to the description set forth in the advance ruling letter.
(iii)
Regional value content rulings.
Each advance ruling letter concerning the application of a regional value content requirement will be applied only with respect to transactions involving the same merchandise and identical facts.
(3)
Reliance on NAFTA advance rulings by others.
An advance ruling letter is subject to modification or revocation without notice to any person other than the person to whom the letter was addressed. Accordingly, no other person may rely on the advance ruling letter or assume that the principles of that advance ruling will be applied in connection with any transaction other than the one described in the letter. However, any person eligible to request an advance ruling under § 181.92(b)(5) of this part may request information as to whether a previously-issued advance ruling letter has been modified or revoked by writing the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Washington, DC 20229, and either enclosing a copy of the advance ruling letter or furnishing other information sufficient to permit the advance ruling letter in question to be identified.
(b)
Modification or revocation of NAFTA advance ruling letters
—(1)
General.
Any NAFTA advance ruling letter may be modified or revoked by Customs Headquarters in any of the following circumstances or for any of the following purposes, provided that written notice of the modification or revocation is given to the person to whom the advance ruling letter was addressed:
(i) If the ruling letter reflects or is based on an error:
(A) Of fact;
(B) In the tariff classification of a good or material that is the subject of the ruling;
(C) In the application of a regional value-content requirement under General Note 12, HTSUS, and under this part;
(D) In the application of the rules for determining whether a good qualifies as a good of Canada or Mexico under Annex 300-B, Annex 302.2 or Chapter Seven of the NAFTA;
(E) In the application of the rules for determining whether a good is a qualifying good under Chapter Seven of the NAFTA; or
(F) In the application of the rules for determining whether a good qualifies for duty-free treatment under § 181.64 of this part when the good re-enters the United States after having been exported to Canada or Mexico for repair or alteration;
(ii) If the ruling letter is not in accordance with an interpretation agreed on by the United States, Canada and Mexico regarding Chapter Three or Chapter Four of the NAFTA;
(iii) If there is a change in the material facts or circumstances on which the ruling is based;
(iv) To conform to a modification of Chapter Three, Four, Five or Seven of the NAFTA, or of the Marking Rules, or of the regulations set forth in this part; or
(v) To conform to a judicial decision or change in domestic law.
(2)
Application of modification or revocation of NAFTA advance ruling letters.
The modification or revocation of a NAFTA advance ruling letter will not be applied to entries or warehouse withdrawals for consumption which were made prior to the effective date of such modification or revocation, except where the person to whom the advance ruling was issued has not acted in accordance with its terms and conditions.
(3)
Effective dates.
Generally, a NAFTA letter modifying or revoking an earlier advance ruling will be effective on the date it is issued. However, Customs may, upon request or on its own initiative, delay the effective date of such a modification or revocation for a period of up to 90 calendar days from the date of issuance. Such a delay may be granted at the request of the party to whom the ruling letter was issued, provided such party can demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customs that it relied on the earlier advance ruling in good faith and to its detriment. The evidence of such reliance must cover the period from the date of the letter modifying or revoking the advance ruling back to the date of that advance ruling and must list all transactions claimed to be covered by the modified or revoked advance ruling by entry number (or other Customs assigned number), the quantity and value of merchandise covered by each such transaction (where applicable), the ports of entry, and the dates of final action by Customs. Such evidence must also include contracts, purchase orders, or other materials tending to establish that future transactions were arranged based on the earlier advance ruling. The request for delay must specifically identify the prior ruling on which reliance is claimed. All persons requesting a delay will be issued a separate letter setting forth the period, if any, of the delay to be provided. In appropriate circumstances, Customs may decide to make its decision, with respect to a delay, applicable to all persons, irrespective of demonstrated reliance; in this event, a notice announcing the delay will be published in the
Customs Bulletin
and individual ruling letters will not be issued.
§ 181.101
Publication of decisions.
Within 90 days after issuing any precedential decision relating to any NAFTA transaction, Customs shall publish the decision in the
Customs Bulletin
or otherwise make it available for public inspection. Disclosure is
governed by 31 CFR part 1, part 103 of this chapter, and § 181.99(a)(3) of this part.
§ 181.102
Administrative and judicial review of advance rulings.
(a)
Administrative review
—(1)
Submission of request for review.
Any person who received an advance ruling issued under this subpart, or an authorized agent of such person, may request administrative review, at CBP Headquarters, of that advance ruling, including any modification or revocation thereof, by letter addressed to the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. Such request shall be filed within 30 calendar days after issuance of the advance ruling and shall set forth the following information:
(i) The name and address of the person seeking review and the name and address of his authorized agent if the request is signed by such an agent;
(ii) The Customs identification number or employer identification number in the case of a U.S. importer and authorized agent thereof, the employer number or importer/exporter number assigned by Revenue Canada in the case of a Canadian exporter or producer and authorized agent thereof, and the federal taxpayer registry number (RFC) in the case of a Mexican exporter or producer and authorized agent thereof;
(iii) The number and date of the advance ruling at issue;
(iv) The numbers and dates of any involved entries for consumption or warehouse withdrawals for consumption;
(v) The nature of, and justification for, the objection to the advance ruling set forth distinctly and specifically with respect to each aspect of the advance ruling for which administrative review is sought; and
(vi) Whether an oral discussion of the issues, as provided in § 181.95 of this part, is desired.
(2)
Issuance of review decision.
Customs will normally issue a written decision within 120 days of receipt of the request for administrative review submitted under this section. However, Customs will, upon a reasonable showing of business necessity, issue a written decision within 60 days of receipt of the request for administrative review. For purposes of this paragraph, the date of receipt of the request for administrative review shall be the date on which all information necessary to process the request, including any information provided after submission of the request in connection with a conference, is filed with Customs.
(b)
Judicial review.
Any person whose claims with regard to a request for administrative review of an advance ruling have been denied in whole or in part under this section may seek judicial review by filing a civil action in the United States Court of International Trade in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 2632 within 180 days after the date of mailing of notice of the denial.

# Subpart J—Review and Appeal of Adverse Marking Decisions
§ 181.111
Applicability.
This subpart sets forth the circumstances and procedures under which exporters and producers of merchandise imported into the United States may obtain information about, and administrative and judicial review of, an adverse marking decision, as provided for in Article 510 of the NAFTA. This subpart does not apply to the review of advance rulings issued under Article 509 of the NAFTA (see subpart I of this part) or to the review of determinations that a good is not an originating good under General Note 12, HTSUS, and the appendix to this part (see part 174 of this chapter).
§ 181.112
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart, the following words and phrases have the meanings indicated:
(a)
Adverse marking decision
means a decision made by the port director or Center director before January 19, 2017, or the Center director on or after January 19, 2017, which an exporter or producer of merchandise believes to be contrary to the provisions of Annex 311 of the NAFTA and which may be protested by the importer pursuant to § 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19
U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter. Notification of an adverse marking decision is given to an importer in the form of a CBP Form 4647, or its electronic equivalent, (Notice to Mark and/or Notice to Redeliver) and/or by assessing marking duties on improperly marked merchandise. Examples of adverse marking decisions include determinations by the port director or Center director before December 20, 2016, or the Center director on or after January 19, 2017: That an imported article is not a good of a NAFTA country, as determined under the Marking Rules, and that it therefore cannot be marked “Canada” or “Mexico”; that a good of a NAFTA country is not marked in a manner which is sufficiently permanent; and that a good of a NAFTA country does not qualify for an exception from marking specified in Annex 311 of the NAFTA. Adverse marking decisions do not include: Decisions issued in response to requests for advance rulings under subpart I of this part or for internal advice under part 177 of this chapter; decisions on protests under part 174 of this chapter; and determinations that an article does not qualify as an originating good under General Note 12, HTSUS, and the appendix to this part.
(b) An
exporter
of merchandise is an exporter located in Canada or Mexico who must maintain records in that country relating to the transaction to which the adverse marking decision relates. The records must be sufficient to enable Customs to evaluate the merits of the exporter's claim(s) regarding the adverse marking decision.
(c) A
producer
of merchandise is a person who grows, mines, harvests, fishes, traps, hunts, manufactures, processes or assembles such merchandise in Canada or Mexico.
[T.D. 95-68, 60 FR 46364, Sept. 6, 1995, as amended by CBP Dec. 15-14, 80 FR 61292, Oct. 13, 2015; CBP Dec. No. 16-26, 81 FR 93026, Dec. 20, 2016]

The request should be on letterhead paper in the form of a letter and clearly designated as a “Request for Basis of Adverse Marking Decision” and shall be signed by the exporter, producer or his authorized agent. The provisions of § 174.3 of this chapter shall apply for purposes of signature by a person other than the principal.

(4) The number and date of each entry involved in the request;
(5) A specific description of the merchandise which is the subject of the adverse marking decision; and
(6) A complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the adverse marking decision and the transaction to which it relates, including the date of the decision.
§ 181.114
Customs response to request.
(a)
Time for response.
The Center director will issue a written response to the requestor within 30 days of receipt of a request containing the information specified in § 181.113 of this part. If the request is incomplete, such that the transaction in question cannot be identified, the Center director will notify the requestor in writing within 30 days of receipt of the request regarding what information is needed.
(b)
Content.
The response by the Center director shall include the following:
(1) A statement concerning the basis for the adverse marking decision;
(2) A copy of the relevant Customs Form 4647 (Notice to Mark and/or Notice to Redeliver), if one was issued to the importer and is available. If the basis for the adverse marking decision is indicated on the Customs Form 4647, or its electronic equivalent, no statement under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is required;
(3) A statement as to whether the importer has filed a protest regarding the adverse marking decision and, if so, where the protest was filed and the protest number; and
(4) A statement concerning the exporter's or producer's right to either intervene in the importer's protest as provided in § 181.115 of this part or file a petition as provided in § 181.116 of this part.
[T.D. 95-68, 60 FR 46364, Sept. 6, 1995, as amended by CBP Dec. 15-14, 80 FR 61292, Oct. 13, 2015]
§ 181.115
Intervention in importer's protest.
(a)
Conditional right to intervene.
An exporter or producer of merchandise does not have an independent right to protest an adverse marking decision. However, if an importer protests the adverse marking decision in accordance with section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter, the exporter or producer of the merchandise which is the subject of the adverse marking decision may intervene in the importer's protest. Such intervention shall not affect any time limits applicable to the protest or delay action on the protest.
(b)
Form and filing of intervention.
In order to intervene in an importer's protest, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the exporter or producer of the merchandise shall file, in triplicate, a typewritten statement of intervention, in English, with the Center director. The statement should be on letterhead paper in the form of a letter and should be clearly designated “NAFTA Exporter or Producer Intervention in Protest”. The statement shall be signed by the exporter, producer or his authorized agent. The provisions of § 174.3 of this chapter shall apply for purposes of signature by a person other than the principal.
(c)
Content.
The NAFTA Exporter or Producer Intervention in Protest letter shall include the following:
(1) The name and address of the exporter or producer of the merchandise and the name and address of any authorized agent filing the request on behalf of such principal;
(2) In the case of a Canadian exporter or producer, the employer number assigned by Revenue Canada, Customs and Excise; in the case of a Mexican exporter or producer, the Federal taxpayer registry number (RFC); and the Customs identification number of an authorized agent filing the request on behalf of such principal;
(3) The number and date of each entry involved in the adverse marking decision;
(4) A specific description of the merchandise which is the subject of the adverse marking decision;
(5) A complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the adverse marking decision and the transaction to which it relates, including the date of the decision;
(6) A detailed statement of position regarding why the exporter or producer believes the adverse marking decision is contrary to the provision of Annex 311 of the NAFTA;
(7) A statement as to whether a Request for Basis of Adverse Marking Decision was filed under § 181.113 of this part, and if so, the date of such Request and of any Customs response thereto issued under § 181.114 of this part. Copies of the Request and the Customs response shall be submitted, if available;
(8) The number assigned to the importer's protest;
(9) A statement that the intervenor is the exporter or producer of the merchandise that was the subject of the adverse marking decision being protested by the importer and, if the intervenor is the exporter, a statement that it maintains sufficient records to enable Customs to evaluate the merits of its claim(s) regarding the adverse marking decision; and
(10) If the intervenor prefers that the principle of confidentiality set forth in § 181.121 of this part be applied to the
information submitted under this section, a statement to that effect. If no such statement is included in the letter, the intervention and information submitted in connection therewith shall be subject to the same treatment as that provided in the case of requests by all interested parties for consolidation of protests as set forth in § 174.15(b)(1) of this chapter.
(d)
Effect of Intervention.
The rights of the intervenor under this section are subordinate to the importer's protest rights. Accordingly, intervention by an exporter or producer of merchandise will not affect the procedures under part 174 of this chapter, and the importer's elections concerning accelerated disposition and application for further review of the protest will govern how the protest is handled and how the intervention is considered. If the importer withdraws or settles the protest, the exporter or producer has no right to continue the intervention action.
(e)
Action by Center director.
If final administrative action has already been taken with respect to the importer's protest at the time the intervention is filed, the Center director shall so advise the exporter or producer and, if the importer has filed a civil action in the Court of International Trade as a result of a denial of the protest, the Center director shall advise the exporter or producer of that filing and of the exporter's or producer's right to seek to intervene in such judicial proceeding. If final administrative action has not been taken on the protest, the Center director shall forward the intervention letter to the Customs office which has the importer's protest under review for consideration in connection with the protest.
(f)
Final disposition.
The intervenor shall be notified in writing of the final disposition of the protest. If the protest is denied in whole or in part, the intervenor shall be furnished a copy of the notice given to the importer under § 174.29.
[T.D. 95-68, 60 FR 46364, Sept. 6, 1995, as amended by CBP Dec. No. 16-26, 81 FR 93027, Dec. 20, 2016]
§ 181.116
Petition regarding adverse marking decision.
(a)
Right to petition.
If the importer does not protest an adverse marking decision in accordance with section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter, the exporter or producer of the merchandise which was the subject of the adverse marking decision may file a petition with Customs requesting reconsideration of the decision. The petition may not be filed until after the importer's time to protest the adverse marking decision has expired (see § 174.12(e) of this chapter for the time limits for filing protests). If the importer filed a protest upon which final administrative action has been taken, the exporter or producer may file a petition under this section, provided that the exporter or producer was not given notice of the pending protest pursuant to § 181.114 of this part. If the importer filed a protest on which final administrative action has not been taken and notice of the pending protest was not provided to the exporter or producer under § 181.114 of this part, a petition filed under this section shall be treated by the Center director as an intervention under § 181.115 of this part.
(b)
Form and filing of petition.
A petition under this section shall be typewritten, in English, and shall be filed, in triplicate, with the port of entry or filed electronically with CBP. The petition under this subpart should be on letterhead paper in the form of a letter, clearly designated as a “Petition for NAFTA Review of Adverse Marking Decision” and shall be signed by the exporter, producer or his authorized agent. The provisions of § 174.3 of this chapter shall apply for purposes of signature by a person other than the principal.
(c)
Content.
The Petition for NAFTA Review of Adverse Marking Decision letter shall contain all the information specified § 181.115 of this part, except for the protest number. It shall also include a statement that petitioner was not notified by Customs in writing of a pending protest.
(d)
Review of petition
—(1)
Review by Center director.
Within 60 days of the
date of receipt of the petition, the Center director shall determine if the petition is to be granted or denied, in whole or in part.

# PART II

# SECTION 4. ORIGINATING GOODS

# Identification of goods which are “wholly obtained or produced”
(1) A good originates in the territory of a NAFTA country where the good is
(a) a mineral good extracted in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries;
(b) a vegetable or other good harvested in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries;
(c) a live animal born and raised in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries;
(d) a good obtained from hunting, trapping or fishing in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries;
(e) fish, shellfish or other marine life taken from the sea by a vessel registered or recorded with a NAFTA country and flying its flag;
(f) a good produced on board a factory ship from a good referred to in paragraph (e), where the factory ship is registered or recorded with the same NAFTA country as the vessel that took that good and flies that country's flag;
(g) a good taken by a NAFTA country or a person of a NAFTA country from or beneath the seabed outside the territorial waters of that country, where a NAFTA country has the right to exploit that seabed;
(h) a good taken from outer space, where the good is obtained by a NAFTA country or a person of a NAFTA country and is not processed outside the territories of the NAFTA countries;
(i) waste and scrap derived from
(i) production in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries, or
(ii) used goods collected in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries, where those goods are fit only for the recovery of raw materials; or
(j) a good produced in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries exclusively from a good referred to in any of paragraphs (a) through (i), or from the derivatives of such a good, at any stage of production.

# Goods made from non-originating materials: change in tariff classification requirement; regional value-content requirement
(2) A good originates in the territory of a NAFTA country where
(a) each of the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergoes the applicable change in tariff classification as a result of production that occurs entirely in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries, where the applicable rule in Schedule I for the tariff provision under which the good is classified specifies only a change in tariff classification, and the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this appendix;
(b) each of the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergoes the applicable change in tariff classification as a result of production that occurs entirely in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries and the good satisfies the applicable regional value-content requirement, where the applicable rule in Schedule I for the tariff provision under which the good is classified specifies both a change in tariff classification and a regional value-content requirement, and the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this appendix; or
(c) the good satisfies the applicable regional value-content requirement, where the applicable rule in Schedule I for the tariff provision under which the good is classified specifies only a regional value-content requirement, and the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this appendix.

# Goods made exclusively from originating materials
(3) A good originates in the territory of a NAFTA country where the good is produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries exclusively from originating materials.

# Exceptions to the change in tariff classification requirement
(4) A good originates in the territory of a NAFTA country where
(a) except in the case of a good provided for in any of Chapters 61 through 63,
(i) the good is produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries,
(ii) one or more of the non-originating materials used in the production of the good do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification because the materials were imported together, whether or not with originating materials, into the territory of a NAFTA country as an unassembled or disassembled good, and were classified as an assembled good pursuant to Rule 2(a) of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System,
(iii) the regional value content of the good, calculated in accordance with section 6, is not less than 60 percent where
the transaction value method is used, or is not less than 50 percent where the net cost method is used, and
(iv) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this appendix, including any applicable, higher regional value-content requirement provided for in section 13 or Schedule I; or
(b) except in the case of a good provided for in any of Chapters 61 through 63,
(i) the good is produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries,
(ii) one or more of the non-originating materials used in the production of the good do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification because
(A) those materials are provided for under the Harmonized System as parts of the good, and
(B) the heading for the good provides for both the good and its parts and is not further subdivided into subheadings, or the subheading for the good provides for both the good and its parts,
(iii) the non-originating materials that do not undergo a change in tariff classification in the circumstances described in subparagraph (ii) and the good are not both classified as parts of goods under the heading or subheading referred to in subparagraph (ii)(B),
(iv) each of the non-originating materials that is used in the production of the good and is not referred to in subparagraph (iii) undergoes an applicable change in tariff classification or satisfies any other applicable requirement set out in Schedule I,
(v) the regional value content of the good, calculated in accordance with section 6, is not less than 60 percent where the transaction value method is used, or is not less than 50 percent where the net cost method is used, and
(vi) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this appendix, including any applicable, higher regional value-content requirement provided for in section 13 or Schedule I.

# Interpretation: heading or subheading which provides for both a good and parts of the good
(5) For purposes of subsection (4)(b),
(a) the determination of whether a heading or subheading provides for a good and its parts shall be made on the basis of the nomenclature of the heading or subheading and the relevant Section or Chapter Notes, in accordance with the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System; and
(b) where, in accordance with the Harmonized System, a heading includes parts of goods by application of a Section Note or Chapter Note of the Harmonized System and the subheadings under that heading do not include a subheading designated “Parts”, a subheading designated “Other” under that heading shall be considered to cover only the goods and parts of the goods that are themselves classified under that subheading.
(6) For purposes of subsection (2), where Schedule I sets out two or more alternative rules for the tariff provision under which a good is classified, if the good satisfies the requirements of one of those rules, it need not satisfy the requirements of another of the rules in order to qualify as an originating good.

# Special rule for certain goods
(7) A good originates in the territory of a NAFTA country if the good is referred to in Table 308.1.1 of Section B of Annex 308.1 to Chapter Three of the Agreement and is imported from the territory of a NAFTA country at a time when the NAFTA countries' most-favored-nation rate of duty for that good is in accordance with paragraph 1 of Section A of that Annex.

# Self-produced material may be a material for determining applicability of rules of origin
(8) For purposes of determining whether non-originating materials undergo an applicable change in tariff classification, a self-produced material may, at the choice of the producer of a good into which the self-produced material is incorporated, be considered as an originating material or non-originating material, as the case may be, used in the production of that good.
(9) The following example is an “Example” as referred to in section 2(4).
Example:
section 4(8), Self-produced Materials as Materials for Purposes of Determining Whether Non-originating Materials Undergo an Applicable Change in Tariff Classification
Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A. In the production process, Producer A uses originating Material X and non-originating Material Y to produce Material Z. Material Z is a self-produced material that will be used to produce Good A.
The rule set out in Schedule I for the heading under which Good A is classified specifies a change in tariff classification from any other heading. In this case, both Good A and the non-originating Material Y are of the same heading. However, the self-produced Material Z is of a heading different than that of Good A.
For purposes of determining whether the non-originating materials that are used in the production of Good A undergo the applicable change in tariff classification, Producer A has the option to consider the self-produced Material Z as the material that
must undergo a change in tariff classification. As Material Z is of a heading different than that of Good A, Material Z satisfies the applicable change in tariff classification and Good A would qualify as an originating good.

# SECTION 5. DE MINIMIS

# De minimis rule for non-originating materials that do not undergo subject to authorization, a required tariff change
(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (4), a good shall be considered to originate in the territory of a NAFTA country where the value of all non-originating materials that are used in the production of the good and that do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification as a result of production occurring entirely in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries is not more than seven percent
(a) of the transaction value of the good determined in accordance with Schedule II with respect to the transaction in which the producer of the good sold the good, adjusted to an F.O.B. basis, or
(b) of the total cost of the good, where there is no transaction value for the good under section 2(1) of Schedule III or the transaction value of the good is unacceptable under section 2(2) of that Schedule,
provided that,
(c) if, under the rule in which the applicable change in tariff classification is specified, the good is also subject to a regional value-content requirement, the value of those non-originating materials shall be taken into account in calculating the regional value content of the good in accordance with the method set out for that good, and
(d) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this appendix.
(2) For purposes of subsection (1), where
(a) Schedule I sets out two or more alternative rules for the tariff provision under which the good is classified, and
(b) the good, in accordance with subsection (1), is considered to originate under one of those rules,
the good is not required to satisfy the requirements specified in any alternative rule referred to in paragraph (a).
(3) For purposes of subsection (1), in the case of a good that is provided for in heading 2402, the percentage shall be nine percent instead of seven percent.

# Exceptions
(4) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to
(a) a non-originating material provided for in Chapter 4 or tariff items 1901.90.31, 1901.90.41 and 1901.90.81 (dairy preparations containing over 10 percent by weight of milk solids) that is used in the production of a good provided for in Chapter 4;
(b) a non-originating material provided for in Chapter 4 or tariff items 1901.90.31, 1901.90.41 and 1901.90.81 (dairy preparations containing over 10 percent by weight of milk solids) that is used in the production of a good provided for in any of tariff items 1901.10.10 (infant preparations containing over 10 percent by weight of milk solids), 1901.20.10 (mixes and doughs, containing over 25 percent by weight of butterfat, not put up for retail sale), 1901.90.31, 1901.90.41 and 1901.90.81 (dairy preparations containing over 10 percent by weight of milk solids), heading 2105 and tariff items 2106.90.05, 2106.90.13, 2106.90.41, 2106.90.51 and 2106.90.61 (preparations containing over 10 percent by weight of milk solids), 2202.90.10 and 2202.90.20 (beverages containing milk) and 2309.90.31 (animal feeds containing over 10 percent by weight of milk solids);

(f) a non-originating material provided for in heading 1701 that is used in the production of a good provided for in any of headings 1701 through 1703;
(g) a non-originating material provided for in Chapter 17 or heading 1805 that is used in the production of a good provided for in subheading 1806.10;
(h) a non-originating material provided for in any of headings 2203 through 2208 that is used in the production of a good provided for in any of headings 2207 through 2208;
(i) a non-originating material that is used in the production of any non-portable gas stoves or ranges of subheading 7321.11 or 7321.19, subheadings 8415.10, 8415.20 through 8415.83, 8418.10 through 8418.21, household type refrigerators, other than electrical absorption type of subheading 8418.29, subheadings 8418.30 through 8418.40, 8421.12, 8422.11, 8450.11 through 8450.20 and 8451.21 through 8451.29 and tariff items 8479.89.55 (trash compactors) and 8516.60.40 (electric stoves or ranges);
(j) a printed circuit assembly that is a non-originating material used in the production of a good, where the applicable change
in tariff classification for the good places restrictions on the use of that non-originating material, such as by prohibiting, or limiting the quantity of, that non-originating material;
(k) a non-originating material that is a single juice ingredient provided for in heading 2009 that is used in the production of a good provided for in any of subheading 2009.90 and tariff items 2106.90.18 (concentrated mixtures of fruit or vegetable juice, fortified with minerals or vitamins) and 2202.90.37 (mixtures of fruit or vegetable juices, fortified with minerals or vitamins);

(m) a non-originating material that is used in the production of a good provided for in any of Chapters 50 through 63.

# De minimis rule for regional value-content requirement
(5) A good that is subject to a regional value-content requirement shall be considered to originate in the territory of a NAFTA country and shall not be required to satisfy that requirement where
(a) the value of all non-originating materials used in the production of the good is not more than seven percent
(i) of the transaction value of the good determined in accordance with Schedule II with respect to the transaction in which the producer of the good sold the good, adjusted to an F.O.B. basis, or
(ii) of the total cost of the good, where there is no transaction value for the good under section 2(1) of Schedule III or the transaction value of the good is unacceptable under section 2(2) of that Schedule; and
(b) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this appendix.

# De minimis rule for textile goods
(6) A good provided for in any of Chapters 50 through 63, that does not originate in the territory of a NAFTA country because certain fibers or yarns that are used in the production of the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification as a result of production occurring entirely in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries, shall be considered to originate in the territory of a NAFTA country if
(a) the total weight of all those fibers or yarns is not more than seven percent of the total weight of that component; and
(b) the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this appendix.
(7) For purposes of subsection (6),
(a) the component of a good that determines the tariff classification of that good shall be identified in accordance with the first of the following General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System under which the identification can be determined, namely, Rule 3(b), Rule 3(c) and Rule 4; and
(b) where the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good is a blend of two or more yarns or fibers, all yarns and fibers used in the production of the component shall be taken into account in determining the weight of fibers and yarns in that component.
(8) For purposes of subsections (1) and (5), the value of non-originating materials shall be determined in accordance with sections 7(1) through (4).

# Calculation of “total cost” for de minimis rules: choice of methods
(9) For purposes of subsection (1)(b) and subsection (5)(a)(ii), the total cost of a good shall be, at the choice of the producer of the good,
(a) the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by the producer that can be reasonably allocated to that good in accordance with Schedule VII; or
(b) the aggregate of each cost that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to that good that can be reasonably allocated to that good in accordance with Schedule VII.

# Calculation of total cost; application of Schedules IX and X for determining value of non-originating materials
(10) Total cost under subsection (9) consists of the costs referred to in section 2(6), and is calculated in accordance with that subsection and section 2(7).
(11) For purposes of determining the value under subsection (1) of non-originating materials that do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification, where Schedule X is not being used to determine the value of those non-originating materials,
(a) if the value of those non-originating materials is being determined as a percentage of the transaction value of the good and the producer chooses under section 6(10) that one of the methods set out in Schedule IX be used to determine the value of those non-originating materials for purposes of calculating the regional value content of the good, the value of those non-originating materials shall be determined in accordance with that method;
(b) if
(i) the value of those non-originating materials is being determined as a percentage of the total cost of the good,
(ii) under the rule in which the applicable change in tariff classification is specified, the good is also subject to a regional value-content requirement and subsection (5)(a) does not apply with respect to that good,
(iii) the regional value content of the good is calculated on the basis of the net cost method, and
(iv) the producer chooses under section 6(15), 11(1), (3) or (6), 12(1) or 13(4) that the regional value content of the good be calculated over a period,
the value of those non-originating materials shall be the sum of the values of non-originating materials determined in accordance with that choice, divided by the number of units of the goods with respect to which the choice is made;
(c) if
(i) the value of those non-originating materials is being determined as a percentage of the total cost of the good,
(ii) under the rule in which the applicable change in tariff classification is specified, the good is not also subject to a regional value-content requirement or subsection (5)(a) applies with respect to that good, and
(iii) the producer chooses under section 2(7)(b) that, for purposes of section 5(9), the total cost of the good be calculated over a period,
the value of those non-originating materials shall be the sum of the values of non-originating materials divided by the number of units produced during that period; and
(d) in any other case, the value of those non-originating materials may, at the choice of the producer, be determined in accordance with one of the methods set out in Schedule IX.
(12) For purposes of subsection (5), the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of the good may, at the choice of the producer, be determined in accordance with one of the methods set out in Schedule IX.

# Examples illustrating de minimis rules
(13) Each of the following examples is an “Example” as referred to in section 2(4).
Example 1:
section 5(1)
Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, uses originating materials and non-originating materials in the production of copper anodes provided for in heading 7402. The rule set out in Schedule I for heading 7402 specifies a change in tariff classification from any other chapter. There is no applicable regional value-content requirement for this heading. Therefore, in order for the copper anode to qualify as an originating good under the rule set out in Schedule I, Producer A may not use in the production of the copper anode any non-originating material provided for in Chapter 74.
All of the materials used in the production of the copper anode are originating materials, with the exception of a small amount of copper scrap provided for in heading 7404, that is in the same chapter as the copper anode. Under section 5(1), if the value of the non-originating copper scrap does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the copper anode or the total cost of the copper anode, whichever is applicable, the copper anode would be considered an originating good.
Example 2:
section 5(2)
Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, uses originating materials and non-originating materials in the production of ceiling fans provided for in subheading 8414.51. There are two alternative rules set out in Schedule I for subheading 8414.51, one of which specifies a change in tariff classification from any other heading. The other rule specifies both a change in tariff classification from the subheading under which parts of the ceiling fans are classified and a regional value-content requirement. Therefore, in order for the ceiling fan to qualify as an originating good under the first of the alternative rules, all of the materials that are classified under the subheading for parts of ceiling fans and used in the production of the completed ceiling fan must be originating materials.
In this case, all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the ceiling fan satisfy the change in tariff classification set out in the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification from any other heading, with the exception of one non-originating material that is classified under the subheading for parts of ceiling fans. Under section 5(1), if the value of the non-originating material that does not satisfy the change in tariff classification specified in the first rule does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the ceiling fan or the total cost of the ceiling fan, whichever is applicable, the ceiling fan would be considered an originating good. Therefore, under section 5(2), the ceiling fan would not be required to satisfy the alternative rule that specifies both a change in tariff classification and a regional value-content requirement.
Example 3:
section 5(2)
Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, uses originating materials and non-originating materials in the production of plastic bags provided for in subheading 3923.29. The rule set out in Schedule I for subheading 3923.29 specifies both a change in tariff classification from any other heading, except from subheadings 3920.20 or 3920.71, under which certain plastic materials are classified, and a regional value-content requirement. Therefore, with respect to that part of
the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification, in order for the plastic bag to qualify as an originating good, any plastic materials that are classified under subheading 3920.20 or 3920.71 and that are used in the production of the plastic bag must be originating materials.
In this case, all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the plastic bag satisfy the specified change in tariff classification, with the exception of a small amount of plastic materials classified under subheading 3920.71. Section 5(1) provides that the plastic bag can be considered an originating good if the value of the non-originating plastic materials that do not satisfy the specified change in tariff classification does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the plastic bag or the total cost of the plastic bag, whichever is applicable. In this case, the value of those non-originating materials that do not satisfy the specified change in tariff classification does not exceed the seven percent limit.
However, the rule set out in Schedule I for subheading 3923.29 specifies both a change in tariff classification and a regional value-content requirement. Therefore, under section 5(1)(c), in order to be considered an originating good, the plastic bag must also, except as otherwise provided in section 5(5), satisfy the regional value-content requirement specified in that rule. As provided in section 5(1)(c), the value of the non-originating materials that do not satisfy the specified change in tariff classification, together with the value of all other non-originating materials used in the production of the plastic bag, will be taken into account in calculating the regional value content of the plastic bag.
Example 4:
section 5(5)
Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, primarily uses originating materials in the production of shoes provided for in heading 6405. The rule set out in Schedule I for heading 6405 specifies both a change in tariff classification from any subheading other than subheadings 6401.10 through 6406.10 and a regional value-content requirement.
With the exception of a small amount of materials provided for in Chapter 39, all of the materials used in the production of the shoes are originating materials.
Under section 5(5), if the value of all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the shoes does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the shoes or the total cost of the shoes, whichever is applicable, the shoes are not required to satisfy the regional value-content requirement specified in the rule set out in Schedule I in order to be considered originating goods.
Example 5:
section 5(5)
Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces barbers' chairs provided for in subheading 9402.10. The rule set out in Schedule I for goods provided for in heading 9402 specifies a change in tariff classification from any other chapter. All of the materials used in the production of these chairs are originating materials, with the exception of a small quantity of non-originating materials that are classified as parts of barbers' chairs. These parts undergo no change in tariff classification because subheading 9402.10 provides for both barbers' chairs and their parts.
Although Producer A's barbers' chairs do not qualify as originating goods under the rule set out in Schedule I, section 4(4)(b) provides, among other things, that, where there is no change in tariff classification from the non-originating materials to the goods because the subheading under which the goods are classified provides for both the goods and their parts, the goods shall qualify as originating goods if they satisfy a specified regional value-content requirement.
However, under section 5(5), if the value of the non-originating materials does not exceed seven percent of the transaction value of the barbers' chairs or the total cost of the barbers' chairs, whichever is applicable, the barbers' chairs will be considered originating goods and are not required to satisfy the regional value-content requirement set out in section 4(4)(b)(v).
Example 6:
sections 5 (6) and (7)
Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces women's dresses provided for in subheading 6204.41 from fine wool fabric of heading 5112. This fine wool fabric, also produced by Producer A, is the component of the dress that determines its tariff classification under subheading 6204.41.
The rule set out in Schedule I for subheading 6204.41, under which the dress is classified, specifies both a change in tariff classification from any other chapter, except from those headings and chapters under which certain yarns and fabrics, including combed wool yarn and wool fabric, are classified, and a requirement that the good be cut and sewn or otherwise assembled in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries.
Therefore, with respect to that part of the rule that specifies a change in tariff classification, in order for the dress to qualify as an originating good, the combed wool yarn and the fine wool fabric made therefrom that are used by Producer A in the production of the dress must be originating materials.
At one point Producer A uses a small quantity of non-originating combed wool yarn in the production of the fine wool fabric. Under section 5(6), if the total weight of the non-originating combed wool yarn does not exceed seven percent of the total weight of all the yarn used in the production of the component of the dress that determines its tariff classification, that is, the wool fabric, the dress would be considered an originating good.

# PART III

# SECTION 6. REGIONAL VALUE CONTENT
(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), the regional value content of a good shall be calculated, at the choice of the exporter or producer of the good, on the basis of either the transaction value method or the net cost method.

# Transaction Value Method
(2) The transaction value method for calculating the regional value content of a good is as follows:
ER06SE95.000
where
RVC is the regional value content of the good, expressed as a percentage;
TV is the transaction value of the good, determined in accordance with Schedule II with respect to the transaction in which the producer of the good sold the good, adjusted to an F.O.B. basis; and
VNM is the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of the good, determined in accordance with section 7.

# Net Cost Method
(3) The net cost method for calculating the regional value content of a good is as follows:
ER06SE95.001
where
RVC is the regional value content of the good, expressed as a percentage;
NC is the net cost of the good, calculated in accordance with subsection (11); and
VNM is the value of non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of the good, determined, except as otherwise provided in sections 9 and 10, in accordance with section 7.

# VNM does not include value of non-originating materials used in originating material
(4) Except as otherwise provided in section 9 and section 10(1)(d), for purposes of calculating the regional value content of a good under subsection (2) or (3), the value of non-originating materials used by a producer in the production of the good shall not include
(a) the value of any non-originating materials used by another producer in the production of originating materials that are subsequently acquired and used by the producer of the good in the production of that good; or
(b) the value of any non-originating materials used by the producer in the production of a self-produced material that is an originating material and is designated as an intermediate material.
(5) For purposes of subsection (4),
(a) in the case of any self-produced material that is not designated as an intermediate material, only the value of any non-originating materials used in the production of the self-produced material shall be included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the good; and
(b) where a self-produced material that is designated as an intermediate material and is an originating material is used by the producer of the good with non-originating materials (whether or not those non-originating materials are produced by that producer) in the production of the good, the value of those non-originating materials shall be included in the value of non-originating materials.

# Net Cost Method required in certain circumstances
(6) The regional value content of a good shall be calculated only on the basis of the net cost method where
(a) there is no transaction value for the good under section 2(1) of Schedule III;
(b) the transaction value of the good is unacceptable under section 2(2) of Schedule III;
(c) the good is sold by the producer to a related person and the volume, by units of quantity, of sales by that producer of identical goods or similar goods, or any combination thereof, to related persons during the six month period immediately preceding the month in which the goods are sold exceeds 85 percent of the producer's total sales to all persons, whether or not related and regardless of location, after “the producer's total sales”of identical goods or similar goods, or any combination thereof, during that period;
(d) the good is
(i) a motor vehicle provided for in any of headings 8701 and 8702, subheadings 8703.21 through 8703.90 and headings 8704, 8705 and 8706,
(ii) a good provided for in a tariff provision listed in Schedule IV or an automotive component assembly, automotive component, sub-component or listed material, and is for use in a motor vehicle referred to in subparagraph (i), either as original equipment or as an after-market part,
(iii) a good provided for in any of subheadings 6401.10 through 6406.10, or
(iv) a good provided for in heading 8469;
(e) the exporter or producer chooses to accumulate with respect to the good in accordance with section 14; or
(f) the good is an intermediate material and is subject to a regional value-content requirement.

# Option to change from TVM to NCM for calculation of regional value content
(7) If the exporter or producer of a good calculates the regional value content of the good on the basis of the transaction value method and the customs administration of a NAFTA country subsequently notifies that exporter or producer in writing, during the course of a verification of origin, that
(a) the transaction value of the good, as determined by the exporter or producer, is required to be adjusted under section 4 of Schedule II or is unacceptable under section 2(2) of Schedule III, there is no transaction value for the good under section 2(1) of Schedule III or the transaction value method may not be used because of the application of subsection (6)(c), or
(b) the value of any material used in the production of the good, as determined by the exporter or producer, is required to be adjusted under section 5 of Schedule VIII or is unacceptable under section 2(3) of Schedule VIII, or there is no transaction value for the material under section 2(2) of Schedule VIII or the transaction value method may not be used to calculate the regional value content of the material because of the application of subsection (6)(c),
the exporter or producer may choose that the regional value content of the good be calculated on the basis of the net cost method, in which case the calculation must be made within 60 days after the producer receives the notification, or such longer period as that customs administration specifies.

# Change from NCM to TVM not permitted
(8) If the exporter or producer of a good chooses that the regional value content of the good be calculated on the basis of the net cost method and the customs administration of a NAFTA country subsequently notifies that exporter or producer in writing, during the course of a verification of origin, that the good does not satisfy the applicable regional value-content requirement, the exporter or producer of the good may not recalculate the regional value content on the basis of the transaction value method.
(9) Nothing in subsection (7) shall be construed as preventing any review and appeal under Article 510 of the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA country, of an adjustment to or a rejection of
(a) the transaction value of the good; or
(b) the value of any material used in the production of the good.

# Application of Schedule IX for determining value of “identical” non-originating materials under TVM
(10) For purposes of the transaction value method, where non-originating materials that are the same as one another in all respects, including physical characteristics, quality and reputation but excluding minor differences in appearance, are used in the production of a good, the value of those non-originating materials may, at the choice of the producer of the good, be determined in accordance with one of the methods set out in Schedule IX.

# Options for calculating the net cost of a good
(11) For purposes of subsection (3), the net cost of a good may be calculated, at the choice of the producer of the good, by
(a) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, subtracting any excluded costs that are included in that total cost, and reasonably allocating, in accordance with Schedule VII, the remainder to the good;
(b) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that producer, reasonably allocating, in accordance with Schedule VII, that total cost to the good, and subtracting any excluded costs that are included in the amount allocated to that good; or
(c) reasonably allocating, in accordance with Schedule VII, each cost that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the good so that the aggregate of those costs does not include any excluded costs.

# Calculation of total cost
(12) Total cost under subsection (11) consists of the costs referred to in section 2(6), and is calculated in accordance with that subsection.

# Calculation of net cost; excluded costs
(13) For purposes of calculating net cost under subsection (11),
(a) excluded costs shall be the excluded costs that are recorded on the books of the producer of the good;
(b) excluded costs that are included in the value of a material that is used in the production of the good shall not be subtracted from or otherwise excluded from the total cost; and
(c) excluded costs do not include any amount paid for research and development services performed in the territory of a NAFTA country.

# Non-allowable interest; determination under Schedule XI
(14) For purposes of calculating non-allowable interest costs, the determination of
whether interest costs incurred by a producer are more than 700 basis points above the yield on debt obligations of comparable maturities issued by the federal government of the country in which the producer is located shall be made in accordance with Schedule XI.

# Use of “averaging” over a period to calculate RVC under NCM; period cannot be changed
(15) For purposes of the net cost method, the regional value content of the good, other than a good with respect to which a choice to average may be made under section 11(1), (3) or (6), 12(1) or 13(4), may be calculated, where the producer chooses to do so, by
(a) calculating the sum of the net costs incurred and the sum of the values of non-originating materials used by the producer of the good with respect to the good and identical goods or similar goods, or any combination thereof, produced in a single plant by the producer over
(i) a month,
(ii) any consecutive three month or six month period that falls within and is evenly divisible into the number of months of the producer's fiscal year remaining at the beginning of that period, or
(iii) the producer's fiscal year; and
(b) using the sums referred to in paragraph (a) as the net cost and the value of non-originating materials, respectively.
(16) The calculation made under subsection (15) shall apply with respect to all units of the good produced during the period chosen by the producer under subsection (15)(a).
(17) A choice made under subsection (15) may not be rescinded or modified with respect to the goods or the period with respect to which the choice is made.

# Choice of averaging period cannot be changed for remainder of fiscal year
(18) Where a producer chooses a one, three or six month period under subsection (15) with respect to goods, the producer shall be considered to have chosen under that subsection a period or periods of the same duration for the remainder of the producer's fiscal year with respect to those goods.

# Choice of net cost method cannot be changed for remainder of the fiscal year
(19) Where the net cost method is required to be used or has been chosen and a choice has been made under subsection (15), the regional value content of the good shall be calculated on the basis of the net cost method over the period chosen under that subsection and for the remainder of the producer's fiscal year.

# Obligation to perform self-analysis and give notification of changed circumstance if RVC calculated on basis of estimated costs
(20) Except as otherwise provided in sections 11(10), 12(11) and 13(10), where the producer of a good has calculated the regional value content of the good under the net cost method on the basis of estimated costs, including standard costs, budgeted forecasts or other similar estimating procedures, before or during the period chosen in subsection (15)(a), the producer shall conduct an analysis at the end of the producer's fiscal year of the actual costs incurred over the period with respect to the production of the good and, if the good does not satisfy the regional value-content requirement on the basis of the actual costs during that period, immediately inform any person to whom the producer has provided a Certificate of Origin for the good, or a written statement that the good is an originating good, that the good is a non-originating good.

# Option to treat any material as non-originating
(21) For purposes of calculating the regional value content of a good, the producer of that good may choose to treat any material used in the production of that good as a non-originating material.

# Examples of Calculation of RVC under TVM and NCM
(22) Each of the following examples is an “Example” as referred to in section 2(4).
Example 1:
example of point of direct shipment (with respect to adjusted to an F.O.B. basis)
A producer has only one factory, at which the producer manufactures finished office chairs. Because the factory is located close to transportation facilities, all units of the finished good are stored in a factory warehouse 200 meters from the end of the production line. Goods are shipped worldwide from this warehouse. The point of direct shipment is the warehouse.
Example 2:
examples of point of direct shipment (with respect to adjusted to an F.O.B. basis)
A producer has six factories, all located within the territory of one of the NAFTA countries, at which the producer produces garden tools of various types. These tools are shipped worldwide, and orders usually consist of bulk orders of various types of tools. Because different tools are manufactured at different factories, the producer decided to consolidate storage and shipping facilities and ships all finished products to a large warehouse located near the seaport, from which all orders are shipped. The distance from the factories to the warehouse varies from 3 km to 130 km. The point of direct
shipment for each of the goods is the warehouse.
Example 3:
examples of point of direct shipment (with respect to adjusted to an F.O.B. basis)
A producer has only one factory, located near the center of one of the NAFTA countries, at which the producer manufactures finished office chairs. The office chairs are shipped from that factory to three warehouses leased by the producer, one on the west coast, one near the factory and one on the east coast. The office chairs are shipped to buyers from these warehouses, the shipping location depending on the shipping distance from the buyer. Buyers closest to the west coast warehouse are normally supplied by the west coast warehouse, buyers closest to the east coast are normally supplied by the warehouse located on the east coast and buyers closest to the warehouse near the factory are normally supplied by that warehouse. In this case, the point of direct shipment is the location of the warehouse from which the office chairs are normally shipped to customers in the location in which the buyer is located.
Example 4:
section 6(3), net cost method
A producer located in NAFTA country A sells Good A that is subject to a regional value-content requirement to a buyer located in NAFTA country B. The producer of Good A chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method. All applicable requirements of this appendix, other than the regional value-content requirement, have been met. The applicable regional value-content requirement is 50 percent.
In order to calculate the regional value-content of Good A, the producer first calculates the net cost of Good A. Under section 6(11)(a), the net cost is the total cost of Good A (the aggregate of the product costs, period costs and other costs) per unit, minus the excluded costs (the aggregate of the sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs and non-allowable interest costs) per unit. The producer uses the following figures to calculate the net cost:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
$30.00
Value of non-originating materials
40.00
Other product costs
20.00
Period costs
10.00
Other costs
0.00
Total cost of Good A, per unit
$100.00
Excluded costs:
Sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service cost
$5.00
Royalties
2.50
Shipping and packing costs
3.00
Non-allowable interest costs
1.50
Total excluded costs
$12.00
The net cost is the total cost of Good A, per unit, minus the excluded costs.
Total cost of Good A, per unit:
$100.00
Excluded costs
−12.00
Net cost of Good A, per unit
$88.00
The value for net cost ($88) and the value of non-originating materials ($40) are needed in order to calculate the regional value content. The producer calculates the regional value content of Good A under the net cost method in the following manner:
ER06SE95.002
Therefore, under the net cost method, Good A qualifies as an originating good, with a regional value-content of 54.5 percent.
Example 5:
section 6(6)(c), net cost method required for certain sales to related persons
On January 15, 1994, a producer located in NAFTA country A sells 1,000 units of Good A to a related person, located in NAFTA country B. During the six month period beginning on July 1, 1993 and ending on December 31, 1993, the producer sold 90,000 units of identical goods and similar goods to related persons from various countries, including that buyer. The producer's total sales of those identical goods and similar goods to all persons from all countries during that six month period were 100,000 units.
The total quantity of identical goods and similar goods sold by the producer to related persons during that six month period was 90 percent of the producer's total sales of those identical goods and similar goods to all persons. Under section 6(6)(c), the producer must use the net cost method to calculate the regional value content of Good A sold in January 1994, because the 85 percent limit was exceeded.
Example 6:
section 6(11)(a)
A producer in a NAFTA country produces Good A and Good B during the producer's fiscal year.
The producer uses the following figures, which are recorded on the producer's books and represent all of the costs incurred with respect to both Good A and Good B, to calculate the net cost of those goods:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
$2,000
Value of non-originating materials
1,000
Other product costs
2,400
Period costs: (including $1,200 in excluded costs)
3,200
Other costs
400
Total cost of Good A and Good B
$9,000
The net cost is the total cost of Good A and Good B, minus the excluded costs incurred with respect to those goods.
Total cost of Good A and Good B
$9,000
Excluded costs
−1,200
Net cost of Good A and Good B
$7,800
The net cost must then be reasonably allocated, in accordance with Schedule VII, to Good A and Good B.
Example 7:
section 6(11)(b)
A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good A and Good B during the producer's fiscal year. In order to calculate the regional value content of Good A and Good B, the producer uses the following figures that are recorded on the producer's books and incurred with respect to those goods:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
$2,000
Value of non-originating materials
1,000
Other product costs
2,400
Period costs: (including $1,200 in excluded costs)
3,200
Other costs
400
Total cost of Good A and Good B
$9,000
Under section 6(11)(b), the total cost of Good A and Good B is then reasonably allocated, in accordance with Schedule VII, to those goods. The costs are allocated in the following manner:
Allocated to
Good A
Allocated to
Good B
Total cost ($9,000 for both Good A and Good B)
$5,220
$3,780
The excluded costs ($1,200) that are included in total cost allocated to Good A and Good B, in accordance with Schedule VII, are subtracted from that amount.
Excluded Cost Allocated to Good A
Excluded Cost Allocated to Good B
Total excluded costs:
Sales promotion, marketing and after-sale service costs
500
290
210
Royalties
200
116
84
Shipping and packing costs
500
290
210
Net cost (total cost minus excluded costs)
$4,524
$3,276
The net cost of Good A is thus $4,524, and the net cost of Good B is $3,276.
Example 8:
section 6(11)(c)
A Producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good C and Good D. The following costs are recorded on the producer's books for the months of January, February and March, and each cost that forms part of the total cost are reasonably allocated, in accordance with Schedule VII, to Good C and Good D.
Total cost: Good C and Good D (in thousands of dollars)
Allocated to Good C (in thousands of dollars)
Allocated to Good D (in thousands of dollars)

Example 9:
section 6(12)
Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. The producer chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method. Producer A buys Material X from Producer B, located in a NAFTA country. Material X is a non-originating material and is used in the production of Good A. Producer A provides Producer B, at no charge, with tools to be used in the production of Material X. The cost of the tools that is recorded on the books of Producer A has been expensed in the current year. Pursuant to section 5(1)(b)(ii) of Schedule VIII, the value of the tools is included in the value of Material X. Therefore, the cost of the tools that is recorded on the books of Producer A and that has been expensed in the current year cannot be included as a separate cost in the net cost of Good A because it has already been included in the value of Material X.
Example 10:
section 6(12)
Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. The producer chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method and averages the calculation over the producer's fiscal year under section 6(15). Producer A determines that during that fiscal year Producer A incurred a gain on foreign currency conversion of $10,000 and a loss on foreign currency conversion of $8,000, resulting in a net gain of $2,000. Producer A also determines that $7,000 of the gain on foreign currency conversion and $6,000 of the loss on foreign currency conversion is related to the purchase of non-originating materials used in the production of Good A, and $3,000 of the gain on foreign currency conversion and $2,000 of the loss on foreign currency conversion is not related to the production of Good A. The producer determines that the total cost of Good A is $45,000 before deducting the $1,000 net gain on foreign currency conversion related to the production of Good A. The total cost of Good A is therefore $44,000. That $1,000 net gain is not included in the value of non-originating materials under section 7(1).
Example 11:
section 6(12)
Given the same facts as in example 10, except that Producer A determines that $6,000 of the gain on foreign currency conversion and $7,000 of the loss on foreign currency conversion is related to the purchase of non-originating materials used in the production of Good A. The total cost of Good A is $45,000, which includes the $1,000 net loss on foreign currency conversion related to the production of Good A. That $1,000 net loss is
not included in the value of non-originating materials under section 7(1).

# Calculation of total cost
(7) Total cost under subsection (6) consists of the costs referred to in section 2(6), and is calculated in accordance with that section and section 2(7).

# Rescission of a designation during course of verification; option to designate another intermediate material
(8) Where a producer of a good designates a self-produced material as an intermediate material under subsection (4) and the customs administration of a NAFTA country into which the good is imported determines during a verification of origin of the good that the intermediate material is a non-originating material and notifies the producer of this in writing before the written determination of whether the good qualifies as an originating good, the producer may rescind the designation, and the regional value content of the good shall be calculated as though the self-produced material were not so designated.
(9) A producer of a good who rescinds a designation under subsection (8)
(a) shall retain any rights of review and appeal under Article 510 of the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA country, with respect to the determination of the origin of the intermediate material as though the producer did not rescind the designation; and
(b) may, not later than 30 days after the customs administration referred to in subsection (8) notifies the producer in writing that the self-produced material referred to in paragraph (a) is a non-originating material, designate as an intermediate material another self-produced material that is incorporated into the good, subject to the proviso set out in subsection (4).
(10) Where a producer of a good designates another self-produced material as an intermediate material under subsection (9)(b) and the customs administration referred to in subsection (8) determines during the verification of origin of the good that that self-produced material is a non-originating material,
(a) the producer may rescind the designation, and the regional value content of the good shall be calculated as though the self-produced material were not so designated;
(b) the producer shall retain any rights of review and appeal under Article 510 of the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA country, with respect to the determination of the origin of the intermediate material as though the producer did not rescind the designation; and
(c) the producer may not designate another self-produced material that is incorporated into the good as an intermediate material.

# Indirect Materials; deemed originating; value as recorded on books of producer
(11) For purposes of determining whether a good is an originating good, an indirect material that is used in the production of the good
(a) shall be considered to be an originating material, regardless of where that indirect material is produced; and
(b) if the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement, for purposes of calculating the net cost under the net cost method, the value of the indirect material shall be the costs of that material that are recorded on the books of the producer of the good.

# Packaging Materials and Containers; origin disregarded for tariff change rules
(12) Packaging materials and containers, if classified under the Harmonized System with the good that is packaged therein, shall be disregarded for purposes of
(a) determining whether all of the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification; and
(b) determining under section 5(1) the value of non-originating materials that do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification.

# Actual originating status considered for RVC requirement; valuation of packaging
(13) Where packaging materials and containers are classified under the Harmonized System with the good that is packaged therein and that good is subject to a regional value-content requirement, the value of those packaging materials and containers shall be taken into account as originating materials or non-originating materials, as the case may be, for purposes of calculating the regional value content of the good.
(14) For purposes of subsection (13), where packaging materials and containers are self-produced materials, the producer may choose to designate those materials as intermediate materials under subsection (4).

# Packing materials and containers; disregarded for tariff change rule and for RVC requirement; value as recorded on books
(15) For purposes of determining whether a good is an originating good, packing materials and containers in which the good is packed
(a) shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether
(i) the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification, and
(ii) the good satisfies a regional value-content requirement; and
(b) if the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement, the value of the packing materials and containers shall be the costs thereof that are recorded on the books of the producer of the good.

# Fungible materials; fungible commingled goods; inventory management methods for determining whether originating
(16) Subject to subsection (16.1), for purposes of determining whether a good is an originating good,
(a) where originating materials and non-originating materials that are fungible materials
(i) are withdrawn from an inventory in one location and used in the production of the good, or
(ii) are withdrawn from inventories in more than one location in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries and used in the production of the good at the same production facility,
the determination of whether the materials are originating materials may be made on the basis of any of the applicable inventory management methods set out in Schedule X; and
(b) where originating goods and non-originating goods that are fungible goods are physically combined or mixed in inventory and prior to exportation do not undergo production or any other operation in the territory of the NAFTA country in which they were physically combined or mixed in inventory, other than unloading, reloading or any other operation necessary to preserve the goods in good condition or to transport the goods for exportation to the territory of another NAFTA country, the determination of whether the good is an originating good may be made on the basis of any of the applicable inventory management methods set out in Schedule X.
(16.1) Where fungible materials referred to in subsection (16)(a) and fungible goods referred to in subsection (16)(b) are withdrawn from the same inventory, the inventory management method used for the materials must be the same as the inventory management method used for goods, and where the averaging method is used, the respective averaging periods for fungible materials and fungible goods are to be used.
(16.2) A choice of inventory management methods under subsection (16) shall be considered to have been made when the customs administration of the NAFTA country into which the good is imported is informed in writing of the choice during the course of a verification of the origin of the good.

# Accessories, spare parts and tools; deemed originating for tariff change rule; actual origin applicable for RVC requirement
(17) Accessories, spare parts or tools that are delivered with a good and form part of the good's standard accessories, spare parts or tools are originating materials if the good is an originating good, and shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification or determining under section 5(1) the value of non-originating materials that do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification, provided that
(a) the accessories, spare parts or tools are not invoiced separately from the good; and
(b) the quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts or tools are customary for the good, within the industry that produces the good.
(18) Where a good is subject to a regional value-content requirement, the value of accessories, spare parts and tools that are delivered with that good and form part of the good's standard accessories, spare parts or tools shall be taken into account as originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good.
(19) For purposes of subsection (18), where accessories, spare parts and tools are self-produced materials, the producer may choose to designate those materials as intermediate materials under subsection (4).

# Examples illustrating the provisions on materials
(20) Each of the following examples is an “Example” as referred to in section 2(4).
Example 1:
section 7(2), Customs Value not Determined in a Manner Consistent with Schedule VIII
Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, imports material A into NAFTA country A. Producer A purchased material A from a middleman located in country B. The middleman purchased the material from a manufacturer located in country B. Under the laws in NAFTA country A that implement the
Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
the customs value of material A was based on the price actually paid or payable by the middleman to the manufacturer. Producer A uses material A to produce Good C, and exports Good C to NAFTA country D. Good C is subject to a regional value-content requirement.
Under section 4(1) of Schedule VIII, the price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the producer to or for the benefit of the seller of the material. Section 1 of that Schedule defines producer and seller for purposes of the Schedule. A producer is the person who uses the material in the production of a good that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. A seller is the person who sells the material being valued to the producer.
The customs value of material A was not determined in a manner consistent with Schedule VIII because it was based on the price actually paid or payable by the middleman to the manufacturer, rather than on the price actually paid or payable by Producer A to the middleman. Thus, section 7(2) applies and material A is valued in accordance with Schedule VIII.
Example 2:
section 7(5), Value of Intermediate Materials
A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good B, which is subject to a regional value-content requirement under section 4(2)(b). The producer also produces Material A, which is used in the production of Good B. Both originating materials and non-originating materials are used in the production of Material A. Material A is subject to a change in tariff classification requirement under section 4(2)(a). The costs to produce Material A are the following:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
$1.00
Value of non-originating materials
7.50
Other product costs
1.50
Period costs (including $0.30 in royalties)
0.50
Other costs
0.10
Total cost of Material A
$10.60
The producer designates Material A as an intermediate material and determines that, because all of the non-originating materials that are used in the production of Material A undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Schedule I, Material A would, under paragraph 4(2)(a) qualify as an originating material. The cost of the non-originating materials used in the production of Material A is therefore not included in the value of non-originating materials that are used in the production of Good B for the purpose of determining the regional value content of Good B. Because Material A has been designated as an intermediate material, the total cost of Material A, which is $10.60, is treated as the cost of originating materials for the purpose of calculating the regional value content of Good B. The total cost of Good B is determined in accordance with the following figures:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
—intermediate materials
$10.60
—other materials
3.00
Value of non-originating materials
5.50
Other product costs
6.50
Period costs
2.50
Other costs
0.10
Total cost of Good B
$28.20
Example 3:
section 7(5), Effects of the Designation of Self-produced Materials on Net Cost
The ability to designate intermediate materials helps to put the vertically integrated producer who is self-producing materials that are used in the production of a good on par with a producer who is purchasing materials and valuing those materials in accordance with subsection 7(1). The following situations demonstrate how this is achieved:
Situation 1
A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good B, which is subject to a regional value-content requirement of 50 percent under the net cost method. Good B satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations. The producer purchases Material A, which is used in the production of Good B, from a supplier located in a NAFTA country. The value of Material A determined in accordance with subsection 7(1)
is $11.00. Material A is an originating material. All other materials used in the production of Good B are non-originating materials. The net cost of Good B is determined as follows:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials (Material A)
$11.00
Value of non-originating materials
5.50
Other product costs
6.50
Period costs: (including $0.20 in excluded costs)
0.50
Other costs
0.10
Total cost of Good B
$23.60
Excluded costs: (included in period costs)
−0.20
Net cost of Good B
$23.40
The regional value content of Good B is calculated as follows:
ER06SE95.003
The regional value content of Good B is 76.5 percent, and Good B, therefore, qualifies as an originating good.
Situation 2
A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good B, which is subject to a regional value-content requirement of 50 percent under the net cost method. Good B satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations. The producer self-produces Material A which is used in the production of Good B. The costs to produce Material A are the following:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
$1.00
Value of non-originating materials
7.50
Other product costs
1.50
Period costs: (including $0.20 in excluded costs)
0.50
Other costs
0.10
Total cost of Material A
$10.60
Additional costs to produce Good B are the following:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
$0.00
Value of non-originating materials
5.50
Other product costs
6.50
Period costs: (including $0.20 in excluded costs)
0.50
Other costs
0.10
Total additional costs
$12.60
The producer does not designate Material A as an intermediate material under subsection 7(4). The net cost of Good B is calculated as follows:
Costs of Material A (not designated as an intermediate material)
Additional Costs to Produce Good B
Total
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
$1.00
$0.00

$23.20
Excluded costs (in period costs)
0.20
0.20
−0.40
Net cost of Good B (total cost minus excluded costs)
$22.80
The regional value content of Good B is calculated as follows:
ER06SE95.004
The regional value content of Good B is 42.9 percent, and Good B, therefore, does not qualify as an originating good.
Situation 3
A producer located in a NAFTA country produces Good B, which is subject to a regional value-content requirement of 50 percent under the net cost method. Good B satisfies all other applicable requirements of these Regulations. The producer self-produces Material A, which is used in the production of Good B. The costs to produce Material A are the following:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
$1.00
Value of non-originating materials
7.50
Other product costs
1.50
Period costs: (including $0.20 in excluded costs)
0.50
Other costs

Total cost of Material A
$10.60
Additional costs to produce Good B are the following:
Product costs:

$0.00
Value of non-originating materials

Other product costs
6.50
Period costs: (including $0.20 in excluded costs)
0.50
Other costs
0.10
Total additional costs
$12.60
The producer designates Material A as an intermediate material under subsection 7(4). Material A qualifies as an originating material under paragraph 4(2)(a). Therefore, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of Material A is not included in the value of non-originating materials for the purposes of calculating the regional value content of Good B. The net cost of Good B is calculated as follows:
Costs of Material A (designated as an intermediate material)
Additional Costs to Produce Good B
Total
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
$10.60
$0.00
$10.60

−0.20
Net cost of Good B (total cost minus excluded costs)
$23.00
The regional value content of Good B is calculated as follows:
ER06SE95.005
The regional value content of Good B is 76.1 percent, and Good B, therefore, qualifies as an originating good.
Example 4:
Originating Materials Acquired from a Producer Who Produced Them Using Intermediate Materials
Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, produces switches. In order for the switches to qualify as originating goods, Producer A designates subassemblies of the switches as intermediate materials. The subassemblies are subject to a regional value-content requirement. They satisfy that requirement, and qualify as originating materials. The switches are also subject to a regional value-content requirement, and, with the subassemblies designated as intermediate materials, are determined to have a regional value content of 65 percent.
Producer A sells the switches to Producer B, located in NAFTA country B, who uses them to produce switch assemblies that are used in the production of Good B. The switch assemblies are subject to a regional value-content requirement. Producers A and B are not accumulating their production within the meaning of section 14. Producer B is therefore able, under section 7(4), to designate the switch assemblies as intermediate materials.
If Producers A and B were accumulating their production within the meaning of section 14, Producer B would be unable to designate the switch assemblies as intermediate materials, because the production of both producers would be considered to be the production of one producer.
Example 5:
Single Producer and Successive Designations of Materials Subject to a Regional Value-Content Requirement as Intermediate Materials
Producer A, located in NAFTA country, produces Material X and uses Material X in the production of Good B. Material X qualifies as an originating material because it satisfies the applicable regional value-content requirement. Producer A designates Material A as an intermediate material.
Producer A uses Material X in the production of Material Y, which is also used in the production of Good B. Material Y is also subject to a regional value-content requirement. Under the proviso set out in section 7(4), Producer A cannot designate Material Y as an intermediate material, even if Material Y satisfies the applicable regional value-content requirement, because Material X was already designated by Producer A as an intermediate material.
Example 6:
Single Producer and Multiple Designations of Materials as Intermediate Materials
Producer X, who is located in NAFTA country X, uses non-originating materials in the production of self-produced materials A, B, and C. None of the self-produced materials are used in the production of any of the other self-produced materials.
Producer X uses the self-produced materials in the production of Good O, which is exported to NAFTA country Y. Materials A, B and C qualify as originating materials because they satisfy the applicable regional value-content requirements.
Because none of the self-produced materials are used in the production of any of the other self-produced materials, then even though each self-produced material is subject to a regional value-content requirement, Producer X may, under section 7(4), designate all of the self-produced materials as intermediate materials. The proviso set out in section 7(4) only applies where self-produced materials are used in the production of other self-produced materials and both are subject to a regional value-content requirement.
Example 7:
section 7(17)
The following are examples of accessories, spare parts or tools that are delivered with a good and form part of the good's standard accessories, spare parts or tools:
(a) consumables that must be replaced at regular intervals, such as dust collectors for an air-conditioning system,
(b) a carrying case for equipment,
(c) a dust cover for a machine,
(d) an operational manual for a vehicle,
(e) brackets to attach equipment to a wall,
(f) a bicycle tool kit or a car jack,
(g) a set of wrenches to change the bit on a chuck,
(h) a brush or other tool to clean out a machine, and
(i) electrical cords and power bars for use with electronic goods.
Example 8:
Value of Indirect Materials that are Assists
Producer A, located in a NAFTA country, produces Good A that is subject to a regional value-content requirement. The producer chooses that the regional value content of that good be calculated using the net cost method. Producer A buys Material X from Producer B, located in a NAFTA country, and uses it in the production of Good A. Producer A provides to Producer B, at no charge, tools to be used in the production of Material X. The tools have a value of $100 which is expensed in the current year by Producer A.
Material X is subject to a regional value-content requirement which Producer B chooses to calculate using the net cost method. For purposes of determining the value of non-originating materials in order to calculate the regional value content of Material X, the tools are considered to be an originating material because they are an indirect material. However, pursuant to section 7(11) they have a value of nil because the cost of the tools with respect to Material X is not recorded on the books of Producer B.
It is determined that Material X is a non-originating material. The cost of the tools that is recorded on the books of producer A is expensed in the current year. Pursuant to section 5 of Schedule VIII, the value of the tools (see section 5(1)(b)(ii) of Schedule VIII) must be included in the value of Material X by Producer A when calculating the regional value content of Good A. The cost of the tools, although recorded on the books of producer A, cannot be included as a separate cost in the net cost of Good A because it is already included in the value of Material X. The entire cost of Material X, which includes the cost of the tools, is included in the value of non-originating materials for purposes of the regional value content of Good A.

the transaction in which that producer acquired it.

# Effect on value of traced material if value on a statement cannot be verified
(7) Where any person who has information with respect to a statement referred to in any of subsections (2)(c) through (h) does not allow a customs administration to verify that information during a verification of origin, the value of the material with respect to which that person did not allow the customs administration to verify the information may be determined by that customs administration in accordance with subsection (5) with respect to the transaction in which that person sells, or otherwise transfers to another person, that material or a material that incorporates that material.

# Use of value of VNM as determined under section 12(3) for traced material incorporated into another material
(8) Where a traced material is incorporated into a material produced in the territory of a NAFTA country and that material is incorporated into a light-duty automotive good, the statement referred to in subsection (2)(c), (d) or (e) may state the value of non-originating materials, determined in accordance with section 12(3), with respect to the material that incorporates the traced material.

# Interpretations and clarifications for provisions applicable to tracing rules for light-duty automotive goods
(9) For purposes of this section,
(a) where a producer, in accordance with section 7(4), designates as an intermediate material any self-produced material used in the production of a light-duty automotive good,
(i) the designation applies solely to the calculation of the net cost of that good, and
(ii) the value of a traced material that is incorporated into that good shall be determined as though the designation had not been made;
(b) the value of a material not listed in Schedule IV, when imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries,
(i) shall not be included in the value of non-originating materials that are used in the production of a light-duty automotive good, and
(ii) shall be included in calculating the net cost of a light-duty automotive good that incorporates that material;
(c) except as otherwise provided in section 12(10), this section does not apply with respect to after-market parts;
(d) the costs referred to in subsections (2)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii), subsections (2)(c)(ii)(B) and (d)(ii)(B) and subsections (4) and (5) shall be the costs referred to in those paragraphs that are recorded on the books of the producer of the light-duty automotive good;
(e) for purposes of calculating the regional value content of a light-duty automotive good, the producer of that good may choose to treat any material used in the production of that good as a non-originating material, and the value of that material shall be determined in accordance with subsection (5) with respect to the transaction in which the producer acquired it; and
(f) any information set out in a statement referred to in subsection (2) that concerns the value of materials or costs shall be in the same currency as the currency of the country in which the person who provided the statement is located.

# Examples of application of tracing for light-duty automotive goods
(10) Each of the following examples is an “Example” as referred to in section 2(4).
Example 1:
Nuts and bolts provided for in heading 7318 are imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and are used in the territory of a NAFTA country in the production of a light-duty automotive good referred to in section 9(1). Heading 7318 is not listed in Schedule IV so the nuts and bolts are not traced materials.
Because the nuts and bolts are not traced materials the value, under section 9(1), of the nuts and bolts is not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the light-duty automotive good even though the nuts and bolts are imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.
The value, under section 9(9)(b), of the nuts and bolts is included in the net cost of the light-duty automotive good for the purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), regional value content of the motor vehicle.
Example 2:
A rear view mirror provided for in subheading 7009.10 is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and is used in the territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle.
Subheading 7009.10 is listed in Schedule IV. The rear view mirror is a traced material. For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), regional value content of the light-duty vehicle, the value of the mirror is included in the value of non-originating materials in accordance with sections 9(2) through (9).
Example 3:
Glass provided for in heading 7005 is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and is used in the territory of NAFTA country A in the production of a rear view mirror. The rear view mirror is a
non-originating good because it fails to satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification.
That rear view mirror is exported to NAFTA country B where it is used as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle. Even though the rear view mirror is a non-originating material and is provided for in a tariff item listed in Schedule IV, it is not a traced material because it was not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.
For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of a light-duty vehicle in which the rear view mirror is incorporated, the value of the rear view mirror, under section 9(1), is not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle.
Even though the glass provided for in heading 7005 that was used in the production of the rear view mirror and incorporated into the light-duty vehicle was imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, the glass is not a traced material because heading 7005 is not listed in Schedule IV. For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle that incorporates the glass, the value of the glass is not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle. The value of the rear view mirror would be included in the net cost of the light-duty vehicle, but the value of the imported glass would not be separately included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle.
Example 4:
An electric motor provided for in subheading 8501.10 is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and is used in the territory of a NAFTA country in the production of a seat frame provided for in subheading 9401.90. The seat frame, with the electric motor attached, is sold to a producer of seats provided for in subheading 9401.20. The seat producer sells the seat to a producer of light-duty vehicles. The seat is to be used as original equipment in the production of that light-duty vehicle.
Subheadings 8501.10 and 9401.20 are listed in Schedule IV; subheading 9401.90 is not. The electric motor is a traced material; the seat is not a traced material because it was not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.
The seat is a light-duty automotive good referred to in section 9(1). For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the seat, the value of traced materials incorporated into it is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the seat. The value of the electric motor is included in that value. (However, the value of the motor would not be included separately in the net cost of the seat because the value of the motor is included as part of the cost of the seat frame.)
For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle, the value of the electric motor is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle, even if the seat is an originating material.
Example 5:
Cast blocks, cast heads and connecting rod assemblies provided for in heading 8409 are imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries by an engine producer, who has title to them at the time of importation, and are used by the producer in the territory of NAFTA country A in the production of an engine provided for in heading 8407. After the regional value content of the engine is calculated, the engine is an originating good. It is not a traced material because it was not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries. The engine is exported to NAFTA country B, to be used as original equipment by a producer of light-duty vehicles.
For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle that incorporates the engine, because heading 8409 is listed in Schedule IV and because the cast blocks, cast heads and connecting rod assemblies were imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and are incorporated into the light-duty vehicle, the value of those materials, which are traced materials, is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle, even though the engine is an originating material.
The producer of the light-duty vehicle did not import the traced materials. However, because that producer has a statement referred to in section 9(2)(c) and that statement states the value of non-originating materials of the traced materials in accordance with section 12(2), the producer of the light-duty vehicle may, in accordance with section 9(8), use that value as the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle with respect to that engine.
Example 6:
Aluminum ingots provided for in subheading 7601.10 and piston assemblies provided for in heading 8409 are imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries by an engine producer and are used by that producer in the territory of NAFTA country A in the production of an engine provided for in heading 8407. The aluminum ingots are used by the producer to produce an engine block; the piston assembly is then incorporated into the engine block and the
producer designates, in accordance with section 7(4), a short block provided for in heading 8409 as an intermediate material. The intermediate material qualifies as an originating material. The engine that incorporates the short block is exported to NAFTA country B and used as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle. The piston assemblies provided for in heading 8409 are traced materials; neither the engine nor the short block are traced materials because they were not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.
For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the engine, the value of the piston assemblies is included, under section 9(9)(a)(ii), in the value of non-originating materials, even if the intermediate material is an originating material. However, the value of the aluminum ingots is not included in the value of non-originating materials because subheading 7601.10 is not listed in Schedule IV. The value of the aluminum ingots does not need to be included separately in the net cost of the engine because that value is included in the value of the intermediate material, and the total cost of the intermediate material is included in the net cost of the engine.
For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle that incorporates the engine (and the piston assemblies), the value of the piston assemblies incorporated into that light-duty vehicle is included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle.
Example 7:
An engine provided for in heading 8407 is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries. The producer of the engine, located in the country from which the engine is imported, used in the production of the engine a piston assembly provided for in heading 8409 that was produced in a NAFTA country and is an originating good. The engine is used in the territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle. The engine is a traced material.
For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of a light-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine, the value of the engine is included in the value of non-originating materials of that light-duty vehicle. The value of the piston assembly, which was, before its exportation to outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, an originating good, shall not be deducted from the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle. Under section 18 (transshipment), the piston assembly is no longer considered to be an originating good because it was used in the production of a good outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.
Example 8:
A wholesaler, located in City A in the territory of a NAFTA country, imports from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries rubber hoses provided for in heading 4009, which is listed in Schedule IV. The wholesaler takes title to the goods at the wholesaler's place of business in City A. The customs value of the imported goods is $500. All freight, taxes and duties associated with the good to the wholesaler's place of business total $100; the cost of the freight, included in that $100, from the place where it was received in the territory of a NAFTA country to the location of the wholesaler's place of business in City A is $25. The wholesaler sells the rubber hoses for $650 to a producer of light-duty vehicles who uses the goods in the territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle. The light-duty vehicle producer pays $50 to have the goods shipped from the location of the wholesaler's place of business in City A to the location at which the light-duty vehicle is produced.
The rubber hoses are traced materials and they are incorporated into a light-duty automotive good. For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle,
(1) if the wholesaler takes title to the goods before the first place at which they were received in the territory of a NAFTA country, then the value of non-originating materials, where the light-duty vehicle producer has a statement referred to in section 9(2)(c), would not include the cost of freight from the place where they were received in the territory of a NAFTA country to the location of the wholesaler's place of business: in this situation, the value of non-originating materials would be $575;
(2) if the producer has a statement referred to in section 9(2)(d) that states the customs value of the traced material and, where not included in that price, the cost of taxes, duties, fees and transporting the goods to the place where title is taken, the light-duty vehicle producer may use those values as the value of non-originating materials with respect to the goods: in this situation, the value of non-originating materials would be $600; or
(3) if the wholesaler is unwilling to provide the light-duty vehicle producer with such a statement, the value of non-originating materials with respect to the traced materials will be the value of the materials with respect to the transaction in which the producer acquired them, as provided for in section 9(2)(i), in this instance $650; the costs of transporting the goods from the location of the wholesaler's place of business to the location of the producer will be included in the net cost of the
goods, but not in the value of non-originating materials.
Example 9:
A wholesaler, located in City A in the territory of a NAFTA country, imports from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries rubber hose provided for in heading 4009, which is listed in Schedule IV. The wholesaler sells the good to a producer located in the territory of the NAFTA country who uses the hose to produce a power steering hose assembly, also provided for in heading 4009. The power steering hose assembly is then sold to a producer of light-duty vehicles who uses that good in the production of a light-duty vehicle. The rubber hose is a traced material; the power steering hose assembly is not a traced material because it was not imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.
The wholesaler who imported the rubber hose from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries has title to it at the time of importation. The customs value of the good is $3, including freight and insurance and all other costs incurred in transporting the good to the first place at which it was received in the territory of the NAFTA country. Duties and fees and all other costs referred to in section 9(4), paid by the wholesaler with respect to the good, total an additional $1. The wholesaler sells the good to the producer of the power steering hose assemblies for $5, not including freight to the location of that producer. The power steering hose producer pays $2 to have the good delivered to the location of production. The value of the power steering hose assembly sold to the light-duty vehicle producer is $10, including freight for delivery of the goods to the location of the light-duty vehicle producer.
For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle:
(1) if the motor vehicle producer has a statement referred to in section 9(2)(c) from the producer of the power steering hose assembly that states the customs value of the imported rubber hose incorporated in the power steering hose assembly, and the value of the duties, fees and other costs referred to in section 9(4), the producer may use those values as the value of non-originating materials with respect to that traced good: in this situation, that value would be the customs value of $3 and the cost of duties and fees of $1, provided that the wholesaler has provided the producer of the power steering hose assembly with the information regarding the customs value of the imported good and the other costs;
(2) if the light-duty vehicle producer has a statement from the producer of the power steering hose assembly that states the value of the imported hose, with respect to the transaction in which the power steering hose assembly producer acquires the imported hose from the wholesaler, the light-duty vehicle producer may include that value as the value of non-originating materials, in accordance with section 9(2)(e): in this situation, that value is $5; and the $2 cost of transporting the good from the location of the wholesaler to the location of the producer, because that cost is separately identified, would not be included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle;
(3) if the light-duty vehicle producer has a statement referred to in section 9(2)(f) signed by the producer of the power steering hose assembly, the light-duty vehicle producer may use the formula set out in section 9(2)(f) to calculate the value of non-originating materials with respect to that acquired material: in this situation, assuming the regional value content is 55 per cent, the value of non-originating materials would be $4.50; and because the cost of transportation from the location of the producer of the power steering hose assembly to the location of the light-duty vehicle producer is included in the purchase price and not separately identified, it may not be deducted from the purchase price, because the formula referred to in section 9(2)(f) does not allow for the deduction of transportation costs that would otherwise not be non-originating;
(4) if the light-duty vehicle producer has a statement referred to in section 9(2)(g) signed by the producer of the power steering hose assembly, the light-duty vehicle producer may use the formula set out in section 9(2)(g) to calculate the value of non-originating materials with respect to that acquired material: in this situation, assuming the regional value-content requirement is 50 per cent, the value of non-originating materials would be $5; and because the cost of transportation from the location of the producer of the power steering hose assembly to the location of the light-duty vehicle producer is included in the purchase price and not separately identified, it may not be deducted from the purchase price, because the formula referred to in section 9(2)(g) does not allow for the deduction of transportation costs that would otherwise not be non-originating; or
(5) if the light-duty vehicle producer does not have a statement referred to in any of sections 9(2)(c) through (h) from the producer of the power steering hose assembly, the light-duty vehicle producer includes in the value of non-originating materials of the vehicles the value, determined in accordance with section 9(2)(i), of the power steering hose assembly: in this situation, that amount would be $10, the cost to the producer of acquiring that material.
Example 10:
A producer of light-duty vehicles located in City C in the territory of a NAFTA country imports from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries rubber hose provided for in heading 4009, which is listed in Schedule IV, and uses that good as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle.
The rubber hose arrives at City A in the NAFTA country, but the producer of the light-duty vehicle does not have title to the good; it is transported under bond to City B, and on its arrival in City B, the producer of the light-duty vehicle takes title to it and the good is received in the territory of a NAFTA country. The good is then transported to the location of the light-duty vehicle producer in City C.
The customs value of the imported good is $4, the transportation and other costs referred to in subparagraph 9(2)(b)(ii) to City A are $3 and to City B are $2, and the cost of duties, taxes and other fees referred to in section 9(4) is $1. The cost of transporting the good from City B to the location of the producer in City C is $1. The rubber hose is traced material.
For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle, the value, under section 9(2)(b), of non-originating materials of that vehicle is the customs value of the traced material and, where not included in that value, the cost of taxes, duties, fees and the cost of transporting the traced material to the place where title is taken. In this situation, the value of non-originating materials would be the customs value of the traced material, $4, the cost of duties taxes and other fees, $1, the cost of transporting the material to City A, $3, and the cost of transporting that material from City A to City B, $2, for a total of $10. The $1 cost of transporting the good from City B to the location of the producer in City C would not be included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle because a person of a NAFTA country has taken title to the traced material.
Example 11:
A radiator provided for in subheading 8708.91 is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries by a producer of light-duty vehicles and is used in the territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of a light-duty vehicle.
The radiator is transported by ship from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and arrives in the territory of the NAFTA country at City A. The radiator is not, however, unloaded at City A and although the radiator is physically present in the territory of the NAFTA country, it has not been received in the territory of a NAFTA country.
The ship sails in territorial waters from City A to City B and the radiator is unloaded there. The light-duty vehicle producer files, from City C in the same country, the entry for the radiator; the radiator enters the territory of the NAFTA country at City B.
Subheading 8708.91 is listed in Schedule IV. The radiator is a traced material.
For purposes of calculating, under section 9(1), the regional value content of the light-duty vehicle, the value of the radiator is included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle. The costs of any freight, insurance, packing and other costs incurred in transporting the radiator to City B are included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle, including the cost of transporting the radiator from City A to City B. The costs of any freight, insurance, packing and other costs that were incurred in transporting the radiator from City B to the location of the producer are not included in the value of non-originating materials of the light-duty vehicle.
Example 12:
Producer X, located in NAFTA country A, produces a car seat of subheading No. 9401.20 that is used in the production of a light-duty vehicle. The only non-originating material used in the production of the car seat is an electric motor of subheading No. 8501.20 that was imported by Producer X from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries. The electric motor is a material of a tariff provision listed in Schedule IV and thus is a traced material.
Producer X sells the car seat as original equipment to Producer Y, a light-duty vehicle producer, located in NAFTA country B. The car seat is an originating good because the non-originating material in the car seat (the electric motor) undergoes the applicable change in tariff classification set out in a rule that specifies only a change in tariff classification. Consequently, Producer X does not choose to calculate the regional value content of the car seat in accordance with section 12(1).
For purposes of determining, under section 9(1), the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle that incorporates the car seat, the value of the electric motor is included even though the car seat qualifies as an originating material.
Producer X provides Producer Y with a statement described in section 9(2)(c), with the value of non-originating material used in the production of the car seat determined in accordance with section 12(3), as is permitted by section 9(8). Producer Y uses that value as the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the light-duty vehicle with respect to the car seat.
Example 13:
This example has the same facts as in Example 12, except that the car seat does not qualify as an originating good under the rule that specifies only a change in tariff classification. Instead, it qualifies as an originating good under a rule that specifies a regional value-content requirement and a change in tariff classification. For purposes of that rule, Producer X chose to calculate the regional value content of the car seat in accordance with section 12(1) over a period set out in section 12(5)(a) and using a category set out in section 12(4)(a).
For purposes of the statement described in section 9(2)(c), Producer X determined, as is permitted under section 9(8), the value of non-originating material used in the production of the car seat in accordance with section 12(3) over a period set out in section 12(5)(a) and using a category set out in section 12(4)(e).

if the producer has a statement, signed by the person from whom the originating material was acquired, that states the sum of the values, as determined by the producer of the originating material under paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (e) of each non-originating material referred to in any of clauses (A) through (D) that is incorporated into that originating material;
(ii) an amount equal to the number resulting from applying the following formula:

# VM × (1 − RVC)
where
VM is the value of the acquired material, determined in accordance with subsection (2), with respect to the transaction in which the producer of the good acquired that material, and
RVC is the regional value content of the acquired material, expressed as a decimal,
if the material is subject to a regional value-content requirement and the producer has a statement, signed by the person from whom the producer acquired that material, that states that the acquired material is an originating material and states the regional value content of the material,

(f) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, minus the value of any reusable scrap or by-product.

# Value of imported material if customs value is not in accordance with Schedule VIII
(3) For purposes of subsections (1)(a)(ii)(A) and (b)(ii)(A) and subsections (1)(c)(i) and (f)(i), where the customs value of an imported material referred to in those clauses or paragraphs was not determined in a manner consistent with Schedule VIII, the value of the material shall be determined in accordance with Schedule VIII with respect to the importation for which that customs value was determined and, where the costs referred to in sections (2)(c) through (f) are not included in that value, those costs shall be added to the value of the material.

# Option to use section 9 tracing rules in certain circumstances
(4) For purposes of calculating the regional value content of a heavy-duty component, where
(a) a heavy-duty component is produced in the same plant as an automotive component assembly or automotive component that is of the same heading or subheading as that heavy-duty component and is for use as original equipment in a light-duty vehicle, and
(b) it is not reasonable for the producer to know which of the production will constitute a heavy-duty component for use in a heavy-duty vehicle,
the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty component in that plant may, at the choice of the producer, be determined in the manner set out in section 9.
(5) For purposes of calculating the regional value content of a heavy-duty vehicle, where a producer of such a vehicle acquires, for use by that producer in the production of the vehicle, a heavy-duty component with respect to which the value of non-originating materials has been determined in accordance with subsection (4), the value of the non-originating materials used by the producer with respect to that heavy-duty component is the value of non-originating materials determined under that subsection.

# VNM may be redetermined for certain acquired materials
(6) Where it is determined, during the course of a verification of origin of a heavy-duty automotive good with respect to which the producer of that good has a statement referred to in subsection (1)(d)(ii) or (iii) that the acquired material referred to in that statement is not an originating material, the value of the acquired material shall, for purposes of subsection (1), be determined in accordance with subsection (2) with respect to the transaction in which that producer acquired it.

# Effect on value of traced material if value on a statement cannot be verified
(7) Where any person who has information with respect to a statement referred to in subsection (1)(b)(ii), (d)(i) or (e)(i) does not allow a customs administration to verify that information during a verification of origin, the value of any material with respect to which that person did not allow the customs administration to verify the information may be determined by that customs administration in accordance with subsection (2) with respect to the transaction in which that person sells, or otherwise transfers to
another person, that material or a material that incorporates that material.

# Use of value of VNM as determined under section 12(3) for traced material incorporated into another material
(8) Where a heavy-duty component, sub-component or listed material is incorporated into a material produced in the territory of a NAFTA country and that material is incorporated into a heavy-duty automotive good, the statement referred to in subsection (1)(b)(ii), (d)(i) or (e)(i) may state the value of non-originating materials, determined in accordance with section 12(3), with respect to the material that incorporates the heavy-duty component, sub-component or listed material.

# Interpretations and clarifications for provisions applicable to rules for determining VNM for heavy-duty automotive goods
(9) For purposes of this section,
(a) for purposes of calculating the regional value content of a heavy-duty automotive good, sub-component or listed material, a producer of such a good may, in accordance with section 7(4), designate as an intermediate material any self-produced material, other than a heavy-duty component or sub-component, that is used in the production of that good;
(b) except as otherwise provided in section 12(10), this section does not apply with respect to after-market parts;
(c) this section does not apply to a sub-component for purposes of calculating its regional value content before it is incorporated into a heavy-duty automotive good;
(d) for purposes of calculating the regional value content of a heavy-duty automotive good, the producer of that good may choose to treat any material used in the production of that good as a non-originating material, and the value of that material shall be determined in accordance with subsection (2) with respect to the transaction in which the producer acquired it;
(e) any information set out in a statement referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii), (d)(i) through (iii) or (e)(i) that concerns the value of materials or costs shall be in the same currency as the currency of the country in which the person who provided the statement is located; and
(f) total cost under subsections (1)(a)(i) and (ii) consists of the costs referred to section 2(6), and is calculated in accordance with that section and section 2(7).

# Examples of application of rules for determining VNM for heavy-duty automotive goods
(10) Each of the following examples is an “Example” as referred to in section 2(4).
Example 1:
A listed material is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries
A cast head, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country in the production of an engine that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. No other non-originating materials are used in the production of the engine. The cast head is a listed material; the engine is an automotive component.
Situation 1:
Use of the listed material in an automotive component
For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the engine, the value of listed materials imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine. Because the cast head was produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, its value, under section 10(1)(c), is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine.
Situation 2:
Use of an originating automotive component incorporating the listed material
The engine is an originating material acquired by the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine (and incorporates the cast head), the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(d) with respect to that engine. The producer may choose to include in the value of non-originating materials of the heavy-duty vehicle
(a) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(i), of the non-originating materials that are incorporated into the engine, which is the value, determined under sections 10(1) (a) through (c) and paragraph (e)(ii), of the non-originating materials;
(b) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(ii), which is an amount equal to the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(iv) multiplied by the remainder of one minus the regional value content, expressed as a decimal, of the engine;
(c) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(iii), which is an amount equal to the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(iv) multiplied by the remainder of one minus the regional value-content requirement, expressed as a decimal, for the engine; or
(d) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(iv), of the engine.
The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the first option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(i), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, the value, determined under section 10(1)(c), of the cast head, is included in the value of non-originating materials of the heavy-duty vehicle, with respect to the engine that is used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.
The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the second option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(ii), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, because of the application of the equation, the value of the cast head will be included in the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(ii) and is, consequently, included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.
The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the third option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(iii), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, because of the application of the equation, the value of the cast head will be included in the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(iii) and is, consequently, included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.
Situation 3:
Use of a non-originating automotive component incorporating the listed material
The engine is a non-originating material acquired by the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine (and incorporates the cast head), the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(e) with respect to that engine. The producer of the heavy-duty vehicle may choose to include in the value of non-originating materials either
(a) the value, as determined under section 10(1)(e)(i), of the non-originating materials that are incorporated into the engine, which is the value of the non-originating materials as determined under sections 10(1)(a) through (d) and (f), or
(b) the value of the engine, determined under section 10(1)(e)(ii).
The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the first option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(e)(i), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, the value of the cast head, as determined under section 10(1)(c), is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle, with respect to the engine that is used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.
Example 2:
A material is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries
A rocker arm assembly, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country in the production of an engine that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. No other non-originating materials are used in the production of the engine. The rocker arm assembly is neither a listed material nor a sub-component; the engine is an automotive component.
Situation 1:
Use of the material in an automotive component
For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the engine, the value of non-originating materials that are not listed materials is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine. Because the rocker arm assembly was produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, it is a non-originating material and its value, under section 10(1)(f), is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine.
Situation 2:
Use of an originating automotive component incorporating the material
The engine is an originating material acquired by the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine (and incorporates the rocker arm assembly), the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(d) with respect to that engine. The producer may choose to include in the value of non-originating materials of the heavy-duty vehicle
(a) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(i), of the non-originating materials that are incorporated into the engine, which is the value, determined under sections 10(1) (a) through (c) and paragraph (e)(ii), of the non-originating materials;
(b) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(ii), which is an amount equal to the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(iv) multiplied by the remainder of one minus the regional value content, expressed as a decimal, of the engine;
(c) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(iii), which is an amount equal to the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(iv) multiplied by the remainder of one minus the regional value-content requirement, expressed as a decimal, for the engine; or
(d) the value, determined under section 10(1)(d)(iv), of the engine.
The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the first option if that producer has a
statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(i), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, the value of the rocker arm assembly, as determined under section 10(1)(f), is not included in the value of non-originating materials of the heavy-duty vehicle, with respect to the engine that is used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.
The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the second option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(ii), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, because of the application of the equation, the value of the rocker arm assembly will be included in the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(ii) and will, consequently, be included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.
The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the third option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(d)(iii), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, because of the application of the equation, the value of the rocker arm assembly will be included in the amount determined under section 10(1)(d)(iii) and will, consequently, be included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.
Situation 3:
Use of a non-originating automotive component incorporating the material
The engine is a non-originating material acquired by the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that engine (and incorporates the rocker arm assembly), the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(e) with respect to that engine. The producer of the heavy-duty vehicle may choose to include in the value of non-originating materials either
(a) the value, as determined under section 10(1)(e)(i), of the non-originating materials that are incorporated into the engine, which is the value of the non-originating materials as determined under sections 10(1) (a) through (d) and (f), or
(b) the value of the engine, determined under section 10(1)(e)(ii).
The heavy-duty vehicle producer may only choose the first option if that producer has a statement, referred to in section 10(1)(e)(i), from the person from whom the engine was acquired. In this situation, the value of the rocker arm assembly, as determined under section 10(1)(f), is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle, with respect to the engine that is used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.
Situation 4:
Use of the material in a self-produced automotive component
If the engine is a self-produced material rather than an acquired material, the heavy-duty vehicle producer is using the rocker arm assembly in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle rather than in the production of the engine, because, under section 7(4), the engine cannot be designated as an intermediate material. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, the value, under section 10(1)(f), of the rocker arm assembly is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.
Example 3:
An automotive component is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries
A transmission, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The transmission is an automotive component.
Situation:
Use of the automotive component
For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle in which the transmission is used, the value of the transmission is included in the value of the non-originating materials under section 10(1)(c), regardless of whether the producer imported the transmission or acquired it from someone else in the territory of a NAFTA country.
Example 4:
An automotive component is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries
A transmission, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and combined with an engine to produce an engine-transmission assembly that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The transmission is an automotive component; the engine-transmission assembly is an automotive component assembly.
Situation:
Use of the automotive component assembly
The automotive component assembly is acquired by a producer who uses it in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. If the automotive component assembly that incorporates the imported transmission is an originating material, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the automotive component assembly is determined, at the choice of the producer, under any of section 10(1)(d) (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). (See example 1 for more detailed explanations of these provisions.) If the automotive component assembly that incorporates the imported transmission is a non-
originating material, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the automotive component assembly is determined, at the choice of the producer, under section 10(1)(e) (i) or (ii). (See example 1 for more detailed explanations of these provisions.)
Regardless of whether the automotive component assembly is an originating material or a non-originating material, the value of the automotive component that was imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle. The transmission is a non-originating material, and, for purposes of calculating the regional value content of an automotive component assembly or heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates that transmission, the value of the transmission is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the automotive component assembly or heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates it.
Example 5:
A material is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries
An aluminum ingot, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country in the production of cast block that will be used in an engine that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The aluminum ingot is not a listed material; the cast block is a listed material; the engine is an automotive component.
Situation 1:
Use of the material in an intermediate material that is a listed material
The engine producer designates the cast block as an intermediate material under section 7(4). For purposes of determining the origin of that cast block, because the aluminum ingot is classified under a different heading than the cast block, the cast block satisfies the applicable change in tariff classification and is an originating material.
Situation 2:
Use of the listed material incorporating the material
For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the engine that incorporates that cast block (and thus incorporates the aluminum ingot), the value of non-originating materials is determined under section 10(1). Because none of sections 10(1) (a) through (f) require that a listed material that is an originating material be included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of a good, the value of the cast block is not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine or in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of an automotive component assembly or heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates the engine.
Because section 10(1)(d) does not refer to a listed material that is an originating material, the value of the non-originating aluminum ingot used in the production of the originating cast block is not included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of any good or material that incorporates the originating cast block.
Example 6:
A non-originating listed material is used to produce a sub-component that is used to produce another sub-component
A crankshaft, produced in the territory of NAFTA country A from a forging imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is a non-originating material. The crankshaft is sold to another producer, located in the same country, who uses it to produce an originating block assembly. That block assembly is sold to another producer, also located in the same country, who uses it to produce a finished block. The finished block is sold to a producer of engines, who is located in NAFTA country B, for use in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The crankshaft is a listed material; the block assembly is a sub-component, as is the finished block.
Situation 1:
Calculating the regional value content of the finished block
A sub-component is not a heavy-duty automotive good. As referred to in section 10(9)(c), for purposes of calculating the regional value content of the sub-component before it is incorporated into a heavy-duty automotive good, such as when the sub-component is exported from the territory of one NAFTA country to the territory of another NAFTA country, the value of non-originating materials of the sub-component includes only the value of non-originating materials used in the production of that sub-component. Because the block assembly is an originating material, its value is not included in the value of non-originating materials of the finished block, nor is the value of the non-originating crankshaft included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the finished block because the crankshaft was used in the production of the block assembly and was not used in the production of the finished block.
Situation 2:
Calculating the regional value content of the component that incorporates the finished block
For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle that incorporates a sub-component, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the sub-component is determined under section 10(1) (d) or (e) with respect to that sub-component. In this situation, the value, under section 10(1)(b), of the non-originating crankshaft is included in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the engine. (See examples 1 and 2 for more detailed explanations of sections 10(1) (d) and (e).)
Example 7:
A non-listed material is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA
countries and is used in the production of another non-listed material
A bumper part, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and is used in the production of a bumper. The bumper is used in the territory of a NAFTA country as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. Neither a bumper part nor a bumper is a listed material, sub-component, automotive component or automotive component assembly.
Situation 1:
The non-listed material is an originating material
The bumper is an originating material. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, neither the value of the imported bumper part nor the value of the bumper is included in the value of the non-originating materials.
Situation 2:
The non-listed material is a non-originating material
The bumper is a non-originating material. For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle is determined under section 10(1)(f) with respect to the bumper. In this situation, the value of the bumper is included in the value of non-originating materials of the heavy-duty vehicle. Because a bumper is not a listed material, the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle does not have the option, under section 10(1)(b)(ii), to include only the value of the imported bumper part in the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the heavy-duty vehicle.
Example 8:
Situation:
Transhipment of a listed material
A producer, located in the territory of a NAFTA country, produces, in that country, a cast head that is an originating good. The producer exports the cast head to outside the territories of the NAFTA territories, where valves, springs, valve lifters, a camshaft and gears are added to it to create a cast head assembly. An engine producer, located in the territory of a NAFTA country, imports the cast head assembly into that country and uses it in the production of an engine that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. A cast head is a listed material; a cast head assembly is a sub-component.
For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the engine, the value of the imported cast head assembly is included in the value of non-originating materials under section 10(1)(c). The value of the cast head cannot be deducted from the value determined under section 10(1)(c). Although the cast head was once an originating good, under section 18 when further production was performed with respect to the cast head outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, it was no longer an originating good.
Example 9:
A material is imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries and a heavy-duty vehicle producer self-produces a non-originating listed material
A material, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is imported into the territory of a NAFTA country and used in that country in the production of a water pump that will be used as original equipment by the same producer in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. Although the producer, under section 7(4), designates the water pump as an intermediate material it is a non-originating material because it fails to satisfy the regional value-content requirement. A water pump is a listed material.
For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, the value of non-originating materials includes, at the choice of the producer, either the total cost, determined under section 10(1)(a)(i), of the water pump or the value, determined under section 10(1)(a)(iii)(A), of the material imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.
Example 10:
A material is acquired and used to produce a non-originating listed material
A material, produced outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, is acquired in the territory of a NAFTA country and is used in that country in the production of a water pump that will be used as original equipment in the production of a heavy-duty vehicle. The producer of the water pump and the producer of the heavy-duty vehicle are separate, unrelated producers, located in the same country. A water pump is a listed material. The producer of the water pump chose to calculate the regional value content of the water pump in accordance with section 12(1) over a period set out in section 12(5)(a) and using a category set out in section 12(4)(b). The water pump is a non-originating material because it fails to satisfy the regional value-content requirement.
For purposes of calculating the regional value content of the heavy-duty vehicle, the value of non-originating materials includes, at the choice of the producer, either the value, determined under section 10(1)(b)(i), of the water pump or, if the producer has a statement referred to in section 10(1)(b)(ii)(B), the value, determined under that section, of the material imported from outside the territories of the NAFTA countries.
The producer has a statement referred to in section 10(1)(b)(ii)(B) and chooses to use the value of non-originating material determined under that section. The statement states, as is permitted under section 10(8), the value of non-originating material used in the production of the water pump in accordance with section 12(3) over a period set out
in section 12(5)(a) and using a category set out in section 12(4)(e).

(9) For purposes of this section, where a producer files a choice under subsection (1), (3) or (4), including a choice referred to in section 13(9), the net cost incurred and the values of non-originating materials used by the producer, with respect to
(a) all motor vehicles that fall within the category chosen by the producer and that are produced during the fiscal year or, in the case of a choice filed under subsection (3), during the period with respect to which the choice is made, or
(b) those motor vehicles to be exported to the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries that fall within the category chosen by the producer and that are produced during the fiscal year or, in the case of a choice filed under subsection (3), during the period with respect to which the choice is made,
shall be included in the calculation of the regional value content under any of the categories set out in subsection (5).

# Year-end analysis required if averaging based on estimated costs; obligation to notify of change in status
(10) Where the producer of a motor vehicle has calculated the regional value content of the motor vehicle on the basis of estimated costs, including standard costs, budgeted forecasts or other similar estimating procedures, before or during the producer's fiscal year, the producer shall conduct an analysis at the end of the producer's fiscal year of the actual costs incurred over the period with respect to the production of the motor vehicle, and, if the motor vehicle does not satisfy the regional value content requirement on the basis of the actual costs, immediately inform any person to whom the producer has provided a Certificate of Origin for the motor vehicle, or a written statement that the motor vehicle is an originating good, that the motor vehicle is a non-originating good.
(11) The following example is an “Example” as referred to in section 2(4).
Example:
A motor vehicle producer located in NAFTA country A produces vehicles that fall within a category set out in section 11(5) that is chosen by the producer. The motor vehicles are to be sold in NAFTA countries A, B and C, as well as in country D, which is not a NAFTA country. Under section 11(1), the motor vehicle producer may choose that the sum of the net costs incurred and the sum of the values of non-originating materials used by the producer be calculated over the producer's fiscal year. The producer may state in the choice the basis of the calculation as described in section 11(9)(a), in which case the calculation would be on the basis of all the motor vehicles produced regardless of where they are destined. Alternatively, the producer may state in the choice the basis of the calculation as described in section 11(9)(b). In this case, the producer would also need to state that the calculation is on the basis of
(a) the motor vehicles produced that are for export to NAFTA countries B and C;
(b) the motor vehicles produced that are for export to only NAFTA country B; or
(c) the motor vehicles produced that are for export to only NAFTA country C.
The calculation would be on the basis as described in the choice.

# PART VI

# GENERAL PROVISIONS

# SECTION 14. ACCUMULATION

# Option to determine origin of good by accumulating the production of a material with production of the good in which the material is used
(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (4), for purposes of determining whether a good is an originating good, an exporter or producer of a good may choose to accumulate the production, by one or more producers in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries, of materials that are incorporated into that good so that the production of the materials shall be considered to have been performed by that exporter or producer.

# Statement required; information as to net cost and value of non-originating materials from production of material if accumulating for regional value content requirement
(2) Where a good is subject to a regional value-content requirement and an exporter or producer of the good has a statement signed by a producer of a material that is used in the production of the good that
(a) states the net cost incurred and the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the material in the production of that material,
(i) the net cost incurred by the producer of the good with respect to the material shall be the net cost incurred by the producer of the material plus, where not included in the net cost incurred by the producer of the material, the costs referred to in sections 7(1)(c) through (e), and
(ii) the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the good with respect to the material shall be the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the material; or
(b) states any amount, other than an amount that includes any of the value of non-originating materials, that is part of the net cost incurred by the producer of the material in the production of that material,
(i) the net cost incurred by the producer of the good with respect to the material shall be the value of the material, determined in accordance with section 7(1), and
(ii) the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the good with respect to the material shall be the value of the material, determined in accordance with section 7(1), minus the amount stated in the statement.

# Averaging of costs from accumulated production
(3) Where a good is subject to a regional value-content requirement and an exporter or producer of the good does not have a statement described in subsection (2) but has a statement signed by a producer of a material that is used in the production of the good that
(a) states the sum of the net costs incurred and the sum of the values of non-originating materials used by the producer of the material in the production of that material and identical materials or similar materials, or any combination thereof, produced in a single plant by the producer of the material over a month or any consecutive three, six or twelve month period that falls within the fiscal year of the producer of the good, divided by the number of units of materials with respect to which the statement is made,
(i) the net cost incurred by the producer of the good with respect to the material shall be the sum of the net costs incurred by the producer of the material with respect to that material and the identical materials or similar materials, divided by the number of units of materials with respect to which the statement is made, plus, where not included in the net costs incurred by the producer of the material, the costs referred to in sections 7(1) (c) through (e), and
(ii) the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the good with respect to the material shall be the sum of the values of non-originating materials used by the producer of the material with respect to that material and the identical materials or similar materials divided by the number of units of materials with respect to which the statement is made; or
(b) states any amount, other than an amount that includes any of the values of non-originating materials, that is part of the sum of the net costs incurred by the producer of the material in the production of that material and identical materials or similar materials, or any combination thereof, produced in a single plant by the producer of the material over a month or any consecutive three, six or twelve month period that falls within the fiscal year of the producer of the good, divided by the number of units of materials with respect to which the statement is made,
(i) the net cost incurred by the producer of the good with respect to the material
shall be the value of the material, determined in accordance with section 7(1), and
(ii) the value of non-originating materials used by the producer of the good with respect to the material shall be the value of the material, determined in accordance with section 7(1), minus the amount stated in the statement.

# Accumulated production considered to be production of a single producer
(4) For purposes of section 7(4), where a producer of the good chooses to accumulate the production of materials under subsection (1), that production shall be considered to be the production of the producer of the good.
(5) For purposes of this section,
(a) in order to accumulate the production of a material,
(i) where the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement, the producer of the good must have a statement described in subsection (2) or (3) that is signed by the producer of the material, and
(ii) where an applicable change in tariff classification is applied to determine whether the good is an originating good, the producer of the good must have a statement signed by the producer of the material that states the tariff classification of all non-originating materials used by that producer in the production of that material and that the production of the material took place entirely in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries;
(b) a producer of a good who chooses to accumulate is not required to accumulate the production of all materials that are incorporated into the good; and
(c) any information set out in a statement referred to in subsection (2) or (3) that concerns the value of materials or costs shall be in the same currency as the currency of the country in which the person who provided the statement is located.

# Examples of accumulation of production
(6) Each of the following examples is an “Example” as referred to in section 2(4).
Example 1:
section 14(1)
Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, imports unfinished bearing rings provided for in subheading 8482.99 into NAFTA country A from a non-NAFTA territory. Producer A further processes the unfinished bearing rings into finished bearing rings, which are of the same subheading. The finished bearing rings of Producer A do not satisfy an applicable change in tariff classification and therefore do not qualify as originating goods. The net cost of the finished bearing rings (per unit) is calculated as follows:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
$0.15
Value of non-originating materials
0.75
Other product costs
0.35
Period costs: (including $0.05 in excluded costs)
0.15
Other costs
0.05
Total cost of the finished bearing rings, per unit
$1.45
Excluded costs: (included in period costs)
0.05
Net cost of the finished bearing rings, per unit
$1.40
Producer A sells the finished bearing rings to Producer B who is located in NAFTA country A for $1.50 each. Producer B further processes them into bearings, and intends to export the bearings to NAFTA country B. Although the bearings satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification, the bearings are subject to a regional value-content requirement.
Situation A:
Producer B does not choose to accumulate costs incurred by Producer A with respect to the bearing rings used in the production of the bearings. The net cost of the bearings (per unit) is calculated as follows:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
$0.45
Value of non-originating materials (value, per unit, of the bearing rings purchased from Producer A)
1.50
Other product costs
0.75
Period costs: (including $0.05 in excluded costs)
0.15
Other costs
0.05
Total cost of the bearings, per unit
$2.90
Excluded costs: (included in period costs)
0.05
Net cost of the bearings, per unit
$2.85
Under the net cost method, the regional value content of the bearings is
ER06SE95.006
Therefore, the bearings are non-originating goods.
Situation B:
Producer B chooses to accumulate costs incurred by Producer A with respect to the bearing rings used in the production of the bearings. Producer A provides a statement described in section 14(2)(a) to Producer B. The net cost of the bearings (per unit) is calculated as follows:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials ($0.45 + $0.15)
$0.60
Value of non-originating materials (value, per unit, of the unfinished bearing rings imported by Producer A)
0.75
Other product costs ($0.75 + $0.35)
1.10
Period costs: (($0.15 + $0.15), including $0.10 in excluded costs)
0.30
Other costs: ($0.05 + $0.05)
0.10
Total cost of the bearings, per unit
$2.85
Excluded costs: (included in period costs)
0.10
Net cost of the bearings, per unit
$2.75
Under the net cost method, the regional value content of the bearings is
ER06SE95.007
Therefore, the bearings are originating goods.
Situation C:
Producer B chooses to accumulate costs incurred by Producer A with respect to the bearing rings used in the production of the bearings. Producer A provides to Producer B a statement described in section 14(2)(b) that specifies an amount equal to the net cost minus the value of non-originating materials used to produce the finished bearing rings ($1.40−$0.75 = $0.65). The net cost of the bearings (per unit) is calculated as follows:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials ($0.45 + $0.65)
$1.10
Value of non-originating materials ($1.50−$0.65)
0.85
Other product costs
0.75
Period costs: (including $0.05 in excluded costs)
0.15
Other costs
0.05
Total cost of the bearings, per unit
$2.90
Excluded costs: (included in period costs)
0.05
Net cost of the bearings, per unit
$2.85
Under the net cost method, the regional value content of the bearings is
ER06SE95.008
Therefore, the bearings are originating goods.
Situation D:
Producer B chooses to accumulate costs incurred by Producer A with respect to the bearing rings used in the production of the bearings. Producer A provides to Producer B a statement described in section 14(2)(b) that specifies an amount equal to the value of other product costs used in the production of the finished bearing rings ($0.35). The net cost of the bearings (per unit) is calculated as follows:
Product costs:
Value of originating materials
$0.45
Value of non-originating materials ($1.50−$0.35)
1.15
Other product costs ($0.75 + $0.35)
1.10
Period costs: (including $0.05 in excluded costs)
0.15
Other costs
0.05
Total cost of the bearings, per unit
$2.90
Excluded costs: (included in period costs)
0.05
Net cost of the bearings, per unit
$2.85
Under the net cost method, the regional value content of the bearings is
ER06SE95.009
Therefore, the bearings are originating goods.
Example 2:
section 14(1)
Producer A, located in NAFTA country A, imports non-originating cotton, carded or combed, provided for in heading 5203 for use in the production of cotton yarn provided for in heading 5205. Because the change from cotton, carded or combed, to cotton yarn is a change within the same chapter, the cotton does not satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification for heading 5205, which is a change from any other chapter, with certain exceptions. Therefore, the cotton yarn that Producer A produces from non-originating cotton is a non-originating good.
Producer A then sells the non-originating cotton yarn to Producer B, also located in NAFTA country A, who uses the cotton yarn in the production of woven fabric of cotton provided for in heading 5208. The change from non-originating cotton yarn to woven fabric of cotton is insufficient to satisfy the applicable change in tariff classification for heading 5208, which is a change from any heading outside headings 5208 through 5212, except from certain headings, under which various yarns, including cotton yarn provided for in heading 5205, are classified. Therefore, the woven fabric of cotton that Producer B produces from non-originating cotton yarn produced by Producer A is a non-originating good.
However, under section 14(1), if Producer B chooses to accumulate the production of Producer A, the production of Producer A would be considered to have been performed by Producer B. The rule for heading 5208, under which the cotton fabric is classified, does not exclude a change from heading 5203, under which carded or combed cotton is classified. Therefore, under section 15(1), the change from carded or combed cotton provided for in heading 5203 to the woven fabric of cotton provided for in heading 5208 would satisfy the applicable change of tariff classification for heading 5208. The woven fabric of cotton would be considered as an originating good.
Producer B, in order to choose to accumulate Producer A's production, must have a statement described in section 14(4)(a)(ii).

# SECTION 15. INABILITY TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION

# Supplier of material unable to provide information; beyond control of supplier; procedure to be followed by Customs
(1) Where, during a verification of origin of a good, the person from whom a producer of the good acquired a material used in the production of that good is unable to provide the customs administration that is conducting the verification with sufficient information to substantiate that the material is an originating material or that the value of the material declared for purpose of calculating the regional value content of the good is accurate, and the inability of that person to provide the information is due to reasons beyond the control of that person, the customs administration shall, before making a determination as to the origin or value of the material, consider, where relevant, the following:
(a) whether the customs administration of the NAFTA country into the territory of
which the good was imported issued an advance ruling under Article 509 of the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA country, with respect to that material that concluded that the material is an originating material or that the value of the material declared for purposes of calculating the regional value content of the good is accurate;
(b) whether an independent auditor has confirmed the accuracy of
(i) any signed statement referred to in this appendix with respect to the material,
(ii) the information that was used by the person from whom the producer acquired the material to substantiate whether the material is an originating material, or
(iii) the information submitted by the producer of the material with an application for an advance ruling where, on the basis of that information, the customs administration concluded that the material is an originating material or that the value declared for the purpose of calculating the regional value content of the good is accurate;
(c) whether the customs administration has, before the start of the origin verification of the good, conducted a verification of origin of identical materials or similar materials produced by the producer of the material and determined that
(i) the identical materials or similar materials are originating materials, or
(ii) any signed statement referred to in this appendix with respect to those identical materials or similar materials is accurate;
(d) whether the producer of the good has exercised due diligence to ensure that any signed statement that is referred to in this appendix with respect to the material and that was provided by the person from whom the producer acquired the material is accurate;
(e) where the customs administration has access only to partial records of the person from whom the producer acquired the material, whether the records provide sufficient evidence to substantiate that the material is an originating material or that the value of the material declared for purposes of calculating the regional value content of the good is accurate;
(f) whether the customs administration can obtain, subject to Article 507 of the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA country, by means other than those referred to in paragraphs (a) through (e), relevant information regarding the determination of the origin or value of the material from the customs administration of the NAFTA country in the territory of which the person from whom the producer acquired the material was located; and
(g) whether the producer of the good, the person from whom the producer acquired the material or a representative of that person or producer agrees to bear the expenses incurred in providing the customs administration with the assistance that it may require for determining the origin or value of the material.

# “Reasons beyond control” of supplier
(2) For purposes of subsection (1), “reasons beyond the control” of the person from whom the producer of the good acquired the material includes
(a) the bankruptcy of the person from whom the producer acquired the material or any other financial distress situation or business reorganization that resulted in that person or a related person having lost control of the records containing the information that substantiate that the material is an originating material or the value of the material declared for the purpose of calculating the regional value content of the good;
(b) any other reason that results in partial or complete loss of records of that producer that the producer could not reasonably have been expected to foresee, including loss of records due to fire, flooding or other natural cause.

# Exporter or producer of good unable to provide information; reasons beyond control of exporter or producer; procedure to be followed by Customs
(3) Where, during a verification of origin of a good, the exporter or producer of the good is unable to provide the customs administration conducting the verification with sufficient information to substantiate that the good is an originating good, and the inability of that person to provide the information is due to reasons beyond the control of that person, the customs administration shall, before making a determination as to the origin of the good, consider, where relevant, the following:
(a) whether the customs administration of the NAFTA country into the territory of which the good was imported issued an advance ruling under Article 509 of the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA country, with respect to that good that concluded that the good is an originating good;
(b) whether an independent auditor has confirmed the accuracy of an origin statement with respect to the good;
(c) whether the customs administration has, before the start of the origin verification of the good, conducted a verification of origin of identical goods or similar goods produced by the producer of the good and determined that the identical
goods or similar goods are originating goods;
(d) whether the exporter or producer of the good has exercised due diligence to ensure that the information provided to substantiate that the good is an originating good is sufficient; and
(e) where the customs administration has access only to partial records of the exporter or producer of the good, whether the records provide sufficient evidence to substantiate that the good is an originating good;
(f) whether the customs administration can obtain, subject to Article 507 of the Agreement, as implemented in each NAFTA country, by means other than those referred to in paragraphs (a) through (e), relevant information regarding the determination of the origin of the good from the customs administration of the NAFTA country in the territory of which the exporter or producer of the good was located; and
(g) whether the exporter or producer of the good or a representative of that person agrees to bear the expenses incurred in providing the customs administration with the assistance that it may require for determining the origin or value of the good.

# “Reasons beyond control”
(4) For purposes of subsection (3), “reasons beyond the control” of the exporter or producer of the good includes
(a) the bankruptcy of the exporter or producer or any other financial distress situation or business reorganization that resulted in that person or a related person having lost control of the records containing the information that substantiate that the good is an originating good;
(b) any other reason that results in partial or complete loss of records of that exporter or producer that that person could not reasonably have been expected to foresee, including loss of records due to fire, flooding or other natural cause.

# SECTION 16. TRANSSHIPMENT

# Effect of subsequent processing outside the territory of a NAFTA country; loss of originating good status
(1) A good is not an originating good by reason of having undergone production that occurs entirely in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries that would enable the good to qualify as an originating good if subsequent to that production
(a) the good is withdrawn from customs control outside the territories of the NAFTA countries; or
(b) the good undergoes further production or any other operation outside the territories of the NAFTA countries, other than unloading, reloading or any other operation necessary to preserve the good in good condition, such as inspection, removal of dust that accumulates during shipment, ventilation, spreading out or drying, chilling, replacing salt, sulphur dioxide or other aqueous solutions, replacing damaged packing materials and containers and removal of units of the good that are spoiled or damaged and present a danger to the remaining units of the good, or to transport the good to the territory of a NAFTA country.

# Transshipped good considered entirely non-originating
(2) A good that is a non-originating good by application of subsection (1) is considered to be entirely non-originating for purposes of this appendix.

# Exceptions for certain goods
(3) Subsection (1) does not apply with respect to:
(a) a “smart card” of subheading 8523.52, containing a single integrated circuit, where any further production or other operation that that good undergoes outside the territories of the NAFTA countries does not result in a change in the tariff classification of the good to any other subheading;
(b) a good of any of subheadings 8541.10 through 8541.60 or subheadings 8542.31 through 8542.39, where any further production or other operation that that good undergoes outside the territories of the NAFTA countries does not result in a change in the tariff classification of the good to a subheading outside subheadings 8541.10 through 8542.90;
(c) an electronic microassembly of subheading 8543.70, where any further production or other operation that that good undergoes outside the territories of the NAFTA countries does not result in a change in the tariff classification of the good to any other subheading; or
(d) an electronic microassembly of subheading 8548.90, where any further production or other operation that that good undergoes outside the territories of the NAFTA countries does not result in a change in the tariff classification of the good to any other subheading.

# SECTION 17. NON-QUALIFYING OPERATIONS

# Mere dilution; production or pricing practice to circumvent the provisions of this appendix
17. A good is not an originating good merely by reason of
(a) mere dilution with water or another substance that does not materially alter the characteristics of the good; or
(b) any production or pricing practice with respect to which it may be demonstrated, on the basis of a preponderance of evidence, that the object was to circumvent this appendix.

# SCHEDULE I
Schedule I shall be the text of Annex 401 to the Agreement as implemented in General Note 12 of the HTSUS.

# SCHEDULE II

# VALUE OF GOODS

# SECTION 1. Definitions.
For purposes of this Schedule, unless otherwise stated:
“buyer” refers to a person who purchases a good from the producer;
“buying commissions” means fees paid by a buyer to that buyer's agent for the agent's services in representing the buyer in the purchase of a good;
“producer” refers to the producer of the good being valued.

# SECTION 2.
For purposes of Article 402(2) of the Agreement, as implemented by section 6(2) of this appendix, the transaction value of a good shall be the price actually paid or payable for the good, determined in accordance with section 3 and adjusted in accordance with section 4.

# SECTION 3.
(1) The price actually paid or payable is the total payment made or to be made by the buyer to or for the benefit of the producer. The payment need not necessarily take the form of a transfer of money; it may be made by letters of credit or negotiable instruments. The payment may be made directly or indirectly to the producer. For an illustration of this, the settlement by the buyer, whether in whole or in part, of a debt owed by the producer is an indirect payment.
(2) Activities undertaken by the buyer on the buyer's own account, other than those for which an adjustment is provided in section 4, shall not be considered to be an indirect payment, even though the activities might be regarded as being for the benefit of the producer. For an illustration of this, the buyer, by agreement with the producer, undertakes activities relating to the marketing of the good. The costs of such activities shall not be added to the price actually paid or payable.
(3) The transaction value shall not include the following charges or costs, provided that they are distinguished from the price actually paid or payable:
(a) charges for construction, erection, assembly, maintenance or technical assistance related to the good undertaken after the good has been sold to the buyer; or
(b) duties and taxes paid in the country in which the buyer is located with respect to the good.
(4) The flow of dividends or other payments from the buyer to the producer that do not relate to the purchase of the good are not part of the transaction value.

# SECTION 4.
(1) In determining the transaction value of a good, the following shall be added to the price actually paid or payable:
(a) to the extent that they are incurred by the buyer, or by a related person on behalf of the buyer, with respect to the good being valued and are not included in the price actually paid or payable
(i) commissions and brokerage fees, except buying commissions,
(ii) the costs of transporting the good to the producer's point of direct shipment and the costs of loading, unloading, handling and insurance that are associated with that transportation, and
(iii) where the packaging materials and containers in which the good is packaged for retail sale are classified with the good under the Harmonized System, the value of the packaging materials and containers;
(b) the value, reasonably allocated in accordance with subsection (12), of the following elements where they are supplied directly or indirectly to the producer by the buyer, free of charge or at reduced cost for use in connection with the production and sale of the good, to the extent that the value is not included in the price actually paid or payable:
(i) a material, other than an indirect material, used in the production of the good,
(ii) tools, dies, molds and similar indirect materials used in the production of the good,
(iii) an indirect material, other than those referred to in subparagraph (ii) or in paragraphs (c), (e) or (f) of the definition “indirect material” set out in Article 415 of the Agreement, as implemented by section 2(1) of this appendix, used in the production of the good, and
(iv) engineering, development, artwork, design work, and plans and sketches necessary for the production of the good, regardless of where performed;
(c) the royalties related to the good, other than charges with respect to the right to reproduce the good in the territory of one or more of the NAFTA countries, that the buyer must pay directly or indirectly as a condition of sale of the good, to the extent that such royalties are not included in the price actually paid or payable; and
(d) the value of any part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of the good that accrues directly or indirectly to the producer.
(2) The additions referred to in subsection (1) shall be made to the price actually paid or payable under this section only on the basis of objective and quantifiable data.
(3) Where objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable under subsection (1), the transaction value cannot be determined under section 2.
(4) No additions shall be made to the price actually paid or payable for the purpose of determining the transaction value except as provided in this section.
(5) The amounts to be added under subsections (1)(a) (i) and (ii) shall be
(a) those amounts that are recorded on the books of the buyer, or
(b) where those amounts are costs incurred by a related person on behalf of the buyer and are not recorded on the books of the buyer, those amounts that are recorded on the books of that related person.
(6) The value of the packaging materials and containers referred to in subsection (1)(a)(iii) and the value of the elements referred to in subsection (1)(b)(i) shall be
(a) where the packaging materials and containers or the elements are imported from outside the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located, the customs value of the packaging materials and containers or the elements,
(b) where the buyer, or a related person on behalf of the buyer, purchases the packaging materials and containers or the elements from an unrelated person in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located, the price actually paid or payable for the packaging materials and containers or the elements,
(c) where the buyer, or a related person on behalf of the buyer, acquires the packaging materials and containers or the elements from an unrelated person in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located other than through a purchase, the value of the consideration related to the acquisition of the packaging materials and containers or the elements, based on the cost of the consideration that is recorded on the books of the buyer or the related person, or
(d) where the packaging materials and containers or the elements are produced by the buyer, or by a related person, in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the producer is located, the total cost of the packaging materials and containers or the elements, determined in accordance with subsection (7),
and shall include the following costs that are recorded on the books of the buyer or the related person supplying the packaging materials and containers or the elements on behalf of the buyer, to the extent that such costs are not included under paragraphs (a) through (d):
(e) the costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the packaging materials and containers or the elements to the location of the producer,
(f) duties and taxes paid or payable with respect to the packaging materials and containers or the elements, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, including credit against duty or tax paid or payable,
(g) customs brokerage fees, including the cost of in-house customs brokerage services, incurred with respect to the packaging materials and containers or the elements, and
(h) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the packaging materials and containers or the elements in the production of the good, less the value of renewable scrap or by-product.
(7) For purposes of subsection (6)(d), the total cost of the packaging materials and containers referred to in subsection (1)(a)(iii) or the elements referred to in subsection (1)(b)(i) shall be
(a) where the packaging materials and containers or the elements are produced by the buyer, at the choice of the buyer,
(i) the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by the buyer, calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of the buyer, that can be reasonably allocated to the packaging materials and containers or the elements in accordance with Schedule VII, or
(ii) the aggregate of each cost incurred by the buyer that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the packaging materials and containers or the elements, calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of the buyer, that can be reasonably allocated to the packaging materials and containers or the elements in accordance with Schedule VII; and
(b) where the packaging materials and containers or the elements are produced by a person who is related to the buyer, at the choice of the buyer,
(i) the total cost incurred with respect to all goods produced by that related person, calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of that person, that can be reasonably allocated to the packaging materials and containers or the elements in accordance with Schedule VII, or
(ii) the aggregate of each cost incurred by that related person that forms part of
the total cost incurred with respect to the packaging materials and containers or the elements, calculated on the basis of the costs that are recorded on the books of that person, that can be reasonably allocated to the packaging materials and containers or the elements in accordance with Schedule VII.
(8) Except as provided in subsections (10) and (11), the value of the elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) through (iv) shall be
(a) the cost of those elements that is recorded on the books of the buyer, or
(b) where such elements are provided by another person on behalf of the buyer and the cost is not recorded on the books of the buyer, the cost of those elements that is recorded on the books of that other person.
(9) Where the elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) through (iv) were previously used by or on behalf of the buyer, the value of the elements shall be adjusted downward to reflect that use.
(10) Where the elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (iii) were leased by the buyer or a person related to the buyer, the value of the elements shall be the cost of the lease as recorded on the books of the buyer or that related person.
(11) No addition shall be made to the price actually paid or payable for the elements referred to in subsection (1)(b)(iv) that are available in the public domain, other than the cost of obtaining copies of them.
(12) The producer shall choose the method of allocating to the good the value of the elements referred to in subsections (1)(b)(ii) through (iv), provided that the value is reasonably allocated to the good in a manner appropriate to the circumstances. The methods the producer may choose to allocate the value include allocating the value over the number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment or allocating the value over the entire anticipated production where contracts or firm commitments exist for that production. For an illustration of this, a buyer provides the producer with a mold to be used in the production of the good and contracts with the producer to buy 10,000 units of that good. By the time the first shipment of 1,000 units arrives, the producer has already produced 4,000 units. In these circumstances, the producer may choose to allocate the value of the mold over 4,000 units or 10,000 units but shall not choose to allocate the value of the elements to the first shipment of 1,000 units. The producer may choose to allocate the entire value of the elements to a single shipment of a good only where that single shipment comprises all of the units of the good acquired by the buyer under the contract or commitment for that number of units of the good between the producer and the buyer.
(13) The addition for the royalties referred to in subsection (1)(c) shall be the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of the buyer, or where the payment for the royalties is recorded on the books of another person, the payment for the royalties that is recorded on the books of that other person.
(14) The value of the proceeds referred to in subsection (1)(d) shall be the amount that is recorded for such proceeds on the books of the buyer or the producer.

# SCHEDULE III

# UNACCEPTABLE TRANSACTION VALUE

# SECTION 1. Definitions.
For purposes of this Schedule, unless otherwise stated
“buyer” refers to a person who purchases a good from the producer;
“customs administration” refers to the customs administration of the NAFTA country into whose territory the good being valued is imported;
“producer” refers to the producer of the good being valued.

# SECTION 2.
(1) There is no transaction value for a good where the good is not the subject of a sale.
(2) The transaction value of a good is unacceptable where
(a) there are restrictions on the disposition or use of the good by the buyer, other than restrictions that
(i) are imposed or required by law or by the public authorities in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the buyer is located,
(ii) limit the geographical area in which the good may be resold, or
(iii) do not substantially affect the value of the good;
(b) the sale or price actually paid or payable is subject to a condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the good;
(c) part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of the good by the buyer will accrue directly or indirectly to the producer, and an appropriate addition to the price actually paid or payable cannot be made in accordance with section 4(1)(d) of Schedule II; or
(d) except as provided in section 3, the producer and the buyer are related persons and the relationship between them influenced the price actually paid or payable for the good.
(3) The conditions or considerations referred to in subsection (2)(b) include the following circumstances:
(a) the producer establishes the price actually paid or payable for the good on condition that the buyer will also buy other goods in specified quantities;
(b) the price actually paid or payable for the good is dependent on the price or prices
at which the buyer sells other goods to the producer of the good; and
(c) the price actually paid or payable is established on the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the good, such as where the good is a semi-finished good that has been provided by the producer to the buyer on condition that the producer will receive a specified quantity of the finished good from the buyer.
(4) For purposes of subsection (2)(b), conditions or considerations relating to the production or marketing of the good shall not render the transaction value unacceptable, such as where the buyer undertakes on the buyer's own account, even though by agreement with the producer, activities relating to the marketing of the good.
(5) Where objective and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to be made to the price actually paid or payable under section 4(1) of Schedule II, the transaction value cannot be determined under the provisions of section 2 of that Schedule. For an illustration of this, a royalty is paid on the basis of the price actually paid or payable in a sale of a liter of a particular good that was purchased by the kilogram and made up into a solution. If the royalty is based partially on the purchased good and partially on other factors that have nothing to do with that good, such as when the purchased good is mixed with other ingredients and is no longer separately identifiable, or when the royalty cannot be distinguished from special financial arrangements between the producer and the buyer, it would be inappropriate to add the royalty and the transaction value of the good could not be determined. However, if the amount of the royalty is based only on the purchased good and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable can be made and the transaction value can be determined.

# SECTION 3.
(1) In determining whether the transaction value is unacceptable under section 2(2)(d), the fact that the producer and the buyer are related persons shall not in itself be grounds for the customs administration to render the transaction value unacceptable. In such cases, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted provided that the relationship between the producer and the buyer did not influence the price actually paid or payable. Where the customs administration has reasonable grounds for considering that the relationship between the producer and the buyer influenced the price, the customs administration shall communicate the grounds to the producer, and that producer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the grounds communicated by the customs administration. If that producer so requests, the customs administration shall communicate in writing the grounds on which it considers that the relationship between the producer and the buyer influenced the price actually paid or payable.
(2) Subsection (1) provides that, where the producer and the buyer are related persons, the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted as the value provided that the relationship between the producer and the buyer did not influence the price actually paid or payable. It is not intended under subsection (1) that there should be an examination of the circumstances in all cases where the producer and the buyer are related persons. Such an examination will only be required where the customs administration has doubts that the price actually paid or payable is acceptable because of the relationship between the producer and the buyer. Where the customs administration does not have doubts that the price actually paid or payable is acceptable, it shall accept that price without requesting further information. For an illustration of this, the customs administration may have previously examined the relationship between the producer and the buyer, or it may already have detailed information concerning the relationship between the producer and the buyer, and may already be satisfied from that examination or information that the relationship between them did not influence the price actually paid or payable.
(3) In applying subsection (1), where the producer and the buyer are related persons and the customs administration has doubts that the transaction value is acceptable without further inquiry, the customs administration shall give the producer an opportunity to supply such further information as may be necessary to enable it to examine the circumstances surrounding the sale. In such a case, the customs administration shall examine the relevant aspects of the sale, including the way in which the producer and the buyer organize their commercial relations and the way in which the price actually paid or payable for the good being valued was arrived at, in order to determine whether the relationship between the producer and the buyer influenced that price actually paid or payable. Where it can be shown that the producer and the buyer buy from and sell to each other as if they were not related persons, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between them. For an illustration of this, if the price actually paid or payable for the good had been settled in a manner consistent with the normal pricing practices of the industry in
question or with the way in which the producer settles prices for sales to unrelated buyers, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between the buyer and the producer. As another illustration, where it is shown that the price actually paid or payable for the good is adequate to ensure recovery of the total cost of producing the good plus a profit that is representative of the producer's overall profit realized over a representative period of time, such as on an annual basis, in sales of goods of the same class or kind, the price actually paid or payable shall be considered as not having been influenced by the relationship between the producer and the buyer.
(4) In a sale between a producer and a buyer who are related persons, the transaction value shall be accepted and determined in accordance with section 2 of Schedule II wherever the producer demonstrates that the transaction value of the good in that sale closely approximates a test value referred to in subsection (5).
(5) The value to be used as a test value shall be the transaction value of identical goods or similar goods sold at or about the same time as the good being valued is sold to an unrelated buyer who is located in the territory of the NAFTA country in which the buyer is located.
(6) In applying a test value referred to in subsection (4), due account shall be taken of demonstrated differences in commercial levels, quantity levels, the value of the elements specified in section 4(1)(b) of Schedule II and the costs incurred by the producer in sales to unrelated buyers that are not incurred by the producer in sales to a related person.
(7) The application of the test value referred to in subsection (4) shall be used at the initiative of the producer and shall be used only for comparison purposes to determine whether the transaction value of the good is acceptable. The test value shall not be used as the transaction value of that good.
(8) Subsection (4) provides an opportunity for the producer to demonstrate that the transaction value closely approximates a test value previously accepted by the customs administration, and is therefore acceptable under subsections (1) and (4). Where the application of a test value under subsection (4) demonstrates that the transaction value of the good being valued is acceptable, the customs administration shall not examine the question of influence in regard to the relationship between the producer and the buyer under subsection (1). Where the customs administration already has sufficient information available, without further inquiries, that the transaction value closely approximates a test value referred to in subsection (4), the producer is not required to apply a test value to demonstrate that the transaction value is acceptable under that subsection.
(9) A number of factors must be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining whether the transaction value of the identical goods or similar goods closely approximates the transaction value of the good being valued. These factors include the nature of the good, the nature of the industry itself, the season in which the good is sold, and whether the difference in values is commercially significant. Since these factors may vary from case to case, it would be impossible to apply an acceptable standardized difference such as a fixed amount or fixed percentage difference in each case. For an illustration of this, a small difference in value in a case involving one type of good could be unacceptable, while a large difference in a case involving another type of good might be acceptable for the purposes of determining whether the transaction value closely approximates a test value set out in subsection (4).

# ADDENDUM A

# COST RATIO METHOD
Calculation of Cost Ratio
For the overhead to be allocated, the producer may choose one or more allocation bases that reflect a relationship between the overhead and the good based on the criterion of benefit, cause or ability to bear.
With respect to each allocation base that is chosen by the producer for allocating overhead, a cost ratio is calculated for each good produced by the producer in accordance with the following formula:
ER06SE95.010
where
CR is the cost ratio with respect to the good;
AB is the allocation base for the good; and
TAB is the total allocation base for all the goods produced by the producer.
Allocation to a Good of Costs Included in Overhead
The costs with respect to which an allocation base is chosen are allocated to a good in accordance with the following formula:

# CAG = CA × CR
where
CAG is the costs allocated to the good;
CA is the costs to be allocated; and
CR is the cost ratio with respect to the good.
Excluded Costs
Under section 6(11)(b) of this appendix, where excluded costs are included in costs to be allocated to a good, the cost ratio used to allocate that cost to the good is used to determine the amount of excluded costs to be subtracted from the costs allocated to the good.
Allocation Bases for Costs
The following is a non-exhaustive list of allocation bases that may be used by the producer to calculate cost ratios:
Direct Labor Hours
Direct Labor Costs
Units Produced
Machine-hours
Sales Dollars or Pesos
Floor Space
“Examples”
The following examples illustrate the application of the cost ratio method to costs included in overhead.
Example 1:
Direct Labor Hours
A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate overhead on the basis of direct labor hours spent to produce Good A and Good B. A total of 8,000 direct labor hours have been spent to produce Good A and Good B: 5,000 hours with respect to Good A and 3,000 hours with respect to Good B. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000.
Calculation of the Ratios:
Good A: 5,000 hours/8,000 hours = .625
Good B: 3,000 hours/8,000 hours = .375
Allocation of overhead to Good A and Good B:
Good A: $6,000,000 × .625 = $3,750,000
Good B: $6,000,000 × .375 = $2,250,000
Example 2:
Direct Labor Costs
A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate overhead on the basis of direct labor costs incurred in the production of Good A and Good B. The total direct labor costs incurred in the production of Good A and Good B is $60,000: $50,000 with respect to Good A and $10,000 with respect to Good B. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000.
Calculation of the Ratios:
Good A: $50,000/$60,000 = .833
Good B: $10,000/$60,000 = .167
Allocation of Overhead to Good A and Good B:
Good A: $6,000,000 × .833 = $4,998,000
Good B: $6,000,000 × .167 = $1,002,000
Example 3:
Units Produced
A producer of Good A and Good B may allocate overhead on the basis of units produced. The total units of Good A and Good B produced is 150,000: 100,000 units of Good A and 50,000 units of Good B. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000.
Calculation of the Ratios:
Good A: 100,000 units/150,000 units = .667
Good B: 50,000 units/150,000 units = .333
Allocation of Overhead to Good A and Good B:
Good A: $6,000,000 × .667 = $4,002,000
Good B: $6,000,000 × .333 = $1,998,000
Example 4:
Machine-hours
A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate machine-related overhead on the basis of machine-hours utilized in the production of Good A and Good B. The total machine-hours utilized for the production of Good A and Good B is 3,000 hours: 1,200 hours
with respect to Good A and 1,800 hours with respect to Good B. The amount of machine-related overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000.
Calculation of the Ratios:
Good A: 1,200 machine-hours/3,000 machine-hours = .40
Good B: 1,800 machine-hours/3,000 machine-hours = .60
Allocation of Machine-Related Overhead to Good A and Good B:
Good A: $6,000,000 × .40 = $2,400,000
Good B: $6,000,000 × .60 = $3,600,000
Example 5:
Sales Dollars or Pesos
A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate overhead on the basis of sales dollars. The producer sold 2,000 units of Good A at $4,000 and 200 units of Good B at $3,000. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000.
Total Sales Dollars for Good A and Good B:
Good A: $4,000 × 2,000 = $8,000,000
Good B: $3,000 × 200 = $600,000
Total Sales Dollars: $8,000,000 + $600,000 = $8,600,000
Calculation of the Ratios:
Good A: $8,000,000/$8,600,000 = .93
Good B: $600,000/$8,600,000 = .07
Allocation of Overhead to Good A and Good B:
Good A: $6,000,000 × .93 = $5,580,000
Good B: $6,000,000 × .07 = $420,000
Example 6:
Floor Space
A producer who produces Good A and Good B may allocate overhead relating to utilities (heat, water and electricity) on the basis of floor space used in the production and storage of Good A and Good B. The total floor space used in the production and storage of Good A and Good B is 100,000 square feet: 40,000 square feet with respect to Good A and 60,000 square feet with respect to Good B. The amount of overhead to be allocated is $6,000,000.
Calculation of the Ratios:
Good A: 40,000 square feet/100,000 square feet = .40
Good B: 60,000 square feet/100,000 square feet = .60
Allocation of Overhead (Utilities) to Good A and Good B:
Good A: $6,000,000 × .40 = $2,400,000
Good B: $6,000,000 × .60 = $3,600,000
