(i) In 1986, D, a distributor, properly elects under section 458 of the Code not to include in its gross income in the year of sale, income attributable to qualified sales of paperback books returned within the specified statutory merchandise return period of four months and 15 days. D and R, a retailer, agree that D shall provide a full refund for paperback books that R purchases from it and is unable to resell. D and R also have agreed that the merchandise must be returned to D within four months following the original sale. The agreement constitutes a legal obligation. D is similarly entitled to a full refund from P, the publisher, for the same paperback books. In 1990, during the merchandise return period, R returns paperback books to D representing $100 of 1989 sales. D's cost relating to these sales is $50. Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, D must decrease its costs of goods sold by $50. D's proper amount excluded from its 1989 gross income under section 458 is $50 resulting from adjustments to sales and costs of sales ($100—$50).
(ii) If D is instead only entitled to a 50 percent refund from P, D is required under paragraph (g)(1) of this section to decrease its costs of goods sold by $25, the amount of refund from P. D's proper amount excluded from its 1989 gross income under section 458 is $75, resulting from adjustments to sales and cost of sales ($100—$25).

§ 1.458-2
Manner of and time for making election.
(a)
Scope.
For taxable years beginning after September 30, 1979, section 458 provides a special method of accounting for taxpayers who account for sales of magazines, paperbacks, or records using an accrual method of accounting. In order to use the special method of accounting under section 458, a taxpayer must make an election in the manner prescribed in this section. The election does not require the prior consent of the Internal Revenue Service. The election is effective for the taxable year for which it is made and for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer secures the prior consent of the Internal Revenue Service to revoke such election.
(b)
Separate election for each trade or business.
An election is made with respect to each trade or business of a taxpayer in connection with which qualified sales (as defined in section 458(b)(5)) of a category of merchandise were made. Magazines, paperbacks, and records are each treated as a separate category of merchandise. If qualified sales of two or more categories of merchandise are made in connection with the same trade or business, then solely for purposes of section 458, each category is treated as a separate trade or business. For example, if a taxpayer makes qualified sales of both magazines and paperbacks in the same trade or business, then solely for purposes of section 458, the qualified sales relating to magazines are considered one trade or business and the qualified sales relating to paperbacks are considered a separate trade or business. Thus, if the taxpayer wishes to account under section 458 for the qualified sales of both magazines and paperbacks, such taxpayer must make a separate election for each category.
(c)
Manner of, and time for, making election.
An election is made under section 458 and this section by filing a statement of election containing the information described in paragraph (d) of this section with the taxpayer's income tax return for first taxable year for which the election is made. The election must be made no later than the time prescribed by law (including extensions) for filing the income tax return for the first taxable year for which the election is made. Thus, the election may not be filed with an amended income tax return after the prescribed date (including extensions) for filing the original return for such year.
(d)
Required information.
The statement of election required by paragraph (c) of this section must indicate that an election is being made under section 458(c) and must set forth the following information:
(1) The taxpayer's name, address, and identification number;
(2) A description of each trade or business for which an election is made;
(3) The first taxable year for which an election is made for each trade or business;
(4) The merchandise return period (as defined in section 458(b)(7)) for each trade or business for which an election is made;
(5) With respect to an election that applies to magazines, the amount of the adjustment computed under section 481(a) resulting from the change to the method of accounting described in section 458; and
(6) With respect to an election that applies to paperbacks or records, the initial opening balance (computed in accordance with section 458(e)) in the suspense account for each trade or business for which an election is made.
The statement of election should be made on a Form 3115 which need contain no information other than that required by this paragraph.

§ 1.460-1
Long-term contracts.
(a)
Overview
—(1)
In general.
This section provides rules for determining whether a contract for the manufacture, building, installation, or construction of property is a long-term contract under section 460 and what activities must be accounted for as a single long-term contract. Specific rules for long-term manufacturing and construction contracts are provided in §§ 1.460-2 and 1.460-3, respectively. A taxpayer generally must determine the income from a long-term contract using the percentage-of-completion method described in § 1.460-4(b) (PCM) and the cost allocation rules described in § 1.460-5(b) or (c). In addition, after a contract subject to the PCM is completed, a taxpayer generally must apply the look-back method described in § 1.460-6 to determine the amount of interest owed on any hypothetical underpayment of tax, or earned on any hypothetical overpayment of tax, attributable to accounting for the long-term contract under the PCM.
(2)
Exceptions to required use of PCM
—(i)
Exempt construction contract.
The requirement to use the PCM does not apply to any exempt construction contract described in § 1.460-3(b). Thus, a taxpayer may determine the income from an exempt construction contract using any accounting method permitted by § 1.460-4(c) and, for contracts accounted for using the completed-contract method (CCM), any cost allocation method permitted by § 1.460-5(d). Exempt construction contracts that are not subject to the PCM or CCM are not subject to the cost allocation rules of § 1.460-5 except for the production-period interest rules of § 1.460-5(b)(2)(v). Exempt construction contractors that are large homebuilders described in § 1.460-5(d)(3) must capitalize costs under section 263A. All other exempt construction contractors must account for the cost of construction using the appropriate rules contained in other sections of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations.
(ii)
Qualified ship or residential construction contract.
The requirement to use the PCM applies only to a portion of a
qualified ship contract
described in § 1.460-2(d) or
residential construction contract
described in § 1.460-3(c). A taxpayer generally may determine the income from a qualified ship contract or residential construction contract using the percentage-of-completion/capitalized-cost method (PCCM) described in § 1.460-4(e), but must use a cost allocation method described in § 1.460-5(b) for the entire contract.
(b)
Terms
—(1)
Long-term contract. A long-term contract
generally is any contract for the manufacture, building, installation, or construction of property if the contract is not completed within the contracting year, as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. However, a contract for the manufacture of property is a long-term contract only if it also satisfies either the unique item or 12-month requirements described in § 1.460-2. A contract for the manufacture of personal property is a
manufacturing contract.
In contrast, a contract
for the building, installation, or construction of real property is a
construction contract.
(2)
Contract for the manufacture, building, installation, or construction of property
—(i)
In general.
A contract is a
contract for the manufacture, building, installation, or construction of property
if the manufacture, building, installation, or construction of property is necessary for the taxpayer's contractual obligations to be fulfilled and if the manufacture, building, installation, or construction of that property has not been completed when the parties enter into the contract. If a taxpayer has to manufacture or construct an item to fulfill its obligations under the contract, the fact that the taxpayer is not required to deliver that item to the customer is not relevant. Whether the customer has title to, control over, or bears the risk of loss from, the property manufactured or constructed by the taxpayer also is not relevant. Furthermore, how the parties characterize their agreement (
e.g.,
as a contract for the sale of property) is not relevant.
(ii)
De minimis construction activities.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, a contract is not a construction contract under section 460 if the contract includes the provision of land by the taxpayer and the estimated total allocable contract costs, as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, attributable to the taxpayer's construction activities are less than 10 percent of the contract's total contract price, as defined in § 1.460-4(b)(4)(i). For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii), the allocable contract costs attributable to the taxpayer's construction activities do not include the cost of the land provided to the customer. In addition, a contract's estimated total allocable contract costs include a proportionate share of the estimated cost of any common improvement that benefits the subject matter of the contract if the taxpayer is contractually obligated, or required by law, to construct the common improvement.
(3)
Allocable contract costs. Allocable contract costs
are costs that are allocable to a long-term contract under § 1.460-5.
(4)
Related party.
A
related party
is a person whose relationship to a taxpayer is described in section 707(b) or 267(b), determined without regard to section 267(f)(1)(A) and determined by replacing “at least 80 percent” with “more than 50 percent” for the purposes of determining the ownership of the stock of a corporation in sections 267(b)(2), (8), (10)(A), and (12).
(5)
Contracting year.
The
contracting year
is the taxable year in which a taxpayer enters into a contract as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(6)
Completion year.
The
completion year
is the taxable year in which a taxpayer completes a contract as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(7)
Contract commencement date.
The
contract commencement date
is the date that a taxpayer or related party first incurs any allocable contract costs, such as design and engineering costs, other than expenses attributable to bidding and negotiating activities. Generally, the contract commencement date is relevant in applying § 1.460-6(b)(3) (concerning the de minimis exception to the look-back method under section 460(b)(3)(B)); § 1.460-5(b)(2)(v)(B)(1)(
i
) (concerning the production period subject to interest allocation); § 1.460-2(d) (concerning qualified ship contracts); and § 1.460-3(b)(1)(ii) (concerning the construction period for exempt construction contracts).
(8)
Incurred. Incurred
has the meaning given in § 1.461-1(a)(2) (concerning the taxable year a liability is incurred under the accrual method of accounting), regardless of a taxpayer's overall method of accounting. See § 1.461-4(d)(2)(ii) for economic performance rules concerning the PCM.
(9)
Independent research and development expenses. Independent research and development expenses
are any expenses incurred in the performance of research or development, except that this term does not include any expenses that are directly attributable to a particular long-term contract in existence when the expenses are incurred and this term does not include any expenses under an agreement to perform research or development.
(10)
Long-term contract methods of accounting. Long-term contract methods of accounting,
which include the PCM, the CCM, the PCCM, and the exempt-contract percentage-of-completion method (EPCM), are methods of accounting that may be used only for long-term contracts.
(c)
Entering into and completing long-term contracts
—(1)
In general.
To determine when a contract is entered into under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and completed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a taxpayer must consider all relevant allocable contract costs incurred and activities performed by itself, by related parties on its behalf, and by the customer, that are incident to or necessary for the long-term contract. In addition, to determine whether a contract is completed in the contracting year, the taxpayer may not consider when it expects to complete the contract.
(2)
Date contract entered into
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer enters into a contract on the date that the contract binds both the taxpayer and the customer under applicable law, even if the contract is subject to unsatisfied conditions not within the taxpayer's control (such as obtaining financing). If a taxpayer delays entering into a contract for a principal purpose of avoiding section 460, however, the taxpayer will be treated as having entered into a contract not later than the contract commencement date.
(ii)
Options and change orders.
A taxpayer enters into a new contract on the date that the customer exercises an option or similar provision in a contract if that option or similar provision must be severed from the contract under paragraph (e) of this section. Similarly, a taxpayer enters into a new contract on the date that it accepts a change order or other similar agreement if the change order or other similar agreement must be severed from the contract under paragraph (e) of this section.
(3)
Date contract completed
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer's contract is completed upon the earlier of—
(A) Use of the subject matter of the contract by the customer for its intended purpose (other than for testing) and at least 95 percent of the total allocable contract costs attributable to the subject matter have been incurred by the taxpayer; or
(B) Final completion and acceptance of the subject matter of the contract.
(ii)
Secondary items.
The date a contract accounted for using the CCM is completed is determined without regard to whether one or more secondary items have been used or finally completed and accepted. If any secondary items are incomplete at the end of the taxable year in which the primary subject matter of a contract is completed, the taxpayer must separate the portion of the gross contract price and the allocable contract costs attributable to the incomplete secondary item(s) from the completed contract and account for them using a permissible method of accounting. A permissible method of accounting includes a long-term contract method of accounting only if a separate contract for the secondary item(s) would be a long-term contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(iii)
Subcontracts.
In the case of a subcontract, a subcontractor's customer is the general contractor. Thus, the subject matter of the subcontract is the relevant subject matter under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.
(iv)
Final completion and acceptance
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(3)(iv), to determine whether final completion and acceptance of the subject matter of a contract have occurred, a taxpayer must consider all relevant facts and circumstances. Nevertheless, a taxpayer may not delay the completion of a contract for the principal purpose of deferring federal income tax.
(B)
Contingent compensation.
Final completion and acceptance is determined without regard to any contractual term that provides for additional compensation that is contingent on the successful performance of the subject matter of the contract. A taxpayer must account for all contingent compensation that is not includible in total contract price under § 1.460-4(b)(4)(i), or in gross contract price under § 1.460-4(d)(3), using a permissible method of accounting. For application of the look-back method for contracts accounted for using the PCM, see § 1.460-6(c)(1)(ii) and (2)(vi).
(C)
Assembly or installation.
Final completion and acceptance is determined without regard to whether the taxpayer has an obligation to assist or supervise assembly or installation of the subject matter of the contract where the assembly or installation is not performed by the taxpayer or a related party. A taxpayer must account for the gross receipts and costs attributable to such an obligation using a permissible method of accounting, other than a long-term contract method.
(D)
Disputes.
Final completion and acceptance is determined without regard to whether a dispute exists at the time the taxpayer tenders the subject matter of the contract to the customer. For contracts accounted for using the CCM, see § 1.460-4(d)(4). For application of the look-back method for contracts accounted for using the PCM, see § 1.460-6(c)(1)(ii) and (2)(vi).
(d)
Allocation among activities
—(1)
In general.
Long-term contract methods of accounting apply only to the gross receipts and costs attributable to long-term contract activities. Gross receipts and costs attributable to long-term contract activities means amounts included in total contract price or gross contract price, whichever is applicable, as determined under § 1.460-4, and costs allocable to the contract, as determined under § 1.460-5. Gross receipts and costs attributable to non-long-term contract activities (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) generally must be taken into account using a permissible method of accounting other than a long-term contract method. See section 446(c) and § 1.446-1(c). However, if the performance of a non-long-term contract activity is incident to or necessary for the manufacture, building, installation, or construction of the subject matter of one or more of the taxpayer's long-term contracts, the gross receipts and costs attributable to that activity must be allocated to the long-term contract(s) benefitted as provided in §§ 1.460-4(b)(4)(i) and 1.460-5(f)(2), respectively. Similarly, if a single long-term contract requires a taxpayer to perform a non-long-term contract activity that is not incident to or necessary for the manufacture, building, installation, or construction of the subject matter of the long-term contract, the gross receipts and costs attributable to that non-long-term contract activity must be separated from the contract and accounted for using a permissible method of accounting other than a long-term contract method. But see paragraph (g) of this section for related party rules.
(2)
Non-long-term contract activity. Non-long-term contract activity
means the performance of an activity other than manufacturing, building, installation, or construction, such as the provision of architectural, design, engineering, and construction management services, and the development or implementation of computer software. In addition, performance under a guaranty, warranty, or maintenance agreement is a non-long-term contract activity that is never incident to or necessary for the manufacture or construction of property under a long-term contract.
(e)
Severing and aggregating contracts
—(1)
In general.
After application of the allocation rules of paragraph (d) of this section, the severing and aggregating rules of this paragraph (e) may be applied by the Commissioner or the taxpayer as necessary to clearly reflect income (
e.g.,
to prevent the unreasonable deferral (or acceleration) of income or the premature recognition (or deferral) of loss). Under the severing and aggregating rules, one agreement may be treated as two or more contracts, and two or more agreements may be treated as one contract. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, a taxpayer must determine whether to sever an agreement or to aggregate two or more agreements based on the facts and circumstances known at the end of the contracting year.
(2)
Facts and circumstances.
Whether an agreement should be severed, or two or more agreements should be aggregated, depends on the following factors:
(i)
Pricing.
Independent pricing of items in an agreement is necessary for the agreement to be severed into two or more contracts. In the case of an agreement for similar items, if the price to be paid for the items is determined under different terms or formulas (e.g., if some items are priced
under a cost-plus incentive fee arrangement and later items are to be priced under a fixed-price arrangement), then the difference in the pricing terms or formulas indicates that the items are independently priced. Similarly, interdependent pricing of items in separate agreements is necessary for two or more agreements to be aggregated into one contract. A single price negotiation for similar items ordered under one or more agreements indicates that the items are interdependently priced.
(ii)
Separate delivery or acceptance.
An agreement may not be severed into two or more contracts unless it provides for separate delivery or separate acceptance of items that are the subject matter of the agreement. However, the separate delivery or separate acceptance of items by itself does not necessarily require an agreement to be severed.
(iii)
Reasonable businessperson.
Two or more agreements to perform manufacturing or construction activities may not be aggregated into one contract unless a reasonable businessperson would not have entered into one of the agreements for the terms agreed upon without also entering into the other agreement(s). Similarly, an agreement to perform manufacturing or construction activities may not be severed into two or more contracts if a reasonable businessperson would not have entered into separate agreements containing terms allocable to each severed contract. Analyzing the reasonable businessperson standard requires an analysis of all the facts and circumstances of the business arrangement between the taxpayer and the customer. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii), a taxpayer's expectation that the parties would enter into another agreement, when agreeing to the terms contained in the first agreement, is not relevant.
(3)
Exceptions
—(i)
Severance for PCM.
A taxpayer may not sever under this paragraph (e) a long-term contract that would be subject to the PCM without obtaining the Commissioner's prior written consent.
(ii)
Options and change orders.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, a taxpayer must sever an agreement that increases the number of units to be supplied to the customer, such as through the exercise of an option or the acceptance of a change order, if the agreement provides for separate delivery or separate acceptance of the additional units.
(4)
Statement with return.
If a taxpayer severs an agreement or aggregates two or more agreements under this paragraph (e) during the taxable year, the taxpayer must attach a statement to its original federal income tax return for that year. This statement must contain the following information—
(i) The legend NOTIFICATION OF SEVERANCE OR AGGREGATION UNDER SEC. 1.460-1(e);
(ii) The taxpayer's name; and
(iii) The taxpayer's employer identification number or social security number.
(f)
Classifying contracts
—(1)
In general.
After applying the severing and aggregating rules of paragraph (e) of this section, a taxpayer must determine the classification of a contract (
e.g.,
as a long-term manufacturing contract, long-term construction contract, non-long-term contract) based on all the facts and circumstances known no later than the end of the contracting year. Classification is determined on a contract-by-contract basis. Consequently, a requirement to manufacture a single unique item under a long-term contract will subject all other items in that contract to section 460.
(2)
Hybrid contracts
—(i)
In general.
A long-term contract that requires a taxpayer to perform both manufacturing and construction activities (hybrid contract) generally must be classified as two contracts, a manufacturing contract and a construction contract. A taxpayer may elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to classify a hybrid contract as a long-term construction contract if at least 95 percent of the estimated total allocable contract costs are reasonably allocable to construction activities. In addition, a taxpayer may elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to classify a hybrid contract as a long-term manufacturing contract subject to the PCM.
(ii)
Elections.
A taxpayer makes an election under this paragraph (f)(2) by using its method of accounting for similar construction contracts or for
manufacturing contracts, whichever is applicable, to account for a hybrid contract entered into during the taxable year of the election on its original federal income tax return for the election year. If an electing taxpayer's method is the PCM, the taxpayer also must use the PCM to apply the look-back method under § 1.460-6 and to determine alternative minimum taxable income under § 1.460-4(f).
(3)
Method of accounting.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, a taxpayer's method of classifying contracts is a method of accounting under section 446 and, thus, may not be changed without the Commissioner's consent. If a taxpayer's method of classifying contracts is unreasonable, that classification method is an impermissible accounting method. A taxpayer may adopt any permissible method of accounting for each classification of contract. Such adoption is not a change in method of accounting under section 446 and the accompanying regulations. For example, a taxpayer that has had only contracts classified as nonexempt long-term contracts and has used the PCM for these contracts may adopt an exempt contract method in the taxable year it first enters into an exempt long-term contract.
(4)
Use of estimates
—(i)
Estimating length of contract.
A taxpayer must use a reasonable estimate of the time required to complete a contract when necessary to classify the contract (e.g., to determine whether the five-year completion rule for qualified ship contracts under § 1.460-2(d), or the two-year completion rule for exempt construction contracts under § 1.460-3(b), is satisfied, but not to determine whether a contract is completed within the contracting year under paragraph (b)(1) of this section). To be considered reasonable, an estimate of the time required to complete the contract must include anticipated time for delay, rework, change orders, technology or design problems, or other problems that reasonably can be anticipated considering the nature of the contract and prior experience. A contract term that specifies an expected completion or delivery date may be considered evidence that the taxpayer reasonably expects to complete or deliver the subject matter of the contract on or about the date specified, especially if the contract provides bona fide penalties for failing to meet the specified date. If a taxpayer classifies a contract based on a reasonable estimate of completion time, the contract will not be reclassified based on the actual (or another reasonable estimate of) completion time. A taxpayer's estimate of completion time will not be considered unreasonable if a contract is not completed within the estimated time primarily because of unforeseeable factors not within the taxpayer's control, such as third-party litigation, extreme weather conditions, strikes, or delays in securing permits or licenses.
(ii)
Estimating allocable contract costs.
A taxpayer must use a reasonable estimate of total allocable contract costs when necessary to classify the contract (e.g., to determine whether a contract is a home construction contract under § 1.460-(3)(b)(2)). If a taxpayer classifies a contract based on a reasonable estimate of total allocable contract costs, the contract will not be reclassified based on the actual (or another reasonable estimate of) total allocable contract costs.
(g)
Special rules for activities benefitting long-term contracts of a related party
—(1)
Related party use of PCM
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, if a related party and its customer enter into a long-term contract subject to the PCM, and a taxpayer performs any activity that is incident to or necessary for the related party's long-term contract, the taxpayer must account for the gross receipts and costs attributable to this activity using the PCM, even if this activity is not otherwise subject to section 460(a). This type of activity may include, for example, the performance of engineering and design services, and the production of components and subassemblies that are reasonably expected to be used in the production of the subject matter of the related party's contract.
(ii)
Exception for components and subassemblies.
A taxpayer is not required to use the PCM under this paragraph
(g) to account for a component or subassembly that benefits a related party's long-term contract if more than 50 percent of the average annual gross receipts attributable to the sale of this item for the 3-taxable-year-period ending with the contracting year comes from unrelated parties.
(2)
Total contract price.
If a taxpayer is required to use the PCM under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, the total contract price (as defined in § 1.460-4(b)(4)(i)) is the fair market value of the taxpayer's activity that is incident to or necessary for the performance of the related party's long-term contract. The related party also must use the fair market value of the taxpayer's activity as the cost it incurs for the activity. The fair market value of the taxpayer's activity may or may not be the same as the amount the related party pays the taxpayer for that activity.
(3)
Completion factor.
To compute a contract's completion factor (as described in § 1.460-4(b)(5)), the related party must take into account the fair market value of the taxpayer's activity that is incident to or necessary for the performance of the related party's long-term contract when the related party incurs the liability to the taxpayer for the activity, rather than when the taxpayer incurs the costs to perform the activity.
(h)
Effective date
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided, this section and §§ 1.460-2 through 1.460-5 are applicable for contracts entered into on or after January 11, 2001.
(2)
Change in method of accounting.
Any change in a taxpayer's method of accounting necessary to comply with this section and §§ 1.460-2 through 1.460-5 is a change in method of accounting to which the provisions of section 446 and the regulations thereunder apply. For the first taxable year that includes January 11, 2001, a taxpayer is granted the consent of the Commissioner to change its method of accounting to comply with the provisions of this section and §§ 1.460-2 through 1.460-5 for long-term contracts entered into on or after January 11, 2001. A taxpayer that wants to change its method of accounting under this paragraph (h)(2) must follow the automatic consent procedures in Rev. Proc. 99-49 (1999-52 I.R.B. 725) (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), except that the scope limitations in section 4.02 of Rev. Proc. 99-49 do not apply. Because a change under this paragraph (h)(2) is made on a cut-off basis, a section 481(a) adjustment is not permitted or required. Moreover, the taxpayer does not receive audit protection under section 7 of Rev. Proc. 99-49 for a change in method of accounting under this paragraph (h)(2). A taxpayer that wants to change its exempt-contract method of accounting is not granted the consent of the Commissioner under this paragraph (h)(2) and must file a Form 3115, “Application for Change in Accounting Method,” to obtain consent. See Rev. Proc. 97-27 (1997-1 C.B. 680) (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(3)
Changes made by Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Pub. L. 115-97).
Paragraph (f)(3) of this section, and § 1.460-5(d)(1) and (d)(3), apply for contracts entered into in taxable years beginning on or after January 5, 2021. However, for contracts entered into after December 31, 2017, in a taxable year ending after December 31, 2017, and before January 5, 2021, a taxpayer may apply paragraph (f)(3) of this section, and § 1.460-5(d)(1) and (d)(3), provided that the taxpayer also applies the applicable rules contained in the regulations under section 460 for such taxable year and all subsequent taxable years.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1. Contract for manufacture of property.
B notifies C, an aircraft manufacturer, that it wants to purchase an aircraft of a particular type. At the time C receives the order, C has on hand several partially completed aircraft of this type; however, C does not have any completed aircraft of this type on hand. C and B agree that B will purchase one of these aircraft after it has been completed. C retains title to and risk of loss with respect to the aircraft until the sale takes place. The agreement between C and B is a contract for the manufacture of property under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, even if labeled as a contract for the sale of property, because the manufacture of the aircraft is necessary for C's obligations under the agreement to be fulfilled and the manufacturing was not complete when B and C entered into the agreement.

# Example 2. De minimis construction activity.
C, a master developer whose taxable year ends December 31, owns 5,000 acres of undeveloped land with a cost basis of $5,000,000 and a fair market value of $50,000,000. To obtain permission from the local county government to improve this land, a service road must be constructed on this land to benefit all 5,000 acres. In 2001, C enters into a contract to sell a 1,000-acre parcel of undeveloped land to B, a residential developer, for its fair market value, $10,000,000. In this contract, C agrees to construct a service road running through the land that C is selling to B and through the 4,000 adjacent acres of undeveloped land that C has sold or will sell to other residential developers for its fair market value, $40,000,000. C reasonably estimates that it will incur allocable contract costs of $50,000 (excluding the cost of the land) to construct this service road, which will be owned and maintained by the county. C must reasonably allocate the cost of the service road among the benefitted parcels. The portion of the estimated total allocable contract costs that C allocates to the 1,000-acre parcel being sold to B (based upon its fair market value) is $10,000 ($50,000 × ($10,000,000 ÷ $50,000,000)). Construction of the service road is finished in 2002. Because the estimated total allocable contract costs attributable to C's construction activities, $10,000, are less than 10 percent of the contract's total contract price, $10,000,000, C's contract with B is not a construction contract under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, C's contract with B is not a long-term contract under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, notwithstanding that construction of the service road is not completed in 2001.

# Example 3. Completion—customer use.
In 2002, C, whose taxable year ends December 31, enters into a contract to construct a building for B. In November of 2003, the building is completed in every respect necessary for its intended use, and B occupies the building. In early December of 2003, B notifies C of some minor deficiencies that need to be corrected, and C agrees to correct them in January 2004. C reasonably estimates that the cost of correcting these deficiencies will be less than five percent of the total allocable contract costs. C's contract is complete under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section in 2003 because in that year, B used the building and C had incurred at least 95 percent of the total allocable contract costs attributable to the building. C must use a permissible method of accounting for any deficiency-related costs incurred after 2003.

# Example 4. Completion—customer use.
In 2001, C, whose taxable year ends December 31, agrees to construct a shopping center, which includes an adjoining parking lot, for B. By October 2002, C has finished constructing the retail portion of the shopping center. By December 2002, C has graded the entire parking lot, but has paved only one-fourth of it because inclement weather conditions prevented C from laying asphalt on the remaining three-fourths. In December 2002, B opens the retail portion of the shopping center and the paved portion of the parking lot to the general public. C reasonably estimates that the cost of paving the remaining three-fourths of the parking lot when weather permits will exceed five percent of C's total allocable contract costs. Even though B is using the subject matter of the contract, C's contract is not completed in December 2002 under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section because C has not incurred at least 95 percent of the total allocable contract costs attributable to the subject matter.

# Example 5. Completion—customer use.
In 2001, C, whose taxable year ends December 31, agrees to manufacture 100 machines for B. By December 31, 2002, C has delivered 99 of the machines to B. C reasonably estimates that the cost of finishing the related work on the contract will be less than five percent of the total allocable contract costs. C's contract is not complete under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section in 2002 because in that year, B is not using the subject matter of the contract (all 100 machines) for its intended purpose.

# Example 6. Non-long-term contract activity.
On January 1, 2001, C, whose taxable year ends December 31, enters into a single long-term contract to design and manufacture a satellite and to develop computer software enabling B to operate the satellite. At the end of 2001, C has not finished manufacturing the satellite. Designing the satellite and developing the computer software are non-long-term contract activities that are incident to and necessary for the taxpayer's manufacturing of the subject matter of a long-term contract because the satellite could not be manufactured without the design and would not operate without the software. Thus, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, C must allocate these non-long-term contract activities to the long-term contract and account for the gross receipts and costs attributable to designing the satellite and developing computer software using the PCM.

# Example 7. Non-long-term contract activity.
C agrees to manufacture equipment for B under a long-term contract. In a separate contract, C agrees to design the equipment being manufactured for B under the long-term contract. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, C must allocate the gross receipts and costs related to the design to the long-term contract because designing the equipment is a non-long-term contract activity that is incident to and necessary for the manufacture of the subject matter of the long-term contract.

# Example 8. Severance.
On January 1, 2001, C, a construction contractor, and B, a real estate investor, enter into an agreement requiring C to build two office buildings in different areas of a large city. The agreement provides that the two office buildings will be completed by C and accepted by B in 2002 and 2003, respectively, and that C will be paid $1,000,000 and $1,500,000 for the two office buildings, respectively. The agreement will provide C with a reasonable profit from the construction of each building. Unless C is required to use the PCM to account for the contract, C is required to sever this contract under paragraph (e)(2) of this section because the buildings are independently priced, the agreement provides for separate delivery and acceptance of the buildings, and, as each building will generate a reasonable profit, a reasonable businessperson would have entered into separate agreements for the terms agreed upon for each building.

# Example 9. Severance.
C, a large construction contractor whose taxable year ends December 31, accounts for its construction contracts using the PCM and has elected to use the 10-percent method described in § 1.460-4(b)(6). In September 2001, C enters into an agreement to construct four buildings in four different cities. The buildings are independently priced and the contract provides a reasonable profit for each of the buildings. In addition, the agreement requires C to complete one building per year in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. As of December 31, 2001, C has incurred 25 percent of the estimated total allocable contract costs attributable to one of the buildings, but only five percent of the estimated total allocable contract costs attributable to all four buildings included in the agreement. C does not request the Commissioner's consent to sever this contract. Using the 10-percent method, C does not take into account any portion of the total contract price or any incurred allocable contract costs attributable to this agreement in 2001. Upon examination of C's 2001 tax return, the Commissioner determines that C entered into one agreement for four buildings rather than four separate agreements each for one building solely to take advantage of the deferral obtained under the 10-percent method. Consequently, to clearly reflect the taxpayer's income, the Commissioner may require C to sever the agreement into four separate contracts under paragraph (e)(2) of this section because the buildings are independently priced, the agreement provides for separate delivery and acceptance of the buildings, and a reasonable businessperson would have entered into separate agreements for these buildings.

# Example 10. Aggregation.
In 2001, C, a shipbuilder, enters into two agreements with the Department of the Navy as the result of a single negotiation. Each agreement obligates C to manufacture a submarine. Because the submarines are of the same class, their specifications are similar. Because C has never manufactured submarines of this class, however, C anticipates that it will incur substantially higher costs to manufacture the first submarine, to be delivered in 2007, than to manufacture the second submarine, to be delivered in 2010. If the agreements are treated as separate contracts, the first contract probably will produce a substantial loss, while the second contract probably will produce substantial profit. Based upon these facts, aggregation is required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section because the submarines are interdependently priced and a reasonable businessperson would not have entered the first agreement without also entering into the second.

# Example 11. Aggregation.
In 2001, C, a manufacturer of aircraft and related equipment, agrees to manufacture 10 military aircraft for foreign government B and to deliver the aircraft by the end of 2003. When entering into the agreement, C anticipates that it might receive production orders from B over the next 20 years for as many as 300 more of these aircraft. The negotiated contract price reflects C's and B's consideration of the expected total cost of manufacturing the 10 aircraft, the risks and opportunities associated with the agreement, and the additional factors the parties considered relevant. The negotiated price provides a profit on the sale of the 10 aircraft even if C does not receive any additional production orders from B. It is unlikely, however, that C actually would have wanted to manufacture the 10 aircraft but for the expectation that it would receive additional production orders from B. In 2003, B accepts delivery of the 10 aircraft. At that time, B orders an additional 20 aircraft of the same type for delivery in 2007. When negotiating the price for the additional 20 aircraft, C and B consider the fact that the expected unit cost for this production run of 20 aircraft will be lower than the unit cost of the 10 aircraft completed and accepted in 2003, but substantially higher than the expected unit cost of future production runs. Based upon these facts, aggregation is not permitted under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Because the parties negotiated the prices of both agreements considering only the expected production costs and risks for each agreement standing alone, the terms and conditions agreed upon for the first agreement are independent of the terms and conditions agreed upon for the second agreement. The fact that the agreement to manufacture 10 aircraft provides a profit for C indicates that a reasonable businessperson would have entered into that agreement without entering into the agreement to manufacture the additional 20 aircraft.

# Example 12. Classification and completion.
In 2001, C, whose taxable year ends December
31, agrees to manufacture and install an industrial machine for B. C elects under paragraph (f) of this section to classify the agreement as a long-term manufacturing contract and to account for it using the PCM. The agreement requires C to deliver the machine in August 2003 and to install and test the machine in B's factory. In addition, the agreement requires B to accept the machine when the tests prove that the machine's performance will satisfy the environmental standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), even if B has not obtained the required operating permit. Because of technical difficulties, C cannot deliver the machine until December 2003, when B conditionally accepts delivery. C installs the machine in December 2003 and then tests it through February 2004. B accepts the machine in February 2004, but does not obtain the operating permit from the EPA until January 2005. Under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section, C's contract is finally completed and accepted in February 2004, even though B does not obtain the operating permit until January 2005, because C completed all its obligations under the contract and B accepted the machine in February 2004.

§ 1.460-2
Long-term manufacturing contracts.
(a)
In general.
Section 460 generally requires a taxpayer to determine the income from a long-term manufacturing contract using the percentage-of-completion method described in § 1.460-4(b) (PCM). A contract not completed in the contracting year is a long-term manufacturing contract if it involves the manufacture of personal property that is—
(1) A unique item of a type that is not normally carried in the finished goods inventory of the taxpayer; or
(2) An item that normally requires more than 12 calendar months to complete (regardless of the duration of the contract or the time to complete a deliverable quantity of the item).
(b)
Unique
—(1)
In general. Unique
means designed for the needs of a specific customer. To determine whether an item is designed for the needs of a specific customer, a taxpayer must consider the extent to which research, development, design, engineering, retooling, and similar activities (customizing activities) are required to manufacture the item and whether the item could be sold to other customers with little or no modification. A contract may require the taxpayer to manufacture more than one unit of a unique item. If a contract requires a taxpayer to manufacture more than one unit of the same item, the taxpayer must determine whether that item is unique by considering the customizing activities that would be needed to produce only the first unit. For the purposes of this paragraph (b), a taxpayer must consider the activities performed on its behalf by a subcontractor.
(2)
Safe harbors.
Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an item is not unique if it satisfies one or more of the safe harbors in this paragraph (b)(2). If an item does not satisfy one or more safe harbors, the determination of uniqueness will depend on the facts and circumstances. The safe harbors are:
(i)
Short production period.
An item is not unique if it normally requires 90 days or less to complete. In the case of a contract for multiple units of an item, the item is not unique only if it normally requires 90 days or less to complete each unit of the item in the contract.
(ii)
Customized item.
An item is not unique if the total allocable contract costs attributable to customizing activities that are incident to or necessary for the manufacture of the item do not exceed 10 percent of the estimated total allocable contract costs allocable to the item. In the case of a contract for multiple units of an item, this comparison must be performed on the first unit of the item, and the total allocable contract costs attributable to customizing activities that are incident to or necessary for the manufacture of the first unit of the item must be allocated to that first unit.
(iii)
Inventoried item.
A unique item ceases to be unique no later than when the taxpayer normally includes similar items in its finished goods inventory.
(c)
Normal time to complete
—(1)
In general.
The amount of time normally required to complete an item is the item's reasonably expected
production period,
as described in § 1.263A-12, determined at the end of the contracting year. Thus, in general, the expected production period for an item begins
when a taxpayer incurs at least five percent of the costs that would be allocable to the item under § 1.460-5 and ends when the item is ready to be held for sale and all reasonably expected production activities are complete. In the case of components that are assembled or reassembled into an item or unit at the customer's facility by the taxpayer's employees or agents, the production period ends when the components are assembled or reassembled into an operable item or unit. To the extent that several distinct activities related to the production of the item are expected to occur simultaneously, the period during which these distinct activities occur is not counted more than once. Furthermore, when determining the normal time to complete an item, a taxpayer is not required to consider activities performed or costs incurred that would not be allocable contract costs under section 460 (
e.g.,
independent research and development expenses (as defined in § 1.460-1(b)(9)) and marketing expenses). Moreover, the time normally required to design and manufacture the first unit of an item for which the taxpayer intends to produce multiple units generally does not indicate the normal time to complete the item.
(2)
Production by related parties.
To determine the time normally required to complete an item, a taxpayer must consider all relevant production activities performed and costs incurred by itself and by related parties, as defined in § 1.460-1(b)(4). For example, if a taxpayer's item requires a component or subassembly manufactured by a related party, the taxpayer must consider the time the related party takes to complete the component or subassembly and, for purposes of determining the beginning of an item's production period, the costs incurred by the related party that are allocable to the component or subassembly. However, if both requirements of the exception for components and subassemblies under § 1.460-1(g)(1)(ii) are satisfied, a taxpayer does not consider the activities performed or the costs incurred by a related party when determining the normal time to complete an item.
(d)
Qualified ship contracts.
A taxpayer may determine the income from a long-term manufacturing contract that is a qualified ship contract using either the PCM or the percentage-of-completion/capitalized-cost method (PCCM) of accounting described in § 1.460-4(e). A
qualified ship contract
is any contract entered into after February 28, 1986, to manufacture in the United States not more than 5 seagoing vessels if the vessels will not be manufactured directly or indirectly for the United States Government and if the taxpayer reasonably expects to complete the contract within 5 years of the contract commencement date. Under § 1.460-1(e)(3)(i), a contract to produce more than 5 vessels for which the PCM would be required cannot be severed in order to be classified as a qualified ship contract.
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1. Unique item and classification.
In December 2001, C enters into a contract with B to design and manufacture a new type of industrial equipment. C reasonably expects the normal production period for this type of equipment to be eight months. Because the new type of industrial equipment requires a substantial amount of research, design, and engineering to produce, C determines that the equipment is a unique item and its contract with B is a long-term contract. After delivering the equipment to B in September 2002, C contracts with B to produce five additional units of that industrial equipment with certain different specifications. These additional units, which also are expected to take eight months to produce, will be delivered to B in 2003. C determines that the research, design, engineering, retooling, and similar customizing costs necessary to produce the five additional units of equipment does not exceed 10 percent of the first unit's share of estimated total allocable contract costs. Consequently, the additional units of equipment satisfy the safe harbor in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section and are not unique items. Although C's contract with B to produce the five additional units is not completed within the contracting year, the contract is not a long-term contract since the additional units of equipment are not unique items and do not normally require more than 12 months to produce. C must classify its second contract with B as a non-long term contract, notwithstanding that it classified the previous contract with B for a similar item as a long-term contract, because the determination of whether a contract is a long-term contract is made on a
contract-by-contract basis. A change in classification is not a change in method of accounting because the change in classification results from a change in underlying facts.

# Example 2. 12-month rule—related party.
C manufactures cranes. C purchases one of the crane's components from R, a related party under § 1.460-1(b)(4). Less than 50 percent of R's gross receipts attributable to the sale of this component comes from sales to unrelated parties; thus, the exception for components and subassemblies under § 1.460-1(g)(1)(ii) is not satisfied. Consequently, C must consider the activities of R as R incurs costs and performs the activities rather than as C incurs a liability to R. The normal time period between the time that both C and R incur five percent of the costs allocable to the crane and the time that R completes the component is five months. C normally requires an additional eight months to complete production of the crane after receiving the integral component from R. C's crane is an item of a type that normally requires more than 12 months to complete under paragraph (c) of this section because the production period from the time that both C and R incur five percent of the costs allocable to the crane until the time that production of the crane is complete is normally 13 months.

# Example 3. 12-month rule—duration of contract.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that C enters into a sales contract with B on December 31, 2001 (the last day of C's taxable year), and delivers a completed crane to B on February 1, 2002. C's contract with B is a long-term contract under paragraph (a)(2) of this section because the contract is not completed in the contracting year, 2001, and the crane is an item that normally requires more than 12 calendar months to complete (regardless of the duration of the contract).

# Example 4. 12-month rule—normal time to complete.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that C (and R) actually complete B's crane in only 10 calendar months. The contract is a long-term contract because the normal time to complete a crane, not the actual time to complete a crane, is the relevant criterion for determining whether an item is subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

# Example 5. Normal time to complete.
C enters into a multi-unit contract to produce four units of an item. C does not anticipate producing any additional units of the item. C expects to perform the research, design, and development that are directly allocable to the particular item and to produce the first unit in the first 24 months. C reasonably expects the production period for each of the three remaining units will be 3 months. This contract is not a contract that involves the manufacture of an item that normally requires more than 12 months to complete because the normal time to complete the item is 3 months. However, the contract does not satisfy the 90-day safe harbor for unique items because the normal time to complete the first unit of this item exceeds 90 days. Thus, the contract might involve the manufacture of a unique item depending on the facts and circumstances.

§ 1.460-3
Long-term construction contracts.
(a)
In general.
Section 460 generally requires a taxpayer to determine the income from a long-term construction contract using the percentage-of-completion method described in § 1.460-4(b) (PCM). A contract not completed in the contracting year is a long-term construction contract if it involves the building, construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of real property; the installation of an integral component to real property; or the improvement of real property (collectively referred to as construction).
Real property
means land, buildings, and
inherently permanent structures,
as defined in § 1.263A-8(c)(3), such as roadways, dams, and bridges. Real property does not include vessels, offshore drilling platforms, or unsevered natural products of land. An
integral component to real property
includes property not produced at the site of the real property but intended to be permanently affixed to the real property, such as elevators and central heating and cooling systems. Thus, for example, a contract to install an elevator in a building is a construction contract because a building is real property, but a contract to install an elevator in a ship is not a construction contract because a ship is not real property.
(b)
Exempt construction contracts
—(1)
In general.
The general requirement to use the PCM and the cost allocation rules described in § 1.460-5(b) or (c) does not apply to any long-term construction contract described in this paragraph (b) (exempt construction contract).
Exempt construction contract
means any—
(i) Home construction contract; and
(ii) Other construction contract, entered into after December 31, 2017, in a taxable year ending after December 31, 2017, by a taxpayer, other than a tax
shelter prohibited from using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting (cash method) under section 448(a)(3), who estimates at the time such contract is entered into that such contract will be completed within the 2-year period beginning on the contract commencement date, and who meets the gross receipts test described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section for the taxable year in which such contract is entered into.
(2)
Home construction contract
—(i)
In general.
A long-term construction contract is a
home construction contract
if a taxpayer (including a subcontractor working for a general contractor) reasonably expects to attribute 80 percent or more of the estimated total allocable contract costs (including the cost of land, materials, and services), determined as of the close of the contracting year, to the construction of—
(A) Dwelling units, as defined in section 168(e)(2)(A)(ii)(I), contained in buildings containing 4 or fewer dwelling units (including buildings with 4 or fewer dwelling units that also have commercial units); and
(B) Improvements to real property directly related to, and located at the site of, the dwelling units.
(ii)
Townhouses and rowhouses.
Each townhouse or rowhouse is a separate building.
(iii)
Common improvements.
A taxpayer includes in the cost of the dwelling units their allocable share of the cost that the taxpayer reasonably expects to incur for any common improvements (e.g., sewers, roads, clubhouses) that benefit the dwelling units and that the taxpayer is contractually obligated, or required by law, to construct within the tract or tracts of land that contain the dwelling units.
(iv)
Mixed use costs.
If a contract involves the construction of both commercial units and dwelling units within the same building, a taxpayer must allocate the costs among the commercial units and dwelling units using a reasonable method or combination of reasonable methods, such as specific identification, square footage, or fair market value.
(3)
Gross receipts test
—(i)
In general.
A taxpayer, other than a tax shelter prohibited from using the cash method under section 448(a)(3), meets the gross receipts test of this paragraph (b)(3) if it meets the gross receipts test of section 448(c) and § 1.448-2(c)(2). This gross receipts test applies even if the taxpayer is not otherwise subject to section 448(a).
(ii)
Application of gross receipts test
—(A)
In general.
In the case of any taxpayer that is not a corporation or a partnership, and except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, the gross receipts test of section 448(c) and the accompanying regulations are applied in the same manner as if each trade or business of such taxpayer were a corporation or partnership.
(B)
Gross receipts of individuals, etc.
Except when the aggregation rules of section 448(c)(2) apply, the gross receipts of a taxpayer other than a corporation or partnership are the amount derived from all trades or businesses of such taxpayer. Amounts not related to a trade or business are excluded from the gross receipts of the taxpayer. For example, an individual taxpayer's gross receipts do not include inherently personal amounts, such as personal injury awards or settlements with respect to an injury of the individual taxpayer, disability benefits, Social Security benefits received by the taxpayer during the taxable year, and wages received as an employee that are reported on Form W-2.
(C)
Partners and S corporation shareholders.
Except when the aggregation rules of section 448(c)(2) apply, each partner in a partnership includes a share of partnership gross receipts in proportion to such partner's distributive share (as determined under section 704) of items of gross income that were taken into account by the partnership under section 703. Similarly, a shareholder includes the pro rata share of S corporation gross receipts taken into account by the S corporation under section 1363(b).
(D)
Examples.
The operation of this paragraph (b)(3) is illustrated by the following examples:
(
1
)
Example 1.
Taxpayer A is an individual who operates two separate and distinct trades or business that are reported on Schedule C,
Profit or Loss from Business,
of A's Federal income
tax return. For 2020, one trade or business has annual average gross receipts of $5 million, and the other trade or business has average annual gross receipts of $35 million. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, for 2020, neither of A's trades or businesses meets the gross receipts test of paragraph (b)(3) of this section ($5 million + $35 million = $40 million, which is greater than the inflation-adjusted gross receipts test amount for 2020, which is $26 million).
(
2
)
Example 2.
Taxpayer B is an individual who operates three separate and distinct trades or business that are reported on Schedule C of B's Federal income tax return. For 2020, Business X is a retail store with average annual gross receipts of $15 million, Business Y is a dance studio with average annual gross receipts of $6 million, and Business Z is a car repair shop with average annual gross receipts of $12 million. Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, B's gross receipts are the combined amount derived from all three of B's trades or businesses. Therefore, for 2020, X, Y and Z do not meet the gross receipts test of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section ($15 million + $6 million + $12 million = $33 million, which is greater than the inflation-adjusted gross receipts test amount for 2020, which is $26 million).
(iii)
Method of accounting.
A change in the method of accounting used for exempt construction contracts described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section is a change in method of accounting under section 446 and the accompanying regulations. For rules distinguishing a change in method from adoption of a method, see § 1.460-1(f)(3). A taxpayer changing its method of accounting must obtain the consent of the Commissioner in accordance with § 1.446-1(e)(3). For rules relating to the clear reflection of income and the pattern of consistent treatment of an item, see section 446 and § 1.446-1. A change in method of accounting shall be implemented pursuant to the applicable administrative procedures to obtain the consent of the Commissioner to change a method of accounting under section 446(e) as published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (IRB) (see Revenue Procedure 2015-13 (2015-5 IRB 419) (or successor) (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter)). A taxpayer that uses the percentage of completion method for exempt contracts described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section that wants to change to another exempt contract method is to use the applicable administrative procedures to obtain the automatic consent of the Commissioner to change such method under section 446(e) as published in the IRB. A taxpayer-initiated change in method of accounting will be permitted only on a cut-off basis, and thus, a section 481(a) adjustment will not be permitted or required. See § 1.460-4(g).
(c)
Residential construction contracts.
A taxpayer may determine the income from a long-term construction contract that is a residential construction contract using either the PCM or the percentage-of-completion/capitalized-cost method (PCCM) of accounting described in § 1.460-4(e). A
residential construction contract
is a home construction contract, as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, except that the building or buildings being constructed contain more than 4 dwelling units.
(d)
Applicability Dates.
Paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(3) of this section apply, for contracts entered into in taxable years beginning on or after January 5, 2021. However, for contracts entered into after December 31, 2017, in a taxable year ending after December 31, 2017, and before January 5, 2021, a taxpayer may apply the paragraphs described in the first sentence of this paragraph (d), provided that the taxpayer follows all the applicable rules contained in the regulations under section 460 for such taxable year and all subsequent taxable years.
[T.D. 8929, 66 FR 2231, Jan. 11, 2001, as amended by T.D. 9942, 86 FR 272, Jan. 5, 2021; 86 FR 32186, June 17, 2021]
§ 1.460-4
Methods of accounting for long-term contracts.
(a)
Overview.
This section prescribes permissible methods of accounting for long-term contracts. Paragraph (b) of this section describes the percentage-of-completion method under section 460(b) (PCM) that a taxpayer generally must use to determine the income from a long-term contract. Paragraph (c) of this section lists permissible methods
of accounting for exempt construction contracts described in § 1.460-3(b)(1) and describes the exempt-contract percentage-of-completion method (EPCM). Paragraph (d) of this section describes the completed-contract method (CCM), which is one of the permissible methods of accounting for exempt construction contracts. Paragraph (e) of this section describes the percentage-of-completion/capitalized-cost method (PCCM), which is a permissible method of accounting for qualified ship contracts described in § 1.460-2(d) and residential construction contracts described in § 1.460-3(c). Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for determining the alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI) from long-term contracts that are not exempted under section 56. Paragraph (g) of this section provides rules concerning consistency in methods of accounting for long-term contracts. Paragraph (h) of this section provides examples illustrating the principles of this section. Paragraph (j) of this section provides rules for taxpayers that file consolidated tax returns. Finally, paragraph (k) of this section provides rules relating to a mid-contract change in taxpayer of a contract accounted for using a long-term contract method of accounting.
(b)
Percentage-of-completion method
—(1)
In general.
Under the PCM, a taxpayer generally must include in income the portion of the
total contract price,
as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, that corresponds to the percentage of the entire contract that the taxpayer has completed during the taxable year. The percentage of completion must be determined by comparing allocable contract costs incurred with estimated total allocable contract costs. Thus, the taxpayer includes a portion of the total contract price in gross income as the taxpayer incurs allocable contract costs.
(2)
Computations.
To determine the income from a long-term contract, a taxpayer—
(i) Computes the
completion factor
for the contract, which is the ratio of the cumulative allocable contract costs that the taxpayer has incurred through the end of the taxable year to the estimated total allocable contract costs that the taxpayer reasonably expects to incur under the contract;
(ii) Computes the amount of
cumulative gross receipts
from the contract by multiplying the completion factor by the total contract price;
(iii) Computes the amount of
current-year gross receipts,
which is the difference between the amount of cumulative gross receipts for the current taxable year and the amount of cumulative gross receipts for the immediately preceding taxable year (the difference can be a positive or negative number); and
(iv) Takes both the current-year gross receipts and the allocable contract costs incurred during the current year into account in computing taxable income.
(3)
Post-completion-year income.
If a taxpayer has not included the total contract price in gross income by the completion year, as defined in § 1.460-1(b)(6), the taxpayer must include the remaining portion of the total contract price in gross income for the taxable year following the completion year. For the treatment of post-completion-year costs, see paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section. See § 1.460-6(c)(1)(ii) for application of the look-back method as a result of adjustments to total contract price.
(4)
Total contract price
—(i)
In general
—(A)
Definition. Total contract price
means the amount that a taxpayer reasonably expects to receive under a long-term contract, including holdbacks, retainages, and cost reimbursements. See § 1.460-6(c)(1)(ii) and (2)(vi) for application of the look-back method as a result of changes in total contract price.
(B)
Contingent compensation.
Any amount related to a contingent right under a contract, such as a bonus, award, incentive payment, and amount in dispute, is included in total contract price as soon as the taxpayer can reasonably predict that the amount will be earned, even if the all events test has not yet been met. For example, if a bonus is payable to a taxpayer for meeting an early completion date, the bonus is includible in total contract price at the time and to the extent
that the taxpayer can reasonably predict the achievement of the corresponding objective. Similarly, a portion of the contract price that is in dispute is includible in total contract price at the time and to the extent that the taxpayer can reasonably predict that the dispute will be resolved in the taxpayer's favor (regardless of when the taxpayer actually receives payment or when the dispute is finally resolved). Total contract price does not include compensation that might be earned under any other agreement that the taxpayer expects to obtain from the same customer (
e.g.,
exercised option or follow-on contract) if that other agreement is not aggregated under § 1.460-1(e). For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B), a taxpayer can reasonably predict that an amount of contingent income will be earned not later than when the taxpayer includes that amount in income for financial reporting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles. If a taxpayer has not included an amount of contingent compensation in total contract price under this paragraph (b)(4)(i) by the taxable year following the completion year, the taxpayer must account for that amount of contingent compensation using a permissible method of accounting. If it is determined after the taxable year following the completion year that an amount included in total contract price will not be earned, the taxpayer should deduct that amount in the year of the determination.
(C)
Non-long-term contract activities.
Total contract price includes an allocable share of the gross receipts attributable to a non-long-term contract activity, as defined in § 1.460-1(d)(2), if the activity is incident to or necessary for the manufacture, building, installation, or construction of the subject matter of the long-term contract. Total contract price also includes amounts reimbursed for independent research and development expenses (as defined in § 1.460-1(b)(9)), or for bidding and proposal costs, under a federal or cost-plus long-term contract (as defined in section 460(d)), regardless of whether the research and development, or bidding and proposal, activities are incident to or necessary for the performance of that long-term contract.
(ii)
Estimating total contract price.
A taxpayer must estimate the total contract price based upon all the facts and circumstances known as of the last day of the taxable year. For this purpose, an event that occurs after the end of the taxable year must be taken into account if its occurrence was reasonably predictable and its income was subject to reasonable estimation as of the last day of that taxable year.
(5)
Completion factor
—(i)
Allocable contract costs.
A taxpayer must use a cost allocation method permitted under either § 1.460-5(b) or (c) to determine the amount of cumulative allocable contract costs and estimated total allocable contract costs that are used to determine a contract's completion factor. Allocable contract costs include a reimbursable cost that is allocable to the contract.
(ii)
Cumulative allocable contract costs.
To determine a contract's completion factor for a taxable year, a taxpayer must take into account the cumulative allocable contract costs that have been incurred, as defined in § 1.460-1(b)(8), through the end of the taxable year.
(iii)
Estimating total allocable contract costs.
A taxpayer must estimate total allocable contract costs for each long-term contract based upon all the facts and circumstances known as of the last day of the taxable year. For this purpose, an event that occurs after the end of the taxable year must be taken into account if its occurrence was reasonably predictable and its cost was subject to reasonable estimation as of the last day of that taxable year. To be considered reasonable, an estimate of total allocable contract costs must include costs attributable to delay, rework, change orders, technology or design problems, or other problems that reasonably can be predicted considering the nature of the contract and prior experience. However, estimated total allocable contract costs do not include any contingency allowance for costs that, as of the end of the taxable year, are not reasonably predicted to be incurred in the performance of the contract. For example, estimated total allocable contract costs do not include any costs attributable to factors not
reasonably predictable at the end of the taxable year, such as third-party litigation, extreme weather conditions, strikes, and delays in securing required permits and licenses. In addition, the estimated costs of performing other agreements that are not aggregated with the contract under § 1.460-1(e) that the taxpayer expects to incur with the same customer (
e.g.,
follow-on contracts) are not included in estimated total allocable contract costs for the initial contract.
(iv)
Pre-contracting-year costs.
If a taxpayer reasonably expects to enter into a long-term contract in a future taxable year, the taxpayer must capitalize all costs incurred prior to entering into the contract that will be allocable to that contract (
e.g.,
bidding and proposal costs). A taxpayer is not required to compute a completion factor, or to include in gross income any amount, related to allocable contract costs for any taxable year ending before the contracting year or, if applicable, the 10-percent year defined in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section. In that year, the taxpayer is required to compute a completion factor that includes all allocable contract costs that have been incurred as of the end of that taxable year (whether previously capitalized or deducted) and to take into account in computing taxable income the related gross receipts and the previously capitalized allocable contract costs. If, however, a taxpayer determines in a subsequent year that it will not enter into the long-term contract, the taxpayer must account for these pre-contracting-year costs in that year (
e.g.,
as a deduction or an inventoriable cost) using the appropriate rules contained in other sections of the Code or regulations.
(v)
Post-completion-year costs.
If a taxpayer incurs an allocable contract cost after the completion year, the taxpayer must account for that cost using a permissible method of accounting. See § 1.460-6(c)(1)(ii) for application of the look-back method as a result of adjustments to allocable contract costs.
(6)
10-percent method
—(i)
In general.
Instead of determining the income from a long-term contract beginning with the contracting year, a taxpayer may elect to use the 10-percent method under section 460(b)(5). Under the 10-percent method, a taxpayer does not include in gross income any amount related to allocable contract costs until the taxable year in which the taxpayer has incurred at least 10 percent of the estimated total allocable contract costs (10-percent year). A taxpayer must treat costs incurred before the 10-percent year as pre-contracting-year costs described in paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section.
(ii)
Election.
A taxpayer makes an election under this paragraph (b)(6) by using the 10-percent method for all long-term contracts entered into during the taxable year of the election on its original federal income tax return for the election year. This election is a method of accounting and, thus, applies to all long-term contracts entered into during and after the taxable year of the election. An electing taxpayer must use the 10-percent method to apply the look-back method under § 1.460-6 and to determine alternative minimum taxable income under paragraph (f) of this section. This election is not available if a taxpayer uses the simplified cost-to-cost method described in § 1.460-5(c) to compute the completion factor of a long-term contract.
(7)
Terminated contract
—(i)
Reversal of income.
If a long-term contract is terminated before completion and, as a result, the taxpayer retains ownership of the property that is the subject matter of that contract, the taxpayer must reverse the transaction in the taxable year of termination. To reverse the transaction, the taxpayer reports a loss (or gain) equal to the cumulative allocable contract costs reported under the contract in all prior taxable years less the cumulative gross receipts reported under the contract in all prior taxable years.
(ii)
Adjusted basis.
As a result of reversing the transaction under paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section, a taxpayer will have an adjusted basis in the retained property equal to the cumulative allocable contract costs reported under the contract in all prior taxable years. However, if the taxpayer received and retains any consideration or compensation from the customer, the taxpayer must reduce the adjusted
basis in the retained property (but not below zero) by the fair market value of that consideration or compensation. To the extent that the amount of the consideration or compensation described in the preceding sentence exceeds the adjusted basis in the retained property, the taxpayer must include the excess in gross income for the taxable year of termination.
(iii)
Look-back method.
The look-back method does not apply to a terminated contract that is subject to this paragraph (b)(7).
(c)
Exempt contract methods
—(1)
In general.
An
exempt contract method
means the method of accounting that a taxpayer must use to account for all its long-term contracts (and any portion of a long-term contract) that are exempt from the requirements of section 460(a). Thus, an exempt contract method applies to exempt construction contracts, as defined in § 1.460-3(b); the non-PCM portion of a qualified ship contract, as defined in § 1.460-2(d); and the non-PCM portion of a residential construction contract, as defined in § 1.460-3(c). Permissible exempt contract methods include the PCM, the EPCM described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the CCM described in paragraph (d) of this section, or any other permissible method. See section 446.
(2)
Exempt-contract percentage-of-completion method
—(i)
In general.
Similar to the PCM described in paragraph (b) of this section, a taxpayer using the EPCM generally must include in income the portion of the total contract price, as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, that corresponds to the percentage of the entire contract that the taxpayer has completed during the taxable year. However, under the EPCM, the percentage of completion may be determined as of the end of the taxable year by using any method of cost comparison (such as comparing direct labor costs incurred to date to estimated total direct labor costs) or by comparing the work performed on the contract with the estimated total work to be performed, rather than by using the cost-to-cost comparison required by paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (5) of this section, provided such method is used consistently and clearly reflects income. In addition, paragraph (b)(3) of this section (regarding post-completion-year income), paragraph (b)(6) of this section (regarding the 10-percent method) and § 1.460-6 (regarding the look-back method) do not apply to the EPCM.
(ii)
Determination of work performed.
For purposes of the EPCM, the criteria used to compare the work performed on a contract as of the end of the taxable year with the estimated total work to be performed must clearly reflect the earning of income with respect to the contract. For example, in the case of a roadbuilder, a standard of completion solely based on miles of roadway completed in a case where the terrain is substantially different may not clearly reflect the earning of income with respect to the contract.
(d)
Completed-contract method
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, a taxpayer using the CCM to account for a long-term contract must take into account in the contract's completion year, as defined in § 1.460-1(b)(6), the gross contract price and all allocable contract costs incurred by the completion year. A taxpayer may not treat the cost of any materials and supplies that are allocated to a contract, but actually remain on hand when the contract is completed, as an allocable contract cost.
(2)
Post-completion-year income and costs.
If a taxpayer has not included an item of contingent compensation (
i.e.,
amounts for which the all events test has not been satisfied) in gross contract price under paragraph (d)(3) of this section by the completion year, the taxpayer must account for this item of contingent compensation using a permissible method of accounting. If a taxpayer incurs an allocable contract cost after the completion year, the taxpayer must account for that cost using a permissible method of accounting.
(3)
Gross contract price.
Gross contract price includes all amounts (including holdbacks, retainages, and reimbursements) that a taxpayer is entitled by law or contract to receive, whether or not the amounts are due or have been paid. In addition, gross contract price includes all bonuses, awards, and incentive payments, such as a bonus for
meeting an early completion date, to the extent the all events test is satisfied. If a taxpayer performs a non-long-term contract activity, as defined in § 1.460-1(d)(2), that is incident to or necessary for the manufacture, building, installation, or construction of the subject matter of one or more of the taxpayer's long-term contracts, the taxpayer must include an allocable share of the gross receipts attributable to that activity in the gross contract price of the contract(s) benefitted by that activity. Gross contract price also includes amounts reimbursed for independent research and development expenses (as defined in § 1.460-1(b)(9)), or bidding and proposal costs, under a federal or cost-plus long-term contract (as defined in section 460(d)), regardless of whether the research and development, or bidding and proposal, activities are incident to or necessary for the performance of that long-term contract.
(4)
Contracts with disputed claims
—(i)
In general.
The special rules in this paragraph (d)(4) apply to a long-term contract accounted for using the CCM with a dispute caused by a customer's requesting a reduction of the gross contract price or the performance of additional work under the contract or by a taxpayer's requesting an increase in gross contract price, or both, on or after the date a taxpayer has tendered the subject matter of the contract to the customer.
(ii)
Taxpayer assured of profit or loss.
If the disputed amount relates to a customer's claim for either a reduction in price or additional work and the taxpayer is assured of either a profit or a loss on a long-term contract regardless of the outcome of the dispute, the gross contract price, reduced (but not below zero) by the amount reasonably in dispute, must be taken into account in the completion year. If the disputed amount relates to a taxpayer's claim for an increase in price and the taxpayer is assured of either a profit or a loss on a long-term contract regardless of the outcome of the dispute, the gross contract price must be taken into account in the completion year. If the taxpayer is assured a profit on the contract, all allocable contract costs incurred by the end of the completion year are taken into account in that year. If the taxpayer is assured a loss on the contract, all allocable contract costs incurred by the end of the completion year, reduced by the amount reasonably in dispute, are taken into account in the completion year.
(iii)
Taxpayer unable to determine profit or loss.
If the amount reasonably in dispute affects so much of the gross contract price or allocable contract costs that a taxpayer cannot determine whether a profit or loss ultimately will be realized from a long-term contract, the taxpayer may not take any of the gross contract price or allocable contract costs into account in the completion year.
(iv)
Dispute resolved.
Any part of the gross contract price and any allocable contract costs that have not been taken into account because of the principles described in paragraph (d)(4)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section must be taken into account in the taxable year in which the dispute is resolved. If a taxpayer performs additional work under the contract because of the dispute, the term
taxable year in which the dispute is resolved
means the taxable year the additional work is completed, rather than the taxable year in which the outcome of the dispute is determined by agreement, decision, or otherwise.
(e)
Percentage-of-completion/capitalized-cost method.
Under the PCCM, a taxpayer must determine the income from a long-term contract using the PCM for the applicable percentage of the contract and its exempt contract method, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, for the remaining percentage of the contract. For residential construction contracts described in § 1.460-3(c), the applicable percentage is 70 percent, and the remaining percentage is 30 percent. For qualified ship contracts described in § 1.460-2(d), the applicable percentage is 40 percent, and the remaining percentage is 60 percent.
(f)
Alternative minimum taxable income
—(1)
In general.
Under section 56(a)(3), a taxpayer subject to the AMT must use the PCM to determine its AMTI from any long-term contract entered into on or after March 1, 1986, that is not a home construction contract, as defined in § 1.460-3(b)(2). For AMTI purposes, the PCM must include
any election under paragraph (b)(6) of this section (concerning the 10-percent method) or under § 1.460-5(c) (concerning the simplified cost-to-cost method) that the taxpayer has made for regular tax purposes. For exempt construction contracts described in § 1.460-3(b)(1)(ii), a taxpayer must use the simplified cost-to-cost method to determine the completion factor for AMTI purposes. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, a taxpayer must use AMTI costs and AMTI methods, such as the depreciation method described in section 56(a)(1), to determine the completion factor of a long-term contract (except a home construction contract) for AMTI purposes.
(2)
Election to use regular completion factors.
Under this paragraph (f)(2), a taxpayer may elect for AMTI purposes to determine the completion factors of all of its long-term contracts using the methods of accounting and allocable contract costs used for regular federal income tax purposes. A taxpayer makes this election by using regular methods and regular costs to compute the completion factors of all long-term contracts entered into during the taxable year of the election for AMTI purposes on its original federal income tax return for the election year. This election is a method of accounting and, thus, applies to all long-term contracts entered into during and after the taxable year of the election. Although a taxpayer may elect to compute the completion factor of its long-term contracts using regular methods and regular costs, an election under this paragraph (f)(2) does not eliminate a taxpayer's obligation to comply with the requirements of section 55 when computing AMTI. For example, although a taxpayer may elect to use the depreciation methods used for regular tax purposes to compute the completion factor of its long-term contracts for AMTI purposes, the taxpayer must use the depreciation methods permitted by section 56 to compute AMTI.
(g)
Method of accounting.
A taxpayer that uses the PCM, EPCM, CCM, or PCCM, or elects the 10-percent method or special AMTI method (or changes to another method of accounting with the Commissioner's consent) must apply the method(s) consistently for all similarly classified long-term contracts, until the taxpayer obtains the Commissioner's consent under section 446(e) to change to another method of accounting. A taxpayer-initiated change in method of accounting will be permitted only on a cut-off basis (
i.e.,
for contracts entered into on or after the year of change), and thus, a section 481(a) adjustment will not be permitted or required.
(h)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1. PCM—estimating total contract price.
C, whose taxable year ends December 31, determines the income from long-term contracts using the PCM. On January 1, 2001, C enters into a contract to design and manufacture a satellite (a unique item). The contract provides that C will be paid $10,000,000 for delivering the completed satellite by December 1, 2002. The contract also provides that C will receive a $3,000,000 bonus for delivering the satellite by July 1, 2002, and an additional $4,000,000 bonus if the satellite successfully performs its mission for five years. C is unable to reasonably predict if the satellite will successfully perform its mission for five years. If on December 31, 2001, C should reasonably expect to deliver the satellite by July 1, 2002, the estimated total contract price is $13,000,000 ($10,000,000 unit price + $3,000,000 production-related bonus). Otherwise, the estimated total contract price is $10,000,000. In either event, the $4,000,000 bonus is not includible in the estimated total contract price as of December 31, 2001, because C is unable to reasonably predict that the satellite will successfully perform its mission for five years.

# Example 2. PCM—computing income.
(i) C, whose taxable year ends December 31, determines the income from long-term contracts using the PCM. During 2001, C agrees to manufacture for the customer, B, a unique item for a total contract price of $1,000,000. Under C's contract, B is entitled to retain 10 percent of the total contract price until it accepts the item. By the end of 2001, C has incurred $200,000 of allocable contract costs and estimates that the total allocable contract costs will be $800,000. By the end of 2002, C has incurred $600,000 of allocable contract costs and estimates that the total allocable contract costs will be $900,000. In 2003, after completing the contract, C determines that the actual cost to manufacture the item was $750,000.
(ii) For each of the taxable years, C's income from the contract is computed as follows:

# Example 3. PCM—computing income with cost sharing.
(i) C, whose taxable year ends December 31, determines the income from long-term contracts using the PCM. During 2001, C enters into a contract to manufacture a unique item. The contract specifies a target price of $1,000,000, a target cost of $600,000, and a target profit of $400,000. C and B will share the savings of any cost underrun (actual total incurred cost is less than target cost) and the additional cost of any cost overrun (actual total incurred cost is greater than target cost) as follows: 30 percent to C and 70 percent to B. By the end of 2001, C has incurred $200,000 of allocable contract costs and estimates that the total allocable contract costs will be $600,000. By the end of 2002, C has incurred $300,000 of allocable contract costs and estimates that the total allocable contract costs will be $400,000. In 2003, after completing the contract, C determines that the actual cost to manufacture the item was $700,000.
(ii) For each of the taxable years, C's income from the contract is computed as follows (note that the sharing of any cost underrun or cost overrun is reflected as an adjustment to C's target price under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section):
Taxable Year

# Example 4. PCM—10 percent method.
(i) C, whose taxable year ends December 31, determines the income from long-term contracts using the PCM. In November 2001, C agrees to manufacture a unique item for $1,000,000. C reasonably estimates that the total allocable contract costs will be $600,000. By December 31, 2001, C has received $50,000 in progress payments and incurred $40,000 of costs. C elects to use the 10 percent method effective for 2001 and all subsequent taxable years. During 2002, C receives $500,000 in progress payments and incurs $260,000 of costs. In 2003, C incurs an additional $300,000 of costs, C finishes manufacturing the item, and receives the final $450,000 payment.
(ii) For each of the taxable years, C's income from the contract is computed as follows:

# Example 5. PCM—contract terminated.
C, whose taxable year ends December 31, determines the income from long-term contracts using the PCM. During 2001, C buys land and begins constructing a building that will contain 50 condominium units on that land. C enters into a contract to sell one unit in this condominium to B for $240,000. B gives C a $5,000 deposit toward the purchase price. By the end of 2001, C has incurred $50,000 of allocable contract costs on B's unit and estimates that the total allocable contract costs on B's unit will be $150,000. Thus, for 2001, C reports gross receipts of $80,000 ($50,000 ÷ $150,000 × $240,000), current-year costs of $50,000, and gross income of $30,000 ($80,000 − $50,000). In 2002, after C has incurred an additional $25,000 of allocable contract costs on B's unit, B files for bankruptcy protection and defaults on the contract with C, who is permitted to keep B's $5,000 deposit as liquidated damages. In 2002, C reverses the transaction with B under paragraph (b)(7) of this section and reports a loss of $30,000 ($50,000−$80,000). In addition, C obtains an adjusted basis in the unit sold to B of $70,000 ($50,000 (current-year costs deducted in 2001)− $5,000 (B's forfeited deposit) + $25,000 (current-year costs incurred in 2002). C may not apply the look-back method to this contract in 2002.

# Example 6. CCM—contracts with disputes from customer claims.
In 2001, C, whose taxable year ends December 31, uses the CCM to account for exempt construction contracts. C enters into a contract to construct a bridge for B. The terms of the contract provide for a $1,000,000 gross contract price. C finishes the bridge in 2002 at a cost of $950,000. When B examines the bridge, B insists that C either repaint several girders or reduce the contract price. The amount reasonably in dispute is $10,000. In 2003, C and B resolve their dispute, C repaints the girders at a cost of $6,000, and C and B agree that the contract price is not to be reduced. Because C is assured a profit of $40,000 ($1,000,000 − $10,000 − $950,000) in 2002 even if the dispute is resolved in B's favor, C must take this $40,000 into account in 2002. In 2003, C will earn an additional $4,000 profit ($1,000,000 − $956,000 − $40,000) from the contract with B. Thus, C must take into account an additional $10,000 of gross contract price and $6,000 of additional contract costs in 2003.

# Example 7. CCM—contracts with disputes from taxpayer claims.
In 2003, C, whose taxable year ends December 31, uses the CCM to account for exempt construction contracts. C enters into a contract to construct a building for B. The terms of the contract provide for a $1,000,000 gross contract price. C finishes the building in 2004 at a cost of $1,005,000. B examines the building in 2004 and agrees that it meets the contract's specifications; however, at the end of 2004, C and
B are unable to agree on the merits of C's claim for an additional $10,000 for items that C alleges are changes in contract specifications and B alleges are within the scope of the contract's original specifications. In 2005, B agrees to pay C an additional $2,000 to satisfy C's claims under the contract. Because the amount in dispute affects so much of the gross contract price that C cannot determine in 2004 whether a profit or loss will ultimately be realized, C may not taken any of the gross contract price or allocable contract costs into account in 2004. C must take into account $1,002,000 of gross contract price and $1,005,000 of allocable contract costs in 2005.

# Example 8. CCM—contracts with disputes from taxpayer and customer claims.
C, whose taxable year ends December 31, uses the CCM to account for exempt construction contracts. C constructs a factory for B pursuant to a long-term contract. Under the terms of the contract, B agrees to pay C a total of $1,000,000 for construction of the factory. C finishes construction of the factory in 2002 at a cost of $1,020,000. When B takes possession of the factory and begins operations in December 2002, B is dissatisfied with the location and workmanship of certain heating ducts. As of the end of 2002, C contends that the heating ducts are constructed in accordance with contract specifications. The amount of the gross contract price reasonably in dispute with respect to the heating ducts is $6,000. As of this time, C is claiming $14,000 in addition to the original contract price for certain changes in contract specifications which C alleges have increased his costs. B denies that these changes have increased C's costs. In 2003, the disputes between C and B are resolved by performance of additional work by C at a cost of $1,000 and by an agreement that the contract price would be revised downward to $996,000. Under these circumstances, C must include in his gross income for 2002, $994,000 (the gross contract price less the amount reasonably in dispute because of B's claim, or $1,000,000 − $6,000). In 2002, C must also take into account $1,000,000 of allocable contract costs (costs incurred less the amounts in dispute attributable to both B's and C's claims, or $1,020,000 − $6,000 − $14,000). In 2003, C must take into account an additional $2,000 of gross contract price ($996,000 − $994,000) and $21,000 of allocable contract costs ($1,021,000 − $1,000,000).
(i)
Applicability date.
Paragraph (f)(1) of this section applies to taxable years beginning on or after January 5, 2021. However, for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 5, 2021, a taxpayer may apply the paragraph described in the first sentence of this paragraph (i), provided that the taxpayer follows all the applicable rules contained in the regulations under section 460 for such taxable year and all subsequent taxable years.
(j)
Consolidated groups and controlled groups
—(1)
Intercompany transactions
—(i)
In general.
Section 1.1502-13 does not apply to the income, gain, deduction, or loss from an intercompany transaction between members of a consolidated group, and section 267(f) does not apply to these items from an intercompany sale between members of a controlled group, to the extent—
(A) The transaction or sale directly or indirectly benefits, or is intended to benefit, another member's long-term contract with a nonmember;
(B) The selling member is required under section 460 to determine any part of its gross income from the transaction or sale under the percentage-of-completion method (PCM); and
(C) The member with the long-term contract is required under section 460 to determine any part of its gross income from the long-term contract under the PCM.
(ii)
Definitions and nomenclature.
The definitions and nomenclature under § 1.1502-13 and § 1.267(f)-1 apply for purposes of this paragraph (j).
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the principles of paragraph (j)(1) of this section.

# Example.
Corporations P, S, and B file consolidated returns on a calendar-year basis. In 1996, B enters into a long-term contract with X, a nonmember, to manufacture 5 airplanes for $500 million, with delivery scheduled for 1999. Section 460 requires B to determine the gross income from its contract with X under the PCM. S enters into a contract with B to manufacture for $50 million the engines that B will install on X's airplanes. Section 460 requires S to determine the gross income from its contract with B under the PCM. S estimates that it will incur $40 million of total contract costs during 1997 and 1998 to manufacture the engines. S incurs $10 million of contract costs in 1997 and $30 million in 1998. Under paragraph (j) of this section, S determines its gross income from the long-term contract under the PCM rather than taking its income or loss into account under section 267(f) or § 1.1502-13. Thus, S includes $12.5 million of gross receipts and $10 million of contract costs in gross income in 1997 and includes $37.5 million of gross receipts and $30 million of contract costs in gross income in 1998.
(3)
Effective dates
—(i)
In general.
This paragraph (j) applies with respect to transactions and sales occurring pursuant to contracts entered into in years beginning on or after July 12, 1995.
(ii)
Prior law.
For transactions and sales occurring pursuant to contracts entered into in years beginning before July 12, 1995, see the applicable regulations issued under sections 267(f) and 1502, including §§ 1.267(f)-1T, 1.267(f)-2T, and 1.1502-13(n) (as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1995).
(4)
Consent to change method of accounting.
For transactions and sales to which this paragraph (j) applies, the Commissioner's consent under section 446(e) is hereby granted to the extent any changes in method of accounting are necessary solely to comply with this section, provided the changes are made in the first taxable year of the taxpayer to which the rules of this paragraph (j) apply. Changes in method of accounting for these transactions are to be effected on a cut-off basis.
(k)
Mid-contract change in taxpayer
—(1)
In general.
The rules in this paragraph (k) apply if prior to the completion of a long-term contract accounted for using a long-term contract method by a taxpayer (old taxpayer), there is a transaction that makes another taxpayer (new taxpayer) responsible for accounting for income from the same contract. For purposes of this paragraph (k) and § 1.460-6(g), an old taxpayer also includes any old taxpayer(s) (e.g., predecessors) of the old taxpayer. In addition, a change in status from taxable to tax exempt or from domestic to foreign, or vice versa, will be considered a change in taxpayer. Finally, a contract will be treated as the same contract if the terms of the contract are not substantially changed in connection with the transaction, whether or not the customer agrees to release the old taxpayer from any or all of its obligations under the contract. The rules governing constructive completion transactions are provided in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, while the rules governing step-in-the-shoes transactions are provided in paragraph (k)(3) of this section. Special rules relating to the treatment of certain partnership transactions are provided in paragraphs (k)(2)(iv) and (k)(3)(v) of this section. For application of the look-back method to mid-contract changes in taxpayers for contracts accounted for using the PCM, see § 1.460-6(g).
(2)
Constructive completion transactions
—(i)
Scope.
The constructive completion rules in this paragraph (k)(2) apply to transactions (constructive completion transactions) that result in a change in the taxpayer responsible for reporting income from a contract and that are not described in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this section. Constructive completion transactions generally include, for example, taxable sales under section 1001 and deemed asset sales under section 338.
(ii)
Old taxpayer.
The old taxpayer is treated as completing the contract on the date of the transaction. The total contract price (or, gross contract price in the case of a long-term contract accounted for under the CCM) for the old taxpayer is the sum of any amounts realized from the transaction that are allocable to the contract and any amounts the old taxpayer has received or reasonably expects to receive under the contract. Total contract price (or gross contract price) is reduced by any amount paid by the old taxpayer to the new taxpayer, and by any transaction costs, that are allocable to the contract. Thus, the old taxpayer's allocable contract costs determined under paragraph (b)(5) of this section do not include any consideration paid, or costs incurred, as a result of the transaction that are allocable to the contract. In the case of a transaction subject to section 338 or 1060, the amount realized from the transaction allocable to the contract is determined by using the residual method under §§ 1.338-6 and 1.338-7.
(iii)
New taxpayer.
The new taxpayer is treated as entering into a new contract on the date of the transaction. The new taxpayer must evaluate whether the new contract should be classified as a long-term contract within the meaning of § 1.460-1(b) and account for the contract under a permissible method of accounting. For a new taxpayer who accounts for a contract using the PCM, the total contract price
is any amount the new taxpayer reasonably expects to receive under the contract consistent with paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Total contract price is reduced by the amount of any consideration paid by the new taxpayer as a result of the transaction, and by any transaction costs, that are allocable to the contract and is increased by the amount of any consideration received by the new taxpayer as a result of the transaction that is allocable to the contract. Similarly, the gross contract price for a contract accounted for using the CCM is all amounts the new taxpayer is entitled by law or contract to receive consistent with paragraph (d)(3) of this section, adjusted for any consideration paid (or received) by the new taxpayer as a result of the transaction, and for any transaction costs, that are allocable to the contract. Thus, the new taxpayer's allocable contract costs determined under paragraph (b)(5) of this section do not include any consideration paid, or costs incurred, as a result of the transaction that are allocable to the contract. In the case of a transaction subject to sections 338 or 1060, the amount of consideration paid that is allocable to the contract is determined by using the residual method under §§ 1.338-6 and 1.338-7.
(iv)
Special rules relating to distributions of certain contracts by a partnership
—(A)
In general.
The constructive completion rules of paragraph (k)(2) of this section apply both to the distribution of a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting by a partnership to a partner and to the distribution of an interest in a partnership (lower-tier partnership) holding (either directly or through other partnerships) one or more contracts accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting by another partnership (upper-tier partnership). Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the constructive completion rules of paragraph (k)(2) of this section do not apply to a transfer by a partnership (transferor partnership) of all of its assets and liabilities to a second partnership (transferee partnership) in an exchange described in section 721, followed by a distribution of the interest in the transferee partnership in liquidation of the transferor partnership, under § 1.708-1(b)(4) (relating to terminations under section 708(b)(1)(B)) or § 1.708-1(c)(3)(i) (relating to certain partnership mergers). If a partnership that holds a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting terminates under section 708(b)(1)(A) because the number of its owners is reduced to one, the entire contract will be treated as being distributed from the partnership for purposes of the constructive completion rules, and the partnership must apply paragraph (k)(2) of this section immediately prior to the transaction or transactions resulting in the termination of the partnership.
(B)
Old taxpayer.
The partnership that distributes the contract is treated as the old taxpayer for purposes of paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section. For purposes of determining the total contract price (or gross contract price) under paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section, the fair market value of the contract is treated as the amount realized from the transaction. For purposes of determining each partner's distributive share of partnership items, any income or loss resulting from the constructive completion must be allocated among the partners of the old taxpayer as though the partnership closed its books on the date of the distribution.
(C)
New taxpayer.
The partner receiving the distributed contract is treated as the new taxpayer for purposes of paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section. For purposes of determining the total contract price (or gross contract price) under paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section, the new taxpayer's basis in the contract (including the uncompleted property, if applicable) after the distribution (as determined under section 732) is treated as consideration paid by the new taxpayer that is allocable to the contract. Thus, the total contract price (or gross contract price) of the new contract is reduced by the partner's basis in the contract (including the uncompleted property, if applicable) immediately after the distribution.
(D)
Basis rules.
For purposes of determining the new taxpayer's basis in the contract (including the uncompleted property, if applicable) under section
732, and the amount of any basis adjustment under section 734(b), the partnership's basis in the contract (including the uncompleted property, if applicable) immediately prior to the distribution is equal to—
(
1
) The partnership's allocable contract costs (including transaction costs);
(
2
) Increased (or decreased) by the amount of cumulative taxable income (or loss) recognized by the partnership on the contract through the date of the distribution (including amounts recognized as a result of the constructive completion); and
(
3
) Decreased by the amounts that the partnership has received or reasonably expects to receive under the contract.
(E)
Section 751
—(
1
)
In general.
Contracts accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting are unrealized receivables within the meaning of section 751(c). For purposes of section 751, the amount of ordinary income or loss attributable to a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting is the amount of income or loss that the partnership would take into account under the constructive completion rules of paragraph (k)(2) of this section if the contract were disposed of for its fair market value in a constructive completion transaction, adjusted to account for any income or loss from the contract that is allocated under section 706 to that portion of the taxable year of the partnership ending on the date of the distribution, sale, or exchange.
(
2
)
Ordering rules.
Because the distribution of a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting is the distribution of an unrealized receivable, section 751(b) may apply to the distribution. A partnership that distributes a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting must apply paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section before applying the rules of section 751(b) to the distribution.
(3)
Step-in-the-shoes transactions
—(i)
Scope.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (k)(3)(v)(D) of this section, the step-in-the-shoes rules in this paragraph (k)(3) apply to the following transactions that result in a change in the taxpayer responsible for reporting income from a contract accounted for using a long-term contract method of accounting (step-in-the-shoes transactions)—
(A) Transfers to which section 361 applies if the transfer is in connection with a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A), (C) or (F);
(B) Transfers to which section 361 applies if the transfer is in connection with a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D) or (G), provided the requirements of section 354(b)(1)(A) and (B) are met;
(C) Distributions to which section 332 applies, provided the contract is transferred to an 80-percent distributee;
(D) Transfers described in section 351;
(E) Transfers to which section 361 applies if the transfer is in connection with a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D) with respect to which the requirements of section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) are met;
(F) Transfers (e.g., sales) of S corporation stock;
(G) Conversion to or from an S corporation;
(H) Members joining or leaving a consolidated group;
(I) Contributions of contracts accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting to which section 721(a) applies;
(J) Contributions of property (other than contracts accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting) to a partnership that holds a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting;
(K) Transfers of partnership interests (other than transfers which cause the partnership to terminate under section 708(b)(1)(A));
(L) Distributions to which section 731 applies (other than the distribution of the contract); and
(M) Any other transaction designated in the Internal Revenue Bulletin by the Internal Revenue Service. See § 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter.
(ii)
Old taxpayer
—(A)
In general.
The new taxpayer will “step into the shoes” of the old taxpayer with respect to the contract. Thus, the old taxpayer's obligation to account for the contract terminates on the date of the
transaction and is assumed by the new taxpayer, as set forth in paragraph (k)(3)(iii) of this section. As a result, an old taxpayer using the PCM is required to recognize income from the contract based on the cumulative allocable contract costs incurred as of the date of the transaction. Similarly, an old taxpayer using the CCM is not required to recognize any revenue and may not deduct allocable contract costs incurred with respect to the contract.
(B)
Gain realized on the transaction.
The amount of gain the old taxpayer realizes on the transfer of a contract in a step-in-the-shoes transaction must be determined after application of paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(A) of this section using the rules of paragraph (k)(2) of this section that apply to constructive completion transactions. (The amount of gain realized on a transfer of a contract is relevant, for example, in determining the amount of gain recognized with respect to the contract in a section 351 transaction in which the old taxpayer receives from the new taxpayer money or property other than stock of the transferee.)
(iii)
New taxpayer
—(A)
Method of accounting.
Beginning on the date of the transaction, the new taxpayer must account for the long-term contract by using the same method of accounting used by the old taxpayer prior to the transaction. The same method of accounting must be used for such contract regardless of whether the old taxpayer's method is the new taxpayer's principal method of accounting under § 1.381(c)(4)-1(b)(3) or whether the new taxpayer is otherwise eligible to use the old taxpayer's method. Thus, if the old taxpayer uses the PCM to account for the contract, the new taxpayer steps into the shoes of the old taxpayer with respect to its completion factor and percentage of completion methods (such as the 10-percent method), even if the new taxpayer has not elected such methods for similarly classified contracts. Similarly, if the old taxpayer uses the CCM, the new taxpayer steps into the shoes of the old taxpayer with respect to the CCM, even if the new taxpayer is not otherwise eligible to use the CCM. However, the new taxpayer is not necessarily bound by the old taxpayer's method for similarly classified contracts entered into by the new taxpayer subsequent to the transaction and must apply general tax principles, including section 381, to determine the appropriate method to account for these subsequent contracts. To the extent that general tax principles allow the taxpayer to account for similarly classified contracts using a method other than the old taxpayer's method, the taxpayer is not required to obtain the consent of the Commissioner to begin using such other method.
(B)
Contract price.
In the case of a long-term contract that has been accounted for under PCM, the total contract price for the new taxpayer is the sum of any amounts the old taxpayer or the new taxpayer has received or reasonably expects to receive under the contract consistent with paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Similarly, the gross contract price in the case of a long-term contract accounted for under the CCM includes all amounts the old taxpayer or the new taxpayer is entitled by law or by contract to receive consistent with paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(C)
Contract costs.
Total allocable contract costs for the new taxpayer are the allocable contract costs as defined under paragraph (b)(5) of this section incurred by either the old taxpayer prior to, or the new taxpayer after, the transaction. Thus, any payments between the old taxpayer and the new taxpayer with respect to the contract in connection with the transaction are not treated as allocable contract costs.
(iv)
Special rules related to certain corporate and partnership transactions
—(A)
Old taxpayer
—
basis adjustment
—(

)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(A)(
2
) of this section, in the case of a transaction described in paragraph (k)(3)(i)(D), (E), or (I) of this section, the old taxpayer must adjust its basis in the stock or partnership interest of the new taxpayer by—
(
i
) Increasing such basis by the amount of gross receipts the old taxpayer has recognized under the contract; and
(
ii
) Reducing such basis by the amount of gross receipts the old taxpayer has received or reasonably expects to receive under the contract (except to the extent such gross receipts give rise to a liability other than a liability described in section 357(c)(3)).
(
2
)
Basis adjustment in excess of stock or partnership interest basis.
If the old and new taxpayer do not join in the filing of a consolidated Federal income tax return, the old taxpayer may not adjust its basis in the stock or partnership interest of the new taxpayer under paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section below zero and the old taxpayer must recognize ordinary income to the extent the basis in the stock or partnership interest of the new taxpayer otherwise would be adjusted below zero. If the old and new taxpayer join in the filing of a consolidated Federal income tax return, the old taxpayer must create an (or increase an existing) excess loss account to the extent the basis in the stock of the new taxpayer otherwise would be adjusted below zero under paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section. See § 1.1502-19 and 1.1502-32(a)(3)(ii).
(
3
)
Subsequent dispositions of certain contracts.
If the old taxpayer disposes of a contract in a transaction described in paragraph (k)(3)(i)(D), (E), or (I) of this section that the old taxpayer acquired in a transaction described in paragraph (k)(3)(i)(D), (E), or (I) of this section, the basis adjustment rule of this paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(A) is applied by treating the old taxpayer as having recognized the amount of gross receipts recognized by the previous old taxpayer under the contract and any amount recognized by the previous old taxpayer with respect to the contract in connection with the transaction in which the old taxpayer acquired the contract. In addition, the old taxpayer is treated as having received or as reasonably expecting to receive under the contract any amount the previous old taxpayer received or reasonably expects to receive under the contract. Similar principles will apply in the case of multiple successive transfers described in paragraph (k)(3)(i)(D), (E), or (I) of this section involving the contract.
(B)
New taxpayer
—(

)
Contract price adjustment.
Generally, payments between the old taxpayer and the new taxpayer with respect to the contract in connection with the transaction do not affect the contract price. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence and paragraph (k)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, however, in the case of transactions described in paragraph (k)(3)(i)(B), (D), (E), or (I) of this section, the total contract price (or gross contract price) must be reduced to the extent of any amount recognized by the old taxpayer with respect to the contract in connection with the transaction (
e.g.,
any amount recognized under section 351(b) or section 357 that is attributable to the contract and any income recognized by the old taxpayer pursuant to the basis adjustment rule of paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(A) of this section).
(
2
)
Basis in contract.
The new taxpayer's basis in a contract (including the uncompleted property, if applicable) acquired in a transaction described in paragraphs (k)(3)(i)(A) through (E) or paragraph (k)(3)(i)(I) of this section will be computed under section 362, section 334, or section 723, as applicable. Upon a new taxpayer's completion (actual or constructive) of a CCM or a PCM contract acquired in a transaction described in paragraphs (k)(3)(i)(A) through (E) or paragraph (k)(3)(i)(I) of this section, the new taxpayer's basis in the contract (including the uncompleted property, if applicable) is reduced to zero. The new taxpayer is not entitled to a deduction or loss in connection with any basis reduction pursuant to this paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(B)(
2
).
(C)
Definition of old taxpayer and new taxpayer for certain partnership transactions.
For purposes of paragraphs (k)(3)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section, in the case of a transaction described in paragraph (k)(3)(i)(I) of this section, the partner contributing the contract to the partnership is treated as the old taxpayer, and the partnership receiving the contract from the partner is treated as the new taxpayer.
(D)
Exceptions to step-in-the-shoes rules for S corporations.
Upon a transfer described in paragraph (k)(3)(i)(F) of this section or a conversion described in paragraph (k)(3)(i)(G) of this section,
paragraphs (k)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section apply to a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting only if the S corporation's books are closed under section 1362(e)(3), section 1362(e)(6)(C), section 1362(e)(6)(D), section 1377(a)(2), or § 1.1502-76 on the date of the transfer or conversion. In these cases, the corporation is treated as both the old taxpayer and the new taxpayer for purposes of paragraphs (k)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section. In all other cases involving these transfers, the corporation shall compute its income or loss from each contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting for the period that includes the date of the transaction as though no change in taxpayer had occurred with respect to the contract, and must allocate the income or loss from the contract for that period in accordance with the rules generally applicable to transfers of S corporation stock and conversions to or from S corporation status. This paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(D) is applicable for transactions on or after July 16, 2004. In addition, this paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(D) may be relied upon for transactions on or after May 15, 2002.
(v)
Special rules relating to certain partnership transactions
—(A)
Section 704(c)
—(
1
)
Contributions of contracts.
The principles of section 704(c)(1)(A), section 737, and the regulations thereunder apply to income or loss with respect to a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting that is contributed to a partnership. The amount of built-in income or built-in loss attributable to a contributed contract that is subject to section 704(c)(1)(A) is determined as follows. First, the contributing partner must take into account any income or loss required under paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(A) of this section for the period ending on the date of the contribution. Second, the partnership must determine the amount of income or loss that the contributing partner would take into account if the contract were disposed of for its fair market value in a constructive completion transaction. This calculation is treated as occurring immediately after the partner has applied paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, but before the contribution to the partnership. Finally, this amount is reduced by the amount of income, if any, that the contributing partner is required to recognize as a result of the contribution.
(
2
)
Revaluations of partnership property.
The principles of section 704(c) and § 1.704-3 apply to allocations of income or loss with respect to a long-term contract that is revalued by a partnership under § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(
f
). The amount of built-in income or built-in loss attributable to such a contract is equal to the amount of income or loss that would be taken into account if, at the time of the revaluation, the contract were disposed of for its fair market value in a constructive completion transaction.
(
3
)
Allocation methods.
In the case of a contract accounted for under the CCM, any built-in income or loss under section 704(c) is taken into account in the year the contract is completed. In the case of a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting other than the CCM, any built-in income or loss under section 704(c) must be taken into account in a manner that reasonably accounts for the section 704(c) income or loss over the remaining term of the contract.
(B)
Basis adjustments under sections 743(b) and 734(b).
For purposes of §§ 1.743-1(d), 1.755-1(b), and 1.755-1(c), the amount of ordinary income or loss attributable to a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting is the amount of income or loss that the partnership would take into account under the constructive completion rules of paragraph (k)(2) of this section if, at the time of the sale of a partnership interest or the distribution to a partner, the partnership disposed of the contract for its fair market value in a constructive completion transaction. If all or part of the transferee's basis adjustment under section 743(b) or the partnership's basis adjustment under section 734(b) is allocated to a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting, the basis adjustment shall reduce or increase, as the case may be, the affected party's income or loss from the contract. In the case of a contract accounted for under the CCM, the basis adjustment is taken into account
in the year in which the contract is completed. In the case of a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting other than the CCM, the portion of that basis adjustment that is recovered in each taxable year of the partnership must be determined by the partnership in a manner that reasonably accounts for the adjustment over the remaining term of the contract.
(C)
Cross reference.
See paragraph (k)(2)(iv)(E) of this section for rules relating to the application of section 751 to the transfer of an interest in a partnership holding a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting.
(D)
Exceptions to step-in-the-shoes rules.
Upon a contribution described in paragraph (k)(3)(i)(J) of this section, a transfer described in paragraph (k)(3)(i)(K) of this section, or a distribution described in paragraph (k)(3)(i)(L) of this section, paragraphs (k)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section apply to a contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting only if the partnership's books are properly closed with respect to that contract under section 706. In these cases, the partnership is treated as both the old taxpayer and the new taxpayer for purposes of paragraphs (k)(3)(ii) and (iii) of this section. In all other cases involving these transactions, the partnership shall compute its income or loss from each contract accounted for under a long-term contract method of accounting for the period that includes the date of the transaction as though no change in taxpayer had occurred with respect to the contract, and must allocate the income or loss from the contract for that period under a reasonable method complying with section 706.
(4)
Anti-abuse rule.
Notwithstanding this paragraph (k), in the case of a transaction entered into with a principal purpose of shifting the tax consequences associated with a long-term contract in a manner that substantially reduces the aggregate U.S. Federal income tax liability of the parties with respect to that contract, the Commissioner may allocate to the old (or new) taxpayer the income from that contract properly allocable to the old (or new) taxpayer. For example, the Commissioner may reallocate income from a long-term contract in a transaction in which a contract accounted for using the CCM, or using the PCM where the old taxpayer has received advance payments in excess of its contribution to the contract, is transferred to a tax indifferent party (e.g., a foreign person not subject to U.S. Federal income tax).
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (k). For purposes of these examples, it is assumed that the contract is a long-term construction contract accounted for using the PCM prior to the transaction unless stated otherwise and the contract is not transferred with a principal purpose of shifting the tax consequences associated with a long-term contract in a manner that substantially reduces the aggregate U.S. Federal income tax liability of the parties with respect to that contract. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1. Constructive completion—PCM.
(i)
Facts.
In Year 1, X enters into a contract. The total contract price is $1,000,000 and the estimated total allocable contract costs are $800,000. In Year 1, X incurs costs of $200,000. In Year 2, X incurs additional costs of $400,000 before selling the contract as part of a taxable sale of its business in Year 2 to Y, an unrelated party. At the time of sale, X has received $650,000 in progress payments under the contract. The consideration allocable to the contract under section 1060 is $150,000. Pursuant to the sale, the new taxpayer Y immediately assumes X's contract obligations and rights. Y is required to account for the contract using the PCM. In Year 2, Y incurs additional allocable contract costs of $50,000. Y correctly estimates at the end of Year 2 that it will have to incur an additional $75,000 of allocable contract costs in Year 3 to complete the contract.
(ii)
Old taxpayer.
For Year 1, X reports receipts of $250,000 (the completion factor multiplied by total contract price ($200,000/$800,000 × $1,000,000)) and costs of $200,000, for a profit of $50,000. X is treated as completing the contract in Year 2 because it sold the contract. For purposes of applying the PCM in Year 2, the total contract price is $800,000 (the sum of the amounts received under the contract and the amount realized in the sale ($650,000 + $150,000)) and the total allocable contract costs are $600,000 (the sum of the costs incurred in Year 1 and Year 2 ($200,000 + $400,000)). Thus, in Year 2, X reports receipts of $550,000 (total contract price minus receipts already reported ($800,000 −
$250,000)) and costs incurred in year 2 of $400,000, for a profit of $150,000.
(iii)
New taxpayer.
Y is treated as entering into a new contract in Year 2. The total contract price is $200,000 (the amount remaining to be paid under the terms of the contract less the consideration paid allocable to the contract ($1,000,000 − $650,000 − $150,000)). The estimated total allocable contract costs at the end of Year 2 are $125,000 (the allocable contract costs that Y reasonably expects to incur to complete the contract ($50,000 + $75,000)). In Year 2, Y reports receipts of $80,000 (the completion factor multiplied by the total contract price [($50,000/$125,000) × $200,000] and costs of $50,000 (the costs incurred after the purchase), for a profit of $30,000. For Year 3, Y reports receipts of $120,000 (total contract price minus receipts already reported ($200,000 − $80,000)) and costs of $75,000, for a profit of $45,000.

# Example 2. Constructive completion—CCM.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that X and Y properly account for the contract under the CCM.
(ii)
Old taxpayer.
X does not report any income or costs from the contract in Year 1. In Year 2, the contract is deemed complete for X, and X reports its gross contract price of $800,000 (the sum of the amounts received under the contract and the amount realized in the sale ($650,000 + $150,000)) and its total allocable contract costs of $600,000 (the sum of the costs incurred in Year 1 and Year 2 ($200,000 + $400,000)) in that year, for a profit of $200,000.
(iii)
New taxpayer.
Y is treated as entering into a new contract in Year 2. Under the CCM, Y reports no gross receipts or costs in Year 2. Y reports its gross contract price of $200,000 (the amount remaining to be paid under the terms of the contract less the consideration paid allocable to the contract ($1,000,000 − $650,000 − $150,000)) and its total allocable contract costs of $125,000 (the allocable contract costs that Y incurred to complete the contract ($50,000 + $75,000)) in Year 3, the completion year, for a profit of $75,000.

# Example 3. Step-in-the-shoes—PCM.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that X transfers the contract (including the uncompleted property) to Y in exchange for stock of Y in a transaction that qualifies as a statutory merger described in section 368(a)(1)(A) and does not result in gain or loss to X under section 361(a).
(ii)
Old taxpayer.
For Year 1, X reports receipts of $250,000 (the completion factor multiplied by total contract price ($200,000/$800,000 × $1,000,000)) and costs of $200,000, for a profit of $50,000. Because the mid-contract change in taxpayer results from a transaction described in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this section, X is not treated as completing the contract in Year 2. In Year 2, X reports receipts of $500,000 (the completion factor multiplied by the total contract price and minus the Year 1 gross receipts [($600,000/$800,000 × $1,000,000)-$250,000]) and costs of $400,000, for a profit of $100,000.
(iii)
New taxpayer.
Because the mid-contract change in taxpayer results from a step-in-the-shoes transaction, Y must account for the contract using the same methods of accounting used by X prior to the transaction. Total contract price is the sum of any amounts that X and Y have received or reasonably expect to receive under the contract, and total allocable contract costs are the allocable contract costs of X and Y. Thus, the estimated total allocable contract costs at the end of Year 2 are $725,000 (the cumulative allocable contract costs of X and the estimated total allocable contract costs of Y ($200,000 + $400,000 + $50,000 + $75,000)). In Year 2, Y reports receipts of $146,552 (the completion factor multiplied by the total contract price minus receipts reported by the old taxpayer ([($650,000/$725,000) × $1,000,000]-$750,000) and costs of $50,000, for a profit of $96,552. For Year 3, Y reports receipts of $103,448 (the total contract price minus prior year receipts ($1,000,000-$896,552)) and costs of $75,000, for a profit of $28,448.

# Example 4. Step-in-the-shoes—CCM
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that X properly accounts for the contract under the CCM.
(ii)
Old taxpayer.
X reports no income or costs from the contract in Years 1, 2 or 3.
(iii)
New taxpayer.
Because the mid-contract change in taxpayer results from a step-in-the-shoes transaction, Y must account for the contract using the same method of accounting used by X prior to the transaction. Thus, in Year 3, the completion year, Y reports receipts of $1,000,000 and total contract costs of $725,000, for a profit of $275,000.

# Example 5. Step in the shoes—PCM—basis adjustment.
The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that X transfers the contract (including the uncompleted property) with a basis of $0 and $125,000 of cash to a new corporation, Z, in exchange for all of the stock of Z in a section 351 transaction. Thus, under section 358(a), X's basis in the Z stock is $125,000. Pursuant to paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(A)(

) of this section, X must increase its basis in the Z stock by the amount of gross receipts X recognized under the contract, $750,000 ($250,000 receipts in Year 1 + $500,000 receipts in Year 2), and reduce its basis by the amount of gross receipts X received under the contract, the $650,000 in progress payments. Accordingly, X's basis in the Z stock is $225,000. All other results are the same.

X reports no income or costs under the contract in Years 1, 2, or 3. Under section 358(a), X's basis in Z is $725,000. Pursuant to paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(A)(

), X must reduce its basis in the stock of Z by $800,000, the progress payments received by X. However, X may not reduce its basis in the Z stock below zero pursuant paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(A)(

Example 3,
except that X transfers the contract (including the uncompleted property) with a basis of $0 and an unrelated capital asset with a value of $100,000 and a basis of $0 to a new corporation, Z, in exchange for stock of Z with a value of $200,000 and $50,000 of cash in a section 351 transaction.
(ii)
Old taxpayer.
For year 1, X reports receipts of $250,000 ($200,000/$800,000 × $1,000,000) and costs of $200,000, for a profit of $50,000. X is not treated as completing the contract in Year 2. In Year 2, X reports receipts of $500,000 (($600,000/$800,000 × $1,000,000 = $750,000 cumulative gross receipts)—$250,000 prior year cumulative gross receipts) and costs of $400,000, for a profit of $100,000. Under paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, X determines that the gain realized on the transfer of the contract to Z under the constructive completion rules of paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section is $50,000 (total contract price of $800,000 ($150,000 value allocable to the contract + $650,000 progress payments)—$750,000 previously recognized cumulative gross receipts—$0 costs incurred but not recognized). The gain realized on the transfer of the unrelated capital asset to Z is $100,000. The amount of gain X must recognize due to the receipt of $50,000 cash in the exchange is $50,000, of which $30,000 is allocated to the contract ($150,000 value of contract/$250,000 total value of property transferred to Z × $50,000) and is treated as ordinary income, and $20,000 is allocated to the unrelated capital asset ($100,000 value of capital asset/$250,000 total value of property transferred to Z × $50,000). Under section 358(a), X's basis in the Z stock is $0. However, pursuant to paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section, X must increase its basis in the Z stock by $750,000, the amount of gross receipts recognized under the contract, and must reduce its basis in the Z stock by $650,000, the amount of gross receipts X received under the contract. Therefore, X's basis in the Z stock is $100,000.
(iii)
New taxpayer.
Z must account for the contract using the same PCM method used by X prior to the transaction. Pursuant to paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(B)(1) of this section, the total contract price is $970,000 ($1,000,000 amount X and Z have received or reasonably expect to receive under the contract—$30,000 income recognized by X with respect to the contract as a result of the receipt of $50,000 cash in the transaction). In Year 2, Z reports gross receipts of $119,655 ($650,000/$725,000 × $970,000 = $869,655 current year cumulative gross receipts—$750,000 cumulative gross receipts reported by the old taxpayer) and costs of $50,000, for a profit of $69,655. In Year 3, Z reports gross receipts of $100,345 ($970,000-$869,655) and costs of $75,000, for a profit of $25,345.

X and Z do not join in filing a consolidated Federal income tax return.
(ii)
Old taxpayer.
X reports no income or costs under the contract in Years 1, 2, or 3. Under paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(B), X determines that the gain realized on the transfer of the contract to Z under the constructive completion rules of paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section is $200,000 ($800,000 total contract price ($150,000 value allocable to the contract + $650,000 progress payments)—$600,000 costs incurred but not recognized). The gain realized on the transfer of the unrelated capital asset to Z is $125,000. The amount of gain X must recognize due to the receipt of $100,000 of cash in the exchange is $100,000, of which $54,545 is allocated to the contract ($150,000 value of the contract/$275,000 total value of property transferred to Z × $100,000) and is treated as ordinary income, and $45,455 is allocated to the unrelated capital asset ($125,000 value of capital asset/$275,000 total value of property transferred to Z × $100,000). Under section 358(a), X's basis in the Z stock is $600,000 ($600,000 basis in the contract and unrelated capital asset transferred—$100,000 cash received + $100,000 gain recognized). Pursuant to paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(A)(
1
) of this section, X must reduce its basis in the stock of Z by $650,000, the progress payments received under the contract. However, X may not reduce its basis in the Z stock below zero pursuant to paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(A)(

) of this section. Accordingly, X's basis in the Z stock
is reduced by $600,000 to zero and X must recognize income of $50,000.

New taxpayer.
Z must account for the contract using the same CCM used by X prior to the transaction. Pursuant to paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(B)(1) of this section, the total contract price is $895,455 ($1,000,000 original contract price—$54,545 income recognized by old taxpayer with respect to the contract as a result of the receipt of cash in the transaction—$50,000 income recognized by the old taxpayer pursuant to the basis adjustment rule of paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(A)). Accordingly, upon completion of the contract in Year 3, Z reports gross receipts of $895,455 and total contract costs of $725,000, for a profit of $170,455.

# Example 9. Constructive completion—PCM—distribution of contract by partnership.
(i)
Facts.
In Year 1, W, X, Y, and Z each contribute $100,000 to form equal partnership PRS. In Year 1, PRS enters into a contract. The total contract price is $1,000,000 and the estimated total allocable contract costs are $800,000. In Year 1, PRS incurs costs of $600,000 and receives $650,000 in progress payments under the contract. Under the contract, PRS performed all of the services required in order to be entitled to receive the progress payments, and there was no obligation to return the payments or perform any additional services in order to retain the payments. PRS properly accounts for the contract under the PCM. In Year 2, PRS distributes the contract to X in liquidation of X's interest. PRS incurs no costs and receives no progress payments in Year 2 prior to the distribution. At the time of the distribution, PRS's only asset other than the long-term contract and the partially constructed property is $450,000 cash ($400,000 initially contributed and $50,000 in excess progress payments). The fair market value of the contract is $150,000. Pursuant to the distribution, X assumes PRS's contract obligations and rights. In Year 2, X incurs additional allocable contract costs of $50,000. X correctly estimates at the end of Year 2 that X will have to incur an additional $75,000 of allocable contract costs in Year 3 to complete the contract (rather than $150,000 as originally estimated by PRS). Assume that X properly accounts for the contract under the PCM, that PRS has no income or loss other than income or loss from the contract, and that PRS has an election under section 754 in effect in Year 2.
(ii)
Tax consequences to PRS.
For Year 1, PRS reports receipts of $750,000 (the completion factor multiplied by total contract price ($600,000/$800,000 × $1,000,000)) and costs of $600,000, for a profit of $150,000, which is allocated equally among W, X, Y, and Z ($37,500 each). Immediately prior to the distribution of the contract to X in Year 2, the contract is deemed completed. Under paragraph (k)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, the fair market value of the contract ($150,000) is treated as the amount realized from the transaction. For purposes of applying the PCM in Year 2, the total contract price is $800,000 (the sum of the amounts received under the contract and the amount treated as realized from the transaction ($650,000 + $150,000)) and the total allocable contract costs are $600,000. Thus, in Year 2 PRS reports receipts of $50,000 (total contract price minus receipts already reported ($800,000 − $750,000)), and costs incurred in Year 2 of $0, for a profit of $50,000. Under paragraph (k)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, this profit must be allocated among W, X, Y, and Z as though the partnership closed its books on the date of the distribution. Accordingly, each partner's distributive share of this income is $12,500.
(iii)
Tax consequences to X.
X's basis in its interest in PRS immediately prior to the distribution is $150,000 (X's $100,000 initial contribution, increased by $37,500, X's distributive share of Year 1 income, and $12,500, X's distributive share of Year 2 income). Under paragraph (k)(2)(iv)(D) of this section, PRS's basis in the contract (including the uncompleted property, if applicable) immediately prior to the distribution is equal to $150,000 (the partnership's allocable contract costs, $600,000, increased by the amount of income recognized by PRS on the contract through the date of the distribution (including amounts recognized as a result of the constructive completion), $200,000, decreased by the amounts that the partnership has received or reasonably expects to receive under the contract, $650,000). Under section 732, X's basis in the contract (including the uncompleted property) after the distribution is $150,000. Under paragraph (k)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, X's basis in the contract (including the uncompleted property) is treated as consideration paid by X that is allocable to the contract. X's total contract price is $200,000 (the amount remaining to be paid under the terms of the contract less the consideration allocable to the contract ($350,000-$150,000)). For Year 2, X reports receipts of $80,000 (the completion factor multiplied by the total contract price [($50,000/$125,000) × $200,000]) and costs of $50,000 (the costs incurred after the distribution of the contract), for a profit of $30,000. For Year 3, X reports receipts of $120,000 (the total contract price minus receipts already reported ($200,000 − $80,000)) and costs of $75,000, for a profit of $45,000.
(iv)
Section 734(b).
Because X's basis in the contract (including the uncompleted property) immediately after the distribution, $150,000, is equal to PRS's basis in the contract (including the uncompleted property) immediately prior to the distribution, there is no basis adjustment under section 734(b).

# Example 10. Constructive completion—CCM—distribution of contract by partnership.

Facts.
The facts are the same as in

9,
except that PRS and X properly account for the contract under the CCM.
(ii)
Tax consequences to PRS.
PRS reports no income or costs from the contract in Year 1. Immediately prior to the distribution of the contract to X in Year 2, the contract is deemed completed. Under paragraph (k)(2)(iv)(B) of this section, the fair market value of the contract ($150,000) is treated as the amount realized from the transaction. For purposes of applying the CCM in Year 2, the gross contract price is $800,000 (the sum of the amounts received under the contract and the amount treated as realized from the transaction ($650,000 + $150,000)) and the total allocable contract costs are $600,000. Thus, in Year 2 PRS reports profits of $200,000 ($800,000 − $600,000). This profit must be allocated among W, X, Y, and Z as though the partnership closed its books on the date of the distribution. Accordingly, each partner's distributive share of this income is $50,000.
(iii)
Tax consequences to X.
X's basis in its interest in PRS immediately prior to the distribution is $150,000 ($100,000 initial contribution, increased by $50,000, X's distributive share of Year 2 income). Under paragraph (k)(2)(iv)(D) of this section, PRS's basis in the contract (including the uncompleted property, if applicable) immediately prior to the distribution is equal to $150,000 (the partnership's allocable contract costs, $600,000, increased by the amount of cumulative taxable income recognized by PRS on the contract through the date of the distribution (including amounts recognized as a result of the constructive completion), $200,000, decreased by the amounts that the partnership has received or reasonably expects to receive under the contract, $650,000). Under section 732, X's basis in the contract (including the uncompleted property) after the distribution is $150,000. Under paragraph (k)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, X's basis in the contract is treated as consideration paid by X that is allocable to the contract. Under the CCM, X reports no gross receipts or costs in Year 2. For Year 3, the completion year, X reports its gross contract price of $200,000 (the amount remaining to be paid under the terms of the contract less the consideration allocable to the contract ($350,000 − $150,000)) and its total allocable contract costs of $125,000 (the allocable contract costs that X incurred to complete the contract ($50,000 + $75,000)), for a profit of $75,000.
(iv)
Section 734(b).
The results under section 734(b) are the same as in Example 9.

# Example 11. Step-in-the-shoes—PCM—contribution of contract to partnership.
(i)
Facts.
In Year 1, X enters into a contract that X properly accounts for under the PCM. The total contract price is $1,000,000 and the estimated total allocable contract costs are $800,000. In Year 1, X incurs costs of $600,000 and receives $650,000 in progress payments under the contract. Under the contract, X performed all of the services required in order to be entitled to receive the progress payments, and there was no obligation to return the payments or perform any additional services in order to retain the payments. In Year 2, X contributes the contract (including the uncompleted property) with a basis of $0 and $125,000 of cash to partnership PRS in exchange for a one-fourth partnership interest. X incurs costs of $10,000, and receives no progress payments in Year 2 prior to the contribution of the contract. X and the other three partners of PRS share equally in its capital, profits, and losses. The parties determine that, at the time of the contribution, the fair market value of the contract is $160,000. Following the contribution in Year 2, PRS incurs additional allocable contract costs of $40,000. PRS correctly estimates at the end of Year 2 that it will have to incur an additional $75,000 of allocable contract costs in Year 3 to complete the contract (rather than $150,000 as originally estimated by PRS).
(ii)
Tax consequences to X.
For Year 1, X reports receipts of $750,000 (the completion factor multiplied by the total contract price ($600,000/$800,000 × $1,000,000)) and costs of $600,000, for a profit of $150,000. Because the mid-contract change in taxpayer results from a transaction described in paragraph (k)(3)(i)(I) of this section, X is not treated as completing the contract in Year 2. Under paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, for Year 2, X reports receipts of $12,500 (the completion factor multiplied by the total contract price ($610,000/$800,000 × $1,000,000, or $762,500), decreased by receipts already reported, $750,000) and costs of $10,000, for a profit of $2,500. Under section 722, X's initial basis in its interest in PRS is $125,000. Pursuant to paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(A)(1) of this section, X must increase its basis in its interest in PRS by the amount of gross receipts X recognized under the contract, $762,500, and reduce its basis by the amount of gross receipts X received under the contract, the $650,000 in progress payments. Accordingly, X's basis in its interest in PRS is $237,500.
(iii)
Tax consequences to PRS.
Because the mid-contract change in taxpayer results from a step-in-the-shoes transaction, PRS must account for the contract using the same methods of accounting used by X prior to the transaction. The total contract price is the sum of any amounts that X and PRS have received or reasonably expect to receive under the contract, and total allocable contract costs are the allocable contract costs of X and PRS. For Year 2, PRS reports receipts of $134,052 (the completion factor multiplied by the total contract price [($650,000/$725,000) − $1,000,000], $896,552, decreased by receipts reported by X, $762,500) and costs of $40,000, for a profit of $94,052. For Year 3, PRS reports receipts of $103,448 (the total contract price minus prior year receipts
($1,000,000 × $896,552)) and costs of $75,000, for a profit of $28,448.
(iv)
Section 704(c).
The principles of section 704(c) and § 1.704-3 apply to allocations of income or loss with respect to the contract contributed by X. In this case, the amount of built-in income that is subject to section 704(c) is the amount of income or loss that the contributing partner would take into account if the contract were disposed of for its fair market value in a constructive completion transaction. This calculation is treated as occurring immediately after the partner has applied paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, but before the contribution to the partnership. In a constructive completion transaction, the total contract price would be $810,000 (the sum of the amounts received under the contract and the amount realized in the deemed sale ($650,000 + $160,000)). X would report receipts of $47,500 (total contract price minus receipts already reported ($810,000 − $762,500)) and costs of $0, for a profit of $47,500. Thus, the amount of built-in income that is subject to section 704(c) is $47,500. The partnership must apply section 704(c) to this income in a manner that reasonably accounts for the income over the remaining term of the contract. For example, in Year 2, PRS could allocate $26,810 to X under section 704(c) (the amount of built-in income, $47,500, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the completion factor for the year, $650,000/725,000, less the completion factor for the prior year, $610,000/$800,000, and the denominator of which is 100 percent reduced by the completion factor for the taxable year preceding the event creating the section 704(c) income or loss, $610,000/$800,000). The remaining $67,242 would be allocated equally among all of the partners. In Year 3, the completion year, PRS could allocate $20,690 to X under section 704(c) ($47,500 × [($725,000/$725,000 −$650,000/$725,000) / (100 percent − $610,000/$800,000)]). The remaining $7,758 would be allocated equally among all the partners.

# Example 12. Step-in-the-shoes—CCM—contribution of contract to partnership.

The facts are the same as in
Example 11,
except that X and PRS properly account for the contract under the CCM, and X has a basis of $610,000 in the contract (including the uncompleted property).
(ii)
Tax consequences to X.
X reports no income or costs from the contract in Years 1 or 2. X is not treated as completing the contract in Year 2. Under section 722, X's initial basis in its interest in PRS is $735,000 (the sum of $125,000 cash and X's basis of $610,000 in the contract (including the uncompleted property)). Pursuant to paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(A)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section, X must reduce its basis in its interest in PRS by the amount of gross receipts X received under the contract, or $650,000. Accordingly, X's basis in its interest in PRS is $85,000.
(iii)
Tax consequences to PRS.
PRS must account for the contract using the same methods of accounting used by X prior to the transaction. Under the CCM, PRS reports no gross receipts or costs in Year 2. For Year 3, the completion year, PRS reports its gross contract price of $1,000,000 (the sum of any amounts that X and PRS have received or reasonably expect to receive under the contract), and total allocable contract costs of $725,000 (the allocable contract costs of X and PRS), for a profit of $275,000.
(iv)
Section 704(c).
In this case, the amount of built-in income that is subject to section 704(c) is the amount of income or loss that the contributing partner would take into account if the contract were disposed of for its fair market value in a constructive completion transaction. This calculation is treated as occurring immediately after the partner has applied paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, but before the contribution to the partnership. In a constructive completion transaction, X would report its gross contract price of $810,000 (the sum of the amounts received under the contract and the amount realized in the deemed sale ($650,000 + $160,000)) and its total allocable contract costs of $610,000, for a profit of $200,000. Thus, the amount of built-in income that is subject to section 704(c) is $200,000. Out of PRS's income of $275,000, in Year 3, $200,000 must be allocated to X under section 704(c), and the remaining $75,000 is allocated equally among all of the partners.

# Example 13. Step-in-the-shoes—PCM—transfer of a partnership interest.
(i)
Facts.
In Year 1, W, X, Y, and Z each contribute $100,000 to form equal partnership PRS. In Year 1, PRS enters into a contract. The total contract price is $1,000,000 and the estimated total allocable contract costs are $800,000. In Year 1, PRS incurs costs of $600,000 and receives $650,000 in progress payments under the contract. Under the contract, PRS performed all of the services required in order to be entitled to receive the progress payments, and there was no obligation to return the payment or perform any additional services in order to retain the payments. PRS properly accounts for the contract under the PCM. In Year 2, W transfers W's interest in PRS to T for $150,000. Assume that $10,000 of PRS's Year 2 costs are incurred prior to the transfer, $40,000 are incurred after the transfer; and that PRS receives no progress payments in Year 2. Also assume that the fair market value of the contract on the date of the transfer is $160,000, that PRS closes its books with respect to the contract under section 706 on the date of the transfer, and that PRS correctly estimates at the end of Year 2 that it will have to incur an additional $75,000 of allocable contract costs in Year 3 to complete the contract (rather than $150,000 as originally estimated by PRS).
(ii)
Income reporting for period ending on date of transfer.
For Year 1, PRS reports receipts of $750,000 (the completion factor multiplied by total contract price ($600,000/$800,000 × $1,000,000)) and costs of $600,000, for a profit of $150,000. This profit is allocated equally among W, X, Y, and Z ($37,500 each). Under paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, for the part of Year 2 ending on the date of the transfer of W's interest, PRS reports receipts of $12,500 (the completion factor multiplied by the total contract price ($610,000/$800,000 × $1,000,000) minus receipts already reported ($750,000)) and costs of $10,000 for a profit of $2,500. This profit is allocated equally among W, X, Y, and Z ($625 each).
(iii)
Income reporting for period after transfer.
PRS must continue to use the PCM. For the part of Year 2 beginning on the day after the transfer, PRS reports receipts of $134,052 (the completion factor multiplied by the total contract price decreased by receipts reported by PRS for the period ending on the date of the transfer [($650,000/$725,000 × $1,000,000)—$762,500]) and costs of $40,000, for a profit of $94,052. This profit is shared equally among T, X, Y, and Z ($23,513 each). For Year 3, PRS reports receipts of $103,448 (the total contract price minus prior year receipts ($1,000,000 − $896,552)) and costs of $75,000, for a profit of $28,448. The profit for Year 3 is shared equally among T, X, Y, and Z ($7,112 each).
(iv)
Tax Consequences to W.
W's amount realized is $150,000. W's adjusted basis in its interest in PRS is $138,125 ($100,000 originally contributed, plus $37,500, W's distributive share of PRS's Year 1 income, and $625, W's distributive share of PRS's Year 2 income prior to the transfer). Accordingly, W's income from the sale of W's interest in PRS is $11,875. Under paragraph (k)(2)(iv)(E) of this section, for purposes of section 751(a), the amount of ordinary income attributable to the contract is determined as follows. First, the partnership must determine the amount of income or loss from the contract that is allocated under section 706 to the period ending on the date of the sale ($625). Second, the partnership must determine the amount of income or loss that the partnership would take into account under the constructive completion rules of paragraph (k)(2) of this section if the contract were disposed of for its fair market value in a constructive completion transaction. Because PRS closed its books under section 706 with respect to the contract on the date of the sale, this calculation is treated as occurring immediately after the partnership has applied paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(A) of this section on the date of the sale. In a constructive completion transaction, the total contract price would be $810,000 (the sum of the amounts received under the contract and the amount realized in the deemed sale ($650,000 + $160,000)). PRS would report receipts of $47,500 (total contract price minus receipts already reported ($810,000 − $762,500)) and costs of $0, for a profit of $47,500. Thus, the amount of ordinary income attributable to the contract is $47,500, and W's share of that income is $11,875. Thus, under § 1.751-1(a), all of W's $11,875 of income from the sale of W's interest in PRS is ordinary income.
(v)
Tax Consequences to T.
T's adjusted basis for its interest in PRS is $150,000. Under § 1.743-1(d)(2), the amount of income that would be allocated to T if the contract were disposed of for its fair market value (adjusted to account for income from the contract for the portion of PRS's taxable year that ends on the date of the transfer) is $11,875. Under § 1.743-1(b), the amount of T's basis adjustment under section 743(b) is $11,875. Under paragraph (k)(3)(v)(B) of this section, the portion of T's basis adjustment that is recovered in Year 2 and Year 3 must be determined by PRS in a manner that reasonably accounts for the adjustment over the remaining term of the contract. For example, PRS could recover $6,703 of the adjustment in Year 2 (the amount of the basis adjustment, $11,875, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the excess of the completion factor for the year, $650,000/$725,000, less the completion factor for the prior year, $610,000/$800,000, and the denominator of which is 100 percent reduced by the completion factor for the taxable year preceding the transfer, $610,000/$800,000). T's distributive share of income in Year 2 from the contract would be adjusted from $23,513 to $16,810 as a result of the basis adjustment. In Year 3, the completion year, PRS could recover $5,172 of the adjustment ($11,875 × [($725,000/$725,000 −$650,000/$725,000) / (100 percent − $610,000/$800,000)]). T's distributive share of income in Year 3, the completion year, from the contract would be adjusted from $7,112 to $1,940 as a result of the basis adjustment.

Effective date.
Except as provided in paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(D) of this section, this paragraph (k) is applicable for transactions on or after May 15, 2002. Application of the rules of this paragraph (k) to a transaction that occurs on or after May 15, 2002 is not a change in method of accounting.

§ 1.460-5
Cost allocation rules.
(a)
Overview.
This section prescribes methods of allocating costs to long-term contracts accounted for using the
percentage-of-completion method described in § 1.460-4(b) (PCM), the completed-contract method described in § 1.460-4(d) (CCM), or the percentage-of-completion/capitalized-cost method described in § 1.460-4(e) (PCCM). Exempt construction contracts described in § 1.460-3(b) accounted for using a method other than the PCM or CCM are not subject to the cost allocation rules of this section (other than the requirement to allocate production-period interest under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section). Paragraph (b) of this section describes the regular cost allocation methods for contracts subject to the PCM. Paragraph (c) of this section describes an elective simplified cost allocation method for contracts subject to the PCM. Paragraph (d) of this section describes the cost allocation methods for exempt construction contracts reported using the CCM. Paragraph (e) of this section describes the cost allocation rules for contracts subject to the PCCM. Paragraph (f) of this section describes additional rules applicable to the cost allocation methods described in this section. Paragraph (g) of this section provides rules concerning consistency in method of allocating costs to long-term contracts.
(b)
Cost allocation method for contracts subject to PCM
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a taxpayer must allocate costs to each long-term contract subject to the PCM in the same manner that direct and indirect costs are capitalized to property produced by a taxpayer under § 1.263A-1(e) through (h). Thus, a taxpayer must allocate to each long-term contract subject to the PCM all direct costs and certain indirect costs properly allocable to the long-term contract (
i.e.,
all costs that directly benefit or are incurred by reason of the performance of the long-term contract). However, see paragraph (c) of this section concerning an election to allocate contract costs using the simplified cost-to-cost method. As in section 263A, the use of the practical capacity concept is not permitted. See § 1.263A-2(a)(4).
(2)
Special rules
—(i)
Direct material costs.
The costs of direct materials must be allocated to a long-term contract when dedicated to the contract under principles similar to those in § 1.263A-11(b)(2). Thus, a taxpayer dedicates direct materials by associating them with a specific contract, including by purchase order, entry on books and records, or shipping instructions. A taxpayer maintaining inventories under § 1.471-1 must determine allocable contract costs attributable to direct materials using its method of accounting for those inventories (
e.g.,
FIFO, LIFO, specific identification).
(ii)
Components and subassemblies.
The costs of a component or subassembly (component) produced by the taxpayer must be allocated to a long-term contract as the taxpayer incurs costs to produce the component if the taxpayer reasonably expects to incorporate the component into the subject matter of the contract. Similarly, the cost of a purchased component (including a component purchased from a related party) must be allocated to a long-term contract as the taxpayer incurs the cost to purchase the component if the taxpayer reasonably expects to incorporate the component into the subject matter of the contract. In all other cases, the cost of a component must be allocated to a long-term contract when the component is dedicated, under principles similar to those in § 1.263A-11(b)(2). A taxpayer maintaining inventories under § 1.471-1 must determine allocable contract costs attributable to components using its method of accounting for those inventories (
e.g.,
FIFO, LIFO, specific identification).
(iii)
Simplified production methods.
A taxpayer may not determine allocable contract costs using the simplified production methods described in § 1.263A-2(b) and (c).
(iv)
Costs identified under cost-plus long-term contracts and federal long-term contracts.
To the extent not otherwise allocated to the contract under this paragraph (b), a taxpayer must allocate any identified costs to a cost-plus long-term contract or federal long-term contract (as defined in section 460(d)).
Identified cost
means any cost, including a charge representing the time-value of money, identified by the taxpayer or related person as being attributable to the taxpayer's cost-plus long-term contract or federal long-term
contract under the terms of the contract itself or under federal, state, or local law or regulation.
(v)
Interest
—(A)
In general.
If property produced under a long-term contract is
designated property,
as defined in § 1.263A-8(b) (without regard to the exclusion for long-term contracts under § 1.263A-8(d)(2)(v)), a taxpayer must allocate interest incurred during the production period to the long-term contract in the same manner as interest is allocated to property produced by a taxpayer under section 263A(f). See §§ 1.263A-8 to 1.263A-12 generally.
(B)
Production period.
Notwithstanding § 1.263A-12(c) and (d), for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(v), the production period of a long-term contract—
(
1
) Begins on the later of—
(
i
) The contract commencement date, as defined in § 1.460-1(b)(7); or
(
ii
) For a taxpayer using the accrual method of accounting for long-term contracts, the date by which 5 percent or more of the total estimated costs, including design and planning costs, under the contract have been incurred; and
(
2
) Ends on the date that the contract is completed, as defined in § 1.460-1(c)(3).
(C)
Application of section 263A(f).
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(v), section 263A(f)(1)(B)(iii) (regarding an estimated production period exceeding 1 year and a cost exceeding $1,000,000) must be applied on a contract-by-contract basis; except that, in the case of a taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting, that section must be applied on a property-by-property basis.
(vi)
Research and experimental expenses.
Notwithstanding § 1.263A-1(e)(3)(ii)(P) and (iii)(B), a taxpayer must allocate research and experimental expenses, other than independent research and development expenses (as defined in § 1.460-1(b)(9)), to its long-term contracts.
(vii)
Service costs
—(A)
Simplified service cost method
—(1)
In general.
To use the simplified service cost method under § 1.263A-1(h), a taxpayer must allocate the otherwise capitalizable mixed service costs among its long-term contracts using a reasonable method. For example, otherwise capitalizable mixed service costs may be allocated to each long-term contract based on labor hours or contract costs allocable to the contract. To be considered reasonable, an allocation method must be applied consistently and must not disproportionately allocate service costs to contracts expected to be completed in the near future.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rule of this paragraph (b)(2)(vii)(A):

# Example. Simplified service cost method.
During 2001, C, whose taxable year ends December 31, produces electronic equipment for inventory and enters into long-term contracts to manufacture specialized electronic equipment. C's method of allocating mixed service costs to the property it produces is the labor-based, simplified service cost method described in § 1.263A-1(h)(4). For 2001, C's total mixed service costs are $100,000, C's section 263A labor costs are $500,000, C's section 460 labor costs (
i.e.,
labor costs allocable to C's long-term contracts) are $250,000, and C's total labor costs are $1,000,000. To determine the amount of mixed service costs capitalizable under section 263A for 2001, C multiplies its total mixed service costs by its section 263A allocation ratio (section 263A labor costs ÷ total labor costs). Thus, C's capitalizable mixed service costs for 2001 are $50,000 ($100,000 × $500,000 ÷ $1,000,000). Thereafter, C allocates its capitalizable mixed service costs to produced property remaining in ending inventory using its 263A allocation method (
e.g.,
burden rate, simplified production). Similarly, to determine the amount of mixed service costs that are allocable to C's long-term contracts for 2001, C multiplies its total mixed service costs by its section 460 allocation ratio (section 460 labor ÷ total labor costs). Thus, C's allocable mixed service contract costs for 2001 are $25,000 ($100,000 × $250,000 ÷ $1,000,000). Thereafter, C allocates its allocable mixed service costs to its long-term contracts proportionately based on its section 460 labor costs allocable to each long-term contract.
(B)
Jobsite costs.
If an administrative, service, or support function is performed solely at the jobsite for a specific long-term contract, the taxpayer may allocate all the direct and indirect costs of that administrative, service, or support function to that long-term contract. Similarly, if an administrative, service, or support function is performed at the jobsite solely for the taxpayer's long-term contract activities,
the taxpayer may allocate all the direct and indirect costs of that administrative, service, or support function among all the long-term contracts performed at that jobsite. For this purpose, jobsite means a production plant or a construction site.
(C)
Limitation on other reasonable cost allocation methods.
A taxpayer may use any other reasonable method of allocating service costs, as provided in § 1.263A-1(f)(4), if, for the taxpayer's long-term contracts considered as a whole, the—
(
1
) Total amount of service costs allocated to the contracts does not differ significantly from the total amount of service costs that would have been allocated to the contracts under § 1.263A-1(f)(2) or (3);
(
2
) Service costs are not allocated disproportionately to contracts expected to be completed in the near future because of the taxpayer's cost allocation method; and
(
3
) Taxpayer's cost allocation method is applied consistently.
(c)
Simplified cost-to-cost method for contracts subject to the PCM
—(1)
In general.
Instead of using the cost allocation method prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, a taxpayer may elect to use the simplified cost-to-cost method, which is authorized under section 460(b)(3)(A), to allocate costs to a long-term contract subject to the PCM. Under the simplified cost-to-cost method, a taxpayer determines a contract's completion factor based upon only direct material costs; direct labor costs; and depreciation, amortization, and cost recovery allowances on equipment and facilities directly used to manufacture or construct the subject matter of the contract. For this purpose, the costs associated with any manufacturing or construction activities performed by a subcontractor are considered either direct material or direct labor costs, as appropriate, and therefore must be allocated to the contract under the simplified cost-to-cost method. An electing taxpayer must use the simplified cost-to-cost method to apply the look-back method under § 1.460-6 and to determine alternative minimum taxable income under § 1.460-4(f).
(2)
Election.
A taxpayer makes an election under this paragraph (c) by using the simplified cost-to-cost method for all long-term contracts entered into during the taxable year of the election on its original federal income tax return for the election year. This election is a method of accounting and, thus, applies to all long-term contracts entered into during and after the taxable year of the election. This election is not available if a taxpayer does not use the PCM to account for all long-term contracts or if a taxpayer elects to use the 10-percent method described in § 1.460-4(b)(6).
(d)
Cost allocation rules for exempt construction contracts reported using the CCM
—(1)
In general.
For exempt construction contracts reported using the CCM, other than contracts described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a taxpayer must annually allocate the cost of any activity that is incident to or necessary for the taxpayer's performance under a long-term contract. A taxpayer must allocate to each exempt construction contract all direct costs as defined in § 1.263A-1(e)(2)(i) and all indirect costs either as provided in § 1.263A-1(e)(3) or as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2)
Indirect costs
—(i)
Indirect costs allocable to exempt construction contracts.
A taxpayer allocating costs under this paragraph (d)(2) must allocate the following costs to an exempt construction contract, other than a contract described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, to the extent incurred in the performance of that contract—
(A) Repair of equipment or facilities;
(B) Maintenance of equipment or facilities;
(C) Utilities, such as heat, light, and power, allocable to equipment or facilities;
(D) Rent of equipment or facilities;
(E) Indirect labor and contract supervisory wages, including basic compensation, overtime pay, vacation and holiday pay, sick leave pay (other than payments pursuant to a wage continuation plan under section 105(d) as it existed prior to its repeal in 1983), shift differential, payroll taxes, and contributions to a supplemental unemployment benefits plan;
(F) Indirect materials and supplies;
(G) Noncapitalized tools and equipment;
(H) Quality control and inspection;
(I) Taxes otherwise allowable as a deduction under section 164, other than state, local, and foreign income taxes, to the extent attributable to labor, materials, supplies, equipment, or facilities;
(J) Depreciation, amortization, and cost-recovery allowances reported for the taxable year for financial purposes on equipment and facilities to the extent allowable as deductions under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code;
(K) Cost depletion;
(L) Administrative costs other than the cost of selling or any return on capital;
(M) Compensation paid to officers other than for incidental or occasional services;
(N) Insurance, such as liability insurance on machinery and equipment; and
(O) Interest, as required under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.
(ii)
Indirect costs not allocable to exempt construction contracts.
A taxpayer allocating costs under this paragraph (d)(2) is not required to allocate the following costs to an exempt construction contract reported using the CCM—
(A) Marketing and selling expenses, including bidding expenses;
(B) Advertising expenses;
(C) Other distribution expenses;
(D) General and administrative expenses attributable to the performance of services that benefit the taxpayer's activities as a whole (
e.g.,
payroll expenses, legal and accounting expenses);
(E) Research and experimental expenses (described in section 174 and the regulations thereunder);
(F) Losses under section 165 and the regulations thereunder;
(G) Percentage of depletion in excess of cost depletion;
(H) Depreciation, amortization, and cost recovery allowances on equipment and facilities that have been placed in service but are temporarily idle (for this purpose, an asset is not considered to be temporarily idle on non-working days, and an asset used in construction is considered to be idle when it is neither en route to nor located at a job-site), and depreciation, amortization and cost recovery allowances under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code in excess of depreciation, amortization, and cost recovery allowances reported by the taxpayer in the taxpayer's financial reports;
(I) Income taxes attributable to income received from long-term contracts;
(J) Contributions paid to or under a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan or other plan deferring the receipt of compensation whether or not the plan qualifies under section 401(a), and other employee benefit expenses paid or accrued on behalf of labor, to the extent the contributions or expenses are otherwise allowable as deductions under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. Other employee benefit expenses include (but are not limited to): Worker's compensation; amounts deductible or for whose payment reduction in earnings and profits is allowed under section 404A and the regulations thereunder; payments pursuant to a wage continuation plan under section 105(d) as it existed prior to its repeal in 1983; amounts includible in the gross income of employees under a method or arrangement of employer contributions or compensation which has the effect of a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan, or other plan deferring the receipt of compensation or providing deferred benefits; premiums on life and health insurance; and miscellaneous benefits provided for employees such as safety, medical treatment, recreational and eating facilities, membership dues, etc.;
(K) Cost attributable to strikes, rework labor, scrap and spoilage; and
(L) Compensation paid to officers attributable to the performance of services that benefit the taxpayer's activities as a whole.
(3)
Large homebuilders.
A taxpayer must capitalize the costs of home construction contracts under section 263A, unless the taxpayer estimates, when entering into the contract, that it will be completed within two years of the contract commencement date, and the taxpayer satisfies the gross receipts test of section 448(c) described in § 1.460-3(b)(3) for the taxable year in which the contract is entered into.
(e)
Cost allocation rules for contracts subject to the PCCM.
A taxpayer must use the cost allocation rules described
in paragraph (b) of this section to determine the costs allocable to the entire qualified ship contract or residential construction contract accounted for using the PCCM and may not use the simplified cost-to-cost method described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(f)
Special rules applicable to costs allocated under this section
—(1)
Nondeductible costs.
A taxpayer may not allocate any otherwise allocable contract cost to a long-term contract if any section of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a deduction for that type of payment or expenditure (
e.g.,
an illegal bribe described in section 162(c)).
(2)
Costs incurred for non-long-term contract activities.
If a taxpayer performs a non-long-term contract activity, as defined in § 1.460-1(d)(2), that is incident to or necessary for the manufacture, building, installation, or construction of the subject matter of one or more of the taxpayer's long-term contracts, the taxpayer must allocate the costs attributable to that activity to such contract(s).
(g)
Method of accounting.
A taxpayer that adopts or elects a cost allocation method of accounting (or changes to another cost allocation method of accounting with the Commissioner's consent) must apply that method consistently for all similarly classified contracts, until the taxpayer obtains the Commissioner's consent under section 446(e) to change to another cost allocation method. A taxpayer-initiated change in cost allocation method will be permitted only on a cut-off basis (
i.e.,
for contracts entered into on or after the year of change) and thus, a section 481(a) adjustment will not be permitted or required.
[T.D. 8929, 66 FR 2237, Jan. 11, 2001, as amended by T.D. 9942, 86 FR 273, Jan. 5, 2021]
§ 1.460-6
Look-back method.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Introduction.
With respect to income from any long-term contract reported under the percentage of completion method, a taxpayer is required to pay or is entitled to receive interest under section 460(b) on the amount of tax liability that is deferred or accelerated as a result of overestimating or underestimating total contract price or contract costs. Under this look-back method, taxpayers are required to pay interest for any deferral of tax liability resulting from the underestimation of the total contract price or the overestimation of total contract costs. Conversely, if the total contract price is overestimated or the total contract costs are underestimated, taxpayers are entitled to receive interest for any resulting acceleration of tax liability. The computation of the amount of deferred or accelerated tax liability under the look-back method is hypothetical; application of the look-back method does not result in an adjustment to the taxpayer's tax liability as originally reported, as reported on an amended return, or as adjusted on examination. Thus, the look-back method does not correct for differences in tax liability that result from over- or under-estimation of contract price and costs and that are permanent because, for example, tax rates change during the term of the contract.
(2)
Overview.
Paragraph (b) explains which situations require application of the look-back method to income from a long-term contract. Paragraph (c) explains the operation of the three computational steps for applying the look-back method. Paragraph (d) provides guidance concerning the simplified marginal impact method. Paragraph (e) provides an elective method to minimize the number of times the look-back method must be reapplied to a single long-term contract. Paragraph (f) describes the reporting requirements for the look-back method and the tax treatment of look-back interest. Paragraph (g) provides rules for applying the look-back method when there is a transaction that changes the taxpayer that reports income from a long-term contract prior to the completion of a contract. Paragraph (h) provides examples illustrating the three computational steps for applying the look-back method. Paragraph (j) of this section provides guidance concerning the election not to apply the look-back method in de minimis cases.
(b)
Scope of look-back method
—(1)
In general.
The look-back method applies to any income from a long-term contract within the meaning of section 460(f) that is required to be reported under the percentage of completion
method (as modified by section 460) for regular income tax purposes or for alternative minimum tax purposes. If a taxpayer uses the percentage of completion-capitalized cost method for long-term contracts, the look-back method applies for regular tax purposes only to the portion (40, 70, or 90 percent, whichever applies) of the income from the contract that is reported under the percentage of completion method. To the extent that the percentage-of-completion method is required to be used under § 1.460-1(g) with respect to income and expenses that are attributable to activities that benefit a related party's long-term contract, the look-back method also applies to these amounts, even if those activities are not performed under a contract entered into directly by the taxpayer.
(2)
Exceptions from section 460.
The look-back method generally does not apply to the regular taxable income from any long-term construction contract within the meaning of section 460(e)(3) that:
(i) Is a home construction contract within the meaning of section 460(e)(1)(A), or
(ii) Is not a home construction contract but is estimated to be completed within a 2-year period by a taxpayer, other than a tax shelter prohibited from using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting under section 448(a)(3), who meets the gross receipts test of section 448(c) and § 1.460-3(b)(3) for the taxable year in which such contract is entered into. These contracts are not subject to the look-back method for regular tax purposes, even if the taxpayer uses a version of the percentage of completion method permitted under § 1.451-3, unless the taxpayer has properly changed its method of accounting for these contracts to the percentage of completion method as modified by section 460(b). The look-back method, however, applies to the alternative minimum taxable income from a contract of this type, for those taxpayers subject to the AMT in taxable years prior to the filing taxable year in which the look-back method is required, unless the contract is exempt from required use of the percentage of completion method under section 56(a)(3).
(3)
De minimis exception.
Notwithstanding that the percentage of completion method is otherwise required to be used, the look-back method does not apply to any long-term contract that:
(i) Is completed within 2 years of the contract commencement date, and
(ii) Has a gross contract price (as of the completion of the contract) that does not exceed the lesser of $1,000,000 or 1 percent of the average annual gross receipts of the taxpayer for the 3 tax years preceding the tax year in which the contract is completed.
(iii) This de minimis exception is mandatory and, therefore, precludes application of the look-back method to any contract that meets the requirements of the exception. The de minimis exception applies for purposes of computing both regular taxable income and alternative minimum taxable income. Solely for this purpose, the determination of whether a long-term contract meets the gross receipts test for both alternative minimum tax and regular tax purposes is made based only on the taxpayer's regular taxable income. For contracts entered into after December 31, 2017, in a taxable year ending after December 31, 2017, a taxpayer's gross receipts are determined in the manner required by regulations under section 448(c).
(4)
Alternative minimum tax.
For purposes of computing alternative minimum taxable income, section 56(a)(3) generally requires long-term contracts within the meaning of section 460(f) (generally without regard to the exceptions in section 460(e)) to be accounted for using only the percentage of completion method as defined in section 460(b), including the look-back method of section 460(b), with respect to tax years beginning after December 31, 1986. However, section 56(a)(3) (and thus the look-back method) does not apply to any long-term contract entered into after June 20, 1988, and before the beginning of the first tax year that begins after September 30, 1990, that meets the conditions of both section 460(e)(1)(A) and clauses (i) and (ii) of section 460(e)(1)(B), and does not apply to any long-term contract entered into
in a tax year that begins after September 30, 1990, that meets the conditions of section 460(e)(1)(A). A taxpayer that applies the percentage of completion method (and thus the look-back method) to income from a long-term contract only for purposes of determining alternative minimum taxable income, and not regular taxable income, must apply the look-back method to the alternative minimum taxable income in the year of contract completion and other filing years whether or not the taxpayer was liable for the alternative minimum tax for the filing year or for any prior year. Interest is computed under the look-back method to the extent that the taxpayer's total tax liability (including the alternative minimum tax liability) would have differed if the percentage of completion method had been applied using actual, rather than estimated, contract price and contract costs.
(5)
Effective date.
The look-back method, including the de minimis exception, applies to long-term contracts entered into after February 28, 1986. With respect to activities that are subject to section 460 solely because they benefit a long-term contract of a related party, the look-back method generally applies only if the related party's long-term contract was entered into after June 20, 1988, unless a principal purpose of the related-party arrangement is to avoid the requirements of section 460.
(c)
Operation of the look-back method
—(1)
Overview
—(i)
In general.
The amount of interest charged or credited to a taxpayer under the look-back method is computed in three steps. This paragraph (c) describes the three steps for applying the look-back method. These steps are illustrated by the examples in paragraph (h). The first step is to hypothetically reapply the percentage of completion method to all long-term contracts that are completed or adjusted in the current year (the “filing year”), using the actual, rather than estimated, total contract price and contract costs. Based on this reapplication, the taxpayer determines the amount of taxable income (and, when applicable, alternative minimum taxable income and modified taxable income under section 59A(c)) that would have been reported for each year prior to the filing year that is affected by contracts completed or adjusted in the filing year if the actual, rather than estimated, total contract price and costs had been used in applying the percentage of completion method to these contracts, and to any other contracts completed or adjusted in a year preceding the filing year. If the percentage of completion method only applies to alternative minimum taxable income for contracts completed or adjusted in the filing year, only alternative minimum taxable income is recomputed in the first step. The second step is to compare what the tax liability would have been under the percentage of completion method (as reapplied in the first step) for each tax year for which the tax liability is affected by income from contracts completed or adjusted in the filing year (a “redetermination year”) with the most recent determination of tax liability for that year to produce a hypothetical underpayments or overpayment of tax. The third step is to apply the rate of interest on overpayments designated under section 6621 of the Code, compounded daily, to the hypothetical underpayment or overpayment of tax for each redetermination year to compute interest that runs, generally, from the due date (determined without regard to extensions) of the return for the redetermination year to the due date (determined without regard to extensions) of the return for the filing year. The net amount of interest computed under the third step is paid by or credited to the taxpayer for the filing year. Paragraph (d) provides a simplified marginal impact method that simplifies the second step—the computation of hypothetical underpayments or overpayments of tax liability for redetermination years—and, in some cases, the third step—the determination of the time period for computing interest.
(ii)
Post-completion revenue and expenses
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in section 460(b)(6) (see § 1.460-6(j) for method of electing) or § 1.460-6(e), a taxpayer must apply the look-back method to a long-term contract in the completion year and in any post-completion year for which the taxpayer must adjust total contract
price or total allocable contract costs, or both, under the PCM. Any year in which the look-back method must be reapplied is treated as a filing year. See Example 3 of paragraph (h)(4) for an illustration of how the look-back method is applied to post-completion adjustments.
(B)
Completion.
A contract is considered to be completed for purposes of the look-back method in the year in which final completion and acceptance within the meaning of ­§ 1.460-1(c)(3) have occurred.
(C)
Discounting of contract price and contract cost adjustments subsequent to completion; election not to discount
—(
1
)
General rule.
The amount of any post-completion adjustment to the total contract price or contract costs is discounted, solely for purposes of applying the look-back method, from its value at the time the amount is taken into account in computing taxable income to its value at the completion of the contract. The discount rate for this purpose is the Federal mid-term rate under section 1274(d) in effect at the time the amount is properly taken into account. For purposes of applying the look-back method for the completion year, no amounts are discounted, even if they are received after the completion year.
(
2
)
Election not to discount.
Notwithstanding the general requirement to discount post-completion adjustments, a taxpayer may elect not to discount contract price and contract cost adjustments with respect to any contract. The election not to discount is to be made on a contract-by-contract basis and is binding with respect to all post-completion adjustments that arise with respect to a contract for which an election has been made. An election not to discount with respect to any contract is made by stating that an election is being made on the taxpayer's timely filed Federal income tax return (determined with regard to extensions) for the first tax year after completion in which the taxpayer takes into account (i.e., includes in income or deducts) any adjustment to the contract price or contract costs. See § 301.9100-8 of this chapter.
(
3
)
Year-end discounting convention.
In the absence of an election not to discount, any revisions to the contract price and contract costs must be discounted to their value as of the completion of the contract in reapplying the look-back method. For this purpose, the period of discounting is the period between the completion date of the contract and the date that any adjustment is taken into account in computing taxable income. Although taxpayers may use the period between the months in which these two events actually occur, in many cases, these dates may not be readily identifiable. Therefore, for administrative convenience, taxpayers are permitted to use the period between the end of the tax years in which these events occur as the period of discounting provided that the convention is used consistently with respect to all post-completion adjustments for all contracts of the taxpayer the adjustments to which are discounted. In that case, the taxpayer must use as the discount rate the Federal mid-term rate under section 1274(d) as of the end of the tax year in which any revision is taken into account in computing taxable income.
(D)
Revenue acceleration rule.
Section 460(b)(1) imposes a special rule that requires a taxpayer to include in gross income, for the tax year immediately following the year of completion, any previously unreported portion of the total contract price (including amounts that the taxpayer expects to receive in the future) determined as of that year, even if the percentage of completion ratio is less than 100 percent because the taxpayer expects to incur additional allocable contract costs in a later year. At the time any remaining portion of the contract price is includible in income under this rule, no offset against this income is permitted for estimated future contract costs. To achieve the requirement to report all remaining contract revenue without regard to additional estimated costs, a taxpayer must include only costs actually incurred through the end of the tax year in the denominator of the percentage of completion ratio in applying the percentage of completion method for any tax years after the year of completion. The look-back method also must be reapplied for the year immediately following the year of
completion if any portion of the contract price is includible in income in that year by reason of section 460(b)(1). For purposes of reapplying the look-back method as a result of this inclusion in income, the taxpayer must only include in the denominator of the percentage of completion ratio the actual contract costs incurred as of the end of the year, even if the taxpayer reasonably expects to incur additional allocable contract costs. To the extent that costs are incurred in a subsequent tax year, the look-back method is reapplied in that year (or a later year if the delayed reapplication method is used), and the taxpayer is entitled to receive interest for the post-completion adjustment to contract costs. Because this reapplication occurs subsequent to the completion year, only the cumulative costs incurred as of the end of the reapplication year are includible in the denominator of the percentage of completion ratio.
(2)
Look-back Step One
—(i)
Hypothetical reallocation of income among prior tax years.
For each filing year, a taxpayer must allocate total contract income among prior tax years, by hypothetically applying the percentage of completion method to all contracts that are completed or adjusted in the filing year using the rules of this paragraph (c)(2). The taxpayer must reallocate income from those contracts among all years preceding the filing year that are affected by those contracts using the total contract price and contract costs, as determined as of the end of the filing year (“actual contract price and costs”), rather than the estimated contract price and contract costs. The taxpayer then must determine the amount of taxable income (and, when applicable, alternative minimum taxable income and modified taxable income under section 59A(c)) that would have been reported for each affected tax year preceding the filing year if the percentage of completion method had been applied on the basis of actual contract price and contract costs in reporting income from all contracts completed or adjusted in the filing year and in any preceding year. If the percentage of completion method only applies to alternative minimum taxable income from the contract, only alternative minimum taxable income is recomputed in the first step. For purposes of reallocating income (and costs if the 10-percent year changes for a taxpayer using the 10-percent method of section 460(b)(5)) under the look-back method, the method of computing the percentage of completion ratio is the same method used to report income from the contract on the taxpayer's return. (Thus, an election to use the 10-percent method or the simplified cost-to-cost method is taken into account). See Example 1 of paragraph (h)(2) for an illustration of Step One.
(ii)
Treatment of estimated future costs in year of completion.
If a taxpayer reasonably expects to incur additional allocable contract costs in a tax year subsequent to the year in which the contract is completed, the taxpayer includes the actual costs incurred as of the end of the completion year plus the additional allocable contract costs that are reasonably expected to be incurred (to the extent includible under the taxpayer's percentage of completion method) in the denominator of the percentage of completion ratio. The completion year is the only filing year for which the taxpayer may include additional estimated costs in the denominator of the percentage of completion ratio in applying the look-back method. If the look-back method is reapplied in any year after the completion year, only the cumulative costs incurred as of the end of the year of reapplication are includible in the denominator of the percentage of completion ratio in reapplying the look-back method.
(iii)
Interim reestimates not considered.
The look-back method cannot be applied to a contract before it is completed. Accordingly, for purposes of applying Step One, the actual total contract price and contract costs are substituted for the previous estimates of total contract price and contract costs only with respect to contracts that have been completed in the filing year and in a tax year preceding the filing year. No adjustments are made under Step One for contracts that have not been completed prior to the end of the current filing year, even if, as of the end of this year, the estimated total contract price or contract costs for
these uncompleted contracts is different from the estimated amount that was used during any tax year for which taxable income is recomputed with respect to completed contracts under the look-back method for the current filing year.
(iv)
Tax years in which income is affected.
In general, because income under the percentage of completion method is generally reported as costs are incurred, the taxable income and, when applicable, alternative minimum taxable income and modified taxable income under section 59A(c), are recomputed only for each year in which allocable contract costs were incurred. However, there will be exceptions to this general rule. For example, a taxpayer may be required to cumulatively adjust the income from a contract in a year in which no allocable contract costs are incurred if the estimated total contract price or contract costs was revised in that year. However, in applying the look-back method, no contract income is allocated to that year. Thus, there may be a difference between the amount of contract income originally reported for that year and the amount of contract income as reallocated. Similarly, because of the revenue acceleration rule of section 460(b)(1), income may be reported in the year immediately following the completion year even though no costs were incurred during that year and, in applying the look-back method in that year or another year, if additional costs are incurred or the contract price is adjusted in a later year, no income is allocated to the year immediately following the completion year.
(v)
Costs incurred prior to contract execution; 10-percent method
—(A)
General rule.
The look-back method does not require allocation of contract income to tax years before the contract was entered into. Costs incurred prior to the year a contract is entered into are first taken into account in the numerator of the percentage of completion ratio in the year the contract is entered into. A taxpayer using the 10-percent method must also use the 10-percent method in applying the look-back method, using actual total contract costs to determine the 10-percent year. Thus, contract income is never reallocated to a year before the 10-percent year as determined on the basis of actual contract costs. If the 10-percent year is earlier as a result of applying Step One of the look-back method, contract costs incurred up to and including the new 10-percent year (as determined based on actual contract costs), are reallocated from the original 10-percent year to the new 10-percent, and costs incurred in later years but before the old 10-percent year are reallocated to those years. If the 10-percent year is later as a result of applying Step One of the look-back method, contract costs incurred up to and including the new 10-percent year are reallocated from all prior years to the new 10-percent year. This is the only case in which costs are reallocated under the look-back method.
(B)
Example.
The application of the look-back method by a taxpayer using the 10-percent method is illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Z elected to use the 10-percent method of section 460(b)(5) for reporting income under the percentage of completion method. Z entered into a contract in 1990 for a fixed price of $1,000
x.
During 1990, Z incurred allocable contract costs of $80
x
and estimated that it would incur a total of $900
x
for the entire contract. Since $80
x
is less than 10 percent of total estimated contract costs, Z reported no revenue from the contract in 1990 and deferred the $80
x
of costs incurred. In 1991, Z incurred an additional $620
x
of contract costs, and completed the contract. Accordingly, in its 1991 return, Z reported the entire contract price of $l,000
x,
and deducted the $620
x
of costs incurred in 1991 and the $80
x
of costs incurred in 1990.
Under section 460(b)(5), the 10-percent method applies both for reporting contract income and the look-back method. Under the look-back method, since the costs incurred in 1990 ($80
x
) exceed 10 percent of the actual total contract costs ($700
x
), Z is required to allocate $114
x
of contract revenue ($80
x
/$700
x
× $1,000
x
) and the $80
x
of costs incurred to 1990. Thus, application of the 1ook-back method results in a net increase in taxable income for 1990 of $34
x,
solely for purposes of the look-back method.
(vi)
Amount treated as contract price
—(A)
General rule.
The amount that is treated as total contract price for purposes of applying the percentage of completion method and reapplying the percentage of completion method under the look-back method under
Step One includes all amounts that the taxpayer expects to receive from the customer. Thus, amounts are treated as part of the contract price as soon as it is reasonably estimated that they will be received, even if the all-events test has not yet been met.
(B)
Contingencies.
Any amounts related to contingent rights or obligations, such as incentive fees or amounts in dispute, are not separated from the contract and accounted for under a non-long-term contract method of accounting, notwithstanding any provision in § 1.460-4(b)(4)(i), to the contrary. Instead, those amounts are treated as part of the total contract price in applying the look-back method. For example, if an incentive fee under a contract to manufacture a satellite is payable to the taxpayer after a specified period of successful performance, the incentive fee is includible in the total contract price at the time and to the extent that it can reasonably be predicted that the performance objectives will be met, . A portion of the contract price that is in dispute is included in the total contract price at the time and to the extent that the taxpayer can reasonably expect the dispute will be resolved in the taxpayer's favor (without regard to when the taxpayer receives payment for the amount in dispute or when the dispute is finally resolved).
(C)
Change orders.
In applying the look-back method, a change order with respect to a contract is not treated as a separate contract unless the change order would be treated as a separate contract under the rules for severing and aggregating contracts provided in § 1.460-1(e). Thus, if a change order is not treated as a separate contract, the contract price and contract costs attributable to the change order must be taken into account in allocating contract income to all tax years affected by the underlying contract.
(3)
Look-back Step Two: Computation of hypothetical overpayment or underpayment of tax
—(i)
In general.
Step Two involves the computation of a hypothetical overpayment or underpayment of tax for each year in which the tax liability is affected by income from contracts that are completed or adjusted in the filing year (a “redetermination year”). The application of Step Two depends on whether the taxpayer uses the simplified marginal impact method contained in paragraph (d) or the actual method described in this paragraph (c)(3). The remainder of this paragraph (c)(3) does not apply if a taxpayer uses the simplified marginal impact method.
(ii)
Redetermination of tax liability.
Under the method described in this paragraph (c)(3) (actual method), a taxpayer first must determine what its regular and, when applicable, its alternative minimum tax and base erosion minimum tax liability would have been for each redetermination year if the amounts of contract income allocated in Step One for all contracts completed or adjusted in the filing year and in any prior year were substituted for the amounts of contract income reported under the percentage of completion method on the taxpayer's original return (or as subsequently adjusted on examination, or by amended return). See Example 2 of paragraph (h)(3) for an illustration of Step Two.
(iii)
Hypothetical underpayment or overpayment.
After redetermining the income tax liability for each tax year affected by the reallocation of contract income, the taxpayer then determines the amount, if any, of the hypothetical underpayment or overpayment of tax for each of these redetermination years. The hypothetical underpayment or overpayment for each affected year is the difference between the tax liability as redetermined under the look-back method for that year and the amount of tax liability determined as of the latest of the following:
(A) The original return date;
(B) The date of a subsequently amended or adjusted return (if, however, the amended return is due to a carryback described in section 6611(f), see paragraph (c)(4)(iii)); or,
(C) The last previous application of the look-back method (in which case, the previous hypothetical tax liability is used).
(iv)
Cumulative determination of tax liability.
The redetermination of tax liability resulting from previous applications of the look-back method is cumulative. Thus, for example, in computing
the amount of a hypothetical overpayment or underpayment of tax for a redetermination year, the current hypothetical tax liability is compared to the hypothetical tax liability for that year determined as of the last previous application of the look-back method.
(v)
Years affected by look-back only.
A redetermination of income tax liability under Step Two is required for every tax year for which the tax liability would have been affected by a change in the amount of income or loss for any other year for which a redetermination is required. For example, if the allocation of contract income under Step One changed the amount of a net operating loss that was carried back to a year preceding the year the taxpayer entered into the contract, the tax liability for the earlier year must be redetermined.
(vi)
Definition of tax liability.
For purposes of Step Two, the income tax liability must be redetermined by taking into account all applicable additions to tax, credits, and net operating loss carrybacks and carryovers. Thus, the taxes, if any, imposed under sections 55 and 59A (relating to alternative and base erosion minimum tax, respectively) must be taken into account. For example, if the taxpayer did not pay alternative minimum tax, but would have paid alternative minimum tax for that year if actual rather than estimated contract price and costs had been used in determining contract income for the year, the amount of any hypothetical overpayment or underpayment of tax must be determined by comparing the hypothetical total tax liability (including hypothetical alternative minimum tax liability) with the actual tax liability for that year.The effect of taking these items into account in applying the look-back method is illustrated in Examples (4) through (7) of paragraphs (h)(5) through (h)(8) below.
(4)
Look-back Step Three: Calculation of interest on underpayment or overpayment
—(i)
In general.
After determining a hypothetical underpayment or overpayment of tax for each redetermination year, the taxpayer must determine the interest charged or credited on each of these amounts. Interest on the amount determined under Step Two is determined by applying the overpayment rate designated under section 6621, compounded daily. In general, the time period over which interest is charged on hypothetical underpayments or credited on hypothetical overpayments begins at the due date (not including extensions) of the return for the redetermination year for which the hypothetical underpayment or overpayment determined in Step Two is computed. This time period generally ends on the earlier of:
(A) The due date (not including extensions) of the return for the filing year, and
(B) The date both
(
1
) The income tax return for the filing year is filed, and
(
2
) The tax for that year has been paid in full. If a taxpayer uses the simplified marginal impact method contained in paragraph (d), the remainder of this paragraph (c)(4) does not apply.
(ii)
Changes in the amount of a loss or credit carryback or carryover.
The time period for determining interest may be different in cases involving loss or credit carrybacks or carryovers in order to properly reflect the time period during which the taxpayer (in the case of an underpayment) or the Government (in the case of an overpayment) had the use of the amount determined to be a hypothetical underpayment or overpayment. Thus, if a reallocation of contract income under Step One results in an increase or decrease to a net operating loss carryback (but not a carryforward), the interest due or to be refunded must be computed on the increase or decrease in tax attributable to the change to the carryback only from the due date (not including extensions) of the return for the redetermination year that generated the carryback and not from the due date of the return for the redetermination year in which the carryback was absorbed. In the case of a change in the amount of a carryover as a result of applying the lookback method, interest is computed from the due date of the return for the year in which the carryover was absorbed. See Examples (8) and (9) of paragraph (h)(9) for an illustration of these rules.
(iii)
Changes in the amount of tax liability that generated a subsequent refund.
If the amount of tax liability for a redetermination year (as reported on the taxpayer's original return, as subsequently adjusted on examination, as adjusted by amended return, or as redetermined by the last previous application of the look-back method) is decreased by the application of the look-back method, and any portion of the redetermination year tax liability was absorbed by a loss or credit carryback arising in a year subsequent to the redetermination year, the look-back method applies as follows to properly reflect the time period of the use of the tax overpayment. To the extent the amount of tax absorbed because of the carryback exceeds the total hypothetical tax liability for the year (as redetermined under the look-back method) the taxpayer is entitled to receive interest only until the due date (not including extensions) of the return for the year in which the carryback arose.

# Example.
Upon the completion of a long-term contract in 1990, the taxpayer redetermines its tax liability for 1988 under the look-back method. This redetermination results in a hypothetical reduction of tax liability from $1,500
x
(actual liability originally reported) to $1,200
x
(hypothetical liability). In addition, the taxpayer had already received a refund of some or all of the actual 1988 tax by carrying back a net operating loss (NOL) that arose in 1989. The time period over which interest would be computed on the hypothetical overpayment of $300
x
for 1988 would depend on the amount of the refund generated by the carryback, as illustrated by the following three alternative situations:
(A) If the amount refunded because of the NOL is $1,500
x:
interest is credited to the taxpayer on the entire hypothetical overpayment of $300
x
from the due date of the 1988 return, when the hypothetical overpayment occurred, until the due date of the 1989 return, when the taxpayer received a refund for the entire amount of the 1988 tax, including the hypothetical overpayment.
(B) If the amount refunded because of the NOL is $1,000
x:
interest is credited to the taxpayer on the entire amount of the hypothetical overpayment of $300
x
from the due date of the 1988 return, when the hypothetical overpayment occurred, until the due date of the 1990 return. In this situation interest is credited until the due date of the return for the completion year of the contract, rather than the due date of the return for the year in which the carryback arose, because the amount refunded was less than the redetermined tax liability. Therefore, no portion of the hypothetical overpayment is treated as having been refunded to the taxpayer before the filing year.
(C) If the amount refunded because of the NOL is $1,300
x−:
interest is credited to the taxpayer on $100
x
($1,300
x
−$1,200
x
) from the due date of the 1988 return until the due date of the 1989 return because only this portion of the total hypothetical overpayment is treated as having been refunded to the taxpayer before the filing year. However, the taxpayer did not receive a refund for the remaining $200
x
of the overpayment at that time and, therefore, is credited with interest on $200
x
through the due date of the tax return for 1990, the filing year. See Examples (10) and (11) of paragraph (h)(9) for a further illustration of this rule.
(d)
Simplified marginal impact method
—(1)
Introduction.
This paragraph (d) provides a simplified method for calculating look-back interest. Any taxpayer may elect this simplified marginal impact method, except that pass-through entities described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section are required to apply the simplified marginal impact method at the entity level with respect to domestic contracts and the owners of those entities do not apply the look-back method to those contracts. Under the simplified marginal impact method, a taxpayer calculates the hypothetical underpayments or overpayments of tax for a prior year based on an assumed marginal tax rate. A taxpayer electing to use the simplified marginal impact method must use the method for each long-term contract for which it reports income (except with respect to domestic contracts if the taxpayer is an owner in a widely held pass-through entity that is required to use the simplified marginal impact method at the entity level for those contracts).
(2)
Operation
—(i)
In general.
Under the simplified marginal impact method, income from those contracts that are completed or adjusted in the filing year is first reallocated in accordance with the procedures of Step One contained in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Step Two is modified in the following manner. The hypothetical underpayment or overpayment of tax for
each year of the contract (a “redetermination year”) is determined by multiplying the applicable regular tax rate (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)) by the increase or decrease in regular taxable income (or, if it produces a greater amount, by multiplying the applicable alternative minimum tax rate by the increase or decrease in alternative minimum taxable income, for taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax without regard to whether tentative minimum tax exceeds regular tax for the redetermination year) that results from reallocating income to the tax year under Step One. Generally, the product of the alternative minimum tax rate and the increase or decrease in alternative minimum taxable income will be the greater of the two amounts described in the preceding sentence only with respect to contracts for which a taxpayer uses the full percentage of completion method only for alternative minimum tax purposes and uses the completed contract method, or the percentage of completion-capitalized cost method, for regular tax purposes. Step Three is then applied. Interest is credited to the taxpayer on the net overpayment and is charged to the taxpayer on the net underpayment for each redetermination year from the due date (determined without regard to extensions) of the return for the redetermination year until the earlier of
(A) The due date (determined without regard to extensions) of the return for the filing year, and
(B) The first date by which both the return is filed and the tax is fully paid.
(ii)
Applicable tax rate.
For purposes of determining hypothetical underpayments or overpayments of tax under the simplified marginal impact method, the applicable regular tax rate is the highest rate of tax in effect for the redetermination year under section 1 in the case of an individual and under section 11 in the case of a corporation. The applicable alternative minimum tax rate is the rate of tax in effect for the taxpayer under section 55(b)(1). The highest rate is determined without regard to the taxpayer's actual rate bracket and without regard to any additional surtax imposed for the purpose of phasing out multiple tax brackets or exemptions.
(iii)
Overpayment ceiling.
The net hypothetical overpayment of tax for any redetermination year is limited to the taxpayer's total federal income tax liability for the redetermination year reduced by the cumulative amount of net hypothetical overpayments of tax for that redetermination year resulting from earlier applications of the look-back method. If the reallocation of contract income results in a net overpayment of tax and this amount exceeds the actual tax liability (as of the filing year) for the redetermination year, as adjusted for past applications of the look-back method and taking into account net operating loss, capital loss, or credit carryovers and carrybacks to that year, the actual tax so adjusted is treated as the overpayment for the redetermination year. This overpayment ceiling does not apply when the simplified marginal impact method is applied at the entity level by a widely held pass-through entity in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(iv)
Example.
The application of the simplified marginal impact method is illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Corporation X, a calendar-year taxpayer, reports income from long-term contracts and elected the simplified marginal impact method when it filed its income tax return for 1989. X uses only the percentage of completion method for both regular taxable income and alternative minimum taxable income. X completed contracts A, B, and C in 1989 and, therefore, was required to apply the look-back method in 1989. Income was actually reported for these contracts in 1987, 1988, and 1989. X's applicable tax rate, as determined under section 11, for the redetermination years 1987 and 1988 was 40 percent and 34 percent, respectively. The amount of contract income originally reported and reallocated for contracts A, B, and C, and the net overpayments and underpayments for the redetermination years are as follows:
1987
1988
Contract A:
Originally reported
$5,000

Actual Tax Liability (After Carryovers and Carrybacks)
1,500
x
500
x
Final (Underpayment)/Overpayment
1,500
x
(850
x
)
Under the simplified marginal impact method, X determined a tentative hypothetical net overpayment for 1987 and a net underpayment for 1988. X determined these amounts by first aggregating the difference for contracts A, B, and C between the amount of contract price originally reported and the amount of contract price as reallocated and, then, applying the highest regular tax rate to the aggregate decrease in income for 1987 and the aggregate increase in income for 1988.
However, X's overpayment for 1987 is subject to a ceiling based on X's total tax liability. Because the tentative net overpayment of tax for 1987 exceeds the actual tax liability for that year after taking into account carryovers and carrybacks to that year, the final overpayment under the simplified marginal impact method is the amount of tax liability paid instead of the tentative net overpayment. Since application of the look-back method for 1988 results in a tentative underpayment of tax, it is not subject to a ceiling. If the look-back method is applied in 1991, the ceiling amount for 1987 will be zero and the ceiling amount for 1988 will be $1,350.
X is entitled to receive interest on the hypothetical overpayment from March 15, 1988, to March 15, 1990. X is required to pay interest on the underpayment from March 15, 1989, to March 15, 1990.
(3)
Anti-abuse rule.
If the simplified marginal impact method is used with respect to any long-term contract (including a contract of a widely held pass-through entity), the district director may recompute interest for the contract (including domestic contracts of widely held pass-through entities) under the look-back method using the actual method (and without regard to the simplified marginal impact method). The district director may make such a recomputation only if the amount of income originally reported with respect to the contract for any redetermination year exceeds the amount of income reallocated under the look-back method with respect to that contract for that year (using actual contract price and contract costs) by the lesser of $1,000,000 or 20 percent of the amount of income as reallocated (
i.e.,
based on actual contract price and contract costs) under the look-back method with respect to that contract for that year. In determining whether to exercise this authority upon examination of the Form 8697, the district director may take into account whether the taxpayer overreported income for a purpose of receiving interest under the look-back method on a hypothetical overpayment determined at the applicable tax rate. The district director also may take into account whether the taxpayer underreported income for the year in question with respect to other contracts. Notwithstanding the look-back method, the district director may require an adjustment to the tax liability for any open tax year if the taxpayer did not apply the percentage of completion method properly on its original return.

Application
—(i)
Required use by certain pass-through entities
— (A)
General rule.
The simplified marginal impact method is required to be used with respect to income reported from domestic contracts by a pass-through entity that is either a partnership, an S corporation, or a trust, and that is not closely held. With respect to contracts described in the preceding sentence, the simplified marginal impact method is applied by the pass-through entity at the entity level. The pass-through entity determines the amount of any hypothetical underpayment or overpayment for a redetermination year using the highest rate of tax in effect for corporations under section 11. However, for redetermination years beginning before January 1, 2018, the pass-through entity uses the highest rates of tax in effect for corporations under section 11 and section 55(b)(1). Further, the pass-through entity uses the highest rates of tax imposed on individuals under section 1 and section 55(b)(1) if, at all times during the redetermination year involved (that is, the year in which the hypothetical increase or decrease in income arises), more than 50 percent of the interests in the entity were held by individuals directly or through 1 or more pass-through entities.
(B)
Closely held.
A pass-through entity is closely held if, at any time during any redetermination year, 50 percent of more (by value) of the beneficial interests in that entity are held (directly or indirectly) by or for 5 or fewer persons. For this purpose, the term “person” has the same meaning as in section 7701(a)(1), except that a pass-through entity is not treated as a person. In addition, the constructive ownership rules of section 1563(e) apply by substituting the term “beneficial interest” for the term “stock” and by substituting the term “pass-through entity” for the term, “corporation” used in that section, as appropriate, for purposes of determining whether a beneficial interest in a pass-through entity is indirectly owned by any person.
(C)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of the rules of paragraph (d)(4)(i):

# Example 1.
P, a partnership, began a long-term contract on March 1, 1986, and completed this contract in its tax year ending December 31, 1989. P used the percentage of completion method for all contract income. Substantially all of the income from the contract arose from U.S. sources. At all times during all of the years for which income was required to be reported under the contract, exactly 25 percent of the value of P's interests was owned by Corporation M. The remaining 75 percent of the value of P's interests was owned in equal shares by 15 unrelated individuals, who are also unrelated to Corporation M. M's ownership of P represents less than 50 percent of the value of the beneficial interests in P, and, therefore, viewed alone, is insufficient to make P a closely held partnership. In addition, because no 4 of the individual owners together own 25 percent or more of the remaining value of P's beneficial interests, there is no group of 5 owners that together own, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by value of the beneficial interests in P. Therefore, P is not closely held pass-through entity.
Because P is not a closely held pass-through entity, and because P completed the contract after the effective date of section 460(b)(4), P is required to use the simplified marginal impact method. Any interest computed under the look-back method will be paid to, or collected from, P, rather than its partners, and must be reported to each of the partners on Form 1065 as interest income or expense. Further, assume that, for the redetermination years, Corporation M is subject to alternative minimum tax at the rate of 20 percent and 3 of the individuals who own interests in P are subject to the highest marginal tax rate of 33 percent in 1988. Regardless of the actual marginal tax rates of its partners, P is required to determine the underpayment or overpayment of tax for each redetermination year at the entity level by applying a single rate to the increase or decrease in income resulting from the reallocation of contract income under the look-back method. Because more than 50 percent of the interests in P are held by individuals, P must use the highest rate specified in section 1 for each redetermination year. Thus, the rate applied by P is 50 percent for 1986, 38.5 percent for 1987, and 28 percent for 1988.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that one of the individuals, Individual I, who directly owns 5 percent of the value of the interests of P, also owns 100 percent of the stock of Corporation M. Section 1563(e)(4) of the Code provides that stock owned directly or indirectly by or for a corporation is considered to be owned by any person who owns 5 percent or more in value of its stock in that proportion which the value of the stock which that person so owns bears to the value of all the stock in that corporation. Because section 460(b)(4)(C)(iii) and this paragraph (d)(4) provide that rules similar to the constructive ownership rules of section 1563(e) apply in determining whether a pass-through entity is closely held, all of M's interest in P is attributed to I because I owns 100 percent of the value of the stock in M. Accordingly, because I's direct 5 percent and constructive 25 percent ownership of P, plus the interests owned by any 4 other individual partners, equals 50 percent or more of the value of the beneficial interests of P, P is a closely held pass-through entity within the meaning of section 460(b)(4)(C)(iii). Therefore, P cannot use the simplified marginal impact method at the entity level. Accordingly, each of the partners of P must separately apply the look-back method to their respective interests in the income and expenses attributable to the contract, but each partner may elect to use the simplified marginal impact method with respect to the partner's share of income from the contract.
(D)
Domestic contracts
—(
1
)
General rule.
A domestic contract is any contract substantially all of the income of which is from sources in the United States. For this purpose, “substantially all” of the income from a long-term contract is considered to be from United States sources if 95 percent or more of the gross income from the contract is from sources within the United States as determined under the rules in sections 861 through 865.
(
2
)
Portion of contract income sourced.
In determining whether substantially
all of the gross income from a long-term contract is from United States sources, taxpayers must apply the allocation and apportionment principles of sections 861 through 865 only to the portion of the contract accounted for under the percentage of completion method. Under the percentage of completion method, gross income from a long-term contract includes all payments to be received under the contract (
i.e.,
any amounts treated as contract price). Similarly, all costs taken into account in the computation of taxable income under the percentage of completion method are deducted from gross income rather than added to a cost of goods sold account that reduces gross income. Therefore, allocable contract costs are not considered in determining whether a long-term contract is a domestic contract or a foreign contract, even if, under the taxpayer's facts, the allocation of contract costs to any portion of a contract not accounted for under the percentage of completion method would affect the relative percentages of United States and foreign source gross income from the entire contract if this portion of the contract were taken into account in applying the 95-percent test.
(E)
Application to foreign contracts.
If a widely held pass-through entity has some foreign contracts and some domestic contracts, the owners of the pass-through entity each apply the look-back method (using, if they elect, the simplified marginal impact method) to their respective share of the income and expense from foreign contracts. Moreover, in applying the look-back method to foreign contracts at the owner level, the owners do not take into account their share of increases or decreases in contract income resulting from the application of the simplified marginal impact method with respect to domestic contracts at the entity level.
(F)
Effective date.
The simplified marginal impact method must be applied to pass-through entities described in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section with respect to domestic contracts completed or adjusted in tax years for which the due date of the return (determined with regard to extensions) of the pass-through entity is after November 9, 1988.
(ii)
Elective use
—(A)
General rule.
As provided in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, the simplified marginal impact method must be used by certain pass-through entities with respect to domestic contracts. C corporations, individuals, and owners of closely held pass-through entities may elect the simplified marginal impact method. Owners of other pass-through entities may also elect the simplified marginal impact method with respect to all contracts other than those for which the simplified marginal impact method is required to be applied at the entity level. This rule applies to foreign contracts of widely held pass-through entities. In the case of an electing owner in a pass-through entity, the simplified marginal impact method is applied at the owner level, instead of at the entity level, with respect to the owner's share of the long-term contract income and expense reported by the pass-through entity.
(B)
Election requirements.
A taxpayer elects the simplified marginal impact method by stating that the election is being made on a timely filed income tax return (determined with regard to extensions) for the first tax year the election is to apply. An election to use the simplified marginal impact method applies to all applications of the look-back method to all eligible long-term contracts for the tax year for which the election is made and for any subsequent tax year. The election may not be revoked without the consent of the Commissioner.
(C)
Consolidated group consistency rule.
In the case of a consolidated group of corporations as defined in § 1.1502-1(h), an election to use the simplified marginal impact method is made by the common parent of the group. The election is binding on all other affected members of the group (including members that join the group after the election is made with respect to all applications of the look-back method after joining). If a member subsequently leaves the group, the election remains binding as to that member unless the Commissioner consents to a revocation of the election. If a corporation using the simplified marginal impact method
joins a group that does not use the method, the election is automatically revoked with respect to all applications of the look-back method after it joins the group.
(e)
Delayed reapplication method
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of reapplying the look-back method after the year of contract completion, a taxpayer may elect the delayed reapplication method to minimize the number of required reapplications of the look-back method. Under this method, the look-back method is reapplied after the year of completion of a contract (or after a subsequent application of the look-back method) only when the first one of the following conditions is met with respect to the contract:
(i) The net undiscounted value of increases or decreases in the contract price occurring since the time of the last application of the look-back method exceeds the lesser of $1,000,000 or 10 percent of the total contract price as of that time,
(ii) The net undiscounted value of increases or decreases in the contract costs occurring since the time of the last application of the look-back method exceeds the lesser of $1,000,000 or 10 percent of the total contract price as of that time,
(iii) The taxpayer goes out of existence,
(iv) The taxpayer reasonably believes the contract is finally settled and closed, or
(v) Neither condition (e)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), nor (iv) above is met by the end of the fifth tax year that begins after the last previous application of the look-back method.
(2)
Time and manner of making election.
An election to use the delayed reapplication method may be made for any filing year for which the due date of the return (determined with regard to extensions) is after June 12, 1990. The election is made by a statement to that effect on the taxpayer's timely filed Federal income tax return (determined with regard to extensions) for the first tax year the election is to be effective. An election to use the delayed reapplication method is binding with respect to all long-term contracts for which the look-back method would be reapplied without regard to the election in the year of election and any subsequent year unless the Commissioner consents to a revocation of the election. In the case of a consolidated group of corporations as defined in § 1.1502-1(h), an election to use the delayed reapplication method is made by the common parent of the group. The election is binding on all other affected members of the group (including members that join the group after the election is made with respect to contracts adjusted after joining). If a member subsequently leaves the group, the election remains binding as to that member unless the Commissioner consents to a revocation of the election. If a corporation that has made the election joins a consolidated group that has not made the election, the election is treated as revoked with respect to contracts adjusted after joining.
(3)
Examples.
The operation of this delayed reapplication method is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X completes a contract in 1987, and applies the look-back method when its return for 1987 is filed. X properly uses $600,000 as the actual contract price in applying the look-back method. In 1990, as a result of the settlement of a dispute with its customer, X redetermines total contract price to be $640,000, and includes $40,000 in gross income. On its return for 1990, X states it is electing the delayed reapplication method. X is not required to reapply the look-back method at that time, because $40,000 does not exceed the lesser of $1,000,000 or 10 percent of the unadjusted contract price of $600,000, and 5 years have not passed since the last application of the look-back method.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that at the end of 1992, the fifth year after completion of the contract, no other adjustments to contract price or contract costs have occurred. X is required to reapply the look-back method in 1992 and, accordingly, redetermine its tax liability for each redetermination year. After redetermining the underpayment of tax for those years, X must compute the amount of interest charged on the underpayments. Although 1992 is the filing year, interest is due on the amount of each underpayment resulting from the adjustment only from the due date of the return for each redetermination year to the due date of the return for 1990 because the tax liability for the adjustment was fully paid in 1990. However, from the due of the 1990 return until the due date of the 1992 return, when the look-back method is reapplied for the adjustment, interest is due on
the amount of interest attributable to the underpayments.
(f)
Look-back reporting
—(1)
Procedure.
The amount of any interest due from, or payable to, a taxpayer as a result of applying the look-back method is computed on Form 8697 for any filing year. In general, the look-back method is applied by the taxpayer that reports income from a long-term contract. See paragraph (g) of this section to determine who is responsible for applying the look-back method when, prior to the completion of a long-term contract, there is a transaction that changes the taxpayer that reports income from the contract.
(2)
Treatment of interest on return
—(i)
General rule.
The amount of interest required to be paid by a taxpayer is treated as an income tax under subtitle A, but only for purposes of subtitle F of the Code (other than sections 6654 and 6655), which addresses tax procedures and administration. Thus, a taxpayer that fails to pay the amount of interest due is subject to any applicable penalties under subtitle F, including, for example, an underpayment penalty under section 6651, and the taxpayer also is liable for underpayment interest under section 6601. However, interest required to be paid under the look-back method is treated as interest expense for purposes of computing taxable income under subtitle A, even though it is treated as income tax liability for subtitle F purposes. Interest received under the look-back method is treated as taxable interest income for all purposes, and is not treated as a reduction in tax liability or a tax refund. The determination of whether or not interest computed under the look-back method is treated as tax is determined on a “net” basis for each filing year. Thus, if a taxpayer computes for the current filing year both hypothetical overpayments and hypothetical underpayments for prior years, the taxpayer has an increase in tax only if the interest computed on the underpayments for all those prior years exceeds the interest computed on the overpayments for all those prior years, for all contracts completed or adjusted for the year.
(ii)
Timing of look-back interest.
For purposes of determining taxable income under subtitle A of the Code, any amount of interest payable to the taxpayer under the look-back method is includible in gross income as interest income in the tax year it is properly taken into account under the taxpayer's method of accounting for interest income. Any amount of interest required to be paid is taken into account as interest expense arising from an underpayment of income tax in the tax year it is properly taken into account under the taxpayer's method of accounting for interest expense. Thus, look-back interest required to be paid by an individual, or by a pass-through entity on behalf of an individual owner (or beneficiary) under the simplified marginal impact method, is personal interest and, therefore, is disallowed in accordance with § 1.163-9T(b)(2). Interest determined at the entity level under the simplified marginal impact method is allocated among the owners (or beneficiaries) for reporting purposes in the same manner that interest income and interest expense are allocated to owners (or beneficiaries) and subject to the requirements of section 704 and any other applicable rules.
(3)
Statute of limitations and compounding of interest on look-back interest.
For guidance on the statute of limitations applicable to the assessment and collection of look-back interest owed by a taxpayer, see sections 6501 and 6502. A taxpayer's claim for credit or refund of look-back interest previously paid by or collected from a taxpayer is a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of tax and is subject to the statute of limitations provided in section 6511. A taxpayer's claim for look-back interest (or interest payable on look-back interest) that is not attributable to an amount previously paid by or collected from a taxpayer is a general, non-tax claim against the federal government. For guidance on the statute of limitations that applies to general, non-tax claims against the federal government, see 28 U.S.C. sections 2401 and 2501. For guidance applicable to the compounding of interest when the look-back interest is not paid, see sections 6601 to 6622.
(g)
Mid-contract change in taxpayer
—(1)
In general.
The rules in this paragraph (g) apply if, as described in § 1.460-4(k), prior to the completion of a
long-term contract accounted for using the PCM or the PCCM by a taxpayer (old taxpayer), there is a transaction that makes another taxpayer (new taxpayer) responsible for accounting for income from the same contract. The rules governing constructive completion transactions are provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, while the rules governing step-in-the-shoes transactions are provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, pre-transaction years are all taxable years of the old taxpayer in which the old taxpayer accounted for (or should have accounted for) gross receipts from the contract, and post-transaction years are all taxable years of the new taxpayer in which the new taxpayer accounted for (or should have accounted for) gross receipts from the contract.
(2)
Constructive completion transactions.
In the case of a transaction described in § 1.460-4(k)(2)(i) (constructive completion transaction), the look-back method is applied by the old taxpayer with respect to pre-transaction years upon the date of the transaction and, if the new taxpayer uses the PCM or the PCCM to account for the contract, by the new taxpayer with respect to post-transaction years upon completion of the contract. The contract price and allocable contract costs to be taken into account by the old taxpayer or the new taxpayer in applying the look-back method are described in § 1.460-4(k)(2).
(3)
Step-in-the-shoes transactions
—(i)
General rules.
In the case of a transaction described in § 1.460-4(k)(3)(i) (step-in-the-shoes transaction), the look-back method is not applied at the time of the transaction, but is instead applied for the first time when the contract is completed by the new taxpayer. Upon completion of the contract, the look-back method is applied by the new taxpayer with respect to both pre-transaction years and post-transaction years, taking into account all amounts reasonably expected to be received by either the old or new taxpayer and all allocable contract costs incurred during both periods as described in § 1.460-4(k)(3). The new taxpayer is liable for filing the Form 8697 and for interest computed on hypothetical underpayments of tax, and is entitled to receive interest with respect to hypothetical overpayments of tax, for both pre- and post-transaction years. The old taxpayer will be secondarily liable for any interest required to be paid with respect to pre-transaction years reduced by any interest on pre-transaction overpayments.
(ii)
Application of look-back method to pre-transaction period
—(A)
Contract price.
The actual contract price for pre-transaction taxable years must be determined by the new taxpayer without regard to any contract price adjustment described in paragraph (k)(3)(iv)(B)(1) of this section.
(B)
Method.
The new taxpayer may apply the look-back method to each pre-transaction taxable year that is a redetermination year using the simplified marginal impact method described in paragraph (d) of this section (regardless of whether or not the old taxpayer would have actually used that method and without regard to the tax liability ceiling). But see paragraph (d)(4) of this section, which requires use of the simplified marginal impact method by certain pass-through entities.
(C)
Interest accrual period.
With respect to any hypothetical underpayment or overpayment of tax for a pre-transaction taxable year, interest accrues from the due date of the old taxpayer's tax return (not including extensions) for the taxable year of the underpayment or overpayment until the due date of the new taxpayer's return (not including extensions) for the completion year or the year of a post-completion adjustment, whichever is applicable.
(D)
Information old taxpayer must provide
—(
1
)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(D)(
2
) of this section, in order to help the new taxpayer to apply the look-back method with respect to pre-transaction taxable years, any old taxpayer that accounted for income from a long-term contract under the PCM or PCCM for either regular or alternative minimum tax purposes is required to provide the information described in this paragraph to the new taxpayer by the due date (not including extensions) of the old taxpayer's income tax return for the first taxable
year ending on or after a step-in-the-shoes transaction described in § 1.460-4(k)(3)(i). The required information is as follows—
(
i
) The portion of the contract reported by the old taxpayer under PCM for regular and alternative minimum tax purposes (
i.e.
, whether the old taxpayer used PCM, the 40/60 PCCM method, or the 70/30 PCCM method);
(
ii
) Any submethods used in the application of PCM (
e.g.
, the simplified cost-to-cost method or the 10-percent method);
(
iii
) The amount of total contract price reported by year;
(
iv
) The numerator and the denominator of the completion factor by year;
(
v
) The due date (not including extensions) of the old taxpayer's income tax returns for each taxable year in which income was required to be reported;
(
vi
) Whether the old taxpayer was a corporate or a noncorporate taxpayer by year; and
(
vii
) Any other information required by the Commissioner by administrative pronouncement.
(
2
)
Special rules for certain pass-through entity transactions.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(D)(
1
) of this section, in the case of a transaction described in § 1.460-4(k)(3)(i)(I), the contributing partner is treated as the old taxpayer, and the partnership is treated as the new taxpayer. In the case of transactions described in § 1.460-4(k)(3)(i)(F), (G), (J), (K), or (L), the old taxpayer is not required to provide the information described in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(D)(
1
) of this section, because information necessary for the new taxpayer to apply the look-back method is provided by the pass-through entity. This paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(D) is applicable for transactions on or after August 6, 2003.
(iii)
Application of look-back method to post-transaction years.
With respect to post-transaction taxable years, the new taxpayer must use the same look-back method it uses for other contacts (i.e., the simplified marginal impact method or the acutal method) to determine the amount of any hypothetical overpayment or underpayment of tax and the time period for computing interest on these amounts.
(iv)
S corporation elections.
Following the conversion of a C corporation into an S corporation, the look-back method is applied at the entity level with respect to contracts entered into prior to the conversion, notwithstanding section 460(b)(4)(B)(i).
(4)
Effective date.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(D) of this section, this paragraph (g) is applicable for transactions on or after May 15, 2002.
(h)
Examples
—(1)
Overview.
This paragraph provides computational examples of the rules of this section. Except as otherwise noted, the examples involve calendar-year taxpayers and involve long-term contracts subject to section 460 that are accounted for using the percentage of completion method, rather than the percentage of completion-capitalized cost method. If the percentage of completion-capitalized cost method were used by a taxpayer described in the examples, the amounts of contract income and expenses shown in the examples would be reduced, for purposes of determining regular taxable income, to the appropriate fraction (40, 70, or 90 percent) of contract items accounted for under the percentage of completion method. Tens of thousands of dollars ($ 00,000's) are omitted from the figures in the examples. The contracts described in the examples are assumed to be the taxpayers' only contracts that are subject to the look-back method of section 460. Except as otherwise stated, the examples assume that the taxpayer has no adjustments and preferences for purposes of section 55, so that alternative minimum taxable income is the same as taxable income, and no alternative minimum tax is imposed for the years involved. The examples assume that the taxpayer does not elect the 10-percent method, the simplified marginal impact method, or the delayed reapplication method.
(2)
Step One.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (c)(2):

# Example 1.
In 1989, W completes three long-term contracts, A, B, and C, entered into on January 1 of 1986, 1987, and 1988, respectively. For Contract A, W used the completed contract method of accounting. For Contract B,
W used the percentage of completion-capitalized cost method of accounting, taking into account 60 percent of contract income under W's normal method of accounting, which was the completed contract method. For Contract C, W used the percentage of completion method of accounting. The total price for each contract was $1,000. In computing alternative minimum taxable income, W is required to use the percentage of completion method for Contracts B and C. W used regular tax costs for purposes of determining the degree of contract completion under the alternative minimum tax.
Contract A is not taken into account for purposes of applying the look-back method, because it is subject to neither section 460 nor section 56(a)(3). Thus, even if W had used the percentage of completion method as permitted under § 1.451-3, instead of the completed contract method, the look-back method would not be applicable because the Contract A was entered into before the effective date of section 460.
The actual costs allocated to Contracts B and C under section 460(c) and incurred in each year of the contract were as follows:
Contract
1987
1988
1989
Total
B
$200
$400
$200
$800
C
100
300
400
800
In applying the look-back method, the first step is to allocate the contract price among tax years preceding and including the completion year. That allocation would produce the following amounts of gross income for purposes of the regular tax. Note that no income from Contract C is allocated to 1987, the year before the contract was entered into, even though contract costs were incurred in 1987:
Contract
1987
1988
1989
B
$100
$200
$700
(40%X$200/$800X$1000)
((40%X$600/$800X$1000)-$100)
C
0
500
500
($400/$800X$1000)
Because the percentage of completion-capitalized cost method may not be used for alternative minimum tax purposes, the allocation of contract income would produce the following amounts of gross income for purposes of computing alternative minimum taxable income:
Contract
1987
1988
1989
B
$250
$500
$250
($200/$800X$1000)
(($600/$800X$1000)-$250)
C
0
500
500

Step Two.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (c)(3):

# Example 2.
(i) X enters into two long-term contracts (D and E) in 1988. X determines its tax liability for 1988 as follows:

(iii) For purposes of the look-back method, X must reallocate the actual total contract D price between 1988 and 1989 based on the actual total contract D costs. This results in the following hypothetical underpayment of tax for 1988 for purposes of the look-back method. Note that X does not reallocate the contract E price in applying the look-back method in 1989 because contract E has not been completed, even though X's estimate of contract E costs has changed. The following computation is only for purposes of applying the look-back method, and does not result in the assessment of a tax deficiency.

For purposes of any subsequent application of the look-back method for which 1989 is a redetermination year, because the reallocation of contract income and redetermination of tax liability are cumulative, X will use for 1989 the amount of contract D income and the amount of tax liability that would have been reported in 1989 if X had used actual contract costs instead of the amounts that were originally reported using the estimate of $8,000. Assuming no subsequent revisions (due to, for example, adjustments to contract D price and costs determined after the end of 1989), this amount would be determined as follows:

(v) For purposes of the look-back method, X must reallocate the actual total contract E price between the 1988, 1989, and 1990, based on the actual total contract E costs.
This results in the following hypothetical overpayment of tax for 1988. Note that X uses the amount of income for contract D determined in the last previous application of the look-back method, and not the amount of income actually reported:
1988

In applying the look-back method to 1989, X again uses the amounts substituted as of the last previous application of the look-back method with respect to contract D. Thus, X computes its hypothetical underpayment for 1989 as follows:

For purposes of any subsequent application of the look-back method for which 1990 is a redetermination year, X will use for 1990 the amount of Contract E income, and the amount of tax liability, that was originally reported in 1990 because X's estimate of the total contract costs from $8,000 to $9,000 did not change after 1989. Without regard to any subsequent revisions, these amounts are the same as in the table in paragraph (h)(3)(iv) above.
(4)
Post-completion adjustments.
The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (c)(1)(ii):

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in Example 2. In 1991, X settles a lawsuit against its customer in Contract E. The customer pays X an additional $3,000, without interest, in 1991. Applying the Federal mid-term rate then in effect, this $3,000 has a discounted value at the time of contract completion in 1990 of $2,700. X is required to apply the look-back method for 1991 even though no contract was completed in 1991. X must include the full $3,000 adjustment (which was not previously includible in total contract price) in gross income for 1991. X does not elect not to discount adjustments to the contract price or costs. Thus, X adjusts the contract price by the discounted amount of the adjustment and, therefore, uses $12,700 (not $13,000) for total Contract E price, rather than $10,000, which was used when the look-back method was first applied with respect to Contract E.
For purposes of the look-back method, X must allocate the revised total Contract E price of $12,700 between 1988, 1989 and 1990 based on the actual total Contract E costs, and compare the resulting revised tax liability with the tax liability determined for the last previous application of the look-back method involving those years. This results in the following hypothetical underpayments of tax for purposes of the look-back method:

In 1992, X incurs an additional cost of $1,000 allocable to the contract, which was not previously includible in total contract costs. Applying the Federal mid-term rate then in effect, the $1,000 has a discounted value at the time of contract completion of $800. X deducts this additional $1,000 in expenses in 1992. Based on this increase to contract costs, X reapplies the look-back method, and determines the following hypothetical underpayments for 1988, 1989 and 1990 for purposes of the look-back method:

Alternative minimum tax.
The operation of the look-back method in the case of a taxpayer liable for the alternative minimum tax as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(vi) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 4.
Y enters into a long-term contract in 1988 that is completed in 1989. Y used regular tax costs for purposes of determining the degree of contract completion under the alternative minimum tax.
(i) Y determines its tax liability for 1988 as follows:

(ii) For purposes of applying the look-back method, Y redetermines its tax liability for 1988, which results in a hypothetical overpayment of tax. This hypothetical overpayment is determined by comparing Y's original regular tax liability for 1988 with the hypothetical total tax liability (including alternative minimum tax liability) for that year because Y would have paid the alternative minimum tax if Y had used its actual contract costs to report income:

Credit carryovers.
The operation of the look-back method in the case of credit carryovers as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(v) is illustrated by the following example:

# Example 5.
Z enters into a contract in 1986 that is completed in 1987. Z determines its tax liability for 1986 as follows:
1986 contract costs
$400a
Total contract costs
$1,000e

$0a
Z determines the following amounts for 1987:
1987 contract costs
$400a
Total contract price
$2,000a
Total contract costs
$800a
If Z had used actual rather than estimated contract costs in determining gross income for 1986, Z would have reported tax liability of $276 (46%x$600) rather than $184. However, Z would have paid no additional tax for 1986 because its unused tax credits carried forward from 1985 would have been sufficient to offset this increased tax liability. Therefore, there is no hypothetical underpayment for 1986 for purposes of the look-back method. However, this hypothetical earlier use of the credit may increase the hypothetical tax liability for 1987 (or another subsequent year) for purposes of subsequent applications of the look-back method.
(7)
Net operating losses.
The operation of the look-back method in the case of net operating loss (“NOL”) carryovers as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(v) is illustrated by the following example:

# Example 6.
A entered into a long-term contract in 1986, which was completed in 1987. A determined its tax liability for 1986 as follows:
1986 contract costs
$400a
Total contract costs
$1,000e
Total contract price
$2,000e
1986 completion (%)
40e
1986 gross income

$400a
Other 1986 net income/(loss)
($1,000a)
Taxable income/(NOL)
($600a)
Tax
$0a
A elected to carry this loss forward to 1987 pursuant to section 172(b)(3)(C).
For 1987, A determined the following amounts:
1987 contract costs
$400a
Total contract costs
$800a
Total contract price
$2,000a
If actual rather than estimated contract costs had been used in determining gross income for 1986, A would have reported $1,000 of gross income from the contract rather than
$800, and thus would have reported a loss of $400 rather than $600. However, since A would have paid no tax for 1986 regardless of whether actual or estimated contract costs had been used, A does not have an underpayment for 1986 for purposes of the look-back method. If A had, instead, carried back the 1986 NOL, and this NOL had been absorbed in the tax years 1983 through 1985, it would have resulted in refunds of tax for those years in 1986. When A applies the look-back method, a hypothetical underpayment of tax would have resulted for those years due to a hypothetical reduction in the amount that would have been refunded if income had been reported on the basis of actual contract costs. See Example 2(iii).
(8)
Alternative minimum tax credit.
The following example illustrates the application of the look-back method if affected by the alternative minimum tax credit as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(vi):
(i) Example 4, above illustrates that the reallocation of contract income under the look-back method can result in a hypothetical underpayment or overpayment determined using the alternative minimum tax rate, even though the taxpayer actually paid only the regular tax for that year. However, application of the look-back method had no effect on the difference between the amount of alternative minimum taxable income and the amount of regular taxable income taken into account in that year because the taxpayer was required to use the percentage of completion method for both regular and alternative minimum tax purposes and used the same version of the percentage of completion method for both regular and alternative minimum tax purposes (
i.e.,
the taxpayer had made an election to use regular tax costs in determining the percentage of completion for purposes of computing alternative minimum taxable income).
(ii) The following example illustrates the application of the look-back method in the case of a taxpayer that does not use the percentage of completion method of accounting for long-term contracts in computing taxable income for regular tax purposes and thus must make an adjustment to taxable income to determine alternative minimum taxable income. The example also shows how interest is computed under the look-back method when the taxpayer is entitled to a credit under section 53 for minimum tax paid because of this adjustment.
(iii)
Example 7.
X, a calendar year C corporation, is engaged in the construction of real property under contracts that are completed within a 24-month period. Its average annual gross receipts for the prior 3-taxable-year period does not exceed $25,000,000. As permitted by section 460(e)(1)(B), X uses the completed contract method (CCM) for regular tax purposes. However, X is engaged in the construction of commercial real property and, for years beginning before January 1, 2018, is required to use the percentage of completion method (PCM) for alternative minimum tax (AMT) purposes. Assume that for 2017, 2018, and 2019, X has only one long-term contract, which is entered into in 2017 and completed in 2019 and that in 2017 X's average annual gross receipts for the prior 3-taxable-years do not exceed $10,000,000. Assume further that X estimates gross income from the contract to be $2,000, total contract costs to be $1,000, and that the contract is 25 percent complete in 2017 and 70 percent complete in 2018, and 5 percent complete in 2019. In 2019, the year of completion, gross income from the contract is actually $3,000, instead of $2,000, and costs are actually $1,000. Because X was required to use the PCM for 2017 for AMT purposes, X must apply the look-back method to its AMT reporting for that year. X has elected to use the simplified marginal impact method. For 2017, X's income using estimated contract price and costs is as follows:
Table 1 to Paragraph (
h
)(8)(
iii
)
Estimates
2017
Gross Income
$500 = ($2,000 × 25%)
Deductions
$(250) = ($1,000 × 25%)
Contract Income—PCM
$250
(A) When X files its federal income tax return for 2019, the contract completion year, X applies the look-back method. For 2017, X's income using actual contract price and costs is as follows:
Table 2 to Paragraph (
h
)(8)(
iii
)(A)
Actual
2017
Gross Income
$750 = ($3,000 × 25%)
Deductions
$(250) = ($1,000 × 25%)
Contract Income—PCM
$500
(B) Accordingly, the reallocation of contract income under the look-back method results in an increase of income for AMT purposes for 2017 of $250 ($500-$250). Under the simplified marginal impact method, X applies the highest rate of tax under section 55(b)(1) to this increase, which produces a hypothetical underpayment for 2017 of $50 (.20 × $250). Interest is charged to X on this $50 underpayment from the due date of X's 2017 return until the due date of X's 2019 return. X, a C corporation, is not subject to the AMT in 2018. X does not compute alternative minimum taxable income or use the PCM in that year. Accordingly, look-back does not apply to 2018.
(9)
Period for interest.
The following Examples (8) through (11) illustrate how to determine the period for computing interest as provided in paragraph (c)(4):

# Example 8.
The facts are the same as in Example 6, except that the contract is completed in 1988, and A determined the following amounts for 1987 and 1988:
For 1987:
1987 contract costs
0
Total contract costs
$1,000e
Total contract price
$2,000e
1987 completion (%)
$40e

0a
Tax
0a
For 1988:
1988 contract costs
$400a
Total contract costs
$800a
Total contract price
$2,000a
If actual rather than estimated contract costs had been used in determining gross income for 1986, A would have reported $1,000 of gross income from the contract for 1986 rather than $800, and would have reported a net operating loss carryforward to 1987 of $400 rather than $600. Therefore, A would have reported taxable income of $200, and would have paid tax of $80 (
i.e.,
$200 × 40%) for 1987. The due date for filing A's Federal income tax return for its 1988 taxable year is March 15. A obtains an extension and files its 1988 return on September 15, 1989. Under the look-back method, A is required to pay interest on the amount of this hypothetical underpayment ($80) computed from the due date (determined without regard to extensions) for A's return for 1987 (not 1986, even though 1986 was the year in which the net operating loss arose) until March 15 (not September 15), the due date (without regard to extensions) of A's return for 1988. A is required to pay additional interest from March 15 until September 15 on the amount of interest outstanding as of March 15 with respect to the hypothetical underpayment of $80.

# Example 9.
The facts are the same as in Example 6, except that A carries the net operating loss of $600 back to 1983 rather than forward to 1987, and receives a refund of $276 ($600 reduction in 1983 taxable income × 46% rate in effect in 1983). As in Example 6, if actual contract costs had been used, A would have reported a loss for 1986 of $400 rather than $600. Thus, A would have received a refund of 1983 tax of $184 ($400 × 46%) rather than $276. Under the look-back method A is required to pay interest on the difference in these two amounts ($92) computed from the due date (determined without regard to extensions) of A's return for 1986 (the year in which the carryback arose rather than 1983, the year in which it was used) until the due date of A's return for 1988.

Assume that B had no taxable income in either 1984 or 1985, so that the entire amount of the $2,400 net operating loss is carried back to 1986, and B receives a refund, with interest from the due date of B's 1987 return, of the entire $1,104 in tax that it paid for 1986.
In 1988, B determines the following amounts:
1988 contract costs
$800a
Total contract costs
$1,600a
Total contract price
$2,000a
If B had used actual contract costs rather than estimated costs in determining its gross income for 1986, B would have had gross
income from the contract of $500 rather than $800, and thus would have had taxable income of $2,100 rather than $2,400, and would have paid tax of $966 rather than $1,104. B is entitled to receive interest on the difference between these two amounts, the hypothetical overpayment of tax of $138. Interest is computed from the due date (without regard to extensions) of B's return for 1986 until the due date for B's return for 1987. Interest stops running at this date, because B's hypothetical overpayment of tax ended when B filed its original 1987 return and received a refund for the carryback to 1986, and interest on this refund began to run only from the due date of B's 1987 return. See section 6611(f).

# Example 11.
C enters into a long-term contract in 1986, its first year in business, which is completed in 1988. C determines its tax liability for 1986 as follows:

C carries back the net operating loss to 1986, and files an amended return for 1986, showing taxable income of $250, and receives a refund of $989 (46% × $2,150). Interest on this refund begins to run only as of the due date of C's 1987 return. See section 6611(f).
In 1988, when the contract is completed, C determines the following amounts:
1988 contract costs
$800a
Total contract costs
$1,600a
Total contract price
$2,000a
If C had used actual contract price and contract costs in determining gross income for 1986, it would have reported gross income from the contract of $500 rather than $800, taxable income of $2,100 rather than $2,400, and tax liability of $966 rather than $1,104.
If C had used actual contract price and contract costs in determining gross income for 1987, it would have reported gross income from the contract of $500 rather than $700, and would have reported a net operating loss of $2,350, rather than $2,150, which would have been carried back to 1986.
Under the look-back method, C receives interest with respect to a total 1986 hypothetical overpayment of $138 ($1,104 minus $966). C is credited with interest on $23 of this amount only from the due date of C's 1986 return until the due date of C's 1987 tax return, because this portion of C's total hypothetical overpayment for 1986 was refunded to C with interest computed from the due date of C's 1987 return and, therefore, was no longer held by the government. However, because the remainder of the total hypothetical overpayment of $115 was not refunded to C, C is credited with interest on this amount from the due date of C's 1986 return until the due date of C's 1988 tax return.
Under the look-back method, C receives no interest with respect to 1987, because C had no tax liability for 1987 using either estimated or actual contract price and costs.

(j)
Election not to apply look-back method in de minimis cases.
Section 460(b)(6) provides taxpayers with an election not to apply the look-back method to long-term contracts in de minimis cases, effective for contracts completed in taxable years ending after August 5, 1997. To make an election, a taxpayer must attach a statement to its timely filed original federal income tax return (including extensions) for the taxable year the election is to become effective or to an amended return for that year, provided the amended return is filed on or before March 31, 998. This statement must have the legend “NOTIFICATION OF ELECTION UNDER SECTION 460(b)(6)”; provide the taxpayer's name and identifying number and the effective date of the election; and identify the trades or businesses that involve long-term contracts. An election applies to all long-term contracts completed during and after the taxable year for which the election is effective. An election may not be revoked without the Commissioner's consent. For taxpayers who elected to use the delayed reapplication method under paragraph (e) of this section, an election under this paragraph (j) automatically revokes the election to use the delayed reapplication method for contracts subject to section 460(b)(6). A consolidated group of corporations, as defined in § 1.1502-1(h), is subject to consistency rules analogous to those in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C) of this section (concerning
election to use simplified marginal impact method).

Applicability date.
Paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(2)(ii), (b)(3)(iii), (c)(1)(i), (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(iv), (c)(3)(ii), (c)(3)(vi), (d)(2)(i), (d)(4)(i)(A), and (h)(8)(iii) of this section apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 5, 2021. However, for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 5, 2021, a taxpayer may apply the paragraphs described in the first sentence of this paragraph (k), provided that the taxpayer follows all the applicable rules contained in the regulations under section 460 for such taxable year and all subsequent taxable years. Further, a taxpayer may apply those portions of paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3)(iii) of this section that relate to section 460(e)(1)(B) for contracts entered into after December 31, 2017, in a taxable year ending after December 31, 2017, provided that the taxpayer follows all the applicable rules contained in the regulations under section 460 for such taxable year and all subsequent taxable years.

§ 1.461-1
General rule for taxable year of deduction.
(a)
General rule
—(1)
Taxpayer using cash receipts and disbursements method.
Under the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, amounts representing allowable deductions shall, as a general rule, be taken into account for the taxable year in which paid. Further, a taxpayer using this method may also be entitled to certain deductions in the computation of taxable income which do not involve cash disbursements during the taxable year, such as the deductions for depreciation, depletion, and losses under sections 167, 611, and 165, respectively. If an expenditure results in the creation of an asset having a useful life which extends substantially beyond the close of the taxable year, such an expenditure may not be deductible, or may be deductible only in part, for the taxable year in which made. An example is an expenditure for the construction of improvements by the lessee on leased property where the estimated life of the improvements is in excess of the remaining period of the lease. In such a case, in lieu of the allowance for depreciation provided by section 167, the basis shall be amortized ratably over the remaining period of the lease. See section 178 and the regulations thereunder for rules governing the effect to be given renewal options in determining whether the useful life of the improvements exceeds the remaining term of the lease where a lessee begins improvements on leased property after July 28, 1958, other than improvements which on such date and at all times thereafter, the lessee was under a binding legal obligation to make. See section 263 and the regulations thereunder for rules relating to capital expenditures. See section 467 and the regulations thereunder for rules under which a liability arising out of the use of property pursuant to a section 467 rental agreement is taken into account.
(2)
Taxpayer using an accrual method
—(i)
In general.
Under an accrual method of accounting, a liability (as defined in § 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)(B)) is incurred, and generally is taken into account for Federal income tax purposes, in the taxable year in which all the events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability, the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy, and economic performance
has occurred with respect to the liability. (See paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section for examples of liabilities that may not be taken into account until a taxable year subsequent to the taxable year incurred, and see §§ 1.461-4 through 1.461-6 for rules relating to economic performance.) Applicable provisions of the Code, the Income Tax Regulations, and other guidance published by the Secretary prescribe the manner in which a liability that has been incurred is taken into account. For example, section 162 provides that the deductible liability generally is taken into account in the taxable year incurred through a deduction from gross income. As a further example, under section 263 or 263A, a liability that relates to the creation of an asset having a useful life extending substantially beyond the close of the taxable year is taken into account in the taxable year incurred through capitalization (within the meaning of § 1.263A-1(c)(3)), and may later affect the computation of taxable income through depreciation or otherwise over a period including subsequent taxable years, in accordance with applicable Internal Revenue Code sections and guidance published by the Secretary. The principles of this paragraph (a)(2) also apply in the calculation of earnings and profits and accumulated earnings and profits.
(ii)
Uncertainty as to the amount of a liability.
While no liability shall be taken into account before economic performance and all of the events that fix the liability have occurred, the fact that the exact amount of the liability cannot be determined does not prevent a taxpayer from taking into account that portion of the amount of the liability which can be computed with reasonable accuracy within the taxable year. For example, A renders services to B during the taxable year for which A charges $10,000. B admits a liability to A for $6,000 but contests the remainder. B may take into account only $6,000 as an expense for the taxable year in which the services were rendered.
(iii)
Alternative timing rules.
(A) If any provision of the Code requires a liability to be taken into account in a taxable year later than the taxable year provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the liability is taken into account as prescribed in that Code provision. See, for example, section 267 (transactions between related parties) and section 464 (farming syndicates).
(B) If the liability of a taxpayer is subject to section 170 (charitable contributions), section 192 (black lung benefit trusts), section 194A (employer liability trusts), section 468 (mining and solid waste disposal reclamation and closing costs), or section 468A (certain nuclear decommissioning costs), the liability is taken into account as determined under that section and not under section 461 or the regulations thereunder. For special rules relating to certain loss deductions, see sections 165(e), 165(i), and 165(l), relating to theft losses, disaster losses, and losses from certain deposits in qualified financial institutions.
(C) Section 461 and the regulations thereunder do not apply to any amount allowable under a provision of the Code as a deduction for a reserve for estimated expenses.
(D) Except as otherwise provided in any Internal Revenue regulations, revenue procedure, or revenue ruling, the economic performance requirement of section 461(h) and the regulations thereunder is satisfied to the extent that any amount is otherwise deductible under section 404 (employer contributions to a plan of deferred compensation), section 404A (certain foreign deferred compensation plans), or section 419 (welfare benefit funds). See § 1.461-4(d)(2)(iii).
(E) Except as otherwise provided by regulations or other published guidance issued by the Commissioner (See § 601.601(b)(2) of this chapter), in the case of a liability arising out of the use of property pursuant to a section 467 rental agreement, the all events test (including economic performance) is considered met in the taxable year in which the liability is to be taken into account under section 467 and the regulations thereunder.
(3)
Effect in current taxable year of improperly accounting for a liability in a prior taxable year.
Each year's return should be complete in itself, and taxpayers shall ascertain the facts necessary to make a correct return. The expenses, liabilities, or loss of one year
generally cannot be used to reduce the income of a subsequent year. A taxpayer may not take into account in a return for a subsequent taxable year liabilities that, under the taxpayer's method of accounting, should have been taken into account in a prior taxable year. If a taxpayer ascertains that a liability should have been taken into account in a prior taxable year, the taxpayer should, if within the period of limitation, file a claim for credit or refund of any overpayment of tax arising therefrom. Similarly, if a taxpayer ascertains that a liability was improperly taken into account in a prior taxable year, the taxpayer should, if within the period of limitation, file an amended return and pay any additional tax due. However, except as provided in section 905(c) and the regulations thereunder, if a liability is properly taken into account in an amount based on a computation made with reasonable accuracy and the exact amount of the liability is subsequently determined in a later taxable year, the difference, if any, between such amounts shall be taken into account for the later taxable year.
(4)
Deductions attributable to certain foreign income.
In any case in which, owing to monetary, exchange, or other restrictions imposed by a foreign country, an amount otherwise constituting gross income for the taxable year from sources without the United States is not includible in gross income of the taxpayer for that year, the deductions and credits properly chargeable against the amount so restricted shall not be deductible in such year but shall be deductible proportionately in any subsequent taxable year in which such amount or portion thereof is includible in gross income. See paragraph (g) of § 1.905-1 for rules relating to credit for foreign income taxes when foreign income is subject to exchange controls.
(b)
Special rule in case of death.
A taxpayer's taxable year ends on the date of his death. See section 443(a)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.443-1. In computing taxable income for such year, there shall be deducted only amounts properly deductible under the method of accounting used by the taxpayer. However, if the taxpayer used an accrual method of accounting, no deduction shall be allowed for amounts accrued only by reason of his death. For rules relating to the inclusion of items of partnership deduction, loss, or credit in the return of a decedent partner, see subchapter K, chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Accrual of real property taxes
—(1)
In general.
If the accrual of real property taxes is proper in connection with one of the methods of accounting described in section 446(c), any taxpayer using such a method of accounting may elect to accrue any real property tax, which is related to a definite period of time, ratably over that period in the manner described in this paragraph. For example, assume that such an election is made by a calendar-year taxpayer whose real property taxes, applicable to the period from July 1, 1955, to June 30, 1956, amount to $1,200. Under section 461(c), $600 of such taxes accrue in the calendar year 1955, and the balance accrues in 1956. For special rule in the case of certain contested real property taxes in respect of which the taxpayer transfers money or other property to provide for the satisfaction of the contested tax, see § 1.461-2. For general rules relating to deductions for taxes, see section 164 and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Special rules
—(i)
Effective date.
Section 461(c) and this paragraph do not apply to any real property tax allowable as a deduction under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1954.
(ii) If real property taxes which relate to a period prior to the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1954, would, but for section 461(c), be deductible in such first taxable year, the portion of such taxes which applies to the prior period is deductible in such first taxable year (in addition to the amount allowable under section 461(c)(1)).
(3)
When election may be made
—(i)
Without consent.
A taxpayer may elect to accrue real property taxes ratably in accordance with section 461(c) and this paragraph without the consent of the Commissioner for his first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, in which the taxpayer incurs real property
taxes. Such election must be made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such year (including extensions thereof). An election may be made by the taxpayer for each separate trade or business (and for nonbusiness activities, if accounted for separately). Such an election shall apply to all real property taxes of the trade, business, or nonbusiness activity for which the election is made. The election shall be made in a statement submitted with the taxpayer's return for the first taxable year to which the election is applicable. The statement should set forth:
(
a
) The trades or businesses, or nonbusiness activity, to which the election is to apply, and the method of accounting used therein;
(
b
) The period of time to which the taxes are related; and
(
c
) The computation of the deduction for real property taxes for the first year of the election (or a summary of such computation).
(ii)
With consent.
A taxpayer may elect with the consent of the Commissioner to accrue real property taxes ratably in accordance with section 461 (c) and this paragraph. A written request for permission to make such an election shall be submitted to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, D.C. 20224, within 90 days after the beginning of the taxable year to which the election is first applicable, or before March 26, 1958, whichever date is later. The request for permission shall state:
(
a
) The name and address of the taxpayer;
(
b
) The trades or businesses, or nonbusiness activity, to which the election is to apply, and the method of accounting used therein;
(
c
) The taxable year to which the election first applies;
(
d
) The period to which the real property tax relate;
(
e
) The computation of the deduction for real property taxes for the first year of election (or a summary of such computation); and
(
f
) An adequate description of the manner in which all real property taxes were deducted in the year prior to the year of election.
(4)
Binding effect of election.
An election to accrue real property taxes ratably under section 461(c) is binding upon the taxpayer unless the consent of the Commissioner is obtained under section 446(e) and paragraph (e) of § 1.446-1 to change such method of deducting real property taxes. If the last day prescribed by law for filing a return for any taxable year (including extensions thereof) to which section 461(c) is applicable falls before March 25, 1958, consent is hereby given for the taxpayer to revoke an election previously made to accrue real property taxes in the manner prescribed by section 461(c). If the taxpayer revokes his election under the preceding sentence, he must, on or before March 25, 1958, notify the district director for the district in which the return was filed of such revocation. For any taxable year for which such revocation is applicable, an amended return reflecting such revocation shall be filed on or before March 25, 1958.
(5)
Apportionment of taxes on real property between seller and purchaser.
For apportionment of taxes on real property between seller and purchaser, see section 164(d) and the regulations thereunder.
(6)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A taxpayer on an accrual method reports his taxable income for the taxable year ending June 30. He elects to accrue real property taxes ratably for the taxable year ending June 30, 1955 (which is his first taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1954). In the absence of an election under section 461(c), such taxes would accrue on January 1 of the calendar year to which they are related. The real property taxes are $1,200 for 1954; $1,600 for 1955; and $1,800 for 1956. Deductions for such taxes for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1955, and June 30, 1956, are computed as follows:
Fiscal year ending June 30, 1955
July through December 1954

# Example 2.
A calendar-year taxpayer on an accrual method elects to accrue real property taxes ratably for 1954. In the absence of an election under section 461(c), such taxes would accrue on July 1 and are assessed for the 12-month period beginning on that date. The real property taxes assessed for the year ending June 30, 1954, are $1,200; $1,600 for the year ending June 30, 1955; and $1,800 for the year ending June 30, 1956. Deductions for such taxes for the calendar years 1954 and 1955 are computed as follows:
Year ending December 31, 1954
January through June 1954
1
None
July through December 1954 (
6/12

The entire tax of $1,200 for the year ended June 30, 1954, was deductible in the return for 1953, since such tax accrued on July 1, 1953.
Year ending December 31, 1955
January through June 1955 (

# Example 3.
A calendar-year taxpayer on an accrual method elects to accrue real property taxes ratably for 1954. In the absence of an election under section 461(c), such taxes, which relate to the calendar year 1954, are accruable on December 1 of the preceding calendar year. No deduction for real property taxes is allowable for the taxable year 1954 since such taxes accrued in the taxable year 1953 under section 23(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.

# Example 4.
A taxpayer on an accrual method reports his taxable income for the taxable year ending March 31. He elects to accrue real property taxes ratably for the taxable year ending March 31, 1955. In the absence of an election under section 461(c), such taxes are accruable on June 1 of the calendar year to which they relate. The real property taxes are $1,200 for 1954; $1,600 for 1955; and $1,800 for 1956. Deductions for such taxes for the taxable years ending March 31, 1955, and March 31, 1956, are computed as follows:
Fiscal year ending March 31, 1955
April through December 1954 (
9/12
of $1,200)
$900
January through March 1955 (
3/12
of $1,600)
400
Taxes accrued ratably in fiscal year ending March 31, 1955
1,800
Tax relating to period January through March 1954, paid in June 1954, and not deductible in prior taxable year (

$1,200
January through March 1956 (
3/12
of $1,800)

# Example 5.
The facts are the same as in Example 4 except that in June 1955, when the taxpayer pays his $1,600 real property taxes for 1955, he pays $400 of such amount under protest. Deductions for taxes for the taxable years ending March 31, 1955, and March 31, 1956, are computed as follows:
Fiscal year ending March 31, 1955
April through December 1954 (
9/12
of $1,200)
$900
January through March 1955 (
3/12
of $1,200, that is, $1,600 minus $400 (the contested portion which is not properly accruable))
300
Taxes accrued ratably in fiscal year ending March 31, 1955

(d)
Limitation on acceleration of accrual of taxes.
(1) Section 461(d)(1) provides that, in the case of a taxpayer whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting, to the extent that the time for accruing taxes is earlier than it would be but for any action of any taxing jurisdiction taken after December 31, 1960, such taxes are to be treated as accruing at the time they would have accrued but for such action. Any such action which, but for the provisions of section 461(d) and this paragraph, would accelerate the time for accruing a tax is to be disregarded in determining the time for accruing such tax for purposes of the deduction allowed for such tax. Such action is to be disregarded not only with respect to a taxpayer (whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of
accounting) upon whom the tax is imposed at the time of the action, but also with respect to such a taxpayer upon whom the tax is imposed at any time subsequent to such action. Thus, in the case of a tax imposed on property, the acceleration of the time for accruing taxes is to be disregarded not only with respect to the taxpayer who owned the property at the time of such acceleration, but also with respect to any subsequent owner of the property whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting. Similarly, such action is to be disregarded with respect to all property subject to such tax, even if such property is acquired after the action. Whenever the time for accruing taxes is to be disregarded in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, the taxpayer shall accrue the tax at the time (original accrual date) the tax would have accrued but for such action, and shall, in the absence of any action of the taxing jurisdiction placing the time for accruing such tax at a time subsequent to the original accrual date, continue to accrue the tax as of the original accrual date for all future taxable years.
(2) For purposes of this paragraph—
(i) The term “a taxpayer whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting” means a taxpayer who, for Federal income tax purposes, accounts for any tax which is the subject of “any action” (as defined in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) under an accrual method of accounting. See section 446 and the regulations thereunder. If a taxpayer uses an accrual method as his overall method of accounting, it shall be presumed that he is “a taxpayer whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting.” However, if the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the district director that he has, for Federal income tax purposes, consistently accounted for such tax under the cash method of accounting, he shall be considered not to be “a taxpayer whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting.”
(ii) The time for accruing taxes shall be determined under section 461 and the regulations in this section.
(iii) The term “any action” includes the enactment or reenactment of legislation, the adoption of an ordinance, the exercise of any taxing or administrative authority, or the taking of any other step, the result of which is an acceleration of the accrual event of any tax. The term also applies to the substitution of a substantially similar tax by either the original taxing jurisdiction or a substitute jurisdiction. However, the term does not include either a judicial interpretation, or an administrative determination by the Internal Revenue Service, as to the event which fixes the accrual date for the tax.
(iv) The term “any taxing jurisdiction” includes the District of Columbia, any State, possession of the United States, city, county, municipality, school district, or other political subdivision or authority, other than the United States, which imposes, assesses, or collects a tax.
(3) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
State X imposes a tax on intangible and tangible personal property used in a trade or business conducted in the State. The tax is assessed as of July 1, and becomes a lien as of that date. As a result of administrative and judicial decisions, July 1 is recognized as the proper date on which accrual method taxpayers may accrue their personal property tax for Federal income tax purposes. In 1961 State X, by legislative action, changes the assessment and lien dates from July 1, 1962, to December 31, 1961, for the property tax year 1962. The action taken by State X is considered to be “any action” of a taxing jurisdiction which results in the time for accruing taxes being earlier than it would have been but for that action. Therefore, for purposes of the deduction allowed for such tax, the personal property tax imposed by State X, for the property tax year 1962, shall be treated as though it accrued on July 1, 1962.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that State X repeals the personal property tax and in lieu thereof enacts a franchise tax which is imposed on the privilege of conducting a trade or business within State X, and is based on the value of intangible and tangible personal property used in the trade or business. The franchise tax is to be assessed and will become a lien as of December 31, 1961, for the franchise tax year 1962, and on December 31 for all subsequent franchise tax years. Since the franchise tax is substantially similar to the former personal property tax and since the
enactment of the franchise tax has the effect of accelerating the accrual date of the personal property tax from July 1, 1962, to December 31, 1961, the action taken by State X is considered to be “any action” of a taxing jurisdiction which results in the time for accruing taxes being earlier than it would have been but for that action. Therefore, for purposes of the deduction allowed for such tax, the franchise tax imposed by State X shall be treated as though it accrued on July 1, 1962, for the franchise tax year 1962, and on July 1 for all subsequent franchise tax years.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that State X repealed the personal property tax and empowered the counties within the State to impose a personal property tax. Assuming the counties in State X subsequently imposed a personal property tax and chose December 31 of the preceding year as the assessment and lien date, the action of each of the counties would be considered to be “any action” of a taxing jurisdiction which results in the time for accruing taxes being earlier than it would have been but for that action since it is immaterial whether the original taxing jurisdiction or a substitute jurisdiction took the action.
(4) Section 461(d)(1) shall not be applicable to the extent that it would prevent the taxpayer and all other persons, including successors in interest, from ever taking into account, for Federal income tax purposes, any tax to which that section would otherwise apply. For example, assume that State Y imposes a personal property tax on tangible personal property used in a trade or business conducted in the State during a calendar year. The tax is assessed as of February 1 of the year following the personal property tax year, and becomes a lien as of that date. As a result of administrative and judicial decisions, February 1 of the following year is recognized as the proper date on which accrual method taxpayers may accrue the personal property tax for Federal income tax purposes. In 1962 State Y, by legislative action, changes the assessment and lien dates for the personal property tax year 1962 from February 1, 1963, to December 1, 1962, and to December 1 of the personal property tax year for all subsequent years. Corporation A, an accrual method taxpayer which uses the calendar year as its taxable year, pays the tax for 1962 on December 10, 1962. On December 15, 1962, the property which was taxed is completely destroyed and, on December 20, 1962, corporation A transfers all of its remaining assets to its shareholders, and is dissolved. Since corporation A is not in existence in 1963, and therefore could not take the personal property tax into account in computing its 1963 Federal income tax if February 1, 1963, is considered to be the time for accruing the tax, and no other person could ever take such tax into account in computing his Federal income tax, such tax shall be treated as accruing as of December 1, 1962. To the extent that any person other than the taxpayer may at any time take such tax into account in computing his taxable income, the provisions of section 461(d)(1) shall apply. Thus, upon the dissolution of a corporation or the termination of a partnership between the time which, but for the provisions of section 461(d)(1) and this paragraph, would be the time for accruing any tax which was the subject of “any action” (as defined in subdivision (iii) of subparagraph (2)), and the original accrual date, the corporation or the partnership would be entitled to a deduction for only that portion, if any, of such tax with respect to which it can establish, to the satisfaction of the district director, that no other taxpayer can properly take into account in computing his taxable income. However, to the extent that the corporation or partnership cannot establish, at the time of its dissolution or termination, as the case may be, that no other taxpayer would be entitled to take such tax into account in computing his taxable income, and it is subsequently determined that no other taxpayer is entitled to take such tax into account in computing his taxable income, the corporation or partnership may file a claim for refund for the year of its dissolution or termination (subject to the limitations prescribed in section 6511) and claim as a deduction therein the portion of such tax determined to be not deductible by any other taxpayer.
(5) Section 461(d) and this paragraph shall apply to taxable years ending after December 31, 1960.
(e)
Dividends or interest paid by certain savings institutions on certain deposits or withdrawable accounts
—(1)
Deduction not allowable
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph,
pursuant to section 461(e) amounts paid to, or credited to the accounts of, depositors or holders of accounts as dividends or interest on their deposits or withdrawable accounts (if such amounts paid or credited are withdrawable on demand subject only to customary notice to withdraw) by a mutual savings bank not having capital stock represented by shares, a domestic building and loan association, or a cooperative bank shall not be allowed as a deduction for the taxable year to the extent such amounts are paid or credited for periods representing more than 12 months. The provisions of section 461(e) are applicable with respect to taxable years ending after December 31, 1962. Whether amounts are paid or credited for periods representing more than 12 months depends upon all the facts and circumstances in each case. For example, payments or credits which under all the facts and circumstances are in the nature of bona fide bonus interest or dividends paid or credited because a shareholder or depositor maintained a certain balance for more than 12 months, will not be considered made for more than 12 months, providing the regular payments or credits represent a period of 12 months or less. The nonallowance of a deduction to the taxpayer under section 461(e) and this subparagraph has no effect either on the proper time for reporting dividends or interest by a depositor or holder of a withdrawable account, or on the obligation of the taxpayer to make a return setting forth, among other things, the aggregate amounts paid to a depositor or shareholder under section 6049 (relating to returns regarding payments of interest) and the regulations thereunder. With respect to a short period (a taxable year consisting of a period of less than 12 months), amounts of dividends or interest paid or credited shall not be allowed as a deduction to the extent that such amounts are paid or credited for a period representing more than the number of months in such short period. In such a case, the rules contained in section 461(e) and this paragraph apply to the short period in a manner consistent with the application of such rules to a 12-month taxable year. Subparagraph (2) of this paragraph provides rules for computing amounts not allowed in the taxable year and subparagraph (3) provides rules for determining when such amounts are allowed. See section 7701(a) (19) and (32) and the regulations thereunder for the definitions of domestic building and loan association and cooperative bank.
(ii)
Exceptions.
The rule of nonallowance set forth in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is not applicable to a taxpayer in the year in which it liquidates (other than following, or as part of, an acquisition of its assets in which the acquiring corporation, pursuant to section 381(a), takes into account certain items of the taxpayer, which for purposes of this paragraph shall be referred to as an acquisition described in section 381(a)). In addition, such rule of nonallowance is not applicable to a taxpayer which pays or credits grace interest or dividends to terminating depositors or shareholders, provided the total amount of the grace interest or dividends paid or credited during the payment or crediting period (for example, a quarterly or semiannual period) does not exceed 10 percent of the total amount of the interest or dividends paid or credited during such period, computed without regard to the grace interest or dividends. For example, providing the 10 percent limitation is met, the rule of nonallowance does not apply in a case in which a calendar year taxpayer, with regular interest payment dates of January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1, pays grace interest for the period beginning October 1 to a depositor who terminates his account on December 10.
(2)
Computation of amounts not allowed as a deduction
—(i)
Method of computation.
The amount of the dividends or interest to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies, which is not allowed as a deduction, shall be computed under the rules of this subparagraph. The amount which is not allowed as a deduction is the difference between the total amount of dividends or interest paid or credited to that class of accounts with respect to which a deduction is not allowed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph during the taxable year (or short period, if applicable) and an amount which bears the same ratio
to such total as the number 12 (or number of months in the short period) bears to the number of months with respect to which such amounts of dividends or interest are paid or credited.
(ii)
Examples.
The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X Association, a domestic building and loan association filing its return on the basis of a calendar year, regularly credits dividends on its withdrawable accounts quarterly on the first day of the quarter following the quarter with respect to which they are earned. X changes the time of crediting dividends commencing with the credit for the fourth quarter of 1964. Such credit and all subsequent credits are made on the last day of the quarter with respect to which they are earned. As a result of this change X's credits for the year 1964 are as follows:
Period with respect to which earned
Date credited in 1964
Amt.
4th quarter, 1963
Jan. 1
$250,000
1st quarter, 1964
Apr. 1
300,000
2d quarter, 1964
July 1
300,000
3d quarter, 1964
Oct. 1
300,000
4th quarter, 1964
Dec. 31
350,000
Total dividends credited
1,500,000
Since the change in the time of crediting dividends results in the crediting in 1964 of amounts of dividends representing periods totaling 15 months (October 1963 through December 1964), amounts shall not be allowed as a deduction in 1964 which are in excess of $1,200,000, which is the amount which bears the same ratio to the amounts of dividends credited during the year ($1,500,000) as the number 12 bears to the number of months (15) with respect to which such dividends are credited. Thus, $300,000 ($1,500,000 minus $1,200,000) is not allowed as a deduction in 1964.

# Example 2.
Y Association, a domestic building and loan association filing its return on the basis of a calendar year, regularly credits dividends on its withdrawable accounts on the basis of a semiannual period on March 31 and September 30 of each year. Y changes the period with respect to which credits are made from the semiannual period to the quarterly basis, commencing with the last quarter in 1964. The credit for this last quarter and all subsequent credits are made on the last day of the quarter with respect to which they are earned. As a result of this change, Y's credits for the year 1964 are as follows:
Period with respect to which earned
Date credited in 1964
Amt.
6-month period ending Mar. 31, 1964
Mar. 31
$300,000
6-month period ending Sept. 30, 1964
Sept. 30
400,000
4th quarter, 1964
Dec. 31
200,000
Total dividends credited
900,000
Since the change in the basis of crediting dividends results in a crediting in 1964 of dividends representing periods totaling 15 months (October 1963 through December 1964), amounts shall not be allowed as a deduction in 1964 which are in excess of $720,000, which is the amount which bears the same ratio to the amounts of dividends credited during the year ($900,000) as the number 12 bears to the number of months (15) with respect to which such dividends are credited. Thus, $180,000 ($900,000 minus $720,000) is not allowed as a deduction in 1964.

# Example 3.
Z Association, a domestic building and loan association regularly files its return on the basis of a fiscal year ending on the last day of February and regularly credits dividends on its withdrawable accounts quarterly on the last day of the quarter with respect to which they are earned. Z receives approval from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to change its accounting period to a calendar year and effects the change by filing a return for a short period ending on December 31, 1964. Dividend credits for the short period beginning on March 1 and ending on December 31, 1964, are as follows:
Period with respect to which earned
Date credited in 1964
Amt.
January-March 1964
Mar. 31
$250,000
April-June 1964
June 30
300,000
July-September 1964
Sept. 30
300,000
October-December 1964
Dec. 31
350,000
Total dividends credited
1,200,000
Since the change of accounting period results in amounts of dividends credited ($1,200,000) representing periods totaling 12 months (January through December 1964), and such periods represent more than the number of months (10) in the short period, an amount shall not be allowed as a deduction in such short period which is in excess of $1,000,000, which is the amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of dividends credited in the short period ($1,200,000) as the number of months (10) in the short period bears to the number of months (12) with respect to which such dividends are credited. Thus, $200,000 ($1,200,000 minus $1,000,000) is not allowed as a deduction in the short period.
(3)
When amounts allowable.
The amount of dividends or interest not allowed as a deduction under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be allowed as follows (subject to the limitation that the total of the amounts so allowed shall not exceed the amount not allowed under subparagraph (1)):
(i) Such amount shall be allowed as a deduction in a later taxable year or years subject to the limitation that, when taken together with the deductions otherwise allowable in the later taxable year or years, it does not bring the deductions for any later taxable year to a total representing a period of more than 12 months (or number of months in the short period, if applicable). However, in any event, an amount otherwise allowable under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall be allowed notwithstanding the fact that it may bring the deductions allowable to a total representing a period of more than 12 months (or number of months in the short period, if applicable).
(ii) In any case in which it is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the taxpayer does not intend to avoid taxes, one-tenth of such amount shall be allowed as a deduction in each of the 10 succeeding taxable years—
(
a
) Commencing with the taxable year for which such amount is not allowed as a deduction under subparagraph (1), or
(
b
) In the case of such amount not allowed for a taxable year ending before July 1, 1964, commencing with either the first or second taxable year after the taxable year for which such amount is not allowed as a deduction under subparagraph (1) if the taxpayer has not taken a deduction on his return, or filed a claim for credit or refund, in respect of such amount under (
a).
Normally, if the deduction not allowed under subparagraph (1) is a result of a change, not requested by the taxpayer, in the taxpayer's annual accounting period or dividend or interest payment or crediting dates solely as a consequence of a requirement of a Federal or State regulatory authority, or if the deduction is not allowed solely as a result of the taxpayer being a party to an acquisition to which section 381(a) applies, the Commissioner will permit the allowance of the amount not allowed in the manner provided in this subdivision. Nothing set forth in this subdivision shall be construed as permitting the allowance of a credit or refund for any year which is barred by the limitations on credit or refund provided by section 6511.
(iii) If the total of the amounts, if any, allowed under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph before the taxable year in which the taxpayer liquidates or otherwise ceases to engage in trade or business is less than the amount not allowed under subparagraph (1), there shall be allowed a deduction in such taxable year for the difference between the amount not allowed under subparagraph (1) and the amounts allowed, if any, as deductions under subdivisions (i) and (ii) unless the circumstances under which the taxpayer ceased to do business constitute an acquisition described in section 381(a) (relating to carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions). If the circumstances under which the taxpayer ceased to do business constitute an acquisition described in section 381(a), the acquiring corporation shall succeed to and take into account the balance of the amounts not allowed on the same basis as the taxpayer, had it not ceased to engage in business.

§ 1.461-2
Contested liabilities.
(a)
General rule
—(1)
Taxable year of deduction.
If—
(i) The taxpayer contests an asserted liability,
(ii) The taxpayer transfers money or other property to provide for the satisfaction of the asserted liability,
(iii) The contest with respect to the asserted liability exists after the time of the transfer, and
(iv) But for the fact that the asserted liability is contested, a deduction would be allowed for the taxable year of the transfer (or, in the case of an accrual method taxpayer, for an earlier
taxable year for which such amount would be accruable),
then the deduction with respect to the contested amount shall be allowed for the taxable year of the transfer.
(2)
Exception.
Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply in respect of the deduction for income, war profits, and excess profits taxes imposed by the authority of any foreign country or possession of the United States, including a tax paid in lieu of a tax on income, war profits, or excess profits otherwise generally imposed by any foreign country or by any possession of the United States.
(3)
Refunds includible in gross income.
If any portion of the contested amount which is deducted under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for the taxable year of transfer is refunded when the contest is settled, such portion is includible in gross income except as provided in § 1.111-1, relating to recovery of certain items previously deducted or credited. Such refunded amount is includible in gross income for the taxable year of receipt, or for an earlier taxable year if properly accruable for such earlier year.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
X Corporation, which uses an accrual method of accounting, in 1964 contests $20 of a $100 asserted real property tax liability but pays the entire $100 to the taxing authority. In 1968, the contest is settled and X receives a refund of $5. X deducts $100 for the taxable year 1964, and includes $5 in gross income for the taxable year 1968 (assuming § 1.111-1 does not apply to such amount). If in 1964 X pays only $80 to the taxing authority, X deducts only $80 for 1964. The result would be the same if X Corporation used the cash method of accounting.

# Example 2.
Y Corporation makes its return on the basis of a calendar year and uses an accrual method of accounting. Y's real property taxes are assessed and become a lien on December 1, but are not payable until March 1 of the following year. On December 10, 1964, Y contests $20 of the $100 asserted real property tax which was assessed and became a lien on December 1, 1964. On March 1, 1965, Y pays the entire $100 to the taxing authority. In 1968, the contest is settled and Y receives a refund of $5. Y deducts $80 for the taxable year 1964, deducts $20 for the taxable year 1965, and includes $5 in gross income for the taxable year 1968 (assuming § 1.111-1 does not apply to such amount).
(b)
Production costs
—(1)
In general; asserted liability.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the term “asserted liability” means an item with respect to which, but for the existence of any contest in respect of such item, a deduction would be allowable under an accrual method of accounting. For example, a notice of a local real estate tax assessment and a bill received for services may represent asserted liabilities.
(2)
Definition of the term “contest”.
Any contest which would prevent accrual of a liability under section 461(a) shall be considered to be a contest in determining whether the taxpayer satisfies paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. A contest arises when there is a bona fide dispute as to the proper evaluation of the law or the facts necessary to determine the existence or correctness of the amount of an asserted liability. It is not necessary to institute suit in a court of law in order to contest an asserted liability. An affirmative act denying the validity or accuracy, or both, of an asserted liability to the person who is asserting such liability, such as including a written protest with payment of the asserted liability, is sufficient to commence a contest. Thus, lodging a protest in accordance with local law is sufficient to contest an asserted liability for taxes. It is not necessary that the affirmative act denying the validity or accuracy, or both, of an asserted liability be in writing if, upon examination of all the facts and circumstances, it can be established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that a liability has been asserted and contested.
(3)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
O Corporation makes its return on the basis of a calendar year and uses an accrual method of accounting. O receives a large shipment of typewriter ribbons from S Company on January 30, 1964, which O pays for in full on February 10, 1964. Subsequent to their receipt, several of the ribbons prove defective because of inferior materials used by the manufacturer. On August 9, 1964, O orally notifies S and demands refund of the full purchase price of the ribbons. After negotiations prove futile and a written demand is rejected by S, O institutes an action for
the full purchase price. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, S has asserted a liability against O which O contests on August 9, 1964. O deducts the contested amount for 1964.
(c)
Transfer to provide for the satisfaction of an asserted liability
—(1)
In general.
(i) A taxpayer may provide for the satisfaction of an asserted liability by transferring money or other property beyond his control to—
(A) The person who is asserting the liability;
(B) An escrowee or trustee pursuant to a written agreement (among the escrowee or trustee, the taxpayer, and the person who is asserting the liability) that the money or other property be delivered in accordance with the settlement of the contest;
(C) An escrowee or trustee pursuant to an order of the United States or of any State or political subdivision thereof or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing, or of a court, that the money or other property be delivered in accordance with the settlement of the contest; or
(D) A court with jurisdiction over the contest.
(ii) In order for money or other property to be beyond the control of a taxpayer, the taxpayer must relinquish all authority over the money or other property.
(iii) The following are not transfers to provide for the satisfaction of an asserted liability—
(A) Purchasing a bond to guarantee payment of the asserted liability;
(B) An entry on the taxpayer's books of account;
(C) A transfer to an account that is within the control of the taxpayer;
(D) A transfer of any indebtedness of the taxpayer or of any promise by the taxpayer to provide services or property in the future; and
(E) A transfer to a person (other than the person asserting the liability) of any stock of the taxpayer or of any stock or indebtedness of a person related to the taxpayer (as defined in section 267(b)).
(2)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
M Corporation contests a $5,000 liability asserted against it by L Company for services rendered. To provide for the contingency that it might have to pay the liability, M establishes a separate bank account in its own name. M then transfers $5,000 from its general account to such separate account. Such transfer does not qualify as a transfer to provide for the satisfaction of an asserted liability because M has not transferred the money beyond its control.

# Example 2.
M Corporation contests a $5,000 liability asserted against it by L Company for services rendered. To provide for the contingency that it might have to pay the liability, M transfers $5,000 to an irrevocable trust pursuant to a written agreement among the trustee, M (the taxpayer), and L (the person who is asserting the liability) that the money shall be held until the contest is settled and then disbursed in accordance with the settlement. Such transfer qualifies as a transfer to provide for the satisfaction of an asserted liability.
(d)
Contest exists after transfer.
In order for a contest with respect to an asserted liability to exist after the time of transfer, such contest must be pursued subsequent to such time. Thus, the contest must have been neither settled nor abandoned at the time of the transfer. A contest may be settled by a decision, judgment, decree, or other order of any court of competent jurisdiction which has become final, or by written or oral agreement between the parties. For example, Z Corporation, which uses an accrual method of accounting, in 1964 contests a $100 asserted liability. In 1967 the contested liability is settled as being $80 which Z accrues and deducts for such year. In 1968 Z pays the $80. Section 461(f) does not apply to Z with respect to the transfer because a contest did not exist after the time of such transfer.
(e)
Deduction otherwise allowed
—(1)
In general.
The existence of the contest with respect to an asserted liability must prevent (without regard to section 461(f)) and be the only factor preventing a deduction for the taxable year of the transfer (or, in the case of an accrual method taxpayer, for an earlier taxable year for which such amount would be accruable) to provide for the satisfaction of such liability. Nothing in section 461(f) or this section shall be construed to give rise to a deduction since section 461(f) and this section relate only to the timing of deductions which are otherwise allowable under the Code.
(2)
Application of economic performance rules to transfers under section 461(f).
(i) A taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting is not allowed a deduction under section 461(f) in the taxable year of the transfer unless economic performance has occurred.
(ii) Economic performance occurs for liabilities requiring payment to another person arising out of any workers compensation act or any tort, or any other liability designated in § 1.461-4(g), as payments are made to the person to which the liability is owed. Except as provided in section 468B or the regulations thereunder, economic performance does not occur when a taxpayer transfers money or other property to a trust, an escrow account, or a court to provide for the satisfaction of an asserted workers compensation, tort, or other liability designated under § 1.461-4(g) that the taxpayer is contesting unless the trust, escrow account, or court is the person to which the liability is owed or the taxpayer's payment to the trust, escrow account, or court discharges the taxpayer's liability to the claimant. Rather, economic performance occurs in the taxable year the taxpayer transfers money or other property to the person that is asserting the workers compensation, tort, or other liability designated under § 1.461-4(g) that the taxpayer is contesting or in the taxable year that payment is made from a trust, an escrow account, or a court registry funded by the taxpayer to the person to which the liability is owed.
(3)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, an individual, makes a gift of certain property to B, an individual. A pays the entire amount of gift tax assessed against him but contests his liability for the tax. Section 275(a)(3) provides that gift taxes are not deductible. A does not satisfy the requirement of paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section because a deduction would not be allowed for the taxable year of the transfer even if A did not contest his liability to the tax.

# Example 2.
Corporation X is a defendant in a class action suit for tort liabilities. In 2002, X establishes a trust for the purpose of satisfying the asserted liability and transfers $10,000,000 to the trust. The trust does not satisfy the requirements of section 468B or the regulations thereunder. In 2004, the trustee pays $10,000,000 to the plaintiffs in settlement of the litigation. Under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, economic performance with respect to X's liability to the plaintiffs occurs in 2004. X may deduct the $10,000,000 payment to the plaintiffs in 2004.

Prepaid interest. [Reserved]
§ 1.461-4
Economic performance.
(a)
Introduction
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of determining whether an accrual basis taxpayer can treat the amount of any liability (as defined in § 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)(B)) as incurred, the all events test is not treated as met any earlier than the taxable year in which economic performance occurs with respect to the liability.
(2)
Overview.
Paragraph (b) of this section lists exceptions to the economic performance requirement. Paragraph (c) of this section provides cross-
references to the definitions of certain terms for purposes of section 461 (h) and the regulations thereunder. Paragraphs (d) through (m) of this section and § 1.461-6 provide rules for determining when economic performance occurs. Section 1.461-5 provides rules relating to an exception under which certain recurring items may be incurred for the taxable year before the year during which economic performance occurs.
(b)
Exceptions to the economic performance requirement.
Paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of § 1.461-1 provides examples of liabilities that are taken into account under rules that operate without regard to the all events test (including economic performance).
(c)
Definitions.
The following cross-references identify certain terms defined for purposes of section 461(h) and the regulations thereunder:
(1)
Liability.
See paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B)d of § 1.446-1 for the definition of “liability.”
(2)
Payment.
See paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section for the definition of “payment.”
(d)
Liabilities arising out of the provision of services, property, or the use of property
—(1)
In general.
The principles of this paragraph (d) determine when economic performance occurs with respect to liabilities arising out of the performance of services, the transfer of property, or the use of property. This paragraph (d) does not apply to liabilities described in paragraph (e) (relating to interest expense) or paragraph (g) (relating to breach of contract, workers compensation, tort, etc.) of this section. In addition, except as otherwise provided in Internal Revenue regulations, revenue procedures, or revenue rulings this paragraph (d) does not apply to amounts paid pursuant to a notional principal contract. The Commissioner may provide additional rules in regulations, revenue procedures, or revenue rulings concerning the time at which economic performance occurs for items described in this paragraph (d).
(2)
Services or property provided to the Taxpayer
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, if the liability of a taxpayer arises out of the providing of services or property to the taxpayer by another person, economic performance occurs as the services or property is provided.
(ii)
Long-term contracts.
In the case of any liability of a taxpayer described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section that is an expense attributable to a long-term contract with respect to which the taxpayer uses the percentage of completion method, economic performance occurs—
(A) As the services or property is provided; or, if earlier,
(B) As the taxpayer makes payment (as defined in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section) in satisfaction of the liability to the person providing the services or property. See paragraph (k)(2) of this section for the effective date of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii).
(iii)
Employee benefits
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in any Internal Revenue regulation, revenue procedure, or revenue ruling, the economic performance requirement is satisfied to the extent that any amount is otherwise deductible under section 404 (employer contributions to a plan of deferred compensation), section 404A (certain foreign deferred compensation plans), and section 419 (welfare benefit funds). See § 1.461-1(a)(2)(iii)(D).
(B)
Property transferred in connection with performance of services.
[Reserved]
(iv)
Cross-references.
See
Examples 4
through
6
of paragraph (d)(7) of this section. See paragraph (d)(6) of this section for rules relating to when a taxpayer may treat services or property as provided to the taxpayer.
(3)
Use of property provided to the taxpayer
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(3)d and paragraph (d)(5) of this section, if the liability of a taxpayer arises out of the use of property by the taxpayer, economic performance occurs ratably over the period of time the taxpayer is entitled to the use of the property (taking into account any reasonably expected renewal periods when necessary to carry out the purposes of section 461(h)). See
Examples 6
through
9
of paragraph (d)(7) of this section.
(ii)
Exceptions
—(A)
Volume, frequency of use, or income.
If the liability of a
taxpayer arises out of the use of property by the taxpayer and all or a portion of the liability is determined by reference to the frequency or volume of use of the property or the income from the property, economic performance occurs for the portion of the liability determined by reference to the frequency or volume of use of the property or the income from the property as the taxpayer uses the property or includes income from the property. See
Examples 8
and
9
of paragraph (d)(7) of this section. This paragraph (d)(3)(ii) shall not apply if the District Director determines, that based on the substance of the transaction, the liability of the taxpayer for use of the property is more appropriately measured ratably over the period of time the taxpayer is entitled to the use of the property.
(B)
Section 467 rental agreements.
In the case of a liability arising out of the use of property pursuant to a section 467 rental agreement, economic performance occurs as provided in § 1.461-1(a)(2)(iii)(E).
(4)
Services or property provided by the taxpayer
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, if the liability of a taxpayer requires the taxpayer to provide services or property to another person, economic performance occurs as the taxpayer incurs costs (within the meaning of § 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)) in connection with the satisfaction of the liability. See
Examples 1
through
3
of paragraph (d)(7) of this section.
(ii)
Barter transactions.
If the liability of a taxpayer requires the taxpayer to provide services, property, or the use of property, and arises out of the use of property by the taxpayer, or out of the provision of services or property to the taxpayer by another person, economic performance occurs to the extent of the lesser of—
(A) The cumulative extent to which the taxpayer incurs costs (within the meaning of § 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)) in connection with its liability to provide the services of property; or
(B) The cumulative extent to which the services or property is provided to the taxpayer.
(5)
Liabilities that are assumed in connection with the sale of a trade or business
—(i)
In general.
If, in connection with the sale or exchange of a trade or business by a taxpayer, the purchaser expressly assumes a liability arising out of the trade or business that the taxpayer but for the economic performance requirement would have been entitled to incur as of the date of the sale, economic performance with respect to that liability occurs as the amount of the liability is properly included in the amount realized on the transaction by the taxpayer. See § 1.1001-2 for rules relating to the inclusion in amount realized from a discharge of liabilities resulting from a sale or exchange.
(ii)
Trade or business.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(5), a trade or business is a specific group of activities carried on by the taxpayer for the purpose of earning income or profit if every operation that is necessary to the process of earning income or profit is included in the group. Thus, for example, the group of activities generally must include the collection of income and the payment of expenses.
(iii)
Tax avoidance.
This paragraph (d)(5) does not apply if the District Director determines that tax avoidance is one of the taxpayer's principal purposes for the sale or exchange.
(6)
Rules relating to the provision of services or property to a taxpayer.
The following rules apply for purposes of this paragraph (d):
(i) Services or property provided to a taxpayer include services or property provided to another person at the direction of the taxpayer.
(ii) A taxpayer is permitted to treat services or property as provided to the taxpayer as the taxpayer makes payment to the person providing the services or property (as defined in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section), if the taxpayer can reasonably expect the person to provide the services or property within 3
1/2
months after the date of payment.
(iii) A taxpayer is permitted to treat property as provided to the taxpayer when the property is delivered or accepted, or when title to the property passes. The method used by the taxpayer to determine when property is provided is a method of accounting that must comply with the rules of
§ 1.446-1(e). Thus, the method of determining when property is provided must be used consistently from year to year, and cannot be changed without the consent of the Commissioner.
(iv) If different services or items of property are required to be provided to a taxpayer under a single contract or agreement, economic performance generally occurs over the time each service is provided and as each item of property is provided. However, if a service or item of property to be provided to the taxpayer is incidental to other services or property to be provided under a contract or agreement, the taxpayer is not required to allocate any portion of the total contract price to the incidental service or property. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(6)(iv), services or property is treated as incidental only if—
(A) The cost of the services or property is treated on the taxpayer's books and records as part of the cost of the other services or property provided under the contract; and
(B) The aggregate cost of the services or property does not exceed 10 percent of the total contract price.
(7)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (d). For purposes of these examples, it is assumed that the requirements of the all events test other than economic performance have been met, and that the recurring item exception is not used. Assume further that the examples do not involve section 467 rental agreements and, therefore, section 467 is not applicable. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1. Services or property provided by the taxpayer.
(i) X corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, is an oil company. During March 1990, X enters into an oil and gas lease with Y. In November 1990, X installs a platform and commences drilling. The lease obligates X to remove its offshore platform and well fixtures upon abandonment of the well or termination of the lease. During 1998, X removes the platform and well fixtures at a cost of $200,000.
(ii) Under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, economic performance with respect to X's liability to remove the offshore platform and well fixtures occurs as X incurs costs in connection with that liability. X incurs these costs in 1998 as, for example, X's employees provide X with removal services (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section). Consequently, X incurs $200,000 for the 1998 taxable year. Alternatively, assume that during 1990 X pays Z $130,000 to remove the platform and fixtures, and that Z performs these removal services in 1998. Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, X does not incur this cost until Z performs the services. Thus, economic performance with respect to the $130,000 X pays Z occurs in 1998.

# Example 2. Services or property provided by the taxpayer.
(i) W corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, sells tractors under a three-year warranty that obligates W to make any reasonable repairs to each tractor it sells. During 1990, W sells ten tractors. In 1992 W repairs, at a cost of $5,000, two tractors sold during 1990.
(ii) Under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, economic performance with respect to W's liability to perform services under the warranty occurs as W incurs costs in connection with that liability. W incurs these costs in 1992 as, for example, replacement parts are provided to W (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section). Consequently, $5,000 is incurred by W for the 1992 taxable year.

# Example 3. Services or property provided by the taxpayer; Long-term contracts.
(i) W corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, manufactures machine tool equipment. In November 1992, W contracts to provide X corporation with certain equipment. The contract is not a long-term contract under section 460 or § 1.451-3. In 1992, W pays Z corporation $50,000 to lease from Z, for the one-year period beginning on January 1, 1993, testing equipment to perform quality control tests required by the agreement with X. In 1992, pursuant to the terms of a contract, W pays Y corporation $100,000 for certain parts necessary to manufacture the equipment. The parts are provided to W in 1993. W's employees provide W with services necessary to manufacture the equipment during 1993, for which W pays $150,000 in 1993.
(ii) Under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, economic performance with respect to W's liability to provide the equipment to X occurs as W incurs costs in connection with that liability. W incurs these costs during 1993, as services, property, and the use of property necessary to manufacture the equipment are provided to W (see paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section). Thus, $300,000 is incurred by W for the 1993 taxable year. See section 263A and the regulations thereunder for rules relating to the capitalization and inclusion in inventory of these incurred costs.
(iii) Alternatively, assume that the agreement with X is a long-term contract as defined in section 460(f), and that W takes into account all items with respect to such contracts under the percentage of completion method as described in section 460(b)(1). Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the $100,000 W pays in 1992 for parts is incurred
for the 1992 taxable year, for purposes of determining the percentage of completion under section 460(b)(1)(A). W's other costs under the agreement are incurred for the 1993 taxable year for this purpose.

# Example 4. Services or property provided to the taxpayers.
(i) LP1, a calendar year, accrual method limited partnership, owns the working interest in a parcel of property containing oil and gas. During December 1990, LP1 enters into a turnkey contract with Z corporation pursuant to which LP1 pays Z $200,000 and Z is required to provide a completed well by the close of 1992. In May 1992, Z commences drilling the well, and, in December 1992, the well is completed.
(ii) Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, economic performance with respect to LP1's liability for drilling and development services provided to LP1 by Z occurs as the services are provided. Consequently, $200,000 is incurred by LP1 for the 1992 taxable year.

# Example 5. Services or property provided to the taxpayer.
(i) X corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, is an automobile dealer. On Jaunary 15, 1990, X agrees to pay an additional $10 to Y, the manufacturer of the automobiles, for each automobile purchased by X from Y. Y agrees to provide advertising and promotional activities to X.
(ii) During 1990, X purchases from Y 1,000 new automobiles and pays to Y an additional $10,000 as provided in the agreement. Y, in turn, uses this $10,000 to provide advertising and promotional activities during 1992.
(iii) Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, economic performance with respect to X's liability for advertising and promotional services provided to X by Y occurs as the services are provided. Consequently, $10,000 is incurred by X for the 1992 taxable year.

# Example 6. Use of property provided to the taxpayer; services or property provided to the taxpayer.
(i) V corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, charters aircrafts. On December 20, 1990, V leases a jet aircraft from L for the four-year period that begins on January 1, 1991. The lease obligates V to pay L a base rental of $500,000 per year. In addition, the lease requires V to pay $25 to an escrow account for each hour that the aircraft is flown. The escrow account funds are held by V and are to be used by L to make necessary repairs to the aircraft. Any amount remaining in the escrow account upon termination of the lease is payable to V. During 1991, the aircraft is flown 1,000 hours and V pays $25,000 to the escrow account. The aircraft is repaired by L in 1993. In 1994, $20,000 is released from the escrow account to pay L for the repairs.
(ii) Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, economic performance with respect to V's base rental liability occurs ratably over the period of time V is entitled to use the jet aircraft. Consequently, the $500,000 rent is incurred by V for the 1991 taxable year and for each of the next three taxable years. Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, economic performance with respect to the liability to place amounts in escrow occurs as the aircraft is repaired. Consequently, V incurs $20,00 for the 1993 taxable year.

# Example 7. Use of property provided to the taxpayer.
(i) X corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, manufactures and sells electronic circuitry. On November 15, 1990, X enters into a contract with Y that entitles X to the exclusive use of a product owned by Y for the five-year period beginning on January 1, 1991. Pursuant to the contract, X pays Y $100,000 on December 30, 1990.
(ii) Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, economic performance with respect to X's liability for the use of property occurs ratably over the period of time X is entitled to use the product. Consequently, $20,000 is incurred by X for 1991 and for each of the succeeding four taxable years.

# Example 8. Use of property provided to the taxpayer.
(i) Y corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, enters into a five-year lease with Z for the use of a copy machine on July 1, 1991. Y also receives elivery of the copy machine on July 1, 1991. The lease obligates Y to pay Z a base rental payment of $6,000 per year at the beginning of each lease year and an additional charge of 5 cents per copy 30 days after the end of each lease year. The machine is used to make 50,000 copies during the first lease year: 20,000 copies in 1991 and 30,000 copies from January 1, 1992, to July 1, 1992. Y pays the $6,000 base rental payment to Z on July 1, 1991, and the $2,500 variable use payment on July 30, 1992.
(ii) under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, economic performance with respect to Y's base rental liability occurs ratably over the period of time Y is entitled to use the copy machine. Consequently, $3,000 rent is incurred by Y for the 1991 taxable year. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, economic performance with respect to Y's variable use portion of the liability occurs as Y uses the machine. Thus, the $1,000 of the $2,500 variable-use liability that relates to the 20,000 copies made in 1991 is incurred by Y for the 1991 taxable year.

# Example 9. Use of property provided to the taxpayer.
(i) X corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, enters into a five-year product distribution agreement with Y, on January 1, 1992. The agreement provides for a payment of $100,000 on January 1, 1992, plus 10 percent of the gross profits earned by X from distribution of the product. The variable income portion of X's liability is payable on April 1 of each subsequent year. On January 1, 1992, X pays Y $100,000. On April 1, 1993, X pays Y $3 million representing 10 percent of X's gross profits from January 1 through December 31, 1992.
(ii) Under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, economic performance with respect to X's $100,000 payment occurs ratably over the period of time X is entitled to use the product. Consequently, $20,000 is incurred by X for each year of the agreement beginning with 1992. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, economic performance with respect to X's variable income portion of the liability occurs as the income is earned by X. Thus, the $3 million variable-income liability is incurred by X for the 1992 taxable year.
(e)
Interest.
In the case of interest, economic performance occurs as the interest cost economically accrues, in accordance with the principles of relevant provisions of the Code.
(f)
Timing of deductions from notional principal contracts.
Economic performance on a notional principal contract occurs as provided under § 1.446-3.
(g)
Certain liabilities for which payment is economic performance
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Person to which payment must be made.
In the case of liabilities described in paragraphs (g) (2) through (7) of this section, economic performance occurs when, and to the extent that, payment is made to the person to which the liability is owed. Thus, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section and § 1.461-6, economic performance does not occur as a taxpayer makes payments in connection with such a liability to any other person, including a trust, escrow account, court-administered fund, or any similar arrangement, unless the payments constitute payment to the person to which the liability is owed under paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. Instead, economic performance occurs as payments are made from that other person or fund to the person to which the liability is owed. The amount of economic performance that occurs as payment is made from the other person or fund to the person to which the liability is owed may not exceed the amount the taxpayer transferred to the other person or fund. For special rules relating to the taxation of amounts transferred to “qualified settlement funds,” see section 468B and the regulations thereunder. The Commissioner may provide additional rules in regulations, revenue procedures, and revenue rulings concerning the time at which economic performance occurs for items described in this paragraph (g).
(ii)
Payment to person to which liability is owed.
Paragraph (d)(6) of this section provides that for purposes of paragraph (d) of this section (relating to the provision of services or property to the taxpayer) in certain cases a taxpayer may treat services or property as provided to the taxpayer as the taxpayer makes payments to the person providing the services or property. In addition, this paragraph (g) provides that in the case of certain liabilities of a taxpayer, economic performance occurs as the taxpayer makes payment to persons specified therein. For these and all other purposes of section 461(h) and the regulations thereunder:
(A)
Payment.
The term
payment
has the same meaning as is used when determining whether a taxpayer using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting has made a payment. Thus, for example, payment includes the furnishing of cash or cash equivalents and the netting of offsetting accounts. Payment does not include the furnishing of a note or other evidence of indebtedness of the taxpayer, whether or not the evidence is guaranteed by any other instrument (including a standby letter of credit) or by any third party (including a government agency). As a further example, payment does not include a promise of the taxpayer to provide services or property in the future (whether or not the promise is evidenced by a contract or other witten agreement). In addition, payment does not include an amount transferred as a loan, refundable deposit, or contingent payment.
(B)
Person to which payment is made.
Payment to a particular person is accomplished if paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(A) of this section is satisfied and a cash basis taxpayer in the position of that person would be treated as having actually or constructively received the amount of the payment as gross income under the principles of section 451 (without regard to section 104(a) or any other provision that specifically excludes the amount from gross income). Thus, for example, the purchase of an annuity contract or any other asset generally does not constitute payment to the person to which a liability is
owed unless the ownership of the contract or other asset is transferred to that person.
(C)
Liabilities that are assumed in connection with the sale of a trade or business.
Paragraph (d)(5) of this section provides rules that determine when economic performance occurs in the case of liabilities that are assumed in connection with the sale of a trade or business. The provisions of paragraph (d)(5) of this section also apply to any liability described in paragraph (g) (2) through (7) of this section that the purchaser expressly assumes in connection with the sale or exchange of a trade or business by a taxpayer, provided the taxpayer (but for the economic performance requirement) would have been entitled to incur the liability as of the date of the sale.
(iii)
Person.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), “person” has the same meaning as in section 7701(a)(1), except that it also includes any foreign state, the United States, any State or political subdivision thereof, any possession of the United States, and any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing.
(iv)
Assignments.
If a person that has a right to receive payment in satisfaction of a liability described in paragraphs (g) (2) through (7) of this section makes a valid assignment of that right to a second person, or if the right is assigned to the second person through operation of law, then payment to the second person in satisfaction of that liability constitutes payment to the person to which the liability is owed.
(2)
Liabilities arising under a workers compensation act or out of any tort, breach of contract, or violation of law.
If the liability of a taxpayer requires a payment or series of payments to another person and arises under any workers compensation act or out of any tort, breach of contract, or violation of law, economic performance occurs as payment is made to the person to which the liability is owed. See
Example 1
of paragraph (g)(8) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)—
(i) A liability to make payments for services, property, or other consideration provided under a contract is not a liability arising out of a breach of that contract unless the payments are in the nature of incidental, consequential, or liquidated damages; and
(ii) A liability arising out of a tort, breach of contract, or violation of law includes a liability arising out of the settlement of a dispute in which a tort, breach of contract, or violation of law, respectively, is alleged.
(3)
Rebates and refunds.
If the liability of a taxpayer is to pay a rebate, refund, or similar payment to another person (whether paid in property, money, or as a reduction in the price of goods or services to be provided in the future by the taxpayer), economic performance occurs as payment is made to the person to which the liability is owed. This paragraph (g)(3) applies to all rebates, refunds, and payments or transfers in the nature of a rebate or refund regardless of whether they are characterized as a deduction from gross income, an adjustment to gross receipts or total sales, or an adjustment or addition to cost of goods sold. In the case of a rebate or refund made as a reduction in the price of goods or services to be provided in the future by the taxpayer, “payment” is deemed to occur as the taxpayer would otherwise be required to recognize income resulting from a disposition at an unreduced price. See
Example 2
of paragraph (g)(8) of this section. For purposes of determining whether the recurring item exception of § 1.461-5 applies, a liability that arises out of a tort, breach of contract, or violation of law is not considered a rebate or refund.
(4)
Awards, prizes, and jackpots.
If the liability of a taxpayer is to provide an award, prize, jackpot, or other similar payment to another person, economic performance occurs as payment is made to the person to which the liability is owed. See
Examples 3
and
4
of paragraph (g)(8) of this section.
(5)
Insurance, warranty, and service contracts.
If the liability of a taxpayer arises out of the provision to the taxpayer of insurance, or a warranty or service contract, economic performance occurs as payment is made to the person to which the liability is owed. See
Examples 5
through
7
of paragraph (g)(8) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(5)—
(i) A warranty or service contract is a contract that a taxpayer enters into in connection with property bought or leased by the taxpayer, pursuant to which the other party to the contract promises to replace or repair the property under specified circumstances.
(ii) The term “insurance” has the same meaning as is used when determining the deductibility of amounts paid or incurred for insurance under section 162.
(6)
Taxes
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (g)(6), if the liability of a taxpayer is to pay a tax, economic performance occurs as the tax is paid to the governmental authority that imposed the tax. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(6), payment includes payments of estimated income tax and payments of tax where the taxpayer subsequently files a claim for credit or refund. In addition, for purposes of this paragraph (g)(6), a tax does not include a charge collected by a governmental authority for specific extraordinary services or property provided to a taxpayer by the governmental authority. Examples of such a charge include the purchase price of a parcel of land sold to a taxpayer by a governmental authority and a charge for labor engaged in by government employees to improve that parcel. In certain cases, a liability to pay a tax is permitted to be taken into account in the taxable year before the taxable year during which economic performance occurs under the recurring item exception of § 1.461-5. See
Example 8
of paragraph (g)(8) of this section.
(ii)
Licensing fees.
If the liability of a taxpayer is to pay a licensing or permit fee required by a governmental authority, economic performance occurs as the fee is paid to the governmental authority, or as payment is made to any other person at the direction of the governmental authority.
(iii)
Exceptions
—(A)
Real property taxes.
If a taxpayer has made a valid election under section 461 (c), the taxpayer's accrual for real property taxes is determined under section 461 (c). Otherwise, economic performance with respect to a property tax liability occurs as the tax is paid, as specified in paragraph (g)(6)(i) of this section.
(B)
Certain foreign taxes.
If the liability of a taxpayer is to pay an income, war profits, or excess profits tax that is imposed by the authority of any foreign country or possession of the United States and is creditable under section 901 (including a creditable tax described in section 903 that is paid in lieu of such a tax), economic performance occurs when the requirements of the all events test (as described in § 1.446-1 (c)(1)(ii)) other than economic performance are met, whether or not the taxpayer elects to credit such taxes under section 901 (a).
(7)
Other liabilities.
In the case of a taxpayer's liability for which economic perfomance rules are not provided elsewhere in this section or in any other Internal Revenue regulation, revenue ruling or revenue procedure, economic performance occurs as the taxpayer makes payments in satisfaction of the liability to the person to which the liability is owed. This paragraph (g)(7) applies only if the liability cannot properly be characterized as a liability covered by rules provided elsewhere in this section. If a liability may properly be characterized as, for example, a liability arising from the provision of services or property to, or by, a taxpayer, the determination as to when economic performance occurs with respect to that liability is made under paragraph (d) of this section and not under this paragraph (g)(7).
(8)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (g). For purposes of these examples, it is assumed that the requirements of the all events test other than economic performance have been met and, except as otherwise provided, that the recurring item exception is not used.

# Example 1. Liabilities arising out of a tort.
(i) During the period 1970 through 1975, Z corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, manufactured and distributed industrial products that contained carcinogenic substances. In 1992, a number of lawsuits are filed against Z alleging damages due to exposure to these products. In settlement of a lawsuit maintained by A, Z agrees to purchase an annuity contract that will provide annual payments to A of $50,000 for a period of 25 years. On December 15, 1992, Z
pays W, an unrelated life insurance company, $491,129 for such an annuity contract. Z retains ownership of the annuity contract.
(ii) Under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, economic performance with respect to Z's liability to A occurs as each payment is made to A. Consequently, $50,000 is incurred by Z for each taxable year that a payment is made to A under the annuity contract. (Z must also include in income a portion of amounts paid under the annuity, pursuant to section 72.) The result is the same if in 1992 Z secures its obligation with a standby letter of credit.
(iii) If Z later transfers ownership of the annuity contract to A, an amount equal to the fair market value of the annuity on the date of transfer is incurred by Z in the taxable year of the transfer (see paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(B) of this section). In addition, the transfer constitutes a transaction to which section 1001 applies.

# Example 2. Rebates and refunds.
(i) X corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, manufactures and sells hardware products. X enters into agreements that entitle each of its distributors to a rebate (or discount on future purchases) from X based on the amount of purchases made by the distributor from X during any calendar year. During the 1992 calendar year, X becomes liable to pay a $2,000 rebate to distributor A. X pays A $1,200 of the rebate on January 15, 1993, and the remaining $800 on October 15, 1993. Assume the rebate is deductible (or allowable as an adjustment to gross receipts or cost of goods sold) when incurred.
(ii) If X does not adopt the recurring item exception described in § 1.461-5 with respect to rebates and refunds, then under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, economic performance with respect to the $2,000 rebate liability occurs in 1993. However, if X has made a proper election under § 1.461-5, and as of December 31, 1992, all events have occurred that determine the fact of the rebate liability, X incurs $1,200 for the 1992 taxable year. Because economic performance (payment) with respect to the remaining $800 does not occur until October 15, 1993 (more than 8
1/2
months after the end of 1992), X cannot use the recurring item exception for this portion of the liability (see § 1.461-5). Thus, the $800 is not incurred by X until the 1993 taxable year. If, instead of making the cash payments to A during 1993, X adjusts the price of hardware purchased by A that is delivered to A during 1993, X's “payment” occurs as X would otherwise be required to recognize income resulting from a disposition at an unreduced price.

# Example 3. Awards, prizes, and jackpots.
(i) W corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, produces and sells breakfast cereal. W conducts a contest pursuant to which the winner is entitled to $10,000 per year for a period of 20 years. On December 1, 1992, A is declared the winner of the contest and is paid $10,000 by W. In addition, on December 1 of each of the next nineteen years, W pays $10,000 to A.
(ii) Under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, economic performance with respect to the $200,000 contest liability occurs as each of the $10,000 payments is made by W to A. Consequently, $10,000 is incurred by W for the 1992 taxable year and for each of the succeeding nineteen taxable years.

# Example 4. Awards, prizes, and jackpots.
(i) Y corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, owns a casino that contains progressive slot machines. A progressive slot machine provides a guaranteed jackpot amount that increases as money is gambled through the machine until the jackpot is won or until a maximum predetermined amount is reached. On July 1, 1993, the guaranteed jackpot amount on one of Y's slot machines reaches the maximum predetermined amount of $50,000. On October 1, 1994, the $50,000 jackpot is paid to B.
(ii) Under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, economic performance with respect to the $50,000 jackpot liability occurs on the date the jackpot is paid to B. Consequently, $50,000 is incurred by Y for the 1994 taxable year.

# Example 5. Insurance, warranty, and service contracts.
(i) V corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, manufactures toys. V enters into a contract with W, an unrelated insurance company, on December 15, 1992. The contract obligates V to pay W a premium of $500,000 before the end of 1995. The contract obligates W to satisfy any liability of V resulting from claims made during 1993 or 1994 against V by any third party for damages attributable to defects in toys manufactured by V. Pursuant to the contract, V pays W a premium of $500,000 on October 1, 1995.
(ii) Assuming the arrangement constitutes insurance, under paragraph (g)(5) of this section economic performance occurs as the premium is paid. Thus, $500,000 is incurred by V for the 1995 taxable year.

# Example 6. Insurance, warranty, and service contracts.
(i) Y corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, is a common carrier. On December 15, 1992, Y enters into a contract with Z, an unrelated insurance company, under which Z must satisfy any liability of Y that arises during the succeeding 5 years for damages under a workers compensation act or out of any tort, provided the event that causes the damages occurs during 1993 or 1994. Under the contract, Y pays $360,000 to Z on December 31, 1993.
(ii) Assuming the arrangement constitutes insurance, under paragraph (g)(5) of this section economic performance occurs as the
premium is paid. Consequently, $360,000 is incurred by Y for the 1993 taxable year. The period for which the $360,000 amount is permitted to be taken into account is determined under the capitalization rules because the insurance contract is an asset having a useful life extending substantially beyond the close of the taxable year.

# Example 7. Insurance, warranty, and service contracts.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 6,
except that Y is obligated to pay the first $5,000 of any damages covered by the arrangement with Z. Y is, in effect, self-insured to the extent of this $5,000 “deductible.” Thus, under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, economic performance with respect to the $5,000 liability does not occur until the amount is paid to the person to which the tort or workers compensation liability is owed.

# Example 8. Taxes.
(i) The laws of State A provide that every person owning personal property located in State A on the first day of January shall be liable for tax thereon and that a lien for the tax shall attach as of that date. In addition, the laws of State A provide that 60% of the tax is due on the first day of December following the lien date and the remaining 40% is due on the first day of July of the succeeding year. On January 1, 1992, X corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, owns personal property located in State A. State A imposes a $10,000 tax on S with respect to that property on January 1, 1992. X pays State A $6,000 of the tax on December 1, 1992, and the remaining $4,000 on July 1, 1993.
(ii) Under paragraph (g)(6) of this section, economic performance with respect to $6,000 of the tax liability occurs on December 1, 1992. Consequently, $6,000 is incurred by X for the 1992 taxable year. Economic performance with respect to the remaining $4,000 of the tax liability occurs on July 1, 1993. If X has adopted the recurring item exception described in § 1.461-5 as a method of accounting for taxes, and as of December 31, 1992, all events have occurred that determine the liability of X for the remaining $4,000, X also incurs $4,000 for the 1992 taxable year. If X does not adopt the recurring item exception method, the $4,000 is not incurred by X until the 1993 taxable year.
(h)
Liabilities arising under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.
Notwithstanding the principles of paragraph (d) of this section, economic performance with respect to the liability of an owner or generator of nuclear waste to make payments to the Department of Energy (“DOE”) pursuant to a contract required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-425, 42 U.S.C. 10101-10226 (1982)) occurs as each payment under the contract is made to DOE and not when DOE satisfies its obligations under the contract. This rule applies to the continuing fee required by 42 U.S.C. 10222(a)(2) (1982), as well as the one-time fee required by 42 U.S.C. 10222 (a)(3) (1982). For rules relating to when economic performance occurs with respect to interest, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Contingent liabilities.
[Reserved]
(k)
Special effective dates
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (k), section 461(h) and this section apply to liabilities that would, under the law in effect before the enactment of section 461(h), be allowable as a deduction or otherwise incurred after July 18, 1984. For example, the economic performance requirement applies to all liabilities arising under a workers compensation act or out of any tort that would, under the law in effect before the enactment of section 461(h), be incurred after July 18, 1984. For taxable years ending before April 7, 1995, see Q
A-2 of § 1.461-7T (as it appears in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1995), which provides an election to make this change in method of accounting applicable to either the portion of the first taxable year that occurs after July 18, 1984 (part-year change method), or the entire first taxable year ending after July 18, 1984 (full-year change method). With respect to the effective date rules for interest, section 461(h) applies to interest accruing under any obligation (whether or not evidenced by a debt instrument) if the obligation is incurred in any transaction occurring after June 8, 1984, and is not incurred under a written contract which was binding on March 1, 1984, and at all times thereafter until the obligation is incurred. Interest accruing under an obligation described in the preceding sentence is subject to section 461(h) even if the interest accrues before July 19, 1984. Similarly, interest accruing under any obligation incurred in a transaction occurring before June 9, 1984, (or under a written contract which was binding on March 1, 1984, and at all times thereafter until the obligation is incurred) is not subject to section 461(h) even to the extent the interest accrues after July 18, 1984.
(2)
Long-term contracts.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (M)(2) of this section, in the case of liabilities described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section (relating to long-term contracts), paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section applies to liabilities that would, but for the enactment of section 461(h), be allowable as a deduction or otherwise incurred for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1991.
(3)
Payment liabilities.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (m)(2) of this section, in the case of liabilities described in paragraph (g) of this section (other than liabilities arising under a workers compensation act or out of any tort described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section), paragraph (g) of this section applies to liabilities that would, but for the enactment of section 461(h), be allowable as a deduction or otherwise incurred for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1991.
(l) [Reserved]
(m)
Change in method of accounting required by this section
—(1)
In general.
For the first taxable year ending after July 18, 1984, a taxpayer is granted the consent of the Commissioner to change its method of accounting for liabilities to comply with the provisions of this section pursuant to any of the following procedures:
(i) For taxable years ending before April 7, 1995, the part-year change in method election described in Q
A-2 through Q
A-6 and Q
A-8 through Q
A-10 of § 1.461-7T (as it appears in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1995);
(ii) For taxable years ending before April 7, 1995, the full-year change in method election described in Q
A-2 through Q
A-6 and Q
A-8 through Q
A-10 of § 1.461-7T (as it appears in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1995); or
(iii) For taxable years ending before April 7, 1995, if no election is made, the cut-off method described in Q
A-1 and Q
A-11 of § 1.461-7T (as it appears in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1995).
(2)
Change in method of accounting for long-term contracts and payment liabilities
—(i)
First taxable year beginning after December 31, 1991.
For the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1991, a taxpayer is granted the consent of the Commissioner to change its method of accounting for long-term contract liabilities described in paragraph (D)(2)(ii) of this section and payment liabilities described in paragraph (g) of this section (other than liabilities arising under a workers compensation act or out of any tort described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section) to comply with the provisions of this section. The change must be made in accordance with paragraph (m)(1)(ii) or (m)(1)(iii) of this section, except the effective date is the first day of the first taxable year beginning December 31, 1991.
(ii)
Retroactive change in method of accounting for long-term contracts and payment liabilities.
For the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1989, or the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1990, a taxpayer is granted the consent of the Commissioner to change its method of accounting for long-term contract liabilities described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section and payment liabilities described in paragraph (g) of this section (other than liabilities arising under a workers compensation act or out of any tort described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section) to comply with the provisions of this section. The change must be made in accordance with paragraph (m)(1)(ii) or (m)(1)(iii) of this section, except the effective date is the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1989, or the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1990. For taxable years ending before April 7, 1995, the taxpayer may make the change in method of accounting, including a full-year change in method election under paragraph (m)(1)(ii) of this section and Q
A-5 of § 1.461-7T (as it appears in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1995), by filing an amended return for such year, provided the amended return is filed on or before October 7, 1992.
[T.D. 8408, 57 FR 12421, Apr. 10, 1992, as amended by T.D. 8491, 58 FR 53135, Oct. 14, 1993; T.D. 8593, 60 FR 18743, Apr. 13, 1995; T.D. 8820, 64 FR 26851, May 18, 1999; T.D. 8408, 69 FR 44597, July 27, 2004]
§ 1.461-5
Recurring item exception.
(a)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting may adopt the recurring item exception described in paragraph (b) of this section as method of accounting for one or more types of recurring items incurred by the taxpayer. In the case of the “other payment liabilities” described in § 1.461-4(g)(7), the Commissioner may provide for the application of the recurring item exception by regulation, revenue procedure or revenue ruling.
(b)
Requirements for use of the exception
—(1)
General rule.
Under the recurring item exception, a liability is treated as incurred for a taxable year if—
(i) As of the end of that taxable year, all events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability and the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy;
(ii) Economic performance with respect to the liability occurs on or before the earlier of—
(A) The date the taxpayer files a timely (including extensions) return for that taxable year; or
(B) The 15th day of the 9th calendar month after the close of that taxable year;
(iii) The liability is recurring in nature; and
(iv) Either—
(A) The amount of the liability is not material; or
(B) The accrual of the liability for that taxable year results in a better matching of the liability with the income to which it relates than would result from accruing the liability for the taxable year in which economic performance occurs.
(2)
Amended returns.
A taxpayer may file an amended return treating a liability as incurred under the recurring item exception for a taxable year if economic performance with respect to the liability occurs after the taxpayer files a return for that year, but within 8
1/2
months after the close of that year.
(3)
Liabilities that are recurring in nature.
A liability is recurring if it can generally be expected to be incurred from one taxable year to the next. However, a taxpayer may treat such a liability as recurring in nature even if it is not incurred by the taxpayer in each taxable year. In addition, a liability that has never previously been incurred by a taxpayer may be treated as recurring if it is reasonable to expect that the liability will be incurred on a recurring basis in the future.
(4)
Materiality requirement.
For purposes of this paragraph (b):
(i) In determining whether a liability is material, consideration shall be given to the amount of the liability in absolute terms and in relation to the amount of other items of income and expense attributable to the same activity.
(ii) A liability is material if it is material for financial statement purposes under generally acepted accounting principles.
(iii) A liability that is immaterial for financial statement purposes under generally accepted accounting principles may be material for purposes of this paragraph (b).
(5)
Matching requirement.
(i) In determining whether the matching requirement of paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(B) of this section is satisfied, generally accepted accounting principles are an important factor, but are not dispositive.
(ii) In the case of a liability described in paragraph (g)(3) (rebates and refunds), paragraph (g)(4) (awards, prizes, and jackpots), paragraph (g)(5) (insurance, warranty, and service contracts), paragraph (g)(6) (taxes), or paragraph (h) (continuing fees under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982) of § 1.461-4, the matching requirement of paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(B) of this section shall be deemed satisfied.
(c)
Types of liabilities not eligible for treatment under the recurring item exception.
The recurring item exception does not apply to any liability of a taxpayer described in paragraph (e) (interest), paragraph (g)(2) (workers compensation, tort, breach of contract, and violation of law), or paragraph (g)(7) (other liabilities) of § 1.461-4. Moreover, the recurring item exception does not apply to any liability incurred by a tax shelter, as defined in section 461(i) and § 1.448-1T(b).
(d)
Time and manner of adopting the recurring item exception
—(1)
In general.
The recurring item exception is a
method of accounting that must be consistently applied with respect to a type of item, or for all items, from one taxable year to the next in order to clearly reflect income. A taxpayer is permitted to adopt the recurring item exception as part of its method of accounting for any type of item for the first taxable year in which that type of item is incurred. Except as otherwise provided, the rules of section 446(e) and § 1.446-1(e) apply to changes to or from the recurring item exception as a method of accounting. For taxable years ending before April 7, 1995, see Q
A-7 of § 1.461-7T (as it appears in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1995) for rules concerning the time and manner of adopting the recurring item exception for taxable years that include July 19, 1984. For purposes of this section, items are to be classified by type in a manner that results in classifications that are no less inclusive than the classifications of production costs provided in the full-absorption regulations of § 1.471-11(b) and(c), whether or not the taxpayer is required to maintain inventories.
(2)
Change to the recurring item exception method for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1991
—(i)
In general.
For the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1991, a taxpayer is granted the consent of the Commissioner to change to the recurring item exception method of accounting. A taxpayer is also granted the consent of the Commissioner to expand or modify its use of the recurring item exception method for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1991. For each trade or business for which a taxpayer elects to use the recurring item exception method, the taxpayer must use the same method of change (cut-off or full-year change) it is using for that trade or business under § 1.461-4(m). For taxable year sending before April 7, 1995, see Q
A-11 of § 1.461-7T (as it appears in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1995) for an explanation of how amounts are taken into account under the cut-off method (except that, for purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), the change applies to all amounts otherwise incurred on or after the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1991). For taxable years ending before April 7, 1995, see Q
A-6 of § 1.461-7T (as it appears in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1995) for an explanation of how amounts are taken into account under the full-year change method (except that the change in method occurs on the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1991). For taxable years ending before April 7, 1995, the full-year change in method may result in a section 481(a) adjustment that must be taken into account in the manner described in Q
A-8 and Q
A-9 of § 1.461-7T (as it appears in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1995) (except that the taxable year of change is the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1991).
(ii)
Manner of changing to the recurring item exception method.
For the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1991, a taxpayer may change to the recurring item exception method by accounting for the item on its timely filed original return for such taxable year (including extensions). For taxable years ending before April 7, 1995, the automatic consent of the Commissioner is limited to those items accounted for under the recurring item exception method on the timely filed return, unless the taxpayer indicates a wider scope of change by filing the statement provided in Q
A-7(b)(2) of § 1.461-7T (as it appears in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1995).

Retroactive change to the recurring item exception method.
For the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1989, or December 31, 1990, a taxpayer is granted consent of the Commissioner to change to the recurring item exception method of accounting, provided the taxpayer complies with paragraph (d)(2) of this section on either the original return for such year or on an amended return for such year filed on or before October 7, 1991. For this purpose the effective date is the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1989, or the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1990. A taxpayer is also granted the consent of the Commissioner to expand or modify its use of the recurring item exception method for the first taxable year beginning
after December 31, 1989, December 31, 1990, or December 31, 1991.
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the principles of this section:

# Example 1. Requirements for use of the recurring item exception.
(i) Y corporation, a calendar year, accrual method taxpayer, manufactures and distributes video cassette recorders. Y timely files its federal income tax return for each taxable year on the extended due date for the return (September 15, of the following taxable year). Y offers to refund the price of a recorder to any purchaser not satisfied with the recorder. During 1992, 100 purchasers request a refund of the $500 purchase price. Y refunds $30,000 on or before September 15, 1993, and the remaining $20,000 after such date but before the end of 1993.
(ii) Under paragraph (g)(3) of § 1.461-4, economic performance with respect to $30,000 of the refund liability occurs on September 15, 1993. Assume the refund is deductible (or allowable as an adjustment to gross receipts or cost of goods sold) when incurred. If Y does not adopt the recurring item exception with respect to rebates and refunds, the $30,000 refund is incurred by Y for the 1993 taxable year. However, if Y has properly adopted the recurring item exception method of accounting under this section, and as of December 31, 1992, all events have occurred that determine the fact of the liability for the $30,000 refund, Y incurs that amount for the 1992 taxable year. Because economic performance (payment) with respect to the remaining $20,000 occurs after September 15, 1993 (more than 8
1/2
months after the end of 1992), that amount is not eligible for recurring item treatment under this section. Thus, the $20,000 amount is not incurred by Y until the 1993 taxable year.

# Example 2. Requirements for use of the recurring item exception; amended returns.
The facts are the same as in
Example 2,
except that Y files its income tax return for 1992 on March 15, 1993, and Y does not refund the price of any recorder before that date. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the refund liability is not eligible for the recurring item exception because economic performance with respect to the refund does not occur before Y files a return for the taxable year for which the item would have been incurred under the exception. However, since economic performance occurs within 8
1/2
months after 1992, Y may file an amended return claiming the $30,000 as incurred for its 1992 taxable year (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section).

§ 1.461-6
Economic performance when certain liabilities are assigned or are extinguished by the establishment of a fund.
(a)
Qualified assignments of certain personal injury liabilities under section 130.
In the case of a qualified assignment (within the meaning of section 130(c)), economic performance occurs as a taxpayer-assignor makes payments that are excludible from the income of the assignee under section 130(a).
(b)
Section 468B.
Economic performance occurs as a taxpayer makes qualified payments to a designated settlement fund under section 468B, relating to special rules for designated settlement funds.
(c)
Payments to other funds or persons that constitute economic performance.
[Reserved]
(d)
Effective dates.
The rules in paragraph (a) of this section apply to payments after July 18, 1984.
[T.D. 8408, 57 FR 12428, Apr. 10, 1992]
§ 1.465-1T
Aggregation of certain activities (temporary).
(a)
General rule.
A partner in a partnership or an S corporation shareholder may aggregate and treat as a single activity—
(1) The holding, production, or distribution of more than one motion picture film or video tape by the partnership or S corporation,
(2) The farming (as defined in section 464 (e)) of more than one farm by the partnership or S corporation,
(3) The exploration for, or exploitation of, oil and gas resources with respect to more than one oil and gas property by the partnership or S corporation, or
(4) The exploration for, or exploitation of, geothermal deposits (within the meaning of section 613(e)(3)) with respect to more than one geothermal property by the partnership or S corporation.
Thus, for example, if a partnership or S corporation is engaged in the activity of exploring for, or exploiting, oil and gas resources with respect to 10 oil and gas properties, a partner or S corporation shareholder may aggregate those properties and treat the aggregated oil and gas activities as a single activity.
If that partnership or S corporation also is engaged in the activity of farming with respect to two farms, the partner or shareholder may aggregate the farms and treat the aggregated farming activities as a single separate activity. Except as provided in section 465(c)(2)(B)(ii), the partner or shareholder cannot aggregate the farming activity with the oil and gas activity.
(b)
Effective date.
This section shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1983 and before January 1, 1985.
(Secs. 465(c)(2)(B) and 7805 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (98 Stat. 814, 68A Stat. 917; 26 U.S.C. 465(c)(2)(B) and 7805))
[T.D. 8012, 50 FR 9614, Mar. 11, 1985]
§ 1.465-8
General rules; interest other than that of a creditor.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Amounts borrowed.
This section applies to amounts borrowed for use in an activity described in section 465(c)(1) or (c)(3)(A). Amounts borrowed with respect to an activity will not increase the borrower's amount at risk in the activity if the lender has an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor or is related to a person (other than the borrower) who has an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor. This rule applies even if the borrower is personally liable for the repayment of the loan or the loan is secured by property not used in the activity. For additional rules relating to the treatment of amounts borrowed from these persons,
see
§ 1.465-20.
(2)
Certain borrowed amounts excepted.
(i) For purposes of determining a corporation's amount at risk, an interest in the corporation as a shareholder is not an interest in any activity of the corporation. Thus, amounts borrowed by a corporation from a shareholder may increase the corporation's amount at risk.
(ii) For purposes of determining a taxpayer's amount at risk in an activity of holding real property, paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to financing that is secured by real property used in the activity and is either—
(A) Qualified nonrecourse financing described in section 465(b)(6)(B); or
(B) Financing that, if it were nonrecourse, would be financing described in section 465(b)(6)(B).
(b)
Loans for which the borrower is personally liable for repayment
—(1)
General rule.
If a borrower is personally liable for the repayment of a loan for use in an activity, a person shall be considered a person with an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor only if the person has either a capital interest in the activity or an interest in the net profits of the activity.
(2)
Capital interest.
For the purposes of this section a capital interest in an activity means an interest in the assets of the activity which is distributable to the owner of the capital interest upon the liquidation of the activity. The partners of a partnership and the shareholders of an S corporation are considered to have capital interests in the activities conducted by the partnership or S corporation.
(3)
Interest in net profits.
For the purposes of this section it is not necessary for a person to have any incidents of ownership in the activity in order to have an interest in the net profits of the activity. For example, an employee or independent contractor any part of whose compensation is determined with reference to the net profits of the activity will be considered to have an interest in the net profits of the activity.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, the owner of a herd of cattle sells the herd to partnership BCD. BCD pays A $10,000 in cash and executes a note for $30,000 payable to A. Each of the three partners, B, C, and D, assumes personal liability for repayment of the amount owed A. In addition, BCD enters into an agreement with A under which A is to take care of the cattle for BCD in return for compensation equal to 6 percent of BCD's net profits from the activity. Because A has an interest in the net profits of BCD's farming activity, A is considered to have an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor. Accordingly, amounts payable to A for use in that activity do not increase the partners' amount at risk even though the partners assume personal liability for repayment.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that instead of receiving compensation equal to 6 percent of BCD's net profits from the activity, A instead receives
compensation equal to 1 percent of the gross receipts from the activity. A does not have a capital interest in BCD. A's interest in the gross receipts is not considered an interest in the net profits. Because B, C, and D assumed personal liability for the amounts payable to A, and A has neither a capital interest nor an interest in the net profits of the activity, A is not considered to have an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor with respect to the $30,000 loan. Accordingly, B, C, and D are at risk for their share of the loan if the other provisions of section 465 are met.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that instead of receiving compensation equal to 6 percent of BCD's net profits from the activity, A instead receives compensation equal to 6 percent of the net profits from the activity or $15,000, whichever is greater. A is considered to have an interest in the net profits from the activity and accordingly will be treated as a person with an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor.
(c)
Nonrecourse loans secured by assets with a readily ascertainable fair market value
—(1)
General rule.
This paragraph shall apply in the case of a nonrecourse loan for use in an activity where the loan is secured by property which has a readily ascertainable fair market value. In the case of such a loan a person shall be considered a person with an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor only if the person has either a capital interest in the activity or an interest in the net profits of the activity.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
X is an investor in an activity described in section 465(c)(1). In order to raise money for the investment, X borrows money from A, the promoter (the person who brought X together with other taxpayers for the purpose of investing in the activity). The loan is secured by stock unrelated to the activity which is listed on a national securities exchange. X's stock has a readily ascertainable fair market value. A does not have a capital interest in the activity or an interest in its net profits. Accordingly, with respect to the loan secured by X's stock, A does not have an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor.
(d)
Nonrecourse loans secured by assets without a readily ascertainable fair market value
—(1)
General rule.
This paragraph shall apply in the case of a nonrecourse loan for use in an activity where the loan is secured by property which does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value. In the case of such a loan a person shall be considered a person with an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor if the person stands to receive financial gain (other than interest) from the activity or from the sale of interests in the activity. For the purposes of this section persons who stand to receive financial gain from the activity include persons who receive compensation for services rendered in connection with the organization or operation of the activity or for the sale of interests in the activity. Such a person will generally include the promoter of the activity who organizes the activity or solicits potential investors in the activity.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph (d) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A is the promoter of an activity described in section 465(c)(1). As the promoter, A organizes the activity and solicits potential investors. For these services A is paid a flat fee of $130x. This fee is paid out of the amounts contributed by the investors to the activity. X, one of the investors in the activity, borrows money from A for use in the activity. X is not personally liable for repayment to A of the amount borrowed. As security for the loan, X pledges an asset which does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value. A is considered a person with an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor with respect to this loan because the asset pledged as security does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value, X is not personally liable for repayment of the loan, and A received financial gain from the activity. Accordingly, X's amount at risk in the activity is not increased despite the fact that property was pledged as security.
(e)
Effective date.
This section applies to amounts borrowed after May 3, 2004.
[T.D. 9124, 69 FR 24079, May 3, 2004; 69 FR 26305, May 12, 2004]
§ 1.465-20
Treatment of amounts borrowed from certain persons and amounts protected against loss.
(a)
General rule.
The following amounts are treated in the same manner as borrowed amounts for which the taxpayer has no personal liability and for which no security is pledged—
(1) Amounts that do not increase the taxpayer's amount at risk because they
are borrowed from a person who has an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor or from a person who is related to a person (other than the taxpayer) who has an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor; and
(2) Amounts (whether or not borrowed) that are protected against loss.
(b)
Interest other than that of a creditor; cross reference. See
§ 1.465-8 for additional rules relating to amounts borrowed from a person who has an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor or is related to a person (other than the taxpayer) who has an interest in the activity other than that of a creditor.
(c)
Amounts protected against loss; cross reference. See
§ 1.465-6 for rules relating to amounts protected against loss.
(d)
Effective date.
This section applies to amounts borrowed after May 3, 2004.
[T.D. 9124, 69 FR 24079, May 3, 2004]
§ 1.465-27
Qualified nonrecourse financing.
(a)
In general.
Notwithstanding any provision of section 465(b) or the regulations under section 465(b), for an activity of holding real property, a taxpayer is considered at risk for the taxpayer's share of any qualified nonrecourse financing which is secured by real property used in such activity.
(b)
Qualified nonrecourse financing secured by real property
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 465(b)(6) and this section, the term
qualified nonrecourse financing
means any financing—
(i) Which is borrowed by the taxpayer with respect to the activity of holding real property;
(ii) Which is borrowed by the taxpayer from a qualified person or represents a loan from any federal, state, or local government or instrumentality thereof, or is guaranteed by any federal, state, or local government;
(iii) For which no person is personally liable for repayment, taking into account paragraphs (b)(3), (4), and (5) of this section; and
(iv) Which is not convertible debt.
(2)
Security for qualified nonrecourse financing
—(i)
Types of property.
For a taxpayer to be considered at risk under section 465(b)(6), qualified nonrecourse financing must be secured only by real property used in the activity of holding real property. For this purpose, however, property that is incidental to the activity of holding real property will be disregarded. In addition, for this purpose, property that is neither real property used in the activity of holding real property nor incidental property will be disregarded if the aggregate gross fair market value of such property is less than 10 percent of the aggregate gross fair market value of all the property securing the financing.
(ii)
Look-through rule for partnerships.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, a borrower shall be treated as owning directly its proportional share of the assets in a partnership in which the borrower owns (directly or indirectly through a chain of partnerships) an equity interest.
(3)
Personal liability; partial liability.
If one or more persons are personally liable for repayment of a portion of a financing, the portion of the financing for which no person is personally liable may qualify as qualified nonrecourse financing.
(4)
Partnership liability.
For purposes of section 465(b)(6) and this paragraph (b), the personal liability of any partnership for repayment of a financing is disregarded and, provided the requirements contained in paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iv) of this section are satisfied, the financing will be treated as qualified nonrecourse financing secured by real property if—
(i) The only persons personally liable to repay the financing are partnerships;
(ii) Each partnership with personal liability holds only property described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section (applying the principles of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section in determining the property held by each partnership); and
(iii) In exercising its remedies to collect on the financing in a default or default-like situation, the lender may proceed only against property that is described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section and that is held by the partnership or partnerships (applying the principles of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section in determining the property held by the partnership or partnerships).
(5)
Disregarded entities.
Principles similar to those described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall apply in determining whether a financing of an entity that is disregarded for federal tax purposes under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter is treated as qualified nonrecourse financing secured by real property.
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1. Personal liability of a partnership; incidental property.
(i) X is a limited liability company that is classified as a partnership for federal tax purposes. X engages only in the activity of holding real property. In addition to real property used in the activity of holding real property, X owns office equipment, a truck, and maintenance equipment that it uses to support the activity of holding real property. X borrows $500 to use in the activity. X is personally liable on the financing, but no member of X and no other person is liable for repayment of the financing under local law. The lender may proceed against all of X's assets if X defaults on the financing.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the personal property is disregarded as incidental property used in the activity of holding real property. Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the personal liability of X for repayment of the financing is disregarded and, provided the requirements contained in paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iv) of this section are satisfied, the financing will be treated as qualified nonrecourse financing secured by real property.

# Example 2. Bifurcation of a financing.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that A, a member of X, is personally liable for repayment of $100 of the financing. If the requirements contained in paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iv) of this section are satisfied, then under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the portion of the financing for which A is not personally liable for repayment ($400) will be treated as qualified nonrecourse financing secured by real property.

# Example 3. Personal liability; tiered partnerships.
(i) UTP1 and UTP2, both limited liability companies classified as partnerships, are the only general partners in Y, a limited partnership. Y borrows $500 with respect to the activity of holding real property. The financing is a general obligation of Y. UTP1 and UTP2, therefore, are personally liable to repay the financing. Under section 752, UTP1's share of the financing is $300, and UTP2's share is $200. No person other than Y, UTP1, and UTP2 is personally liable to repay the financing. Y, UTP1, and UTP2 each hold only real property.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the personal liability of Y, UTP1, and UTP2 to repay the financing is disregarded and, provided the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iv) of this section are satisfied, UTP1's $300 share of the financing and UTP2's $200 share of the financing will be treated as qualified nonrecourse financing secured by real property.

# Example 4. Personal liability; tiered partnerships.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that Y's general partners are UTP1 and B, an individual. Because B, an individual, is also personally liable to repay the $500 financing, the entire financing fails to satisfy the requirement in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, UTP1's $300 share of the financing will not be treated as qualified nonrecourse financing secured by real property.

# Example 5. Personal liability; tiered partnerships.
The facts are the same as in
Example 3,
except that Y is a limited liability company and UTP1 and UTP2 are not personally liable for the debt. However, UTP1 and UTP2 each pledge property as security for the loan that is other than real property used in the activity of holding real property and other than property that is incidental to the activity of holding real property. The fair market value of the property pledged by UTP1 and UTP2 is greater than 10 percent of the sum of the aggregate gross fair market value of the property held by Y and the aggregate gross fair market value of the property pledged by UTP1 and UTP2. Accordingly, the financing fails to satisfy the requirement in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section by virtue of its failure to satisfy paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Therefore, the financing is not qualified nonrecourse financing secured by real property.

# Example 6. Personal liability; Disregarded entity.
(i) X is a single member limited liability company that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for federal tax purposes under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter. X owns certain real property and property that is incidental to the activity of holding the real property. X does not own any other property. For federal tax purposes, A, the sole member of X, is considered to own all of the property held by X and is engaged in the activity of holding real property through X. X borrows $500 and uses the proceeds to purchase additional real property that is used in the activity of holding real property. X is personally liable to repay the financing, but A is not personally liable for repayment of the financing under local law. The lender may proceed against all of X's assets if X defaults on the financing.
(ii) X is disregarded so that the assets and liabilities of X are treated as the assets and liabilities of A. However, A is not personally liable for the $500 liability. Provided that the requirements contained in paragraphs
(b)(1)(i), (ii), and (iv) of this section are satisfied, the financing will be treated as qualified nonrecourse financing secured by real property with respect to A.
(c)
Effective date.
This section is effective for any financing incurred on or after August 4, 1998. Taxpayers, however, may apply this section retroactively for financing incurred before August 4, 1998.
[T.D. 8777, 63 FR 41421, Aug. 4, 1998]
§ 1.466-1
Method of accounting for the redemption cost of qualified discount coupons.
(a)
Introduction.
Section 466 permits taxpayers who elect to use the method of accounting description in section 466 to deduct the redemption cost (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) of qualified discount coupons (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) outstanding at the end of the taxable year and redeemed during the redemption period (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) of this section) in addition to the redemption cost of qualified discount coupons redeemed during the taxable year which were not deducted for a prior taxable year. For the taxable year in which the taxpayer first uses this method of accounting, the taxpayer is not allowed to deduct the redemption costs of qualified discount coupons redeemed during the taxable year that would have been deductible for the prior taxable year had the taxpayer used this method of accounting for such prior year. (See paragraph (e) of this section for rules describing how this amount should be taken into account.) A taxpayer must use the accrual method of accounting for any trade or business for which an election is made under section 466. Furthermore, the taxpayer must make an election in accordance with the rules in section 466(d) and § 1.466-3 for that trade or business. The method of accounting in section 466 is applicable only to the taxpayer's redemption of qualified discount coupons. Section 466 does not apply to trading stamps or premium coupons, which are subject to the method of accounting in § 1.451-4, or to discount coupons that are not qualified discount coupons.
(b)
Redemption costs
—(1)
Costs deductible under section 466.
The deduction allowed by section 466 applies only to the redemption cost of qualified discount coupons. The term “redemption cost” means an amount equal to:
(i) The lesser of:
(A) The amount of the discount stated on the coupon, or
(B) The cost incurred by the taxpayer for paying the discount; plus
(ii) The amount payable to the retailer (or other person redeeming the coupon from the person receiving the price discount) for services in redeeming the coupon.
The amount payable to the retailer or other person for services in redeeming the coupon is allowed only if the amount payable is stated on the coupon.
(2)
Costs not deductible under section 466.
The term “redemption cost” includes only the amounts stated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Amounts other than those mentioned in paragraph (b)(1) of this section cannot be deducted under the method of accounting described in section 466 even though such amounts are incurred in relation to the redemption of qualified discount coupons. Therefore, those amounts must be taken into account as if section 466 did not apply. Examples of such amounts are fees paid to the redemption center or clearinghouse and amounts payable to the retailer in excess of the amount stated on the coupon.
(c)
Qualified discount coupons
—(1)
General rule.
In order for a discount coupon (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) to be considered a qualified discount coupon, all of the following requirements must be met:
(i) The coupon must have been issued by and must be redeemable by the taxpayer;
(ii) The coupon must allow a discount on the purchase price of merchandise or other tangible personal property;
(iii) The face amount of the coupon must not exceed five dollars;
(iv) The coupon, by its terms, may not be used with other coupons to bring about a price discount reimbursable by the issuer of more than five dollars with respect to any item; and
(v) There must exist a redemption chain (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)
of this section) with respect to the coupon.
(2)
Definitions
—(i)
Discount coupon.
A discount coupon is a sales promotion device used to encourage the purchase of a specific product by allowing a purchaser of that product to receive a discount on its purchase price. The term “discount coupon” does not include trading stamps or premium coupons, which are subject to the method of accounting in § 1.451-4. A discount coupon may or may not be issued as part of a prior purchase. A discount coupon normally entitles its holders to receive nothing more than a reduction in the sales price of one of the issuer's products. The discount may be stated in terms of a cash amount, a percentage or fraction of the purchase price, a “two for the price of one” deal, or any other similar provision. A discount coupon need not be printed on paper in the form usually associated with coupons; it may be a token or other object so long as it functions as a coupon.
(ii)
Redemption chain.
A redemption chain exists when the issuer redeems the coupon from some person other than the customer who used the coupon to receive the price discount. Thus, in order to be treated as a qualified discount coupon, the coupon must not be issued by the person that initially redeems the coupon from the customer. For purposes of determining whether a redemption chain exists, corporations that are members of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in section 1563(a)) as the issuer of the coupon shall be treated as the issuer. Thus, if the issuer of the coupon and the retailer that initially redeems the coupon from the customer are members of the same controlled group of corporations, the coupon shall not be treated as a qualified discount coupon.
(d)
Deduction for coupons redeemed during the redemption period
—(1)
General rule.
Two special conditions must be met before the cost of redeeming qualified discount coupons during the redemption period can be deducted from the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year preceding the redemption period. First, the qualified discount coupons must have been outstanding at the close of such taxable year. Second, the qualified discount coupons must have been received by the taxpayer before the close of the redemption period for that taxable year.
(2)
Redemption period.
The taxpayer can select any redemption period so long as the period does not extend longer than 6 months after the close of the taxapayer's taxable year. A change in the redemption period so selected shall be treated as a change in method of accounting.
(3)
Coupons received.
The deduction provided for in section 466(a)(1) is limited to the redemption costs associated with coupons that are actually received by the taxpayer within the redemption period. For purposes of this paragraph, if the issuer uses a redemption agent or clearinghouse to group, count, and verify coupons after they have been redeemed by a retailer, the coupons received by the redemption agent or clearinghouse will be
considered to have been received by the issuer. Nothing in section 466, however, allows deductions to be made on the basis of estimated redemptions, whether such estimates are made by either the issuer or some other party.
(e)
Transitional adjustment
—(1)
In general.
An election to change from some other method of accounting for the redemption of discount coupons to the method of accounting described in section 466 is a change in method of accounting that requires a transitional adjustment. Unless the taxpayer can qualify for a waiver of the suspense account requirement as provided for in section 373(c) of the Revenue Act of 1978 (92 Stat. 2865), the taxpayer should compute the transitional adjustment described in section 481(a)(2) according to the rules contained in this section. This adjustment should be taken into account according to the special rules in subsections (e) and (f) of section 466.
(2)
Net increase in taxable income.
In the case of a transitional adjustment that would result in a net increase in taxable income under section 481(a)(2) for the year of change, that increase should be taken into income over a ten-year period consisting of the year of change and the immediately succeeding nine taxable years. For example, assume that A, a calendar year taxpayer, makes an election to use the
method of accounting described in section 466 for the year 1980 and for subsequent years. Assume further that the amount of the transitional adjustment computed under section 481(a)(2) would result in a net increase in taxable income of $100 for 1980. Under these facts, A should increase taxable income for 1980 and each of the next nine taxable years by $10.
(3)
Suspense account
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a transitional adjustment that would result in a net decrease in taxable income under section 481(a)(2) for the year of change, in lieu of applying section 481, the taxpayer must establish a separate suspense account for each trade or business for which the taxpayer has made an election to use section 466. The computation of the initial opening balance in the suspense account is described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. An initial adjustment to gross income for the year of election is described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. Annual adjustments to the suspense account are described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, and gross income adjustments are described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section. Examples are provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. The effect of the suspense account is to defer some part of, or all of, the deduction of the transitional adjustment until the taxpayer no longer redeems discount coupons in connection with the trade or business to which the suspense account relates.
(ii)
Establishing a suspense account
—(A)
Initial opening balance.
To compute the initial opening balance of the suspense account for the first taxable year for which the election to use section 466 is effective, the taxpayer must determine the dollar amount of the deduction that would have been allowed for qualified discount coupon redemption costs during the redemption period for each of the three immediately preceding taxable years had the election to use section 466 been in effect for those years. The initial opening balance of the suspense account is the largest such dollar amount reduced by the sum of the adjustments attributable to the change in method of accounting that increase income for the year of change.
(B)
Initial year adjustment.
If, in computing the initial opening balance, the largest dollar amount of deduction that would have been allowed in any of the three prior years exceeds the actual cost of redeeming qualified discount coupons received during the redemption period following the close of the year immediately preceding the year of election, the excess is included in income in the year of election. Section 481(b) does not apply to this increase in gross income.
(iii)
Annual adjustments
—(A)
Adjustment to the suspense account.
Adjustments are made to the suspense account each year to account for fluctuations in coupon redemptions. To compute the annual adjustment, the taxpayer must determine the amount to be deducted under section 466(a)(1) for the taxable year. If the amount is less than the opening balance in the suspense account for the taxable year, the balance in the suspense account is reduced by the difference. Conversely, if such amount is greater than the opening balance in the suspense account for the taxable year, the account is increased by the difference (but not to an amount in excess of the initial opening balance described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section). Therefore, the balance in the suspense account will never be greater than the initial opening balance in the suspense account determined in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. However, the balance in the suspense account after adjustments may be less than this initial opening balance in the suspense account.
(B)
Gross income adjustments.
Adjustments to the suspense account for years subsequent to the year of the election also produce adjustments in the taxpayer's gross income. Adjustments which reduce the balance in the suspense account reduce gross income for the year in which the adjustment to the suspense account is made. Adjustments which increase the balance in the suspense account increase gross income for the year in which the adjustment to the suspense account is made.
(4)
Examples.
(i) The provisions of paragraph (e)(3) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Assume that the issuer of qualified discount coupons makes a timely election under section 466 for its taxable year ending December 31, 1979, and does not select a coupon redemption period shorter than the statutory period of 6 months. Assume further that the taxpayer's qualified discount coupon redemption costs in the first 6 months of 1977, 1978, and 1979 were $7, $13, and $8 respectively, and that the accounting change adjustments that increase income for 1979 are $10. Since the accounting change adjustment that increases income for 1979, ($10), is greater than the taxpayer's discount coupon redemptions during the first 6 months of 1979 ($8), the net section 481(a)(2) adjustment for the year of change results in a positive adjustment. Because of this, a suspense account is not required. The taxpayer should instead follow the rules in section 466(f) and in paragraph (e)(2) of this section in order to take this positive transitional adjustment into account.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the sum of the accounting change adjustments that increase income for 1979 is equal to $2. Under these facts the initial opening balance in the suspense account on January 1, 1979 would be $11 (that is, the largest dollar amount of qualified coupon redemption costs in the pertinent years ($13), reduced by the sum of the accounting change adjustments that increase income in the year of change ($2)). Since the coupon redemption costs taken into account in determining the initial opening balance ($13 in 1979) exceed the actual redemption costs in the first 6 months of the taxable year for which the election is first effective ($8 in 1979), the excess of $5 is added to gross income for the year of election (1979).

# Example 3.
Assume, in addition to the facts of Example 2, that coupon redemption costs during the redemption period for the 1979 taxable year are $7. Since the qualifying redemption costs ($7) during the redemption period for the taxable year are less than the opening balance in the suspense account ($11) the taxpayer must reduce the suspense account balance by the difference ($4). The taxpayer is also allowed to take a deduction equal to the amount of this adjustment to the suspense account. Thus, the net amount deductible for the 1979 taxable year after taking into account the coupon redemptions during the redemption period, the amount deductible because of the decrease in the suspense account, and the initial year adjustment determined in Example 2 is $6 ($7 + $4−$5).

# Example 4.
Assume, in addition to the facts of Example 3, that coupon redemption costs during the redemption period for the 1980 taxable year are $10. Since the qualifying redemption costs during the redemption period for the taxable year ($10) exceed the opening balance of the suspense account at the beginning of the taxable year ($7), the suspense account must be increased by the difference ($3). The taxpayer must also include $3 in gross income for the taxable year. Thus, the net amount deductible for the 1980 taxable year is $7 ($10−$3).

# Example 5.
Assume, in addition to the facts of Example 4, that coupon redemption costs during the redemption period for the 1981 taxable year are $12. Since the qualifying redemption costs for the 1961 taxable year ($12) exceed the opening balance of the suspense account at the beginning of the taxable year ($10), the suspense account must be increased by the difference ($2) but not above the initial opening balance ($11). Thus, the taxpayer will increase the balance by $1. The taxpayer must also include $1 in gross income for the taxable year. Thus, the net amount deductible for the 1981 taxable year is $11 ($12−$1).

Subchapter C transactions
—(1)
General rule.
If a transfer of substantially all the assets of a trade or business in which discount coupons are redeemed is made to an acquiring corporation, and if the acquiring corporation determines its bases in these assets, in whole or part, with reference to the basis of these assets in the hands of the transferor, then for the purposes of section 466(e) the principles of section 381 and § 1.381(c)(4)-1 will apply. The application of this rule is not limited to the transactions described in section 381(a). Thus, the rule also applies, for example, to transactions described in section 351.
(2)
Special rules.
If, in the case of a transaction described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, an acquiring corporation acquires assets that were used in a trade or business that was not subject to a section 466 election from a transferor that is owned or controlled directly (or indirectly through a chain of corporations) by the same interests, and if the acquiring corporation uses the acquired assets in a trade or business for which the acquiring corporation later makes an election to use section 466, then the acquiring corporation must establish a suspense account by taking into account not only its own experience but also the transferor's experience when the transferor held the assets in its trade or business. Furthermore, the transferor is not allowed a deduction for qualified discount coupons redeemed after the date of the transfer attributable to discount coupons issued by the transferor before the date of the transfer. Such redemptions shall be considered to be made by the acquiring corporation.
(3)
Example.
The provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Corporation S, a calendar year taxpayer, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Corporation P, a calendar year taxpayer. On December 31, 1982, S acquires from P sustantially all of the assets used in a trade or business in which qualified disount coupons are redeemed. P had not made an election under section 466 with respect to the redemption costs of the qualified discount coupons issued in connection with that trade or business. S makes an election to use section 466 for its taxable year ending December 31, 1983, for the trade or business in which the acquired assets are used, and selects a redemption period of 6 months. Assume that P's qualified discount coupon redemption costs in the first 6 months of 1981 and 1982 were $120 and $140 respectively. Assume further that S's qualified discount coupon redemption costs in the first 6 months of 1983 were $130, and that there are no accounting change adjustments that increase income with respect to the election. S must establish a suspense account by taking into account the largest dollar amount of deductions that would have been allowed under section 466(a)(1) for the 3 immediately preceding taxable years of P, including both P's and S's experience with respect to costs actually incurred during the redemption periods relating to those years. Thus, the initial opening balance of S's suspense account is $140. S must also make an initial year adjustment of $10 ($140-$130), which S must include in income for S's taxable year ending December 31, 1983. P may not take a deduction for the qualified coupon redemptions made after December 31, 1982, that are attributable to coupons issued by P before December 31, 1982. Thus, none of the $130 qualified discount coupon redemption costs incurred by S during the first six months of 1983 may be deducted by P.

§ 1.466-2
Special protective election for certain taxpayers.
(a)
General rule.
Section 373(c) of the Revenue Act of 1978 (92 Stat. 2865) allows certain taxpayers, who in prior years have accounted for discount coupons under a method of accounting reasonably similar to the method described in § 1.451-4, to elect to treat that method of accounting as a proper one for those prior years. There are
several differences between this protective election and the section 466(d) election. First, the protective election applies only to a single continuous period of taxable years the last year of which ends before January 1, 1979. Second, an otherwise qualifying protective election may apply to coupons which are discount coupons but which would not be treated as qualified discount coupons under Code section 466. Third, certain expenses such as the cost of redemption center service fees, and amounts that are payable to the retailer (or other person redeeming the coupons from the person receiving the price discount) for services in redeeming the coupons but that are not stated on the coupon, can be subtracted from gross receipts for prior years covered by a protective election (if treated as deductible under the accounting method for such years), even though such expenses would not be deductible under Code section 466.
(b)
Requirements.
In order to qualify for this special protective election, the following conditions must be met:
(1) For a continuous period of one or more prior taxable years, (the last year of which ends before Jan. 1, 1979), the taxpayer must have used a method of accounting for discount coupons that is reasonably similar to the method provided in § 1.451-4 or its predecessors under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954;
(2) The taxpayer must make an election under section 466 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 according to the rules contained in § 1.466-3 for its first taxable year ending after December 31, 1978; and
(3) The taxpayer must make an election under section 373(c) of the Revenue Act of 1978 according to the rules contained in § 1.466-4 for its first taxable year ending after December 31, 1978.
(c)
Amount to be subtracted from gross receipts.
The amount the taxpayer may subtract under this section for the redemption costs of coupons shall include only:
(1) Costs of the type permitted by § 1.451-4 to be included in the estimated average cost of redeeming coupons, plus
(2) Any amount designated or referred to on the coupon payable by the taxpayer to the person who allowed the discount on a sale by such person to the user of the coupon.
Nothing in this paragraph shall allow an item to be deducted more than once.
(d)
Right to amend prior tax returns.
This paragraph applies only to those taxpayers who have agreed in a prior year to discontinue the use of the method of accounting described in § 1.451-4 for discount coupon redemptions. If the taxpayer used such method of accounting on the original return filed for the prior taxable year, and if any such year is not closed under the statute of limitations or by reason of a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service, a taxpayer who has made a protective election may file an amended return and a claim for refund for such years. In this amended return, the taxpayer should account for its discount coupon redemptions, according to the method of accounting described in § 1.451-4. This is not to be construed, however, to abrogate in any way the rules regarding the close of taxable years due to the statute of limitations or a binding closing agreement between the Internal Revenue Service and the taxpayer.
(e)
Suspense account not required.
If the following three conditions are satisfied, the taxpayer need not establish the suspense account otherwise required by section 466(e). First, the taxpayer must make a timely election under these rules to protect prior years. Second, the method of accounting used in those years must have been used for all discount coupons issued by the taxpayer in those years in all the taxpayer's separate trades or
businesses in which coupons were issued. Third, either before or after an amendment to the taxpayer's tax returns as described in paragraph (d) of this section, a method of accounting reasonably similar to the method of accounting described in § 1.451-4 must have been used for the taxable year ending on or before December 31, 1978. If these conditions are met, the taxpayer will treat the election of the method under section 466 as a change in method of accounting to which the
rules in section 481 and the regulations thereunder apply.
(f)
Definition: reasonably similar.
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1) and (e) of this section, a taxpayer will be considered to have used a method of accounting for discount coupons that is “reasonably similar” to the method of accounting provided in § 1.451-4 if the taxpayer followed the method of accounting described in § 1.451-4 as if that method were a valid method of accounting for discount coupon redemptions.
[T.D. 8022, 50 FR 18476, May 1, 1985]
§ 1.466-3
Manner of and time for making election under section 466.
(a)
In general.
Section 466 provides a special method of accounting for accrual basis taxpayers who issue qualified discount coupons (as defined in section 466(b)). In order to use the special method under section 466, a taxpayer must make an election with respect to the trade or business in connection with which the qualified discount coupons are issued. If a taxpayer issues qualified discount coupons in connection with more than one trade or business, the taxpayer may use the special method of accounting under section 466 only with respect to the qualified discount coupons issued in connection with a trade or business for which an election is made. The election must be made in the manner prescribed in this section. The election does not require the prior consent of the Internal Revenue Service. An election under section 466 is effective for the taxable year for which it is made and for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer secures the prior consent of the Internal Revenue Service to revoke such election.
(b)
Manner of and time for making election
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an election is made under section 466 and this section by filing a statement of election containing the information described in paragraph (c) of this section with the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxpayer's first taxable year for which the election is made. The election must be made not later than the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the income tax return for the first taxable year for which the election is made. Thus, the election may not be made for a taxable year by filing an amended income tax return after the time prescribed (including extensions) for filing the original return for such year.
(2)
Transitional rule.
If the last day of the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing a taxpayer's income tax return for the taxpayer's first taxable year ending after December 31, 1978, falls before December 3, 1979, and the taxpayer does not make an election under section 466 with respect to such taxable year in the manner prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an election is made under section 466 and this section with respect to such taxable year if—
(i) Within the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the taxpayer's income tax return for such taxable year, the taxpayer has made a reasonable effort to notify the Commissioner of the taxpayer's intent to make an election under section 466 with respect to such taxable year, and
(ii) Before January 2, 1980, the taxpayer files a statement of election
containing the information described in paragraph (c) of this section to be associated with the taxpayer's income tax return for such taxable year.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, a reasonable effort to notify the Commissioner of an intent to make an election under section 466 with respect to a taxable year includes the timely filing of an income tax return for such taxable year if the taxable income reported on the return reflects a deduction for the redemption costs of qualified discount coupons as determined under section 466(a).
(c)
Required information.
The statement of election required by paragraph (b) of this section must indicate that the taxpayer (identified by name, address, and taxpayer identification number) is making an election under section 466 and must set forth the following information:
(1) A description of each trade or business for which the election is made;
(2) The first taxable year for which the election is made;
(3) The redemption period (as defined in section 466(c)(2)) for each trade or business for which the election is made;
(4) If the taxpayer is required to establish a suspense account under section 466(e) for a trade or business for which the election is made, the initial opening balance of such account (as defined in section 466(e)(2)) for each such trade or business; and
(5) In the case of an election under section 466 that results in a net increase in taxable income under section 481(a)(2), the amount of such net increase.
The statement of election should be made on a Form 3115, which need contain no information other than that required by this paragraph or paragraph (c) of § 1.466-4.
[T.D. 8022, 50 FR 18477, May 1, 1985]
§ 1.466-4
Manner of and time for making election under section 373(c) of the Revenue Act of 1978.
(a)
In general.
Section 373(c)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1978 (92 Stat. 2865) provides an election for taxpayers who satisfy the requirements of section 373(c)(2)(A) (i) and (ii) of the Act. The election is made with respect to a method of accounting for the redemption costs of discount coupons used by the electing taxpayer in a continuous period of one or more taxable years ending before January 1, 1979. The election must be made in the manner prescribed by this section. The election does not require the prior consent of the Internal Revenue Service.
(b)
Manner of and time for making election
—(1)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the election under section 373(c) of the Revenue Act of 1978 is made by filing a statement of election containing the information described in paragraph (c) of this section with the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxpayer's first taxable year ending after December 31, 1978. The election must be made not later than the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the income tax return for the taxpayer's first taxable year ending after December 31, 1978. Thus, the election may not be made with an amended income tax return for such year filed after the time prescribed (including extensions) for filing the original return.
(2)
Transitional rule.
If the last day of the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing a taxpayer's income tax return for the taxpayer's first taxable year ending after December 31, 1978, falls before December 3, 1979, and the taxpayer does not make an election in the manner prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an election is made under section 373(c) of the Act and this section with respect to a continuous period if—
(i) Within the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxpayer's first taxable year ending after December 31, 1978, the taxpayer has made a reasonable effort to notify the Commissioner of the taxpayer's intent to make election under section 373(c) of the Act with respect to the continuous period, and
(ii) Before January 2, 1980, the taxpayer files a statement of election containing the information described in paragraph (c) of this section to be associated with the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxpayer's first taxable year ending after December 31, 1978.
(c)
Required information.
The statement of election required by paragraph (b) of this section must indicate that the taxpayer (identified by name, address, and taxpayer identification number) is making an election under section 373(c) of the Revenue Act of 1978 and must set forth the taxable years in the continuous period for which the election is made. The statement of election should be made on the same form 3115 on which the taxpayer has made a statement of election under section 466. The Form 3115 need contain no information other than that required by this paragraph or paragraph (c) of § 1466-3.

§ 1.467-1
Treatment of lessors and lessees generally.
(a)
Overview
—(1)
In general.
When applicable, section 467 requires a lessor and lessee of tangible property to treat rents consistently and to use the accrual method of accounting (and time value of money principles) regardless of their overall method of accounting. In addition, in certain cases involving tax avoidance, the lessor and lessee must take rent and stated or imputed interest into account under a constant rental accrual method, pursuant to which the rent is treated as accruing ratably over the entire lease term.
(2)
Cases in which rules are inapplicable.
Section 467 applies only to leases (or other similar arrangements) that constitute section 467 rental agreements as defined in paragraph (c) of this section. For example, a rental agreement is not a section 467 rental agreement, and, therefore, is not subject to the provisions of this section and §§ 1.467-2 through 1.467-9 (the section 467 regulations), if it specifies equal amounts of rent for each month throughout the lease term and all payments of rent are due in the calendar year to which the rent relates (or in the preceding or succeeding calendar year). In addition, the section 467 regulations do not apply to a rental agreement that requires total rents of $250,000 or less. For purposes of determining whether the agreement has total rents of $250,000 or less, certain specified contingent rent is disregarded.
(3)
Summary of rules
—(i)
Basic rules.
Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for determining whether a rental agreement is a section 467 rental agreement. Paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section provide rules for determining the amount of rent and interest, respectively, required to be taken into account by a lessor and lessee under a section 467 rental agreement. Paragraphs (f) through (h) and (j) of this section provide various definitions and special rules relating to the application of the section 467 regulations. Paragraph (i) of this section is reserved.
(ii)
Special rules.
Section 1.467-2 provides rules for section 467 rental agreements that have deferred or prepaid rents without providing for adequate interest. Section 1.467-3 provides rules for application of the constant rental accrual method, including criteria for determining whether an agreement is subject to this method. Section 1.467-4 provides rules for establishing and adjusting a section 467 loan (the amount that a lessor is deemed to have loaned to the lessee, or vice versa, pursuant to the application of the section 467 regulations). Section 1.467-5 provides rules for applying the section 467 regulations where a rental agreement requires payments of interest at a variable rate. Section 1.467-6, relating to the treatment of certain section 467 rental agreements with contingent payments, is reserved. Section 1.467-7 provides rules for the treatment of dispositions by a lessor of property subject to a section 467 rental agreement and the treatment of assignments by lessees and certain lessee-financed renewals of a section 467 rental agreement. Section 1.467-7 also provides rules for the treatment of modified rental agreements. Section 1.467-8 provides special transitional rules relating to the method of
accounting for certain rental agreements entered into on or before May 18, 1999. Finally, § 1.467-9 provides the effective date rules for the section 467 regulations.
(4)
Scope of rules.
No inference should be drawn from any provision of this section or §§ 1.467-2 through 1.467-9 concerning whether—
(i) For Federal tax purposes, an arrangement constitutes a lease; or
(ii) For Federal tax purposes, any obligation of the lessee under a rental agreement is treated as rent.
(5)
Application of other authorities.
Notwithstanding section 467 and the regulations thereunder, other authorities such as section 446(b) clear-reflection-of-income principles, section 482, and the substance-over-form doctrine, may be applied by the Commissioner to determine the income and expense from a rental agreement (including the proper allocation of fixed rent under a rental agreement).
(b)
Method of accounting for section 467 rental agreements.
If a rental agreement is a section 467 rental agreement, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, the lessor and lessee must each take into account for any taxable year the sum of—
(1) The section 467 rent for the taxable year (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section); and
(2) The section 467 interest for the taxable year (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section).
(c)
Section 467 rental agreements
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the term
section 467 rental agreement
means a rental agreement, as defined in paragraph (h)(12) of this section, that has increasing or decreasing rents (as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section), or deferred or prepaid rents (as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section).
(2)
Increasing or decreasing rent
—(i)
Fixed rent
—(A)
In general.
A rental agreement has increasing or decreasing rent if the annualized fixed rent, as described in paragraph (j)(3) of this section, allocated to any rental period exceeds the annualized fixed rent allocated to any other rental period in the lease term.
(B)
Certain rent holidays disregarded.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, a rental agreement does not have increasing or decreasing rent if the increasing or decreasing rent is solely attributable to a rent holiday provision allowing reduced rent (or no rent) for a period of three months or less at the beginning of the lease term.
(ii)
Fixed rent allocated to a rental period
—(A)
Specific allocation
—(
1
)
In general.
If a rental agreement provides a specific allocation of fixed rent, as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section, the amount of fixed rent allocated to each rental period during the lease term is the amount of fixed rent allocated to that period by the rental agreement.
(
2
)
Rental agreements specifically allocating fixed rent.
A rental agreement specifically allocates fixed rent if the rental agreement unambiguously specifies, for periods no longer than a year, a fixed amount of rent for which the lessee becomes liable on account of the use of the property during that period, and the total amount of fixed rent specified is equal to the total amount of fixed rent payable under the lease. For example, a rental agreement providing that rent is $100,000 per calendar year, and providing for total payments of fixed rent equal to the total amount specified, specifically allocates rent. A rental agreement stating only when rent is payable does not specifically allocate rent.
(B)
No specific allocation.
If a rental agreement does not provide a specific allocation of fixed rent (for example, because the total amount of fixed rent specified is not equal to the total amount of fixed rent payable under the lease), the amount of fixed rent allocated to a rental period is the amount of fixed rent payable during that rental period. If an amount of fixed rent is payable before the beginning of the lease term, it is allocated to the first rental period in the lease term. If an amount of fixed rent is payable after the end of the lease term, it is allocated to the last rental period in the lease term.
(iii)
Contingent rent
—(A)
In general.
A rental agreement has increasing or decreasing rent if it requires (or may require) the payment of contingent rent (as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this section), other than contingent rent described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
(B)
Certain contingent rent disregarded.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), rent is disregarded to the extent it is contingent as the result of one or more of the following provisions—
(
1
) A qualified percentage rents provision, as defined in paragraph (h)(8) of this section;
(
2
) An adjustment based on a reasonable price index, as defined in paragraph (h)(10) of this section;
(
3
) A provision requiring the lessee to pay third-party costs, as defined in paragraph (h)(15) of this section;
(
4
) A provision requiring the payment of late payment charges, as defined in paragraph (h)(4) of this section;
(
5
) A loss payment provision, as defined in paragraph (h)(7) of this section;
(
6
) A qualified TRAC provision, as defined in paragraph (h)(9) of this section;
(
7
) A residual condition provision, as defined in paragraph (h)(13) of this section;
(
8
) A tax indemnity provision, as defined in paragraph (h)(14) of this section;
(
9
) A variable interest rate provision, as defined in paragraph (h)(16) of this section; or
(
10
) Any other provision provided in regulations or other published guidance issued by the Commissioner, but only if the provision is designated as contingent rent to be disregarded for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii).
(3)
Deferred or prepaid rent
—(i)
Deferred rent.
A rental agreement has deferred rent under this paragraph (c)(3) if the cumulative amount of rent allocated as of the close of a calendar year (determined under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section) exceeds the cumulative amount of rent payable as of the close of the succeeding calendar year.
(ii)
Prepaid rent.
A rental agreement has prepaid rent under this paragraph (c)(3) if the cumulative amount of rent payable as of the close of a calendar year exceeds the cumulative amount of rent allocated as of the close of the succeeding calendar year (determined under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section).
(iii)
Rent allocated to a calendar year.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3), the rent allocated to a calendar year is the sum of—
(A) The fixed rent allocated to any rental period (determined under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) that begins and ends in the calendar year;
(B) A ratable portion of the fixed rent allocated to any other rental period that begins or ends in the calendar year; and (C) Any contingent rent that accrues during the calendar year.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(3):

# Example 1.
(i) A and B enter into a rental agreement that provides for the lease of property to begin on January 1, 2000, and end on December 31, 2003. The rental agreement provides that rent of $100,000 accrues during each year of the lease term. Under the rental agreement, no rent is payable during calendar year 2000, a payment of $100,000 is to be made on December 31, 2001, and December 31, 2002, and a payment of $200,000 is to be made on December 31, 2003. A and B both select the calendar year as their rental period. Thus, the amount of rent allocated to each rental period under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section is $100,000. Therefore, the rental agreement does not have increasing or decreasing rent as described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(ii) Under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, a rental agreement has deferred rent if, at the close of a calendar year, the cumulative amount of rent allocated under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section exceeds the cumulative amount of rent payable as of the close of the succeeding year. In this example, there is no deferred rent: the rent allocated to 2000 ($100,000) does not exceed the cumulative rent payable as of December 31, 2001 ($100,000); the rent allocated to 2001 and preceding years ($200,000) does not exceed the cumulative rent payable as of December 31, 2002 ($200,000); the rent allocated to 2002 and preceding years ($300,000) does not exceed the cumulative rent payable as of December 31, 2003 ($400,000); and the rent allocated to 2003 and preceding years ($400,000) does not exceed the cumulative rent payable as of December 31, 2004 ($400,000). Therefore, because the rental agreement does not have increasing or decreasing rent and does not have deferred or prepaid rent, the rental agreement is not a section 467 rental agreement.

# Example 2.
(i) A and B enter into a rental agreement that provides for a 10-year lease
of personal property, beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2009. The rental agreement provides for accruals of rent of $10,000 during each month of the lease term. Under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, $120,000 is allocated to each calendar year. The rental agreement provides for a $1,200,000 payment on December 31, 2000.
(ii) The rental agreement does not have increasing or decreasing rent as described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. The rental agreement, however, provides prepaid rent under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section because the cumulative amount of rent payable as of the close of a calendar year exceeds the cumulative amount of rent allocated as of the close of the succeeding calendar year. For example, the cumulative amount of rent payable as of the close of 2000 ($1,200,000 is payable on December 31, 2000) exceeds the cumulative amount of rent allocated as of the close of 2001, the succeeding calendar year ($240,000). Accordingly, the rental agreement is a section 467 rental agreement.
(4)
Rental agreements involving total payments of $250,000 or less
—(i)
In general.
A rental agreement is not a section 467 rental agreement if, as of the agreement date (as defined in paragraph (h)(1) of this section), it is not reasonably expected that the sum of the aggregate amount of rental payments under the rental agreement and the aggregate value of all other consideration to be received for the use of property (taking into account any payments of contingent rent, and any other contingent consideration) will exceed $250,000.
(ii)
Special rules in computing amount described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section of this section.
The following rules apply in determining the amount described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section:
(A) Stated interest on deferred rent is not taken into account. However, the Commissioner may recharacterize a portion of stated interest as additional rent if a rental agreement provides for interest on deferred rent at a rate that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances, is clearly greater than the arm's-length rate of interest that would have been charged in a lending transaction between the lessor and lessee.
(B) Consideration that does not involve a cash payment is taken into account at its fair market value. A liability that is either assumed or secured by property acquired subject to the liability is taken into account at the sum of its remaining principal amount and accrued interest (if any) thereon or, in the case of an obligation originally issued at a discount, at the sum of its adjusted issue price and accrued qualified stated interest (if any), within the meaning of § 1.1273-1(c)(1).
(C) All rental agreements that are part of the same transaction or a series of related transactions involving the same lessee (or any related person) and the same lessor (or any related person) are treated as a single rental agreement. Whether two or more rental agreements are part of the same transaction or a series of related transactions depends on all the facts and circumstances.
(D) If an agreement includes a provision increasing or decreasing rent payable solely as a result of an adjustment based on a reasonable price index, the amount described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section must be determined as if the applicable price index did not change during the lease term.
(E) If an agreement includes a variable interest rate provision (as defined in paragraph (h)(16) of this section), the amount described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section must be determined by using fixed rate substitutes (determined in the same manner as under § 1.1275-5(e), treating the agreement date as the issue date) for the variable rates of interest applicable to the lessor's indebtedness.
(F) Contingent rent described in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(B)(
3
) through (
8
) of this section is not taken into account.
(d)
Section 467 rent
—(1)
In general.
The section 467 rent for a taxable year is the sum of—
(i) The fixed rent for any rental period (determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) that begins and ends in the taxable year;
(ii) A ratable portion of the fixed rent for any other rental period beginning or ending in the taxable year; and
(iii) In the case of a section 467 rental agreement that provides for contingent rent, the contingent rent that accrues during the taxable year.
(2)
Fixed rent for a rental period
—(i)
Constant rental accrual.
In the case of a
section 467 rental agreement that is a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement (as described in § 1.467-3(b)), the fixed rent for a rental period is the constant rental amount (as determined under § 1.467-3(d)).
(ii)
Proportional rental accrual.
In the case of a section 467 rental agreement that is not described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, and does not provide adequate interest on fixed rent (as determined under § 1.467-2(b)), the fixed rent for a rental period is the proportional rental amount (as determined under § 1.467-2(c)).
(iii)
Section 467 rental agreement accrual.
In the case of a section 467 rental agreement that is not described in either paragraph (d)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, the fixed rent for a rental period is the amount of fixed rent allocated to the rental period under the rental agreement, as determined under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
(e)
Section 467 interest
—(1)
In general.
The section 467 interest for a taxable year is the sum of—
(i) The interest on fixed rent for any rental period that begins and ends in the taxable year;
(ii) A ratable portion of the interest on fixed rent for any other rental period beginning or ending in the taxable year; and
(iii) In the case of a section 467 rental agreement that provides for contingent rent, any interest that accrues on the contingent rent during the taxable year.
(2)
Interest on fixed rent for a rental period
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section and § 1.467-5(b)(1)(ii), the interest on fixed rent for a rental period is equal to the product of—
(A) The principal balance of the section 467 loan (as described in § 1.467-4(b)) at the beginning of the rental period; and
(B) The yield of the section 467 loan (as described in § 1.467-4(c)).
(ii)
Section 467 rental agreements with adequate interest.
Except in the case of a section 467 rental agreement that is a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement, if a section 467 rental agreement provides adequate interest under § 1.467-2(b)(1)(i) (agreements with no deferred or prepaid rent) or § 1.467-2(b)(1)(ii) (agreements with adequate interest stated at a single fixed rate), the interest on fixed rent for a rental period is the amount of interest provided in the rental agreement for the period.
(3)
Treatment of interest.
If the section 467 interest for a rental period is a positive amount, the lessor has interest income and the lessee has an interest expense. If the section 467 interest for a rental period is a negative amount, the lessee has interest income and the lessor has an interest expense. Section 467 interest is treated as interest for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.
(f)
Substantial modification of a rental agreement
—(1)
Treatment as new agreement
—(i)
In general.
If a substantial modification of a rental agreement occurs after June 3, 1996, the post-modification agreement is treated as a new agreement and the date on which the modification occurs is treated as the agreement date in applying section 467 and the regulations thereunder to the post-modification agreement. Thus, for example, the post-modification agreement is treated as a new agreement entered into on the date the modification occurs for purposes of determining whether it is a section 467 rental agreement under this section, whether it is a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement under § 1.467-3, and whether it is entered into after the applicable effective date in § 1.467-9.
(ii)
Limitation.
In the case of a substantial modification of a rental agreement occurring on or before May 18, 1999, this paragraph (f) applies only if—
(A) The rental agreement was a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement before the modification and the agreement date, determined without regard to the modification, is after June 3, 1996; or
(B) The post-modification agreement would, after application of the rules in this paragraph (f) (other than the special rule for disqualified agreements in paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section), be a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement.
(2)
Post-modification agreement; in general.
For purposes of determining whether a post-modification agreement is a section 467 rental agreement or a
disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the terms of the post-modification agreement are, except as provided in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, only those terms that provide for rights and obligations relating to post-modification items (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(5)(iv) of this section).
(3)
Other effects of a modification.
For rules relating to amounts that must be taken into account following certain modifications, see § 1.467-7(g).
(4)
Special rules
—(i)
Carryover of character; leasebacks.
If an agreement is a leaseback prior to its modification and the lessee prior to the modification (or a related person) is the lessee after the modification, the post-modification agreement is a leaseback even if the post-modification lessee did not have an interest in the property at any time during the two-year period ending on the date on which the modification occurs.
(ii)
Carryover of character; long-term agreements.
If an agreement is a long-term agreement prior to its modification and the entire agreement (as modified) would be a long-term agreement, the post-modification agreement is a long-term agreement.
(iii)
Carryover of character; disqualified agreements.
If an agreement (as in effect before its modification) is a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement as the result of a determination (whether occurring before or after the modification) under § 1.467-3(b)(1)(ii) and the post-modification agreement is a section 467 rental agreement (or the entire agreement (as modified) would be a section 467 rental agreement), the post-modification agreement will, notwithstanding its treatment as a new agreement under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, be subject to constant rental accrual unless the Commissioner determines that, because of the absence of tax avoidance potential, the post-modification agreement should not be treated as a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement.
(iv)
Allocation of rent.
If the entire agreement (as modified) provides a specific allocation of fixed rent, as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section, the post-modification agreement is treated as an agreement that provides a specific allocation of fixed rent. If the entire agreement (as modified) does not provide a specific allocation of fixed rent, the fixed rent allocated to rental periods during the lease term of the post-modification agreement is determined by applying the rules of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section to the entire agreement (as modified).
(v)
Difference between aggregate rent and interest and aggregate payments
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(v)(B) of this section, a post-modification agreement described in paragraph (f)(4)(v)(C) of this section is treated as a section 467 rental agreement subject to proportional rental accrual (determined under § 1.467-2(c)).
(B)
Constant rental accrual prior to the modification.
A post-modification agreement described in paragraph (f)(4)(v)(C) of this section is treated as a section 467 rental agreement subject to constant rental accrual if—
(
1
) Constant rental accrual is required under paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section; or
(
2
) The post-modification agreement involves total payments of more than $250,000 (as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section), and the Commissioner determines that the post-modification agreement is a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement.
(C)
Agreements described in this paragraph
(f)(4)(v)(C). A post-modification agreement is described in this paragraph (f)(4)(v)(C) if the aggregate amount of fixed rent and stated interest treated as post-modification items does not equal the aggregate amount of payments treated as post-modification items.
(vi)
Principal purpose of tax avoidance.
If a principal purpose of a substantial modification is to avoid the purpose or intent of section 467 or the regulations thereunder, the Commissioner may treat the entire agreement (as modified) as a single agreement for purposes of section 467 and the regulations thereunder.
(5)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this paragraph (f) and § 1.467-7(g):
(i) A
modification
of a rental agreement is any alteration, including any
deletion or addition, in whole or in part, of a legal right or obligation of the lessor or lessee thereunder, whether the alteration is evidenced by an express agreement (oral or written), conduct of the parties, or otherwise.
(ii) A modification is
substantial
only if, based on all of the facts and circumstances, the legal rights or obligations that are altered and the degree to which they are altered are economically substantial. A modification of a rental agreement will not be treated as substantial solely because it is not described in paragraph (f)(6) of this section.
(iii) A modification
occurs
on the earlier of the first date on which there is a binding contract that substantially sets forth the terms of the modification or the date on which agreement to such terms is otherwise evidenced.
(iv)
Post-modification items
with respect to any modification of a rental agreement are all items (other than pre-modification items) provided under the terms of the entire agreement (as modified).
(v)
Pre-modification items
with respect to any modification of a rental agreement are pre-modification rent, interest thereon, and payments allocable thereto (whether payable before or after the modification.) For this purpose—
(A) Pre-modification rent is rent allocable to periods before the effective date of the modification, but only to the extent such rent is payable under the entire agreement (as modified) at the time such rent was due under the agreement in effect before the modification; and
(B) Pre-modification items are identified by applying payments, in the order payable under the entire agreement (as modified) unless the agreement specifies otherwise, to rent and interest thereon in the order in which amounts accrue.
(vi) The
entire agreement (as modified)
with respect to any modification is the agreement consisting of pre-modification terms providing for rights and obligations that are not affected by the modification and post-modification terms providing for rights and obligations that differ from the rights and obligations under the agreement in effect before the modification. For example, if a 10-year rental agreement that provides for rent of $25,000 per year is modified at the end of the 5th year to provide for rent of $30,000 per year in subsequent years, the entire agreement (as modified) provides for a 10-year lease term and provides for rent of $25,000 per year in years 1 through 5 and rent of $30,000 per year in years 6 through 10. The result would be the same if the modification provided for both the increase in rent and the substitution of a new lessee.
(6)
Safe harbors.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f)(5) of this section, a modification of a rental agreement is not a substantial modification if the modification occurs solely as the result of one or more of the following—
(i) The refinancing of any indebtedness incurred by the lessor to acquire the property subject to the rental agreement and secured by such property (or any refinancing thereof) but only if all of the following conditions are met—
(A) Neither the amount, nor the time for payment, of the principal amount of the new indebtedness differs from the amount and time for payment of the remaining principal amount of the refinanced indebtedness, except for de minimis changes;
(B) For each of the remaining rental periods, the rent allocation schedule, the payments of rent and interest, and the amount accrued under section 467 are changed only to the extent necessary to take into account the change in financing costs, and such changes are made pursuant to the terms of the rental agreement in effect before the modification;
(C) The lessor and the lessee are not related persons to each other or to any lender to the lessor with respect to the property (whether under the refinanced indebtedness or the new indebtedness); and
(D) With respect to the indebtedness being refinanced, the lessor was granted a unilateral option (within the meaning of § 1.1001-3(c)(3)) by the creditor to repay the refinanced indebtedness, exercisable with or without the lessee's consent;
(ii) A change in the obligation of the lessee to make any of the contingent payments described in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii)(B)(
3
) through (
8
) of this section; or
(iii) A change in the amount of fixed rent allocated to a rental period that, when combined with all previous changes in the amount of fixed rent allocated to the rental period, does not exceed one percent of the fixed rent allocated to that rental period prior to the modification.
(7)
Special rules for certain transfers
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), a substitution of a new lessee or a sale, exchange, or other disposition by a lessor of property subject to a rental agreement will not, by itself, be treated as a substantial modification unless a principal purpose of the transaction giving rise to the modification is the avoidance of Federal income tax. In determining whether a principal purpose of the transaction giving rise to the modification is the avoidance of Federal income tax—
(A) The safe harbors and other principles of § 1.467-3(c) are taken into account; and
(B) The Commissioner may treat the post-modification agreement as a new agreement or treat the entire agreement (as modified) as a single agreement.
(ii)
Exception.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section, the continuing lessor and the new lessee (in the case of a substitution of a new lessee) or the new lessor and the continuing lessee (in the case of a sale, exchange, or other disposition by a lessor of property subject to a rental agreement) may, in appropriate cases, request the Commissioner to treat the transaction as if it were a substantial modification in order to have the provisions of paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section and § 1.467-7(g)(1) apply to the transaction.
(g)
Treatment of amounts payable by lessor to lessee
—(1)
Interest.
For purposes of determining present value, any amounts payable by the lessor to the lessee as interest on prepaid rent are treated as negative amounts.
(2)
Other amounts.
[Reserved]
(h)
Meaning of terms.
The following meanings apply for purposes of this section and §§ 1.467-2 through 1.467-9:
(1)
Agreement date
means the earlier of the lease date or the first date on which there is a binding written contract that substantially sets forth the terms under which the property will be leased.
(2)
Contingent rent
means any rent that is not fixed rent, including any amount reflecting an adjustment based on a reasonable price index (as defined in paragraph (h)(10) of this section) or a variable interest rate provision (as defined in paragraph (h)(16) of this section).
(3)
Fixed rent
means any rent to the extent its amount and the time at which it is required to be paid are fixed and determinable under the terms of the rental agreement as of the lease date. The following rules apply for the purpose of determining the extent to which rent is fixed rent:
(i) The possibility of a breach, default, or other early termination of the rental agreement and any adjustments based on a reasonable price index or a variable interest rate provision are disregarded.
(ii) Rent will not fail to be treated as fixed rent merely because of the possibility of impairment by insolvency, bankruptcy, or other similar circumstances.
(iii) If the lease term (as defined in paragraph (h)(6) of this section) includes one or more periods as to which either the lessor or the lessee has an option to renew or extend the term of the agreement, rent will not fail to be treated as fixed rent merely because the option has not been exercised.
(iv) If the lease term includes one or more periods during which a substitute lessee or lessor may have use of the property, rent will not fail to be treated as fixed rent merely because the contingencies relating to the obligation of the lessee (or a related person) to make payments in the nature of rent have not occurred.
(v) If either the lessor or the lessee has an unconditional option or options, exercisable on one or more dates during the lease term, that, if exercised, require payments of rent to be made under an alternative payment schedule
or schedules, the amount of fixed rent and the dates on which such rent is required to be paid are determined on the basis of the payment schedule that, as of the agreement date, is most likely to occur. If payments of rent are made under an alternative payment schedule that differs from the payment schedule assumed in applying the preceding sentence, then, for purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, the rental agreement is treated as having been modified at the time the option to make payments on such alternative schedule is exercised.
(4)
Late payment charge
means any amount required to be paid by the lessee to the lessor as additional compensation for the lessee's failure to make any payment of rent under a rental agreement when due.
(5)
Lease date
means the date on which the lessee first has the right to use of the property that is the subject of the rental agreement.
(6)
Lease term
means the period during which the lessee has use of the property subject to the rental agreement, including any option of the lessor to renew or extend the term of the agreement. An option of the lessee to renew or extend the term of the agreement is included in the lease term only if it is expected, as of the agreement date, that the option will be exercised. For this purpose, a lessee is generally expected to exercise an option if, for example, as of the agreement date the rent for the option period is less than the expected fair market value rental for such period. The lessor's or lessee's determination that an option period is either included in or excluded from the lease term is not binding on the Commissioner. If the lessee (or a related person) agrees that one or both of them will or could be obligated to make payments in the nature of rent (within the meaning of § 1.168(i)-2(b)(2)) for a period when another lessee (the substitute lessee) or the lessor will have use of the property subject to the rental agreement, the Commissioner may, in appropriate cases, treat the period when the substitute lessee or lessor will have use of the property as part of the lease term. See § 1.467-7(f) for special rules applicable to the lessee, substitute lessee, and lessor. This paragraph (h)(6) applies to section 467 rental agreements entered into after March 6, 2001. However, taxpayers may choose to apply this paragraph (h)(6) to any rental agreement that is described in § 1.467-9(a) and is entered into on or before March 6, 2001.
(7) A
loss payment provision
means a provision that requires the lessee to pay the lessor a sum of money (which may be either a stipulated amount or an amount determined by reference to a formula or other objective measure) if the property subject to the rental agreement is lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed, or otherwise rendered unsuitable for any use (other than for scrap purposes).
(8) A
qualified percentage rents provision
means a provision pursuant to which the rent is equal to a fixed percentage of the lessee's receipts or sales (whether or not receipts or sales are adjusted for returned merchandise or Federal, state, or local sales taxes), but only if the percentage does not vary throughout the lease term. A provision will not fail to be treated as a qualified percentage rents provision solely by reason of one or more of the following additional terms:
(i) Differing percentages of receipts or sales apply to different departments or separate floors of a retail store, but only if the percentage applicable to a particular department or floor does not vary throughout the lease term.
(ii) The percentage is applied to receipts or sales in excess of determinable dollar amounts, but only if the determinable dollar amounts are fixed and do not vary throughout the lease term.
(9) A
qualified TRAC provision
means a terminal rental adjustment clause (as defined in section 7701(h)(3)) contained in a qualified motor vehicle operating agreement (as defined in section 7701(h)(2)), but only if the adjustment to the rental price is based on a reasonable estimate, determined as of any date between the agreement date and the lease date (or, in the event the agreement date is the same as or later than the lease date, determined as of the agreement date), of the fair market value of the motor vehicle (including any trailer) at the end of the lease term.
(10) An adjustment is
based on a reasonable price index
if the adjustment reflects inflation or deflation occurring over a period during the lease term and is determined consistently under a generally recognized index for measuring inflation or deflation (for example, the non-seasonally adjusted U.S. City Average All Items Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), which is published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor). An adjustment will not fail to be treated as one that is based on a reasonable price index merely because the adjustment may be limited to a fixed percentage, but only if the parties reasonably expect, as of any date between the agreement date and the lease date (or, in the event the agreement date is the same as the lease date, as of such date), that the fixed percentage will actually limit the amount of the rent payable during less than 50 percent of the lease term.
(11) For purposes of determining whether a section 467 rental agreement is a leaseback within the meaning of § 1.467-3(b)(2), two persons are
related persons
if they are related persons within the meaning of section 465(b)(3)(C). In all other cases, two persons are
related persons
if they either have a relationship to each other that is specified in section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1) or are related entities within the meaning of sections 168(h)(4)(A), (B), or (C).
(12)
Rental agreement
includes any agreement, whether written or oral, that provides for the use of tangible property and is treated as a lease for Federal income tax purposes.
(13) A
residual condition provision
means a provision in a rental agreement that requires a payment to be made by either the lessor or the lessee to the other party based on the difference between the actual condition of the property subject to the agreement, determined as of the expiration of the lease term, and the expected condition of the property at the expiration of the lease term, as set forth in the rental agreement. The amount of any such payment may be determined by reference to any objective measure relating to the use or condition of the property, such as miles, hours or other duration of use, units of production, or similar measure. A provision will be treated as a residual condition provision only if the payment represents compensation for the use of, or wear and tear on, the property in excess of, or below, a standard set forth in the rental agreement, and the standard is reasonably expected, as of any date between the agreement date and the lease date (or, in the event the agreement date is the same as or later than the lease date, as of the agreement date), to be met at the expiration of the lease term.
(14) A
tax indemnity provision
means a provision in a rental agreement that may require the lessee to make one or more payments to the lessor in the event that the Federal, foreign, state, or local income tax consequences actually realized by a lessor from owning the property subject to the rental agreement and leasing it to the lessee differ from the consequences reasonably expected by the lessor, but only if the differences in such consequences result from a misrepresentation, act, or failure to act on the part of the lessee, or any other factor not within the control of the lessor or any related person.
(15)
Third-party costs
include any real estate taxes, insurance premiums, maintenance costs, and any other costs (excluding a debt service cost) that relate to the leased property and are not within the control of the lessor or lessee or any person related to the lessor or lessee.
(16) A
variable interest rate provision
means a provision in a rental agreement that requires the rent payable by the lessee to the lessor to be adjusted by the dollar amount of changes in the amount of interest payable by the lessor on any indebtedness that was incurred to acquire the property subject to the rental agreement (or any refinancing thereof), but—
(i) Only to the extent the changes are attributable to changes in the interest rate; and
(ii) Only if the indebtedness provides for interest at one or more qualified floating rates (within the meaning of § 1.1275-5(b)), or the changes are attributable to a refinancing at a fixed rate or one or more qualified floating rates.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Computational rules.
For purposes of this section and §§ 1.467-2 through 1.467-9, the following rules apply—
(1)
Counting conventions.
Any reasonable counting convention may be used (for example, 30 days per month/360 days per year) to determine the length of a rental period or to perform any computation. Rental periods of the same descriptive length, for example annual, semiannual, quarterly, or monthly, may be treated as being of equal length.
(2)
Conventions regarding timing of rent and payments
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of determining present values and yield only, except as otherwise provided in this section and §§ 1.467-2 through 1.467-8—
(A) The rent allocated to a rental period is taken into account on the last day of the rental period;
(B) Any amount payable during the first half of the first rental period is treated as payable on the first day of that rental period;
(C) Any amount payable during the first half of any other rental period is treated as payable on the last day of the preceding rental period;
(D) Any amount payable during the second half of a rental period is treated as payable on the last day of the rental period; and
(E) Any amount payable at the midpoint of a rental period is treated, in applying this paragraph (j)(2), as an amount payable during the first half of the rental period.
(ii)
Time amount is payable.
For purposes of this section and §§ 1.467-2 through 1.467-9, an amount is payable on the last day for timely payment (that is, the last day such amount may be paid without incurring interest, computed at an arm's-length rate, a substantial penalty, or other substantial detriment (such as giving the lessor the right to terminate the agreement, bring an action to enforce payment, or exercise other similar remedies under the terms of the agreement or applicable law)). This paragraph (j)(2)(ii) applies to section 467 rental agreements entered into after March 6, 2001. However, taxpayers may choose to apply this paragraph (j)(2)(ii) to any rental agreement that is described in § 1.467-9(a) and is entered into on or before March 6, 2001.
(3)
Annualized fixed rent.
Annualized fixed rent is determined by multiplying the fixed rent allocated to the rental period under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section by the number of periods of the rental period's length in a calendar year. Thus, if the fixed rent allocated to a rental period is $10,000 and the rental period is one month, the annualized fixed rent for that rental period is $120,000 ($10,000 times 12).
(4)
Allocation of fixed rent within a period.
A rental agreement that allocates fixed rent to any period is treated as allocating fixed rent ratably within that period. Thus, if a rental agreement provides that $120,000 is allocated to each calendar year in the lease term, $10,000 of rent is allocated to each calendar month.
(5)
Rental period length.
Except as provided in § 1.467-3(d)(1) (relating to agreements for which constant rental accrual is required), rental periods may be of any length, may vary in length, and may be different as between the lessor and the lessee as long as—
(i) The rental periods are one year or less, cover the entire lease term, and do not overlap;
(ii) Each scheduled payment under the rental agreement (other than a payment scheduled to occur before or after the lease term) occurs within 30 days of the beginning or end of a rental period; and
(iii) In the case of a rental agreement that does not provide a specific allocation of fixed rent, the rental periods selected do not cause the agreement to be treated as a section 467 rental agreement unless all alternative rental period schedules would result in such treatment.
[T.D. 8820, 64 FR 26853, May 18, 1999, as amended by T.D. 8917, 66 FR 1039, Jan. 5, 2001]
§ 1.467-2
Rent accrual for section 467 rental agreements without adequate interest.
(a)
Section 467 rental agreements for which proportional rental accrual is required.
Under § 1.467-1(d)(2)(ii), the fixed rent for each rental period is the proportional rental amount, computed under paragraph (c) of this section, if—
(1) The section 467 rental agreement is not a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement under § 1.467-3(b); and
(2) The section 467 rental agreement does not provide adequate interest on fixed rent under paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Adequate interest on fixed rent
—(1)
In general.
A section 467 rental agreement provides adequate interest on fixed rent if, disregarding any contingent rent—
(i) The rental agreement has no deferred or prepaid rent as described in § 1.467-1(c)(3);
(ii) The rental agreement has deferred or prepaid rent, and—
(A) The rental agreement provides interest (the stated rate of interest) on deferred or prepaid fixed rent at a single fixed rate (as defined in § 1.1273-1(c)(1)(iii));
(B) The stated rate of interest on fixed rent is no lower than 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate (as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section);
(C) The amount of deferred or prepaid fixed rent on which interest is charged is adjusted at least annually to reflect the amount of deferred or prepaid fixed rent as of a date no earlier than the date of the preceding adjustment and no later than the date of the succeeding adjustment; and
(D) The rental agreement requires interest to be paid or compounded at least annually;
(iii) The rental agreement provides for deferred rent but no prepaid rent, and the sum of the present values (within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section) of all amounts payable by the lessee as fixed rent (and interest, if any, thereon) is equal to or greater than the sum of the present values of the fixed rent allocated to each rental period; or
(iv) The rental agreement provides for prepaid rent but no deferred rent, and the sum of the present values of all amounts payable by the lessee as fixed rent, plus the sum of the negative present values of all amounts payable by the lessor as interest, if any, on prepaid fixed rent, is equal to or less than the sum of the present values of the fixed rent allocated to each rental period.
(2)
Section 467 rental agreements that provide for a variable rate of interest.
For purposes of the adequate interest test under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if a section 467 rental agreement provides for variable interest, the rental agreement is treated as providing for fixed rates of interest on deferred or prepaid fixed rent equal to the fixed rate substitutes (determined in the same manner as under § 1.1275-5(e), treating the agreement date as the issue date) for the variable rates called for by the rental agreement. For purposes of this section, a rental agreement provides for variable interest if all stated interest provided by the agreement is paid or compounded at least annually at a rate or rates that meet the requirements of § 1.1275-5(a)(3)(i)(A) or (B) and (a)(4).
(3)
Agreements with both deferred and prepaid rent.
If an agreement has both deferred and prepaid rent, the agreement provides adequate interest under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section are met for both the prepaid and the deferred rent. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), an agreement will be considered to meet the condition set forth in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section if the agreement provides a single fixed rate of interest on the deferred rent and a single fixed rate of interest on the prepaid rent, even if those rates are not the same. This paragraph (b)(3) applies to section 467 rental agreements entered into after March 6, 2001. However, taxpayers may choose to apply this paragraph (b)(3) to any rental agreement that is described in § 1.467-9(a) and is entered into on or before March 6, 2001.
(c)
Computation of proportional rental amount
—(1)
In general.
The proportional rental amount for a rental period is the amount of fixed rent allocated to the rental period under § 1.467-1(c)(2)(ii), multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the sum of the present values of the amounts payable under the terms of the section 467 rental agreement as fixed rent and interest thereon. The denominator of the fraction is the sum of the present values of the fixed rent allocated to each
rental period under the rental agreement.
(2)
Section 467 rental agreements that provide for a variable rate of interest.
To calculate the proportional rental amount for a section 467 rental agreement that provides for a variable rate of interest, see § 1.467-5.
(d)
Present value.
For purposes of determining adequate interest under paragraph (b) of this section or the proportional rental amount under paragraph (c) of this section, the present value of any amount is determined using a discount rate equal to 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate. In general, present values are determined as of the first day of the first rental period in the lease term. However, if a section 467 rental agreement calls for payments of fixed rent prior to the lease term, present values are determined as of the first day a fixed rent payment is called for by the agreement. For purposes of the present value determination under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, the fixed rent allocated to a rental period must be discounted from the first day of the rental period. For other conventions and rules relating to the determination of present value, see § 1.467-1(g) and (j).
(e)
Applicable Federal rate
—(1)
In general.
The applicable Federal rate for a section 467 rental agreement is the applicable Federal rate in effect on the agreement date. The
applicable Federal rate
for a rental agreement means—
(i) The Federal short-term rate if the term of the rental agreement is not over 3 years;
(ii) The Federal mid-term rate if the term of the rental agreement is over 3 years but not over 9 years; and
(iii) The Federal long-term rate if the term of the rental agreement is over 9 years.
(2)
Source of applicable Federal rates.
The Internal Revenue Service publishes the applicable Federal rates, based on annual, semiannual, quarterly, and monthly compounding, each month in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d) of this chapter). However, the applicable Federal rates may be based on any compounding assumption. To convert a rate based on one compounding assumption to an equivalent rate based on a different compounding assumption, see § 1.1272-1(j),
Example 1.
(3)
110 percent of applicable Federal rate.
For purposes of § 1.467-1, this section and §§ 1.467-3 through 1.467-9, 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate means 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate based on semiannual compounding or any rate based on a different compounding assumption that is equivalent to 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate based on semiannual compounding. The Internal Revenue Service publishes 110 percent of the applicable Federal rates, based on annual, semiannual, quarterly, and monthly compounding, each month in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter).
(4)
Term of the section 467 rental agreement
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of determining the applicable Federal rate under this paragraph (e), the term of the section 467 rental agreement includes the lease term, any period before the lease term beginning with the first day an amount of fixed rent is payable under the terms of the rental agreement, and any period after the lease term ending with the last day an amount of fixed rent or interest thereon is payable under the rental agreement.
(ii)
Section 467 rental agreements with variable interest.
If a section 467 rental agreement provides variable interest on deferred or prepaid fixed rent, the term of the rental agreement for purposes of calculating the applicable Federal rate is the longest period between interest rate adjustment dates, or, if the rental agreement provides an initial fixed rate of interest on deferred or prepaid fixed rent, the period between the agreement date and the last day the fixed rate applies, if this period is longer. If, as described in § 1.1274-4(c)(2)(ii), the rental agreement provides for a qualified floating rate (as defined in § 1.1275-5(b)) that in substance resembles a fixed rate, the applicable Federal rate is determined by reference to the lease term.
(f)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section. In each of these examples it is assumed that the rental agreement is not a disqualified leaseback or long-term
agreement subject to constant rental accrual. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i) C agrees to lease property from D for five years beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2004. The section 467 rental agreement provides that rent of $100,000 accrues in each calendar year in the lease term and that rent of $500,000 plus $120,000 of interest is payable on December 31, 2004. Assume that the parties select the calendar year as the rental period and that 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate is 10 percent, compounded annually.
(ii) The rental agreement has deferred rent under § 1.467-1(c)(3)(i) because the fixed rent allocated to calendar years 2000, 2001, and 2002 is not paid until 2004. In addition, because the rental agreement does not state an interest rate, the rental agreement does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(iii)(A) Because the rental agreement has deferred fixed rent and no prepaid rent, the agreement has adequate interest only if the present value test provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section is met. The present value of all fixed rent and interest payable under the rental agreement is $384,971.22, determined as follows: $620,000/(1.10)
5
= $384,971.22. The present value of all fixed rent allocated under the rental agreement (discounting the amount of fixed rent allocated to a rental period from the last day of the rental period) is $379,078.68, determined as follows:
ER18MY99.000
(B) The rental agreement provides adequate interest on fixed rent because the present value of the single amount payable under the section 467 rental agreement exceeds the sum of the present values of fixed rent allocated.
(iv) For an example illustrating the computation of the yield on the rental agreement and the allocation of the interest and rent provided for under the rental agreement, see § 1.467-4(f),
Example 2.

# Example 2.
(i) E and F enter into a section 467 rental agreement for the lease of equipment beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2004. The rental agreement provides that rent of $100,000 accrues for each calendar month during the lease term. All rent is payable on December 31, 2004, together with interest on accrued rent at a qualified floating rate set at a current value (as defined in § 1.1275-5(a)(4)) that is compounded at the end of each calendar month and adjusted at the beginning of each calendar month throughout the lease term. Therefore, the rental agreement provides for variable interest within the meaning of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(ii) On the agreement date the qualified floating rate is 7.5 percent, and 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate, as defined in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, based on monthly compounding, is 7 percent. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the fixed rate substitute for the qualified floating rate is 7.5 percent and the agreement is treated as providing for interest at this fixed rate for purposes of determining whether adequate interest is provided under paragraph (b) of this section. Accordingly, the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section are satisfied, and the rental agreement has adequate interest.

# Example 3.
(i) X and Y enter into a section 467 rental agreement for the lease of real property beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2002. The rental agreement provides that rent of $800,000 is allocable to 2000, $1,000,000 is allocable to 2001, and $1,200,000 is allocable to 2002. Under the rental agreement, Y must make a $3,000,000 payment on December 31, 2002. Assume that both X and Y choose the calendar year as the rental period, X and Y are calendar year taxpayers, and 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate is 8.5 percent compounded annually.
(ii) The rental agreement fails to provide adequate interest under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Therefore, under § 1.467-1(d)(2)(ii), the fixed rent for each rental period is the proportional rental amount.
(iii)(A) The proportional rental amount is computed under paragraph (c) of this section. Because the rental agreement does not call for any fixed rent payments prior to the lease term, under paragraph (d) of this section, the present value is determined as of the first day of the first rental period in the lease term. The present value of the single amount payable by the lessee under the rental agreement is computed as follows:
ER18MY99.001
(B) The sum of the present values of the fixed rent allocated to each rental period (discounting the fixed rent allocated to a rental period from the last day of such rental period) is computed as follows:
ER18MY99.002
(C) Thus, the fraction for determining the proportional rental amount is .9297194 ($2,348,724.30/$2,526,272.20). The section 467 interest for each of the taxable years within the lease term is computed and taken into account as provided in § 1.467-4. The section 467 rent for each of the taxable years within the lease term is as follows:
Taxable year
Section 467 rent
2000
$743,775.52
($ 800,000 × .9297194).
2001
929,719.40
($1,000,000 × .9297194).
2002
1,115,663.28
($1,200,000 × .9297194).
[T.D. 8820, 64 FR 26859, May 18, 1999, as amended by T.D. 8917, 66 FR 1040, Jan. 5, 2001]
§ 1.467-3
Disqualified leasebacks and long-term agreements.
(a)
General rule.
Under § 1.467-1(d)(2)(i), constant rental accrual (as described under paragraph (d) of this section) must be used to determine the fixed rent for each rental period in the lease term if the section 467 rental agreement is a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section. Constant rental accrual may not be used in the absence of a determination by the Commissioner, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, that the rental agreement is disqualified. Such determination may be made either on a case-by-case basis or in regulations or other guidance published by the Commissioner (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) providing that a certain type or class of leaseback or long-term agreement will be treated as disqualified and subject to constant rental accrual.

In general.
A leaseback (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) or a long-term agreement (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) is disqualified only if—
(i) A principal purpose for providing increasing or decreasing rent is the avoidance of Federal income tax (as described in paragraph (c) of this section);
(ii) The Commissioner determines that, because of the tax avoidance purpose, the agreement should be treated as a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement; and
(iii) For section 467 rental agreements entered into before July 19, 1999, the amount determined with respect to the rental agreement under § 1.467-1(c)(4) (relating to the exception for rental agreements involving total payments of $250,000 or less) exceeds $2,000,000.
(2)
Leaseback.
A section 467 rental agreement is a leaseback if the lessee (or a related person) had any interest (other than a de minimis interest) in the property at any time during the two-year period ending on the agreement date. For this purpose, interests in property include options and agreements to purchase the property (whether or not the lessee or related person was considered the owner of the property for Federal income tax purposes) and, in the case of subleased property, any interest as a sublessor.
(3)
Long-term agreement
—(i)
In general.
A section 467 rental agreement is a long-term agreement if the lease term exceeds 75 percent of the property's statutory recovery period.
(ii)
Statutory recovery period
—(A)
In general.
The term statutory recovery period means—
(
1
) In the case of property depreciable under section 168, the applicable period determined under section 467(e)(3)(A);
(
2
) In the case of land, 19 years; and
(
3
) In the case of any other tangible property, the period that would apply under section 467(e)(3)(A) if the property were property to which section 168 applied.
(B)
Special rule for rental agreements relating to properties having different statutory recovery periods.
In the case of a rental agreement relating to two or more related properties that have different statutory recovery periods, the statutory recovery period for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section is the weighted average, based on the fair market values of the properties on the agreement date, of the statutory recovery periods of each of the properties.
(c)
Tax avoidance as principal purpose for increasing or decreasing rent
—(1)
In general.
In determining whether a principal purpose for providing increasing or decreasing rent is the avoidance of Federal income tax, all relevant facts
and circumstances are taken into account. However, an agreement will not be treated as a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement if either of the safe harbors set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section is met. The mere failure of a leaseback or long-term agreement to meet one of these safe harbors will not, by itself, cause the agreement to be treated as one in which tax avoidance was a principal purpose for providing increasing or decreasing rent.
(2)
Tax avoidance
—(i)
In general.
If, as of the agreement date, a significant difference between the marginal tax rates of the lessor and lessee can reasonably be expected at some time during the lease term, the agreement will be closely scrutinized and clear and convincing evidence will be required to establish that tax avoidance is not a principal purpose for providing increasing or decreasing rent. The term “marginal tax rate” means the percentage determined by dividing one dollar into the amount of the increase or decrease in the Federal income tax liability of the taxpayer that would result from an additional dollar of rental income or deduction.
(ii)
Significant difference in tax rates.
A significant difference between the marginal tax rates of the lessor and lessee is reasonably expected if—
(A) The rental agreement has increasing rents and the lessor's marginal tax rate is reasonably expected to exceed the lessee's marginal tax rate by more than 10 percentage points during any rental period to which the rental agreement allocates annualized fixed rent that is less than the average rent allocated to all calendar years (determined by taking into account the rules set forth in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section); or
(B) The rental agreement has decreasing rents and the lessee's marginal tax rate is reasonably expected to exceed the lessor's marginal tax rate by more than 10 percentage points during any rental period to which the rental agreement allocates annualized fixed rent that is greater than the average rent allocated to all calendar years (determined by taking into account the rules set forth in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section).
(iii)
Special circumstances.
In determining the expected marginal tax rates of the lessor and lessee, net operating loss and credit carryovers and any other attributes or special circumstances reasonably expected to affect the Federal income tax liability of the taxpayer (including the alternative minimum tax) are taken into account. For example, in the case of a partnership or S corporation, the amount of rental income or deduction that would be allocable to the partners or shareholders, respectively, is taken into account.
(3)
Safe harbors.
Tax avoidance will not be considered a principal purpose for providing increasing or decreasing rent if—
(i) The uneven rent test (as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section) is met; or
(ii) The increase or decrease in rent is wholly attributable to one or more of the following provisions—
(A) A contingent rent provision set forth in § 1.467-1(c)(2)(iii)(B); or
(B) A single rent holiday provision allowing reduced rent (or no rent) for one consecutive period during the lease term, but only if—
(
1
) The rent holiday is for a period of three months or less at the beginning of the lease term and for no other period; or
(
2
) The duration of the rent holiday is reasonable, determined by reference to commercial practice (as of the agreement date) in the locality where the use of the property occurs, and does not exceed the lesser of 24 months or 10 percent of the lease term.
(4)
Uneven rent test
—(i)
In general.
The uneven rent test is met if the rent allocated to each calendar year does not vary from the average rent allocated to all calendar years (determined in accordance with the rules set forth in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section) by more than 10 percent.
(ii)
Special rule for real estate.
Paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section is applied by substituting “15 percent” for “10 percent” if the rental agreement is a long-term agreement and at least 90 percent of the property subject to the agreement (determined on the basis of fair market value as of the agreement
date) consists of real property (as defined in § 1.856-3(d)).
(iii)
Operating rules.
In determining whether the uneven rent test has been met, the following rules apply:
(A) Any contingent rent attributable to a provision set forth in § 1.467-1(c)(2)(iii)(B)(
3
) through (
9
) is disregarded.
(B) If the lease term includes one or more partial calendar years (a period less than a complete calendar year), the average rent allocated to each calendar year is the total rent allocated under the rental agreement, divided by the actual length (in years) of the lease term. The rent allocated to a partial calendar year is annualized by multiplying the allocated rent by the number of periods of the partial calendar year's length in a full calendar year and the annualized rent is treated as the amount of rent allocated to that year in determining whether the uneven rent test is met.
(C) In the case of a rental agreement not described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, an initial rent holiday period and any rent allocated to such period are disregarded for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4) if taking such period and rent into account would cause the agreement to fail to meet the uneven rent test. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(4), an initial rent holiday period is any period of three months or less at the beginning of the lease term during which annualized fixed rent (determined by treating such period as a rental period for purposes of § 1.467-1(j)(3)) is less than the average rent allocated to all calendar years (determined before the application of this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(C)).
(D) In the case of a rental agreement described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, one qualified rent holiday period and any rent allocated to such period are disregarded for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4) if taking such period and rent into account would cause the agreement to fail the uneven rent test. For this purpose, a qualified rent holiday period is a consecutive period that is an initial rent holiday period or that meets the following conditions:
(
1
) The period does not exceed the lesser of 24 months or 10 percent of the lease term (determined before the application of this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(D)).
(
2
) Annualized fixed rent during the period (determined by treating the period as a rental period for purposes of § 1.467-1(j)(3)) is less than the average rent allocated to all calendar years (determined before the application of this paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(D)).
(
3
) Providing less than average rent for the period is reasonable, determined by reference to commercial practice (as of the agreement date) in the locality where the use of the property occurs.
(E) If the rental agreement contains a variable interest rate provision, the uneven rent test is applied by treating the rent as having been fixed under the terms of the rental agreement for the entire lease term using fixed rate substitutes (determined in the same manner as § 1.1275-5(e), treating the agreement date as the issue date) for the variable rates of interest provided under the terms of the lessor's indebtedness.
(d)
Calculating constant rental amount
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the constant rental amount is the amount that, if paid at the end of each rental period, would result in a present value equal to the present value of all amounts payable under the disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement as rent and interest. In computing the constant rental amount, the rules for determining present value are the same as those provided in § 1.467-2(d) for computing the proportional rental amount. If constant rental accrual is required, all rental periods (other than an initial or final short period of not more than one month) must be equal in length and satisfy the requirements of § 1.467-1(j)(5).
(2)
Initial or final short periods.
If a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement has an initial or final short rental period, the constant rental amount for the initial or final short period may be determined under any reasonable method. However, the sum of the present values of all the constant rental amounts must equal the present values of all amounts payable under the disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement as rent and interest. Any
adjustment necessary to eliminate the section 467 loan balance because of the method used to determine the constant rental amount for short periods must be taken into account as section 467 rent for the final rental period.
(3)
Method to determine constant rental amount; no short periods
—(i)
Step 1.
Determine the present value of amounts payable under the disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement as rent or interest.
(ii)
Step 2.
Determine the present value of $1 to be received at the end of each rental period during the lease term as of the first day of the first rental period during the lease term (or, if earlier, the first day a rent payment is required under the rental agreement).
(iii)
Step 3.
Divide the amount determined in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section (Step 1) by the number of dollars determined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section (Step 2).
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) K, lessor, and L, lessee, enter into a long-term agreement for a 10-year lease of personal property beginning on January 1, 2000. K and L are C corporations that use the calendar year as their taxable year. K does not have any unused losses or credits from taxable years preceding 2000. In addition, as of the agreement date, K expects that it will be subject to the maximum rate of tax imposed by section 11 in 2000 and that it will not be limited in its ability to use any losses or credits. As of the agreement date, L expects that it will be subject to the alternative minimum tax imposed by section 55 in 2000. The rental agreement provides for rent allocations in each year of the lease term, as follows:
Year
Amount
2000
$427,500
2001
442,500
2002
457,500
2003
472,500
2004
487,500
2005
502,500
2006
517,500
2007
532,500
2008
547,500
2009
562,500
(ii) As described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, as of the agreement date, a significant difference between the marginal tax rates of the lessor and lessee can reasonably be expected at some time during the lease term. First, the rental agreement has increasing rents. Second, the lessor's marginal tax rate exceeds the lessee's marginal tax rate by more than 10 percentage points during a rental period to which the rental agreement allocates less than a ratable portion of the aggregate amount of rent payable under the agreement. For example, for the year 2000, the lessor's expected marginal tax rate is 35 percent, the percentage determined by dividing the increase in the Federal income tax liability of K that would result from an additional dollar of rental income ($.35) by $1. Because the lessee is subject to the alternative minimum tax, the lessee's expected marginal tax rate for 2000 is 20 percent, the percentage determined by dividing the decrease in the Federal income tax liability (taking into account both the decrease in the lessee's regular tax and the increase in the lessee's alternative minimum tax) that would result from an additional dollar of rental deduction ($.20) by $1. Further, for the year 2000, the rent allocated in accordance with the rental agreement is $427,500, which is less than a ratable portion of the aggregate amount of rental payments, $495,000, determined by dividing the total rents payable under the agreement ($4,950,000) by the number of years in the lease term (10). Thus, because a significant difference between the marginal tax rates of the lessor and lessee can reasonably be expected during the lease term, the agreement will be closely scrutinized and clear and convincing evidence will be required to establish that tax avoidance is not a principal purpose for providing increasing rent.

# Example 2.
(i) A and B enter into a long-term agreement for a 5-year lease of personal property beginning on July 1, 2000, and ending on June 30, 2005. The rental agreement provides that the rent is allocated to the calendar years in the lease term in accordance with the following schedule and is paid at successive six-month intervals (on December 31 and June 30) during the lease term:
Year
Amount
2000
$450,000
2001
900,000
2002
900,000
2003
1,100,000
2004
1,100,000
2005
550,000
(ii) In determining whether the uneven rent test described in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section is met, the total amount of rent allocated under the rental agreement is $5,000,000, and the lease term is five years. The average rent for each year is $1,000,000 (see paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B) of this section), and the uneven rent test is met if the rent for each year is not less than $900,000 and not more than $1,100,000. The test is met for 2000 because the annualized rent for that year is
$900,000. The test is met for 2005 because the annualized rent for that year is $1,100,000. The test is met for each of the years 2001 through 2004 because the rent for each of these years is not less than $900,000 and not more than $1,100,000. Accordingly, because the uneven rent test of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section is met, the long-term agreement will not be treated as disqualified.

# Example 3.
(i) C and D enter into a long-term agreement for a lease of personal property beginning on October 1, 1999, and ending on December 31, 2005. The rental agreement provides that the rent is allocated to the calendar years in the lease term in accordance with the following schedule and is paid at successive six-month intervals (on December 31 and June 30) during the lease term:
Year
Amount
1999
$0
2000
900,000
2001
900,000
2002
900,000
2003
1,100,000
2004
1,100,000
2005
1,100,000
(ii) The three-month rent holiday period at the beginning of the lease term is an initial rent holiday within the meaning of paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(C) of this section. Moreover, the agreement would fail the uneven rent test if the rent holiday period and the rent allocated to the period were taken into account. Thus, under paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(C) of this section, the period and the rent allocated to the period are disregarded for purposes of applying the uneven rent test. In that case, the lease term is six years, and the uneven rent test is met because the average rent for each year in the lease term is $1,000,000 and the rent for each calendar year in the lease term is not less than $900,000 nor more than $1,100,000. Accordingly, the long-term agreement will not be treated as disqualified.

# Example 4.
(i) E and F enter into a long-term agreement for a 6-year lease of personal property beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2005. The rental agreement provides that the rent allocated to the calendar years in the lease term and paid at successive six-month intervals (on June 30 and December 31) during the lease term is the sum of the interest on the lessor's indebtedness, in the amount of $4,637,577, and an amount determined in accordance with the following schedule:
Year
Amount
2000
$539,574
2001
583,603
2002
631,225
2003
886,733
2004
959,090
2005
1,037,352
(ii) Assume further that the lessor's indebtedness bears interest at the rate of 2 percent in excess of the 6-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) in effect on the first day of the 6-month period for each rental period and that, on the agreement date, the interest rate under this formula would be 8 percent. If the interest rate remained fixed during the entire lease term, the formula for determining the rent payable by the lessee would result in payments of rent in the amount of $450,000 for each six-month period in 2000, 2001, and 2002, and $550,000 for each six-month period in 2003, 2004, and 2005.
(iii) Under paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(E) of this section, the fixed rate substitute for the variable interest rate provision produces a schedule of fixed rents that meets the uneven rent test of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. Thus, even if the actual rents payable under the rental agreement do not meet the uneven rent test because of fluctuations in the 6-month LIBOR, the uneven rent test will be treated as having been met, and the long-term agreement will not be treated as disqualified.

# Example 5.
(i) G and H enter into a long-term agreement for a 5-year lease of personal property beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2004. The rental agreement provides that the rent is payable to G at the rate of $40,000 per month in arrears, subject to an adjustment based on changes in prevailing interest rates during the lease term. Under this adjustment, the lessor is entitled to receive an amount equal to the sum of a specified dollar amount, which increases each month as payments of rent are made, and interest on a notional principal amount (as defined in § 1.446-3(c)(3)) at a qualified floating rate (as defined in § 1.1275-5(b)). The notional principal amount is initially established at 80 percent of the cost of the property. As each payment of rent is made, the notional principal amount is reduced (but not below zero) to an amount that would represent the outstanding principal balance of a loan the payments on which are equal to the monthly payments of rent. As of the agreement date, the value of the qualified floating rate is 9 percent. Although G did not incur indebtedness specifically for the purpose of acquiring the property, the parties agreed to the adjustment provisions in order to compensate G for its general costs of borrowing.
(ii) The adjustment provision produces a schedule of rent payments that is virtually identical to the schedule that would have resulted if G had actually borrowed money in an amount and on terms identical to the terms used in determining interest on the notional principal amount and the adjustment were based on that indebtedness. An adjustment based on actual indebtedness of the lessor would have been a variable interest rate provision eligible for a safe harbor
under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. Accordingly, based on all the facts and circumstances, the adjustment provision did not have as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of Federal income tax, and thus the long-term agreement will not be treated as disqualified.

# Example 6.
(i) X and Y enter into a leaseback for a 5-year lease of personal property beginning on January 1, 1998, and ending on December 31, 2002. The rental agreement provides that $0 of rent is allocated to years 1998, 1999, and 2000, and that rent of $17,500,000 is allocated to years 2001 and 2002. The rental agreement provides that the rent allocated to each year is payable on December 31 of that year. Assume all rental periods are the calendar year. Assume also that 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate based on annual compounding is 12 percent.
(ii)(A) If the Commissioner determines that the leaseback is disqualified, the constant rental amount is computed as follows:
(B) Step 1 in calculating the constant rental amount is to determine the present value of the two payments due under the rental agreement as follows:
ER18MY99.003
(iii) Because no amounts of rent are payable before the lease term, Step 2 in calculating the constant rental amount is to determine the present value as of the first day of the lease term of $1 to be received at the end of each rental period during the lease term. This results in a present value of $3.6047762. In Step 3 the amount determined in Step 1 is divided by the number of dollars determined in Step 2. Thus, the constant rental amount is $5,839,901 for each calendar year during the lease term computed as follows:
ER18MY99.004
[T.D. 8820, 64 FR 26860, May 18, 1999, as amended by T.D. 8917, 66 FR 1040, Jan. 5, 2001]
§ 1.467-4
Section 467 loan.
(a)
In general
—(1)
Overview.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the section 467 loan rules of this section apply to a section 467 rental agreement if, as of the first day of a rental period, there is a difference between the amount of fixed rent payable under the rental agreement on or before the first day and the amount of fixed rent required to be accrued in accordance with § 1.467-1(d)(2) before the first day. Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules for computing the principal balance of a section 467 loan at the beginning of any rental period. The principal balance of a section 467 loan may be positive or negative. For Federal tax purposes, if the principal balance is positive, the amount represents a loan from the lessor to the lessee, and if the principal balance is negative, the amount represents a loan from the lessee to the lessor.
(2)
No section 467 loan in the case of certain section 467 rental agreements.
Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section, this section does not apply to section 467 rental agreements that provide adequate interest under § 1.467-2(b)(1)(i) (agreements with no deferred or prepaid rent) or § 1.467-2(b)(1)(ii) (agreements with deferred or prepaid rent that provide adequate stated interest at a single fixed rate).
(3)
Rental agreements subject to constant rental accrual.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, this section applies to rental agreements subject to constant rental accrual under § 1.467-3 (relating to disqualified leasebacks or long-term agreements).
(4)
Special rule in applying the provisions of § 1.467-7(e), (f), or (g).
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, section 467 loan balances must be computed for section 467 rental agreements that are not subject to constant rental accrual under § 1.467-3 and that provide adequate interest under § 1.467-2(b)(1)(i) or (ii), but only for purposes of applying the provisions of § 1.467-7(e) (relating to dispositions of property subject to a section 467 rental agreement), § 1.467-7(f) (relating to assignments by lessees and lessee-financed renewals), and § 1.467-7(g) (relating to modifications of rental agreements).
(b)
Principal balance
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section or in § 1.467-7(e), (f), or (g), the principal balance of the section 467 loan at the beginning of a rental period equals—
(i) The fixed rent accrued in preceding rental periods;
(ii) Increased by the sum of—
(A) The interest on fixed rent includible in the gross income of the lessor for preceding rental periods; and
(B) Any amount payable by the lessor on or before the first day of the rental period as interest on prepaid fixed rent; and
(iii) Decreased by the sum of—
(A) The interest on prepaid fixed rent includible in the gross income of the lessee for preceding rental periods; and
(B) Any amount payable by the lessee on or before the first day of the rental period as fixed rent or interest thereon.
(2)
Section 467 rental agreements that provide for prepaid fixed rent and adequate interest.
If a section 467 rental agreement calls for prepaid fixed rent and provides adequate interest under § 1.467-2(b)(1)(iv), the principal balance of the section 467 loan at the beginning of a rental period equals the principal balance determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, plus the fixed rent accrued for that rental period.
(3)
Timing of payments.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), the day on which an amount is payable is determined under the rules of § 1.467-1(j)(2)(i)(B) through (E) and § 1.467-1(j)(2)(ii).
(c)
Yield
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Method of determining yield.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, the yield of a section 467 loan is the discount rate at which the sum of the present values of all amounts payable by the lessee as fixed rent and interest on fixed rent, plus the sum of the present values of all amounts payable by the lessor as interest on prepaid fixed rent, equals the sum of the present values of the fixed rent that accrues in accordance with § 1.467-1(d)(2). The yield must be constant over the term of the section 467 rental agreement and, when expressed as a percentage, must be calculated to at least two decimal places.
(ii)
Method of stating yield.
In determining the section 467 interest for a rental period, the yield of the section 467 loan must be stated appropriately by taking into account the length of the rental period. Section 1.1272-1(j),
Example 1,
provides a formula for converting a yield based on a period of one length to an equivalent yield based on a period of a different length.
(iii)
Rounding adjustments.
Any adjustment necessary to eliminate the section 467 loan because of rounding the yield to two or more decimal places must be taken into account as an adjustment to the section 467 interest for the final rental period determined as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
(2)
Yield of section 467 rental agreements for which constant rental amount or proportional rental amount is computed.
In the case of a section 467 rental agreement to which § 1.467-1(d)(2)(i) or (ii) applies, the yield of the section 467 loan equals 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate (based on a compounding period equal to the length of the rental period).
(3)
Yield for purposes of applying paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
For purposes of applying paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the yield of the section 467 loan balance of any party, or prior party, to a section 467 rental agreement for a period is the same for all parties and is the yield that results in the net accrual of positive or negative interest for that period equal to the amount of such interest that accrues under the terms of the rental agreement for that period. For example, if property subject to a section 467 rental agreement is sold (transferred) and the beginning section 467 loan balance of the transferor (as described in § 1.467-7(e)(2)(i)) is positive and the beginning section 467 loan balance of the transferee (as described in § 1.467-7(e)(2)(ii)) is negative, the yield on each of these loan balances for any period is the same for all parties and is the yield that results in the net accrual of positive or negative interest, taking into account the aggregate positive or negative interest on the section 467 loan balances of both the transferor and transferee, equal to the amount of such interest that accrues under the terms of the rental agreement for that period.
(4)
Determination of present values.
The rules for determining present value in computing the yield of a section 467 loan are the same as those provided in § 1.467-2(d) for computing the proportional rental amount.
(d)
Contingent payments.
Except as otherwise required, contingent payments are not taken into account in calculating either the yield or the principal balance of a section 467 loan.
(e)
Section 467 rental agreements that call for payments before or after the lease
term.
If a section 467 rental agreement calls for the payment of fixed rent or interest thereon before the beginning of the lease term, this section is applied by treating the period beginning on the first day an amount is payable and ending on the day before the beginning of the first rental period of the lease term as one or more rental periods. If a rental agreement calls for the payment of fixed rent or interest thereon after the end of the lease term, this section is applied by treating the period beginning on the day after the end of the last rental period of the lease term and ending on the last day an amount of fixed rent or interest thereon is payable as one or more rental periods. Rental period length for the period before the lease term or after the lease term is determined in accordance with the rules of § 1.467-1(j)(5).

The following examples illustrate the application of this section:

# Example 1.
(i)(A) A leases property to B for a three-year period beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2002. The section 467 rental agreement has the following rent allocation schedule and payment schedule:
Rent
allocation
Payment
2000
$400,000
2001
600,000
2002
800,000
$1,800,000
(B) The rental agreement requires a $1.8 million payment to be made on December 31, 2002, but does not provide for interest on deferred rent. Assume A and B choose the calendar year as the rental period length and that 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate based on annual compounding is 10 percent. Assume also that the agreement is not a leaseback or long-term agreement and, therefore, is not subject to constant rental accrual.
(ii) Because the section 467 rental agreement does not provide adequate interest under § 1.467-2(b) and is not subject to constant rental accrual, the fixed rent that accrues during each rental period is the proportional rental amount as described in § 1.467-2(c). The proportional rental amounts for each rental period are as follows:
2000
$370,370.37
2001
555,555.56
2002
740,740.73
(iii) A section 467 loan arises at the beginning of the second rental period because the rent payable on or before that day (zero) is less than the fixed rent accrued under § 1.467-1(d)(2) in all preceding rental periods ($370,370.37). Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the yield of the loan is equal to 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate (10 percent compounded annually). Because no payments are treated as made on or before the first day of the second rental period, the principal balance of the loan at the beginning of the second rental period is $370,370.37. The interest for the second rental period on fixed rent is $37,037.04 (.10 × $370,370.37) and, under § 1.467-1(e)(3), is treated as interest income of the lessor and as an interest expense of the lessee.
(iv) Because no payments are made on or before the first day of the third rental period, the principal balance of the loan at the beginning of the third rental period is equal to the fixed rent accrued during the first and second rental periods plus the lessor's interest income on fixed rent for the second rental period ($962,962.97 = $370,370.37 + $555,555.56 + $37,037.04). The interest for the third rental period on fixed rent is $96,296.30 (.10 × $962,962.97). Thus, the sum of the fixed rent and interest on fixed rent for the three rental periods is equal to the total amount paid over the lease term (first year fixed rent accrual, $370,370.37, plus second year fixed rent and interest accrual, $555,555.56 + $37,037.04, plus third year fixed rent and interest accrual, $740,740.73 + $96,296.30, equals $1,800,000). B takes the amounts of interest and rent into account as interest and rent expense, respectively, and A takes such amounts into account as interest and rent income, respectively, for the calendar years identified above, regardless of their respective overall methods of accounting.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
§ 1.467-2(f). C agrees to lease property from D for five years beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2004. The section 467 rental agreement provides that rent of $100,000 accrues in each calendar year in the lease term and that rent of $500,000 plus $120,000 of interest is payable on December 31, 2004. The parties select the calendar year as the rental period, and 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate is 10 percent, compounded annually. The rental agreement has deferred rent but provides adequate interest on fixed rent.
(ii)(A) Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the yield of the section 467 loan is 10.775078%, compounded annually. The following is a schedule of the rent allocable to each rental period during the lease term, the balance of the section 467 loan as of the end of each rental period (determined, in the case of the calendar year 2004, without regard to the single payment of rent and interest in the amount of $620,000 payable on the last day of the lease term), and the interest on the section 467 loan allocable to each rental period:
Calendar year

§ 1.467-5
Section 467 rental agreements with variable interest.
(a)
Variable interest on deferred or prepaid rent
—(1)
In general.
This section provides rules for computing section 467 rent and interest in the case of section 467 rental agreements providing variable interest. For purposes of this section, a rental agreement provides for variable interest if the rental agreement provides for stated interest that is paid or compounded at least annually at a rate or rates that meet the requirements of § 1.1275-5(a)(3)(i)(A) or (B) and (a)(4). If a section 467 rental agreement provides for interest that is neither variable interest nor fixed interest, the agreement provides for contingent payments.
(2)
Exceptions.
This section is not applicable to section 467 rental agreements that provide adequate interest under § 1.467-2(b)(1)(i) (agreements with no deferred or prepaid rent) or (b)(1)(ii) (rental agreements with stated interest at a single fixed rate). The exceptions in this paragraph (a)(2) do not apply to rental agreements subject to constant rental accrual under § 1.467-3.
(b)
Variable rate treated as fixed
—(1)
In general.
If a section 467 rental agreement provides variable interest—
(i) The fixed rate substitutes (determined in the same manner as under § 1.1275-5(e), treating the agreement date as the issue date) for the variable rates of interest on deferred or prepaid fixed rent provided by the rental agreement must be used in computing the proportional rental amount under § 1.467-2(c), the constant rental amount under § 1.467-3(d), the principal balance of a section 467 loan under § 1.467-4(b), and the yield of a section 467 loan under § 1.467-4(c); and
(ii) The interest on fixed rent for any rental period is equal to the amount that would be determined under § 1.467-1(e)(2) if the section 467 rental agreement did not provide variable interest, using the fixed rate substitutes determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section in place of the variable rates called for by the rental agreement, plus the variable interest adjustment amount provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(2)
Variable interest adjustment amount
—(i)
In general.
The variable interest adjustment amount for a rental period equals the difference between—
(A) The amount of interest that, without regard to section 467, would have accrued during the rental period under the terms of the section 467 rental agreement; and
(B) The amount of interest that, without regard to section 467, would have accrued during the rental period under the terms of the section 467 rental agreement using the fixed rate substitutes determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section in place of the variable interest rates called for by the rental agreement.
(ii)
Positive or negative adjustment.
If the amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section is greater than the amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the variable interest adjustment amount is positive. If the amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section is less than the amount determined under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the variable interest adjustment amount is negative.
(3)
Section 467 loan balance.
The variable interest adjustment amount is not taken into account in determining the principal balance of a section 467 loan under § 1.467-4(b). Instead, the section 467 loan balance is computed as if all
amounts payable under the section 467 rental agreement were based on the fixed rate substitutes determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(c)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) X and Y enter into a section 467 rental agreement for the lease of personal property beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2002. The rental agreement allocates $100,000 of rent to 2000, $200,000 to 2001, and $100,000 to 2002, and requires the lessee to pay all $400,000 of rent on December 31, 2002. The rental agreement requires the accrual of interest on unpaid accrued rent at two different qualified floating rates (as defined in § 1.1275-5(b)), one for 2001 and the other for 2002, such interest to be paid on December 31 of the year it accrues. The rental agreement provides that the qualified floating rate is set at a current value within the meaning of § 1.1275-5(a)(4). Assume that on the agreement date, 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate is 10 percent, compounded annually. Assume also that the agreement is not a leaseback or long-term agreement and, therefore, is not subject to constant rental accrual.
(ii) To determine if the section 467 rental agreement provides for adequate interest under § 1.467-2(b), § 1.467-2(b)(2) requires the use of fixed rate substitutes (in this example determined in the same manner as under § 1.1275-5(e)(3)(i) treating the agreement date as the issue date) in place of the variable rates called for by the rental agreement. Assume that on the agreement date the qualified floating rates, and therefore the fixed rate substitutes, relating to 2001 and 2002 are 10 and 15 percent compounded annually. Taking into account the fixed rate substitutes, the sum of the present values of all amounts payable by the lessee as fixed rent and interest thereon is greater than the sum of the present values of the fixed rent allocated to each rental period. Accordingly, the rental agreement provides adequate interest under § 1.467-2(b)(1)(iii) and the fixed rent accruing in each calendar year during the rental agreement is the fixed rent allocated under the rental agreement.
(iii) Because the section 467 rental agreement provides for variable interest on unpaid accrued fixed rent at qualified floating rates and the qualified floating rates are set at a current value, the requirements of § 1.1275-5(a)(3)(i)(A) and (4) are met and the rental agreement provides for variable interest within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Therefore, under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the yield of the section 467 loan is computed based on the fixed rate substitutes. Under § 1.467-4(c), the constant yield (rounded to two decimal places) equals 13.63 percent compounded annually. Based on the fixed rate substitutes, the fixed rent, interest on fixed rent, and the principal balance of the section 467 loan, for each calendar year during the lease term, are as follows:
Accrued rent
Accrued
interest
Projected
payment
Cumulative loan

(10,000)
303,630
2002
100,000
41,370
(445,000)
0
(iv) To compute the actual reported interest on fixed rent for each calendar year, the variable interest adjustment amount, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, must be added to the accrued interest determined in paragraph (iii) of this
Example 1.
Assume that the variable rates for 2001 and 2002 are actually 11 and 14 percent, respectively. Without regard to section 467, the interest that would have accrued during each calendar year under the terms of the section 467 rental agreement, and the interest that would have accrued under the terms of the rental agreement using the fixed rate substitutes determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are as follows:
Accrued interest under rental agreement
Accrued interest using fixed rate substitutes
2000
$0
$0
2001
11,000
10,000
2002
42,000
45,000
(v) Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the variable interest adjustment amount is $1,000 ($11,000−$10,000) for 2001 and is −$3,000 ($42,000−$45,000) for 2002. Thus, under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the actual interest on fixed rent for 2001 is $14,630 ($13,630 + $1,000) and for 2002 is $38,370 ($41,370−$3,000).

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate is 15 percent compounded annually and the section 467 rental agreement does not provide adequate interest under § 1.467-2(b). Consequently, the fixed
rent for each calendar year during the lease is the proportional rental amount.
(ii) The sum of the present values of the fixed rent provided for each calendar year during the lease term, discounted at 15 percent compounded annually, equals $303,936.87.
(iii)(A) Paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section requires the proportional rental amount to be computed based on the assumption that interest will accrue and be paid based on the fixed rate substitutes. Thus, the sum of the present values of the projected payments under the section 467 rental agreement equals $300,156.16, computed as follows:
ER18MY99.005
(B) The fraction for computing the proportional rental amount equals .9875609 ($300,156.16/$303,936.87).
(iv) Based on the fixed rate substitutes, the fixed rent, interest on fixed rent, and the balance of the section 467 loan for each calendar year during the lease term are as follows:
Proportional

(v) The variable interest adjustment amount in this example is the same as in
Example 1.
Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the actual interest on fixed rent for 2001 is $15,813.41 ($14,813.41 + $1,000) and for 2002 is $42,162.23 ($45,162.23−$3,000).

§ 1.467-6
Section 467 rental agreements with contingent payments. [Reserved]
§ 1.467-7
Section 467 recapture and other rules relating to dispositions and modifications.
(a)
Section 467 recapture.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a lessor disposing of property in a transaction to which this paragraph (a) applies must recognize the recapture amount (determined under paragraph (b) of this section) and treat that amount as ordinary income. This paragraph (a) applies to any disposition of property subject to a section 467 rental agreement that—
(1) Is a leaseback (as defined in § 1.467-3(b)(2)) or a long-term agreement (as defined in § 1.467-3(b)(3));
(2) Is not disqualified under § 1.467-3(b)(1); and
(3) Allocates to any rental period fixed rent that, when annualized, exceeds the annualized fixed rent allocated to any preceding rental period.
(b)
Recapture amount
—(1)
In general.
The recapture amount for a disposition is the lesser of—
(i) The prior understated inclusion (determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section); or
(ii) The section 467 gain (determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section).
(2)
Prior understated inclusion.
The prior understated inclusion is the excess (if any) of—
(i) The aggregate amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest for the period during which the lessor held the property, determined as if the section 467 rental agreement were a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement subject to constant rental accrual under § 1.467-3; over
(ii) The aggregate amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest accrued by the lessor during that period.
(3)
Section 467 gain
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the section 467 gain is the excess (if any) of—
(A) The amount realized from the disposition; over
(B) The sum of the adjusted basis of the property and the amount of any gain from the disposition that is treated as ordinary income under any provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 467(c) (for example, section 1245 or 1250).
(ii)
Certain dispositions.
In the case of a disposition that is not a sale or exchange, the section 467 gain is the excess (if any) of the fair market value of the property on the date of disposition over the amount determined under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
(c)
Special rules
—(1)
Gifts.
Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to a disposition by gift. However, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section for dispositions by transferees. If a disposition is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, paragraph (a) of this section applies to the disposition but the prior understated inclusion is determined by taking into account only section 467 rent and section 467 interest properly allocable to the portion of the property not disposed of by gift.
(2)
Dispositions at death.
Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to a disposition if the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined under section 1014(a) or section 1022. However, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section for dispositions of property subject to section 1022 by transferees. This paragraph (c)(2) does not apply to property that constitutes a right to receive an item of income in respect of a decedent. See sections 691, 1014(c), and 1022(f).
(3)
Certain tax-free exchanges
—(i)
In general.
The recapture amount in the case of a disposition to which this paragraph (c)(3) applies is limited to the amount of gain recognized to the transferor (determined without regard to paragraph (a) of this section), reduced by the amount of any gain from the disposition that is treated as ordinary income under any provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 467(c). However, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section for dispositions by transferees.
(ii)
Dispositions covered
—(A)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, this paragraph (c)(3) applies to a disposition of property if the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of section 332, 351, 361, 721, or 731.
(B)
Transfers to certain tax-exempt organizations.
This paragraph (c)(3) does not apply to a disposition to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from tax imposed by chapter 1, subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (a tax-exempt entity) except to the extent the property is used in an activity the income from which is subject to tax under section 511(a) (a section 511(a) activity). However, if assets used to any extent in a section 511(a) activity are disposed of by the tax-exempt entity, then, notwithstanding any other provision of law (except section 1031 or section 1033) the recapture amount with respect to such disposition, to the extent attributable under paragraph (c)(4) of this section to the period of the transferor's ownership of the property prior to the first disposition, shall be included in the tax-exempt entity's unrelated business taxable income. To the extent that the tax-exempt entity ceases to use the property in a section 511(a) activity, the entity will be treated for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section as having disposed of the property to such extent on the date of the cessation.
(4)
Dispositions by transferee.
If the recapture amount with respect to a disposition of property (the first disposition) is limited under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(3) of this section, or under paragraph (c)(2) of this section because the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined under section 1022, and the transferee subsequently disposes of the property in a transaction to which paragraph (a) of this section applies, the prior understated inclusion determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section is computed by taking into account the amounts attributable to the period of the transferor's ownership of the property prior to the first disposition. Thus, for example, the section 467 rent and section 467 interest that would have been taken into account by the transferee if the section 467 rental agreement were a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement subject to constant rental accrual include the amounts that would have been taken into account by the transferor, and the aggregate amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest accrued by the transferee includes the aggregate
amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest that was taken into account by the transferor. The prior understated inclusion determined under this paragraph (c)(4) must be reduced by any recapture amount taken into account under paragraph (a) of this section by the transferor.
(5)
Like-kind exchanges and involuntary conversions.
If property is disposed of or converted and, before the application of paragraph (a) of this section, gain is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 or 1033, then the amount of section 467 gain taken into account by the lessor is limited to the sum of—
(i) The amount of gain recognized on the disposition or conversion of the property (determined without regard to paragraph (a) of this section); and
(ii) The fair market value of property acquired that is not subject to the same section 467 rental agreement and that is not taken into account under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section.
(6)
Installment sales.
In the case of an installment sale of property to which paragraph (a) of this section applies—
(i) The recapture amount is recognized and treated as ordinary income in the year of the disposition; and
(ii) Any gain in excess of the recapture amount is reported under the installment method of accounting if and to the extent that method is otherwise available under section 453.
(7)
Dispositions covered by section 170(e), 341(e)(12), or 751(c).
For purposes of sections 170(e), 341(e)(12), and 751(c), amounts treated as ordinary income under paragraph (a) of this section must be treated in the same manner as amounts treated as ordinary income under section 1245 or 1250.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. In each of these examples the transferor of property subject to a section 467 rental agreement is entitled to the rent for the day of the disposition. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i)(A) X and Y enter into a section 467 rental agreement for a 5-year lease of personal property beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2004. The rental agreement provides that the calendar year will be the rental period and that rents accrue and are paid in the following pattern:
Allocation
Payment
2000
$0
$0
2001
87,500

175,000
2003

175,000
2004

(B) Assume that both X and Y are calendar year taxpayers and that 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate is 11 percent, compounded annually. Assume also that the rental agreement is a long-term agreement (as defined in § 1.467-3(b)(3)), but it is not a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement. Further, because the agreement does not provide prepaid or deferred rent, proportional rental accrual is not applicable. (See § 1.467-2(b)(1)(i)). Therefore, the rent taken into account under § 1.467-1(d)(2) is the fixed rent allocated to the rental periods under § 1.467-1(c)(2)(ii).
(ii) On December 31, 2000, X sells the property subject to the section 467 rental agreement to an unrelated person for $575,000. At the time of the sale, X's adjusted basis in the property is $175,000. Thus, X's gain on the sale of the property is $400,000. Assume that $175,000 of this gain would be treated as ordinary income under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 467(c). Under paragraph (a) of this section, X is required to take the recapture amount into account as ordinary income. Under paragraph (b) of this section, the recapture amount is the lesser of the prior understated inclusion or the section 467 gain.
(iii)(A) In computing the prior understated inclusion under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, assume that the section 467 rent and section 467 interest (based on constant rental accrual) would be taken into account as follows if the section 467 rental agreement were a disqualified long-term agreement:
Section 467 rent
Section 467
interest

$65,812.55

2001

2003
65,812.55
4,944.73
2004
65,812.55
(6,521.95)
(B) The total amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest for 2000, based on constant rental accrual, is $65,812.55. Since X did not take any section 467 rent or section 467 interest into account in 2000, the prior understated inclusion is also $65,812.55. X's section 467 gain is $225,000, which is the excess of the gain realized ($400,000) over the amount of that gain treated as ordinary income under non-section 467 provisions ($175,000). Accordingly, the recapture amount (the lesser of the prior understated inclusion
or the section 467 gain) treated as ordinary income is $65,812.55.

# Example 2.

(ii)(A) Assume the section 467 rental agreement does not provide for adequate interest under § 1.467-2(b), and, therefore, the fixed rent for a rental period is the proportional rental amount. See § 1.467-1(d)(2)(ii). Under § 1.467-2(c), the following amounts would be required to be taken into account:

(B) The amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest taken into account by X for 2000 is $57,260.43. Thus, the prior understated inclusion is $8,552.12 (the excess of the amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest based on constant rental accrual for 2000, $65,812.55, over the amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest actually taken into account, $57,260.43). Since the prior understated inclusion is less than the section 467 gain ($225,000, as determined in
Example 1
(iii)(B)), the recapture amount treated as ordinary income is also $8,552.12.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except that, instead of selling the property, X transfers the property to S on December 31, 2002, in exchange for stock of S in a transaction that meets the requirements of section 351(a). Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, because of the application of section 351, X is not required to take into account any section 467 recapture.
(ii) On December 31, 2003, S sells the property subject to the section 467 rental agreement to an unrelated person for $450,000. At the time of the sale, S's adjusted basis in the property is $105,000. Thus, S's gain on the sale of the property is $345,000. Assume that $245,000 of this gain would be treated as ordinary income under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 467(c). Under paragraph (a) of this section, S is required to take the recapture amount into account as ordinary income which, under paragraph (b) of this section, is the lesser of the prior understated inclusion or the section 467 gain.
(iii) S owned the property in 2003 and, under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, for purposes of determining S's prior understated inclusion, S is treated as if it had owned the property during the years 2000 through 2002. In computing S's prior understated inclusion under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the section 467 rent and section 467 interest based on constant rental accrual are the same as the amounts set forth in the schedule in
Example 1
(iii)(A). Thus, the constant rental amount for 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 is $290,709.40 ((4 × $65,812.55) + $7,239.38 + $15,275.09 + $4,944.73). The section 467 rent and section 467 interest actually taken into account prior to the disposition is $262,500. Thus, S's prior understated inclusion is $28,209.40 ($290,709.40 minus $262,500 (3 × $87,500)). S's section 467 gain is $100,000, the difference between the gain realized on the disposition ($345,000) and the amount of gain that is treated as ordinary income under non-section 467 Code provisions ($245,000). Accordingly, S's recapture amount, the lesser of the prior understated inclusion or the section 467 gain, is $28,209.40.
(e)
Other rules relating to dispositions
—(1)
In general.
If there is a sale, exchange, or other disposition of property subject to a section 467 rental agreement (the transfer), the section 467 rent and, if applicable, section 467 interest for a period are taken into account by the owner of the property during the period. The following rules apply in determining the section 467 rent and section 467 interest for the portion of the rental period ending immediately prior to the transfer:
(i) The section 467 rent and section 467 interest for the portion of the rental period ending immediately prior to the transfer are a pro rata portion of the section 467 rent and the section 467 interest, respectively, for the rental period. Such amounts are also taken into account in determining the transferor's section 467 loan balance, prior to any adjustment thereof that may be required under paragraph (h) of this section, immediately before the transfer.
(ii) If the transferor of the property is entitled to the rent for the day of transfer, the transfer is treated as occurring at the end of the day of the transfer.
(iii) If the transferee of the property is entitled to the rent for the day of transfer, the transfer is treated as occurring at the beginning of the day of the transfer.
(2)
Treatment of section 467 loan.
If there is a transfer described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the following rules apply in determining the transferor's and the transferee's section 467 loans for the period after the transfer, the amount realized by the transferor, and the transferee's basis in the property:
(i) The beginning balance of the transferor's section 467 loan is equal to the net present value at the time of the transfer (but after giving effect to the transfer) of all subsequent amounts payable as fixed rent and interest on fixed rent to the transferor and all subsequent amounts payable as interest on prepaid fixed rent by the transferor. The transferor must continue to take into account interest on the transferor's section 467 loan balance after the date of the transfer.
(ii) The beginning balance of the transferee's section 467 loan is equal to the principal balance of the transferor's section 467 loan immediately before the transfer reduced (below zero, if appropriate) by the beginning balance of the transferor's section 467 loan. Amounts payable to the transferor are not taken into account in adjusting the transferee's section 467 loan balance.
(iii) If the beginning balance of the transferee's section 467 loan is negative, the transferor and transferee must treat the balance as a liability that is either assumed in connection with the transfer of the property or secured by the property acquired subject to the liability. If the beginning balance of the transferee's section 467 loan is positive, the transferor and transferee must treat the balance as an additional asset acquired in connection with the transfer of the property. In the case of a positive beginning balance of the transferee's section 467 loan, the transferee will have an initial cost basis in the section 467 loan equal to the lesser of the beginning balance of the loan or the aggregate consideration for the transfer of the property subject to the section 467 rental agreement and the transfer of the transferor's interest in the section 467 loan.

Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e). In each of these examples the transferor of property subject to a section 467 rental agreement is entitled to the rent for the day of the transfer. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i) Q and R enter into a section 467 rental agreement for a 5-year lease of personal property beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2004. The rental agreement provides that $0 of rent is allocated to 2000, 2001, and 2002, and $1,750,000 is allocated to each of the years 2003 and 2004. The rental agreement provides that the calendar year will be the rental period and that the rent allocated to each calendar year is payable on the last day of that calendar year. Assume that both Q and R are calendar year taxpayers and that 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate is 11 percent, compounded annually. Assume further that the rental agreement is a disqualified long-term agreement (as defined in § 1.467-3(b)(3)) and that the section 467 rent, the section 467 interest, and the section 467 loan balance would be the following amounts:

(ii) On December 31, 2002, Q sells the property subject to the section 467 rental agreement to P, an unrelated person, for $3,000,000. Q does not retain the right to receive any amounts payable by R under the rental agreement after the date of sale, but the agreement is not otherwise modified. At the time of the sale, Q's adjusted basis in the property is $975,000. Assume that, under § 1.467-1(f)(7), the disposition is not a substantial modification. Further, the Commissioner does not determine that the treatment of the agreement as a disqualified long-term agreement should be changed and, under § 1.467-1(f)(4)(iii), the agreement remains subject to constant rental accrual. Thus, under paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, section 467 rent and section 467 interest for periods after the disposition will be taken into account on the basis of constant rental
accrual applied to the terms of the entire agreement (as modified).
(iii) Under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the beginning balance of P's section 467 loan is $1,981,550.71. P's section 467 loan balance is computed by reducing the balance of the section 467 loan immediately before the transfer ($1,981,550.71) by the beginning balance of the transferor's section 467 loan ($0 because Q does not retain the right to receive any amounts payable under the rental agreement subsequent to the transfer).
(iv) Q will be treated as if it had received $1,981,550.71 from the disposition of the section 467 loan and $1,018,449.29 from the sale of the property subject to the rental agreement. Thus, Q's gain on the sale of the property is $43,449.29 ($1,018,449.29 amount realized less $975,000 adjusted basis). Q's gain is not subject to the recapture provisions of section 467(c) and paragraph (a) of this section because the rental agreement was disqualified under § 1.467-3(b)(1) and, thus, the requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section is not met. Q recognizes no gain on the disposition of the section 467 loan because Q's basis in the loan equals the amount considered received for the loan. Further, Q does not take into account any of the section 467 rent or section 467 interest attributable to periods after the transfer of the property.
(v) P is treated as if it had acquired the property and the positive balance in the transferee's section 467 loan. P's cost basis in the property is $1,018,449.29, and its cost basis in the section 467 loan immediately following the transfer is $1,981,550.71. P takes section 467 rent and section 467 interest into account for the calendar years 2002 and 2003 under the constant rental accrual method and, accordingly, treats payments received under the rental agreement as recoveries of the principal balance of the section 467 loan (as adjusted from time to time).

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as
Example 1,
except that on December 31, 2002, Q transfers the property to P in exchange for stock of P having a fair market value of $3,000,000 and the transaction meets the requirements of section 351(a).
(ii) Q is treated as having transferred two assets to P, the property subject to the rental agreement and the positive balance of the section 467 loan. Under section 351(a), because only stock of P is received by Q, Q does not recognize any of the gain realized on the transaction. Pursuant to section 358(a), the basis of Q in the P stock received in the exchange is the same as the aggregate basis of the property exchanged, or $2,956,550.71 (the sum of the balance of the section 467 loan, $1,981,550.71, and the adjusted basis of the property, $975,000). Q does not take into account any of the section 467 rent or section 467 interest attributable to periods after the transfer of the property.
(iii) P is treated as if it had acquired the property and the positive balance in the transferee's section 467 loan in the transaction. Pursuant to section 362(a), P's basis in each asset is the same as the basis of Q immediately preceding the transfer. Thus, the basis of P in the property subject to the rental agreement is $975,000, and the basis of P in the section 467 loan immediately following the transfer is $1,981,550.71. P takes section 467 rent and section 467 interest into account for the calendar years 2003 and 2004 under the constant rental accrual method and, accordingly, treats payments received under the rental agreement as recoveries of the principal balance of the section 467 loan (as adjusted from time to time).
(f)
Treatment of assignments by lessee and lessee-financed renewals
—(1)
Substitute lessee use.
If a lessee assigns its interest in a section 467 rental agreement to a substitute lessee, or if a period when a substitute lessee has the use of property subject to a section 467 rental agreement is otherwise included in the lease term under § 1.467-1(h)(6), the section 467 rent for a period is taken into account by the person having the use of the property during the period. The following rules apply in determining the section 467 rent and section 467 interest for the portion of the rental period ending immediately prior to the assignment:
(i) The section 467 rent and section 467 interest for the portion of the rental period ending immediately prior to the assignment are a pro rata portion of the section 467 rent and the section 467 interest, respectively, for the rental period. Such amounts are also taken into account in determining the lessee's section 467 loan balance, prior to any adjustment thereof that may be required under paragraph (h) of this section, immediately before the substitute lessee first has use of the property.
(ii) If the lessee is liable for the rent for the day that the substitute lessee first has use of the property, the substitute lessee's use shall be treated as beginning at the end of that day.
(iii) If the substitute lessee is liable for the rent for the day that the substitute lessee first has use of the property, the substitute lessee's use shall be treated as beginning at the beginning of that day.
(2)
Treatment of section 467 loan.
If, as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a lessee assigns its interest in a
section 467 rental agreement to a substitute lessee or a period when a substitute lessee has the use of property subject to a section 467 rental agreement is otherwise included in the lease term under § 1.467-1(h)(6), the following rules apply in determining the amount of the lessee's and the substitute lessee's section 467 loans for the period when the substitute lessee has use of the property and in computing the taxable income of the lessee and substitute lessee:
(i) The beginning balance of the lessee's section 467 loan is equal to the net present value, as of the time the substitute lessee first has use of the property (but after giving effect to the transfer of the right to use the property), of all amounts subsequently payable by the lessee as fixed rent and interest on fixed rent and all amounts subsequently payable as interest on prepaid fixed rent to the lessee. For purposes of this paragraph (f), any amount otherwise payable by the lessee is not treated as an amount subsequently payable by the lessee to the extent that such payment, if made by the lessee, would give rise to a right of contribution or other similar claim against the substitute lessee or any other person. The lessee must continue to take into account interest on the lessee's section 467 loan balance after the substitute lessee first has use of the property.
(ii) The beginning balance of the substitute lessee's section 467 loan is equal to the principal balance of the lessee's section 467 loan immediately before the substitute lessee first has use of the property reduced (below zero, if appropriate) by the beginning balance of the lessee's section 467 loan. Amounts payable by the lessee to any person other than the substitute lessee (or a related person) or payable to the lessee by any person other than the substitute lessee (or a related person) are not taken into account in adjusting the substitute lessee's section 467 loan balance.
(iii) If the beginning balance of the substitute lessee's section 467 loan is positive, the beginning balance is treated as—
(A) Gross receipts of the lessee for the taxable year in which the substitute lessee first has use of the property; and
(B) A liability that is either assumed in connection with the transfer of the leasehold interest to the substitute lessee or secured by property acquired subject to the liability.
(iv) If the beginning balance of the substitute lessee's section 467 loan is negative, the following rules apply:
(A) If the principal balance of the lessee's section 467 loan immediately before the substitute lessee first has use of the property was negative, any consideration paid by the substitute lessee to the lessee in conjunction with the transfer of the use of the property shall be treated as a nontaxable return of capital to the lessee to the extent that—
(
1
) The consideration does not exceed the amount owed to the lessee under the lessee's section 467 loan balance immediately before the substitute lessee first has use of the property; and
(
2
) The lessee has basis in the principal balance of the lessee's section 467 loan immediately before the substitute lessee first has use of the property.
(B) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(D) of this section, the excess, if any, of the beginning balance of the amount owed to the substitute lessee under the section 467 loan, over any consideration paid by the substitute lessee to the lessee in conjunction with the transfer of the use of the property, is treated as an amount incurred by the lessee for the taxable year in which the substitute lessee first has use of the property.
(C) To the extent the beginning balance of the amount owed to the substitute lessee under the section 467 loan exceeds any consideration paid by the substitute lessee to the lessee in conjunction with the transfer of the use of the property, repayments of the beginning balance are items of gross income of the substitute lessee in the taxable year in which repayment occurs (determined by applying any repayment first to the beginning balance of the substitute lessee's section 467 loan).
(D) Any amount incurred by the lessee under paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section with respect to a transfer of
the use of property (the current transfer) shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the extent that the lessee, in its capacity, if any, as a substitute lessee with respect to an earlier transfer of the use of the property would have recognized additional gross income under paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C) of this section if the current transfer had not occurred.
(v) For purposes of paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, repayments occur as the negative balance is amortized through the net accrual of rent and negative interest.
(3)
Lessor use.
If a period when the lessor has the use of property subject to a section 467 rental agreement is included in the lease term under § 1.467-1(h)(6), the section 467 rent for the period is not taken into account and the lessor is treated as a substitute lessee for purposes of this paragraph (f).
(4)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f). In each of these examples, the substitute lessee is liable for the rent for the day on which the substitute lessee first has use of the property subject to the section 467 rental agreement. Further, assume that in each example the lessee assignment is not a substantial modification under § 1.467-1(f). The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
of paragraph (e)(4) of this section, except that on December 31, 2001, R, the lessee, contracts to assign its entire remaining interest in the leasehold to S, a calendar year taxpayer. The assignment becomes effective at the beginning of January 1, 2002. Pursuant to the terms of the assignment, R agrees with S that R will make $1,400,000 of the $1,750,000 rental payment required on December 31, 2003.
(ii) Under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, R's section 467 loan balance as of the beginning of January 1, 2002, the time S first has use of the property, is $1,136,271.41 ($1,400,000/(1.11)2). Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, S's section 467 loan balance as of the beginning of January 1, 2002, is $114,759.98 (the principal balance of R's section 467 loan immediately before S has use of the property ($1,251,031.39), less R's section 467 loan balance at the beginning of January 1, 2002 ($1,136,271.41)).
(iii) Because S's $114,759.98 section 467 loan balance is positive, under paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, such amount is treated as gross receipts of R for 2002, R's taxable year in which S first has use of the property. R will treat the $114,759.98 as an amount received in exchange for the transfer of the leasehold interest. Under paragraph (f)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, S will treat that amount as a liability assumed in acquiring the leasehold interest. Thus, S's cost basis in the leasehold interest is $114,759.98.
(iv) Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, S takes the section 467 rent attributable to the property into account for the period beginning on January 1, 2002. For 2002, S takes section 467 interest into account based on S's section 467 loan balance at the beginning of 2002. S's amounts payable, section 467 rent, section 467 interest, and end-of-year section 467 loan balances for calendar years 2002 through 2004 are as follows:

(v) Under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, R must continue to take into account section 467 interest on R's section 467 loan balance after S first has use of the property. R's section 467 loan balance beginning when S first has use of the property is $1,136,271.41. R's section 467 interest and end-of-year section 467 loan balances for calendar years 2002 through 2003 are as follows:

# Example 2.
(i) On January 1, 2000, B leases tangible personal property from C for a period of five years. The rental agreement provides that the rental period is the calendar year and that rent payments are due at the end of the calendar year. The rental agreement does not provide for interest on prepaid rent. Assume that B and C are both calendar year taxpayers and that 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate is 10 percent, compounded annually. The rental agreement allocates rents and provides for payments of rent as follows:

(ii) The rental agreement has prepaid rent within the meaning of § 1.467-1(c)(3)(ii) because the cumulative amount of rent payable through the end of 2001 ($700,000) exceeds the cumulative amount of rent allocated to calendar years 2000 through 2002 ($600,000). Because the rental agreement does not provide for adequate interest on prepaid fixed rent, the rent for each calendar year during the lease term is the proportional rental amount, as described in § 1.467-2(c). The amounts payable, section 467 rent, section 467 interest, and end-of-year section 467 loan balances for each calendar year are as follows:

(iii) On December 31, 2001, B contracts to assign its entire remaining interest in the leasehold to D, a calendar year taxpayer. The assignment becomes effective at the beginning of January 1, 2002. D pays B $278,000 on January 1, 2002, in conjunction with the assignment of the leasehold interest. Under the terms of the assignment, B is not obligated to make any rental payments due after the assignment.
(iv) Under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, B's section 467 loan balance as of the beginning of January 1, 2002, the time D first has use of the property, is zero because D is obligated to make all rent payments due after the assignment of the leasehold interest. Under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, D's section 467 loan balance as of the beginning of January 1, 2002, is negative $280,126.46 (the principal balance of B's section 467 loan immediately before D has use of the property (negative $280,126.46), less B's section 467 loan balance when D first has use of the property (zero)). Because D's beginning section 467 loan balance is negative, paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section applies.
(v) Because B's $280,126.46 section 467 loan balance at the end of 2001 (that is, immediately before D has use of the property) is negative, paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section applies. B's loan balance is the amount owed to B under the section 467 loan and consists of the excess of B's payments to C over the net amount of rent and negative interest B has taken into account through the end of 2001. Thus, B's basis in the negative section 467 loan balance at the end of 2001 is $280,126.46. Because the $278,000 paid by D to B in conjunction with the transfer of the leasehold interest does not exceed the amount owed to B under the section 467 loan at the end of 2001, and does not exceed B's basis in that loan balance, under paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(A) of this section B treats the $278,000 payment from D as a nontaxable return of capital.
(vi) The beginning balance of the amount owed to D under the section 467 loan ($280,126.46) exceeds by $2,126.46 the $278,000 paid by D to B in conjunction with the transfer of the leasehold interest. Paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(B) of this section treats the $2,126.46 as an amount incurred by B in 2002, B's taxable year in which D first has use of the property. Paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(D) of this section does not apply to reduce the amount incurred by B because B is the original lessee under the section 467 rental agreement.
(vii) Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, D takes the section 467 rent into account for the period beginning when D first has use of the property. D takes section 467 interest into account based on a beginning section 467 loan balance of negative $280,126.46.
(viii) The beginning balance of the amount owed to D under the section 467 loan ($280,126.46) exceeds by $2,126.46 the $278,000 paid by D to B in conjunction with the transfer of the leasehold interest. Under paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C) of this section, D must include this amount in gross income in 2002, the year in which this amount of D's beginning section 467 loan balance is paid through the net accrual of rent and negative interest.
This inclusion in gross income ensures that the reductions in D's taxable income attributable to the section 467 rental agreement will not exceed the actual amount of D's expenditures.

—(1)
Substantial modifications.
The following rules apply to any substantial modification of a rental agreement occurring after May 18, 1999 unless the entire agreement (as modified) is treated as a single agreement under § 1.467-1(f)(4)(vi):
(i)
Treatment of pre-modification items.
The lessor and lessee must take pre-modification items (within the meaning of § 1.467-1(f)(5)(v)) into account under their method of accounting used before the modification to report income and expense attributable to the rental agreement.
(ii)
Computations with respect to post-modification items.
In computing section 467 rent, section 467 interest, and the amount of the section 467 loan with respect to post-modification items—
(A) Post-modification items are treated as provided under a rental agreement (the post-modification agreement) separate from the agreement under which pre-modification items are provided;
(B) The lease term of the post-modification agreement begins at the beginning of the first period for which rent other than pre-modification rent is provided; and
(C) The applicable Federal rate for the post-modification agreement is the applicable Federal rate in effect on the day on which the modification occurs.
(iii)
Adjustments
—(A)
Adjustment relating to certain prepayments.
If any payments before the beginning of the lease term of the post-modification agreement are post-modification items, the lessor and lessee must take into account, in the taxable year in which the modification occurs, any adjustment necessary to prevent duplication with respect to such payments or the omission of interest thereon for periods before the beginning of the lease term.
(B)
Adjustment relating to retroactive beginning of lease term.
If the lease term of a post-modification agreement begins before the date on which the modification occurs, the lessor and lessee must take into account in the taxable year in which the modification occurs any amount necessary to prevent the duplication or omission of rent or interest for the period after the beginning of the lease term of the post-modification agreement and before the beginning of the taxable year in which the modification occurs. For this purpose, the amount necessary to prevent duplication or omission is determined after taking into account any adjustments required by the Commissioner for taxable years ending prior to the beginning of the taxable year in which the modification occurs. In determining any adjustments required by the Commissioner for taxable years ending prior to the beginning of the taxable year in which the modification occurs, the Commissioner will disregard the modification.
(iv)
Coordination with rules relating to dispositions and assignments
—(A)
Dispositions.
If the modification involves a sale, exchange, or other disposition of the property subject to the rental agreement—
(
1
) Adjustments required under this paragraph (g) are taken into account before applying paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (e) of this section;
(
2
) The prior understated inclusion for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section is the sum of the prior understated inclusion with respect to pre-modification items and the prior understated inclusion with respect to post-modification items; and
(
3
) Paragraph (e) of this section applies separately with respect to pre-modification items and post-modification items.
(B)
Assignments.
If the modification involves an assignment of the lessee's interest in the rental agreement to a substitute lessee or a substitute lessee having use of the property during a period otherwise included in the lease term—
(
1
) Adjustments required under this paragraph (g) are taken into account before applying paragraph (f) of this section; and
(
2
) Paragraph (f) of this section applies separately with respect to pre-modification items and post-modification items.
(2)
Other modifications.
The following rules apply to a modification (other than a substantial modification) of a rental agreement occurring after May 18, 1999:
(i)
Computation of section 467 loan for modified agreement.
The amount of the section 467 loan relating to the agreement is computed as of the effective date of the modification. The section 467 rent and section 467 interest for periods before the effective date of the modification are determined, solely for purposes of computing the amount of the section 467 loan, under the terms of the entire agreement (as modified).
(ii)
Change in balance of section 467 loan.
(A) If the balance of the section 467 loan determined under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section is greater than the balance of the section 467 loan immediately before the effective date of the modification, the difference is taken into account, in the taxable year in which the modification occurs, as additional rent.
(B) If the balance of the section 467 loan determined under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section is less than the balance of the section 467 loan immediately before the effective date of the modification, the difference is taken into account, in the taxable year in which the modification occurs, as a reduction of the rent previously taken into account by the lessor and lessee.
(C) For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)(ii), a negative balance is less than a positive balance, a zero balance, or any other negative balance that is closer to a zero balance.
(iii)
Section 467 rent and interest after the modification.
The section 467 rent and section 467 interest for periods after the effective date of the modification are determined under the terms of the entire agreement (as modified).
(iv)
Applicable Federal rate.
The applicable Federal rate for the agreement does not change as a result of the modification.
(v)
Modification effective within a rental period.
If the effective date of a modification does not coincide with the beginning or end of a rental period under the agreement in effect before the modification, the section 467 rent and section 467 interest for the portion of the rental period ending immediately prior to the effective date of the modification are a pro rata portion of the section 467 rent and the section 467 interest, respectively, for the rental period. Such amounts are also taken into account in determining the section 467 loan balance, prior to any adjustment thereof that may be required under paragraph (h) of this section, immediately before the effective date of the modification. Similar rules apply with respect to the section 467 rent and section 467 interest determined under the terms of the entire agreement (as modified) for purposes of computing the amount of the section 467 loan under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section and the section 467 rent and section 467 interest for a partial rental period beginning on the effective date of the modification.
(vi)
Other adjustments.
The lessor and lessee must take into account, in the taxable year in which a retroactive modification occurs, any amount necessary to prevent the duplication or omission of rent or interest for the period before the beginning of the taxable year in which the modification occurs.
(vii)
Coordination with rules relating to dispositions and assignments.
If the modification involves a sale, exchange, or other disposition of the property subject to the rental agreement, an assignment of the lessee's interest in the rental agreement to a substitute lessee or a substitute lessee having use of the property during a period otherwise included in the lease term, adjustments required under this paragraph (g) are taken into account before applying paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (e), and (f) of this section.
(viii)
Exception for agreements entered into prior to effective date of section 467.
This paragraph (g)(2) does not apply to a modification of a rental agreement that is not subject to section 467 because of the effective date provisions of section 92(c) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-369 (98 Stat. 612)).
(3)
Adjustment by Commissioner.
If the entire agreement (as modified) is treated as a single agreement under § 1.467-1(f)(4)(vi), the Commissioner may require adjustments to taxable income to reflect the effect of the modification, including adjustments that are similar
to those required under paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
(4)
Effective date of modification.
The effective date of a modification of a rental agreement occurs at the earliest of—
(i) The date on which the modification occurs;
(ii) The beginning of the first period for which the amount of rent or interest provided under the entire agreement (as modified) differs from the amount of rent or interest provided under the agreement in effect before the modification;
(iii) The due date of the first payment, under either the entire agreement (as modified) or the agreement in effect before the modification, that is not identical, in due date and amount, under both such agreements;
(iv) The date, in the case of a modification involving the substitution of a new lessor, on which the property subject to the rental agreement is transferred; or
(v) The date, in the case of a modification involving the substitution of a new lessee, on which the substitute lessee first has use of the property subject to the rental agreement.
(5)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (g):

# Example 1.
(i) F, a cash method lessor, and G, an accrual method lessee, agree to a 7-year lease of tangible personal property for the period beginning on January 1, 1998, and ending on December 31, 2004. The rental agreement allocates $100,000 of rent to each calendar year during the lease term, such rent to be paid December 31 following the close of the calendar year to which it is allocated. Because the rental agreement does not provide for increasing rent, or deferred rent within the meaning of section 467(d)(1)(A), section 467 does not apply to the rental agreement.
(ii) Prior to January 1, 2001, G timely makes the $100,000 rental payments required as of December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2000. On January 1, 2001, F and G modify the rental agreement payment schedule to provide for a single final payment of $500,000 on December 31, 2004. Assume that the change is a substantial modification within the meaning of § 1.467-1(f)(5)(ii). Because the modification occurs after May 18, 1999, the post-modification agreement is treated, under § 1.467-1(f)(1), as a new agreement for purposes of determining whether it is a section 467 rental agreement.
(iii) Under § 1.467-1(f)(5)(v), the $200,000 of rent allocated to calendar years 1998 and 1999 (periods prior to the modification) constitutes pre-modification rent, and the $100,000 rent payments made on December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2000, constitute pre-modification payments. Although calendar year 2000 is also prior to the modification, the rent allocated to calendar year 2000 is not pre-modification rent and the related payment is not a pre-modification payment because the modification changed the time at which that rent is payable. See § 1.467-1(f)(5)(v)(A).
(iv) Under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, F and G take pre-modification rent and pre-modification payments into account under the method of accounting they used to report income and deductions attributable to the pre-modification agreement.
(v) Under § 1.467-1(f)(1)(i), the post-modification agreement providing rent for the period beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2004, is treated as a new rental agreement. This rental agreement allocates $100,000 of rent to each of the calendar years 2000 through 2004 and provides for a single rental payment of $500,000 on December 31, 2004. Because the post-modification agreement provides for deferred rent under § 1.467-1(c)(3)(i), section 467 applies. Further, the post-modification agreement does not provide for adequate interest on fixed rent, and therefore F and G must account for fixed rent and interest on fixed rent using proportional rental accrual. Under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, for their taxable years which include January 1, 2001, F and G must adjust reported rent for the difference between the rent taken into account for the calendar year 2000 under the unmodified agreement and the proportional rental amount for that year under the post-modification agreement.

# Example 2.
(i) On January 1, 2000, X, lessee, and Y, lessor, enter into a rental agreement for a 6-year lease of tangible personal property beginning January 1, 2000, and endingDecember 31, 2005. The agreement provides that the calendar year is the rental period and all rent payments are due on July 15 of all years in which a payment is required. Assume the agreement is not a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement within the meaning of § 1.467-3(b), and has the following allocation schedule and payment schedule:
Year
Allocation
Payment
2000
$800,000
$0
2001
900,000
0
2002
1,000,000
1,500,000
2003
1,000,000
1,500,000
2004
1,100,000
1,500,000
2005
1,200,000
1,500,000
(ii) The rental agreement has deferred rent within the meaning of § 1.467-1(c)(3)(i) because the rent allocated to 2000 is not payable until 2002 and some of the rent allocable to 2001 is not payable until 2003. Further, the rental agreement does not provide adequate interest on fixed rent within the meaning of § 1.467-2(b). Therefore, the rent amount to be accrued by X and Y for each rental period is the proportional rental amount, as described in § 1.467-2(c). Assuming 110 percent of the applicableFederal rate is 10 percent compounded annually, the section 467 rent, interest, and loan balances are as follows:
Year
Rent
Interest
Loan balance
2000
$736,949.55
$0
$736,949.55
2001
829,068.24

358,705.14
2005
1,105,424.33
35,870.53
0
(iii)(A) On January 1, 2004, X and Y agree that the $1,500,000 payment scheduled for July 15, 2005, will be made in three equal installments on June 15, 2005, July 15, 2005, and August 15, 2005. Under § 1.467-1(j)(2)(i)(C) (relating to timing conventions), the payment to be made on June 15, 2005, is treated as if it were payable on December 31, 2004, for purposes of determining present values and yield of the section 467 loan. Assume that this change, which results in the following allocation schedule and payment schedule, is not a substantial modification within the meaning of § 1.467-1(f)(5)(ii):
Year
Allocation
Payment
2000
$800,000
$0
2001
900,000
0
2002
1,000,000

2004
1,100,000
2,000,000
2005
1,200,000
1,000,000
(B) The agreement remains subject to proportional rental accrual after the modification because it has deferred rent and does not provide adequate interest on fixed rent within the meaning of § 1.467-2(b).
(iv) Because the modification occurs after May 18, 1999, and is not substantial within the meaning of § 1.467-1(f)(5)(ii), paragraph (g)(2) of this section applies. Under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, the amount of the section 467 loan relating to the modified agreement is computed as of the effective date of the modification, and, solely for purposes of recomputing the amount of the section 467 loan, the section 467 rent and section 467 interest for periods before the modification are determined under the terms of the entire agreement (as modified). In addition, the applicable Federal rate does not change as a result of the modification. Thus, the recomputed section 467 rent, interest, and loan balances are as follows:
Year
Rent
Interest
Loan balance
2000
$ 742,242.59
$ 0
$ 742,242.59
2001
835,022.91
74,224.26
1,651,489.76

165,148.98
1,244,441.98
2003
927,803.24
124,444.20
796,689.42
2004
1,020,583.56
79,668.94
(103,058.08)
2005
1,113,363.88
(10,305.80)
0
(v) Under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section, the difference between the section 467 loan balance immediately before the effective date of the modification and the recomputed section 467 loan balance as of the effective date of the modification is taken into account. In this example, the loan balance immediately before the effective date of the modification is $768,545.01 and the recomputed loan balance as of the effective date of the modification is $796,689.42. Thus, because the recomputed loan balance exceeds the original loan balance, the difference ($28,144.41) is taken into account, in the taxable year in which the modification occurs, as additional rent. Beginning on January 1, 2004, section 467 rent and interest are taken into account by X and Y in accordance with the recomputed rent schedule set forth in paragraph (iv) of this example.
(h)
Omissions or duplications
—(1)
In general.
In applying the rules of this section in conjunction with the rules of §§ 1.467-1 through 1.467-5, adjustments must be made to the extent necessary to prevent the omission or duplication of items of income, deduction, gain, or loss. For example, if a transferee lessor acquires property subject to a section 467 rental agreement at other than the
beginning or end of a rental period, and the transferee lessor's beginning section 467 loan balance differs from the transferor lessor's section 467 loan balance immediately prior to the transfer, it will be necessary to treat the rental period that includes the day of transfer as consisting of two rental periods, one beginning at the beginning of the rental period that includes the day of transfer and ending with or immediately prior to the transfer and one beginning with or immediately after the transfer and ending immediately prior to the beginning of the succeeding rental period. Because the substitution of two rental periods for one rental period may change the proportional rental amount or constant rental amount, the change in rental periods should be treated as a modification of the rental agreement that occurs immediately prior to the transfer. The change in rental periods, by itself, is not treated as a substantial modification of the rental agreement although the substitution of a new lessor may constitute a substantial modification of the rental agreement. Likewise, § 1.467-1(j)(2), which provides rules regarding when amounts are treated as payable, is designed to simplify calculations of present values, section 467 loan balances, and proportional and constant rental amounts. These simplifying conventions assume that there will be no change in the lessor or lessee under a section 467 rental agreement and that the terms of the section 467 rental agreement will not be modified. Therefore, as illustrated in the example in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, when actual events do not reflect these assumptions, it may be necessary to alter the application of these rules to properly reflect taxable income.
(2)
Example.
The following example illustrates an application of this paragraph (h):

# Example.
(i) J leases tangible personal property from K for five years beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2004. Under the rental agreement, rent is payable on July 15 of the calendar year to which it is allocated. Both J and K treat the calendar year as the rental period. The allocation of rent and payments of rent required under the rental agreement are as follows:
Calendar year
Rent
Payments
2000
$200,000
$450,000
2001
200,000

200,000
2003
200,000
100,000
2004
200,000
0
(ii) The rental agreement does not provide for interest on prepaid rent. The rental agreement has prepaid rent under § 1.467-1(c)(3)(ii) because the rent payable at the end of 2000 exceeds the cumulative amount of rent allocated to 2000 and 2001. Therefore, J and K must take section 467 rent into account under the proportional rental method of § 1.467-2(c). Assume that 110 percent of the applicable Federal rate is 10 percent, compounded annually. The section 467 rent, section 467 interest, amounts payable, and section 467 loan balances for each of the calendar years under the terms of the rental agreement are as follows:
Calendar Year
Section 467 rent
Section 467 interest

(20,007.07)

(iii) On January 1, 2002, J and K amend the terms of the rental agreement to advance the due date of the $200,000 payment originally due on July 15, 2002, to June 15, 2002. This change in the payment schedule constitutes a modification of the terms of the rental agreement within the meaning of § 1.467-1(f)(5)(i). Assume, however, that the change is not a substantial modification within the meaning of § 1.467-1(f)(5)(ii). Because the modification occurs after May 18, 1999, and is not substantial, paragraph (g)(2) of this section applies. Thus, the section 467 loan balance at the beginning of 2002 must be recomputed as if the June 15, 2002, payment date had been included in the terms of the pre-modification rental agreement. If this had been the case, the section 467 rent, section 467 interest, amounts payable, and section 467 loan balances for each of the calendar years under the terms of the rental agreement would have been as follows:
Calendar
Section 467 rent

(iv) Section 1.467-4(b)(3) incorporates the conventions of § 1.467-1(j)(2) in determining when amounts are treated as payable for purposes of determining the section 467 loan balance. Section 1.467-1(j)(2)(i)(C) treats amounts payable during the first half of any rental period except the first rental period as payable on the last day of the preceding rental period. Therefore, because June 15, 2002, occurs in the first half of 2002, in determining the section 467 loan balance at the beginning of 2002 under the amended terms of the rental agreement, the $200,000 payment due on June 15, 2002, is treated as payable on December 31, 2001.
(v) Under paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, if the recomputed section 467 loan balance is less than the section 467 loan balance immediately before the modification, the difference is taken into account as a reduction of the rent previously taken into account by the lessor and the lessee. In this example, the recomputed section 467 loan balance immediately after the modification is negative $474,513.10 and the section 467 loan balance immediately before the modification is negative $282,837.29. However, the section 467 loan balance immediately before the modification does not take into account the $200,000 payment originally payable on July 15, 2002, whereas, under the conventions of § 1.467-1(j)(2)(i)(C), the recomputed section 467 loan balance immediately after the modification takes into account that $200,000 payment because it is now payable in the first half of the rental period (June 15). Under these circumstances, if the recomputed section 467 loan balance immediately after the modification is treated as negative $474,513.10 for purposes of applying paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, K's gross income and J's deductions attributable to the section 467 rental agreement will be understated by $200,000. Therefore, under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, only for purposes of applying paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the $200,000 payment due on June 15, 2002, should not be taken into account in determining the recomputed section 467 loan balance immediately after the modification.
[T.D. 8820, 64 FR 26867, May 18, 1999, as amended by T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6238, Jan. 19, 2017]
§ 1.467-8
Automatic consent to change to constant rental accrual for certain rental agreements.
(a)
General rule.
For the first taxable year ending after May 18, 1999, a taxpayer may change to the constant rental accrual method, as described in § 1.467-3, for all of its section 467 rental agreements described in paragraph (b) of this section. A change to the constant rental accrual method is a change in method of accounting to which the provisions of sections 446 and 481 and the regulations thereunder apply. A taxpayer changing its method of accounting in accordance with this section must follow the automatic change in accounting method provisions of Rev. Proc. 98-60 (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) except, for purposes of this paragraph (a), the scope limitations in section 4.02 of Rev. Proc. 98-60 are not applicable. Taxpayers changing their method of accounting in accordance with this section must do so for all of their section 467 rental agreements described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Agreements to which automatic consent applies.
A section 467 rental agreement is described in this paragraph (b) if—
(1) The property subject to the section 467 rental agreement is financed with an “exempt facility bond” within the meaning of section 142;
(2) The facility subject to the section 467 rental agreement is described in section 142(a)(1), (2), (3), or (12);
(3) The section 467 rental agreement does not include a specific allocation of fixed rent within the meaning of § 1.467-1(c)(2)(ii)(A)(
2
); and
(4) The section 467 rental agreement was entered into on or before May 18, 1999.

§ 1.468A-1
Nuclear decommissioning costs; general rules.
(a)
Introduction.
Section 468A provides an elective method for taking into account nuclear decommissioning costs for Federal income tax purposes. In general, an eligible taxpayer that elects the application of section 468A pursuant to the rules contained in § 1.468A-7 is allowed a deduction (as determined under § 1.468A-2) for the taxable year in which the taxpayer makes a cash payment to a nuclear decommissioning fund. Taxpayers using an accrual method of accounting that do not elect the application of section 468A are not allowed a deduction for nuclear decommissioning costs prior to the taxable year in which economic performance occurs with respect to such costs (
see
section 461(h)).
(b)
Definitions.
The following terms are defined for purposes of section 468A and §§ 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9:
(1) The term
eligible taxpayer
means any taxpayer that possesses a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant (including a nuclear power plant that is under construction).
(2) The term
qualifying interest
means—
(i) A direct ownership interest; and
(ii) A leasehold interest in any portion of a nuclear power plant if—
(A) The holder of the leasehold interest is primarily liable under Federal or State law for decommissioning such portion of the nuclear power plant; and
(B) No other person establishes a nuclear decommissioning fund with respect to such portion of the nuclear power plant.
(3) The term
direct ownership interest
includes an interest held as a tenant in common or joint tenant, but does not include stock in a corporation that owns a nuclear power plant or an interest in a partnership that owns a nuclear power plant. Thus, in the case of a partnership that owns a nuclear power plant, the election under section 468A must be made by the partnership and not by the partners. In the case of an unincorporated organization described in § 1.761-2(a)(3) that elects under section 761(a) to be excluded from the application of subchapter K, each taxpayer that is a co-owner of the nuclear power plant is eligible to make a separate election under section 468A.
(4) The terms
nuclear decommissioning fund
and
qualified nuclear decommissioning fund
mean a fund that satisfies the requirements of § 1.468A-5. The term
nonqualified fund
means a fund that does not satisfy those requirements.
(5) The term
nuclear power plant
means any nuclear power reactor that is used predominantly in the trade or business of the furnishing or sale of electric energy. Each unit (that is, nuclear reactor) located on a multi-unit site is a separate nuclear power plant. The term
nuclear power plant
also includes the portion of the common facilities of a multi-unit site allocable to a unit on that site.
(6) The term
nuclear decommissioning costs
or
decommissioning costs
includes all otherwise deductible expenses to be incurred in connection with the entombment, decontamination, dismantlement, removal and disposal of the structures, systems and components of a nuclear power plant, whether that nuclear power plant will continue to produce electric energy or has permanently ceased to produce electric energy. Such term includes all otherwise deductible expenses to be incurred in connection with the preparation for decommissioning, such as engineering and other planning expenses, and all otherwise deductible expenses to be incurred with respect to the plant after the actual decommissioning occurs, such as physical security and radiation monitoring expenses. Such term also includes costs incurred in connection with the construction, operation, and ultimate decommissioning of a facility used solely to store, pending acceptance by the government for permanent storage or disposal, spent nuclear fuel generated by the nuclear power plant or plants located on the same site as the storage facility. Such term does not include otherwise deductible expenses to be incurred in connection with the disposal of spent nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-425). An expense is otherwise deductible for purposes of this paragraph (b)(6) if it would be deductible under chapter 1 of the Internal
Revenue Code without regard to section 280B.
(i) For the purpose of this title, the term
nuclear decommissioning costs
or
decommissioning costs
includes all expenses related to land improvements and otherwise deductible expenses to be incurred in connection with the entombment, decontamination, dismantlement, removal and disposal of the structures, systems and components of a nuclear power plant, whether that nuclear power plant will continue to produce electric energy or has permanently ceased to produce electric energy. Such term includes all expenses related to land improvements and otherwise deductible expenses to be incurred in connection with the preparation for decommissioning, such as engineering and other planning expenses, and all otherwise deductible expenses to be incurred with respect to the plant after the actual decommissioning occurs, such as physical security and radiation monitoring expenses. An expense is otherwise deductible for purposes of this paragraph (b)(6) if it would be deductible or recoverable through depreciation or amortization under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code without regard to section 280B.
(ii) The term nuclear decommissioning costs or decommissioning costs, as applicable to this title, also includes expenses incurred in connection with the construction, operation, and ultimate decommissioning of a facility used solely to store, pending delivery to a permanent repository or disposal, spent nuclear fuel generated by one or more nuclear power plants (for example, an Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation). Such term does not include otherwise deductible expenses to be incurred in connection with the disposal of spent nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-425).
(7) The term
public utility commission
means any State or political subdivision thereof, any agency, instrumentality or judicial body of the United States, or any judicial body, commission or other similar body of the District of Columbia or of any State or any political subdivision thereof that establishes or approves rates for the furnishing or sale of electric energy.
(8) The term
ratemaking proceeding
means any proceeding before a public utility commission in which rates for the furnishing or sale of electric energy are established or approved. Such term includes a generic proceeding that applies to two or more taxpayers that are subject to the jurisdiction of a single public utility commission.
(9) The term
special transfer
means any transfer of funds to a qualified nuclear decommissioning fund pursuant to § 1.468A-8.
(c)
Special rules applicable to certain experimental nuclear facilities.
(1) The owner of a qualifying interest in an experimental nuclear facility possesses a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section if such person is engaged in the trade or business of the furnishing or sale of electric energy.
(2) An owner of stock in a corporation that owns an experimental nuclear facility possesses a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if—
(i) Such stockholder satisfies the conditions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and
(ii) The corporation that directly owns the facility is not engaged in the trade or business of the furnishing or sale of electric energy.
(3) For purposes of this paragraph (c), an experimental nuclear facility is a nuclear power reactor that is used predominantly for the purpose of conducting experimentation and research.
[T.D. 9512, 75 FR 80701, Dec. 23, 2010, as amended by T.D. 9906, 85 FR 55190, Sept. 4, 2020]
§ 1.468A-2
Treatment of electing taxpayer.
(a)
In general.
An eligible taxpayer that elects the application of section 468A pursuant to the rules contained in § 1.468A-7 (an electing taxpayer) is allowed a deduction for the taxable year in which the taxpayer makes a cash payment (or is deemed to make a cash payment as provided in paragraph (c) of this section) to a nuclear decommissioning fund and for any taxable year in which a deduction is allowed for a special transfer described in § 1.468A-8.
The amount of the deduction for any taxable year equals the total amount of cash payments made (or deemed made) by the electing taxpayer to a nuclear decommissioning fund (or nuclear decommissioning funds) during such taxable year under this section, plus any amount allowable as a deduction in that taxable year for a special transfer described in § 1.468A-8. The amount of a special transfer permitted under § 1.468A-8 is not treated as a cash payment for purposes of this paragraph (a), and a taxpayer making a special transfer is allowed a ratable deduction in each taxable year during the remaining useful life of the nuclear power plant for the special transfer. A payment may not be made (or deemed made) to a nuclear decommissioning fund before the first taxable year in which all of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The construction of the nuclear power plant to which the nuclear decommissioning fund relates has commenced.
(2) A ruling amount is applicable to the nuclear decommissioning fund (
see
§ 1.468A-3).
(b)
Limitation on payments to a nuclear decommissioning fund
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the maximum amount of cash payments made (or deemed made) to a nuclear decommissioning fund under paragraph (a) of this section during any taxable year shall not exceed the ruling amount applicable to the nuclear decommissioning fund for such taxable year (as determined under § 1.468A-3).
(2)
Excess contributions not deductible.
If the amount of cash payments made (or deemed made) to a nuclear decommissioning fund during any taxable year exceeds the limitation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the excess is not deductible by the electing taxpayer. In addition,
see
paragraph (c) of § 1.468A-5 for rules which provide that the Internal Revenue Service may disqualify a nuclear decommissioning fund if the amount of cash payments made (or deemed made) to a nuclear decommissioning fund during any taxable year exceeds the limitation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(3)
Special transfer disregarded.
The amount of a special transfer permitted under § 1.468A-8 is not treated as a cash payment for purposes of this paragraph (b).
(c)
Deemed payment rules
—(1)
In general.
The amount of any cash payment made by an electing taxpayer to a nuclear decommissioning fund on or before the 15th day of the third calendar month after the close of any taxable year (the deemed payment deadline date) shall be deemed made during such taxable year if the electing taxpayer irrevocably designates the amount as relating to such taxable year on its timely filed Federal income tax return for such taxable year (
see
§ 1.468A-7(b)(4)(iii) and (iv) for rules relating to such designation).
(2)
Cash payment by customer.
The amount of any cash payment made by a customer of an electing taxpayer to a nuclear decommissioning fund of such electing taxpayer shall be deemed made by the electing taxpayer if the amount is included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer in the manner prescribed by section 88 and § 1.88-1.
(d)
Treatment of distributions
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the amount of any actual or deemed distribution from a nuclear decommissioning fund shall be included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer for the taxable year in which the distribution occurs. The amount of any distribution of property equals the fair market value of the property on the date of the distribution.
See
§ 1.468A-5(c) and (d) for rules relating to the deemed distribution of the assets of a nuclear decommissioning fund in the case of a disqualification or termination of the fund. A distribution from a nuclear decommissioning fund shall include an expenditure from the fund or the use of the fund's assets—
(i) To satisfy, in whole or in part, the liability of the electing taxpayer for decommissioning costs of the nuclear power plant to which the fund relates; and
(ii) To pay administrative costs and other incidental expenses of the fund.
(2)
Exceptions to inclusion in gross income
—(i)
Payment of administrative costs and incidental expenses.
The amount of any payment by a nuclear decommissioning fund for administrative costs
or other incidental expenses of such fund (as defined in § 1.468A-5(a)(3)(ii)) shall not be included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer unless such amount is paid to the electing taxpayer (in which case the amount of the payment is included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer under section 61).
(ii)
Withdrawals of excess contributions.
The amount of a withdrawal of an excess contribution (as defined in § 1.468A-5(c)(2)(ii)) by an electing taxpayer pursuant to the rules of § 1.468A-5(c)(2) shall not be included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer.
See
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, which provides that the payment of such amount to the nuclear decommissioning fund is not deductible by the electing taxpayer.
(iii)
Actual distributions of amounts included in gross income as deemed distributions.
If the amount of a deemed distribution is included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer for the taxable year in which the deemed distribution occurs, no further amount is required to be included in gross income when the amount of the deemed distribution is actually distributed by the nuclear decommissioning fund. The amount of a deemed distribution is actually distributed by a nuclear decommissioning fund as the first actual distributions are made by the nuclear decommissioning fund on or after the date of the deemed distribution.
(e)
Deduction when economic performance occurs.
An electing taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting is allowed a deduction for nuclear decommissioning costs no earlier than the taxable year in which economic performance occurs with respect to such costs (
see
section 461(h)(2)). The amount of nuclear decommissioning costs that is deductible under this paragraph (e) is determined without regard to section 280B (
see
§ 1.468A-1(b)(6)). A deduction is allowed under this paragraph (e) whether or not a deduction was allowed with respect to such costs under section 468A(a) and paragraph (a) of this section for an earlier taxable year.
[T.D. 9512, 75 FR 80701, Dec. 23, 2010]
§ 1.468A-3
Ruling amount.
(a)
In general.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g) of this section or in § 1.468A-8 (relating to deductions for special transfers into a nuclear decommissioning fund), an electing taxpayer is allowed a deduction under section 468A(a) for the taxable year in which the taxpayer makes a cash payment (or is deemed to make a cash payment) to a nuclear decommissioning fund only if the taxpayer has received a schedule of ruling amounts for the nuclear decommissioning fund that includes a ruling amount for such taxable year. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) or (5) of this section, a schedule of ruling amounts for a nuclear decommissioning fund (
schedule of ruling amounts
) is a ruling (within the meaning of § 601.201(a)(2) of this chapter) specifying the annual payments (ruling amounts) that, over the taxable years remaining in the funding period as of the date the schedule first applies, will result in a projected balance of the nuclear decommissioning fund as of the last day of the funding period equal to (and in no event greater than) the amount of decommissioning costs allocable to the fund. The projected balance of a nuclear decommissioning fund as of the last day of the funding period shall be calculated by taking into account the fair market value of the assets of the fund as of the first day of the first taxable year to which the schedule of ruling amounts applies and the estimated rate of return to be earned by the assets of the fund after payment of the estimated administrative costs and incidental expenses to be incurred by the fund (as defined in § 1.468A-5(a)(3)(ii)), including all Federal, State and local income taxes to be incurred by the fund (the after-tax rate of return).
See
paragraph (c) of this section for a definition of funding period and paragraph (d) of this section for guidance with respect to the amount of decommissioning costs allocable to a fund.
(2) Each schedule of ruling amounts must be consistent with the principles and provisions of this section and must be based on reasonable assumptions concerning—
(i) The after-tax rate of return to be earned by the assets of the qualified nuclear decommissioning fund;
(ii) The total estimated cost of decommissioning the nuclear power plant (
see
paragraph (d)(2) of this section); and
(iii) The frequency of contributions to a nuclear decommissioning fund for a taxable year (for example, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual contributions).
(3) The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) shall provide a schedule of ruling amounts that is identical to the schedule of ruling amounts proposed by the taxpayer in connection with the taxpayer's request for a schedule of ruling amounts (
see
paragraph (e)(2)(viii) of this section), but no schedule of ruling amounts shall be provided unless the taxpayer's proposed schedule of ruling amounts is consistent with the principles and provisions of this section and is based on reasonable assumptions. If a proposed schedule of ruling amounts is not consistent with the principles and provisions of this section or is not based on reasonable assumptions, the taxpayer may propose an amended schedule of ruling amounts that is consistent with such principles and provisions and is based on reasonable assumptions.
(4) The taxpayer bears the burden of demonstrating that the proposed schedule of ruling amounts is consistent with the principles and provisions of this section and is based on reasonable assumptions. If a public utility commission established or approved the currently applicable rates for the furnishing or sale by the taxpayer of electricity from the plant, the taxpayer can generally satisfy this burden of proof by demonstrating that the schedule of ruling amounts is calculated using the assumptions used by the public utility commission in its most recent order. In addition, a taxpayer that owns an interest in a deregulated nuclear plant may submit assumptions used by a public utility commission that formerly had regulatory jurisdiction over the plant as support for the assumptions used in calculating the taxpayer's proposed schedule of ruling amounts, with the understanding that the assumptions used by the public utility commission may be given less weight if they are out of date or were developed in a proceeding for a different taxpayer. The use of other industry standards, such as the assumptions underlying the taxpayer's most recent financial assurance filing with the NRC, are an alternative means of demonstrating that the taxpayer has calculated its proposed schedule of ruling amounts on a reasonable basis. Consistency with financial accounting statements is not sufficient, in the absence of other supporting evidence, to meet the taxpayer's burden of proof under this paragraph (a)(4).
(5) The IRS will approve, at the request of the taxpayer, a formula or method for determining a schedule of ruling amounts (rather than providing a schedule specifying a dollar amount for each taxable year) if the formula or method is consistent with the principles and provisions of this section and is based on reasonable assumptions.
See
paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section for a special rule relating to the mandatory review of ruling amounts that are determined pursuant to a formula or method.
(6) The IRS may, in its discretion, provide a schedule of ruling amounts that is determined on a basis other than the rules of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section if—
(i) In connection with its request for a schedule of ruling amounts, the taxpayer explains the need for special treatment and sets forth an alternative basis for determining the schedule of ruling amounts; and
(ii) The IRS determines that special treatment is consistent with the purpose of section 468A.
(b)
Level funding limitation.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the ruling amount specified in a schedule of ruling amounts for any taxable year in the funding period (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) shall not be less than the ruling amount specified in such schedule for any earlier taxable year.
(2) The ruling amount specified in a schedule of ruling amounts for a taxable year after the end of the funding period may be less than the ruling
amount specified in such schedule for an earlier taxable year.
(3) The ruling amount specified in a schedule of ruling amounts for the last taxable year in the funding period may be less than the ruling amount specified in such schedule for an earlier taxable year if, when annualized, the amount specified for the last taxable year is not less than the amount specified for such earlier taxable year. The amount specified for the last taxable year is annualized by—
(i) Determining the number of days between the beginning of the taxable year and the end of the plant's estimated useful life;
(ii) Dividing the amount specified for the last taxable year by such number of days; and
(iii) Multiplying the result by the number of days in the last taxable year (generally 365).
(c)
Funding period
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the funding period for a nuclear decommissioning fund is the period that—
(i) Begins on the first day of the first taxable year for which a deductible payment is made (or deemed made) to such nuclear decommissioning fund (
see
§ 1.468A-2(a) for rules relating to the first taxable year for which a payment may be made (or deemed made) to a nuclear decommissioning fund); and
(ii) Ends on the last day of the taxable year that includes the last day of the estimated useful life of the nuclear power plant to which the nuclear decommissioning fund relates.
(2)
Estimated useful life.
The last day of the estimated useful life of a nuclear power plant is determined under the following rules:
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section—
(A) The last day of the estimated useful life of a nuclear power plant that has been included in rate base for ratemaking purposes in any ratemaking proceeding that established rates for a period before January 1, 2006, is the date used in the first such ratemaking proceeding as the estimated date on which the nuclear power plant will no longer be included in the taxpayer's rate base for ratemaking purposes;
(B) The last day of the estimated useful life of a nuclear power plant that is not described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section is the last day of the estimated useful life of the plant determined as of the date it is placed in service;
(C) A taxpayer with an interest in a plant that is not described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section may use any reasonable method for determining the last day of such estimated useful life; and
(D) A reasonable method for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section may include use of the period for which a public utility commission has included a comparable nuclear power plant in rate base for ratemaking purposes.
(ii) If it can be established that the estimated useful life of the nuclear power plant will end on a date other than the date determined under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, the taxpayer may use such other date as the last day of the estimated useful life but is not required to do so. If the last day of the estimated useful life was determined under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section and the most recent ratemaking proceeding used an alternative date as the estimated date on which the nuclear power plant will no longer be included rate base, the most recent ratemaking proceeding will generally be treated as establishing such alternative date as the last day of the estimated useful life.
(iii) The estimated useful life of a nuclear power plant determined for purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section may end on a different date from the estimated useful life of a nuclear power plant determined for purposes of § 1.468A-8(b)(1) and (c)(1).
(d)
Decommissioning costs allocable to a fund.
The amount of decommissioning costs allocable to a nuclear decommissioning fund is determined for purposes of this section by applying the following rules and definitions:
(1)
General rule.
The amount of decommissioning costs allocable to a nuclear decommissioning fund is the taxpayer's share of the total estimated cost of decommissioning the nuclear power plant to which the fund relates.
(2)
Total estimated cost of decommissioning.
Under paragraph (a)(2) of this
section, the taxpayer must demonstrate the reasonableness of the assumptions concerning the total estimated cost of decommissioning the nuclear power plant.
(3)
Taxpayer's share.
The taxpayer's share of the total estimated cost of decommissioning a nuclear power plant equals the total estimated cost of decommissioning such nuclear power plant multiplied by the percentage of such nuclear power plant that the qualifying interest of the taxpayer represents. (
See
§ 1.468A-1(b)(2) for circumstances in which a taxpayer possesses a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant).
(e)
Manner of requesting schedule of ruling amounts
—(1)
In general.
(i) In order to receive a ruling amount for any taxable year, a taxpayer must file a request for a schedule of ruling amounts that complies with the requirements of this paragraph (e), the applicable procedural rules set forth in § 601.201(e) of this chapter (Statement of Procedural Rules), and the requirements of any applicable revenue procedure that is in effect on the date the request is filed.
(ii) A separate request for a schedule of ruling amounts is required for each nuclear decommissioning fund established by a taxpayer. (
See
paragraph (a) of § 1.468A-5 for rules relating to the number of nuclear decommissioning funds that a taxpayer can establish.)
(iii) Except as provided by §§ 1.468A-5(a)(1)(iv) (relating to certain unincorporated organizations that may be taxable as corporations) and 1.468A-8 (relating to a special transfer under section 468A(f)(1)), a request for a schedule of ruling amounts must not contain a request for a ruling on any other issue, whether the issue involves section 468A or another section of the Internal Revenue Code.
(iv) In the case of an affiliated group of corporations that join in the filing of a consolidated return, the common parent of the group may request a schedule of ruling amounts for each member of the group that possesses a qualifying interest in the same nuclear power plant by filing a single submission with the IRS.
(v) The IRS will not provide or revise a ruling amount applicable to a taxable year in response to a request for a schedule of ruling amounts that is filed after the deemed payment deadline date (as defined in § 1.468A-2(c)(1)) for such taxable year. In determining the date when a request is filed, the principles of sections 7502 and 7503 shall apply.
(vi) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(vii) of this section, a request for a schedule of ruling amounts shall be considered filed only if such request complies substantially with the requirements of this paragraph (e).
(vii) If a request does not comply substantially with the requirements of this paragraph (e), the IRS will notify the taxpayer of that fact. If the information or materials necessary to comply substantially with the requirements of this paragraph (e) are provided to the IRS within 30 days after this notification, the request will be considered filed on the date of the original submission. In addition, the request will be considered filed on the date of the original submission in a case in which the information and materials are provided more than 30 days after the notification if the IRS determines that the electing taxpayer made a good faith effort to provide the applicable information or materials within 30 days after notification and also determines that treating the request as filed on the date of the original submission is consistent with the purposes of section 468A. In any other case in which the information or materials necessary to comply substantially with the requirements of this paragraph (e) are not provided within 30 days after the notification, the request will be considered filed on the date that all information or materials necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (e) are provided.

(f)
Review and revision of schedule of ruling amounts
—(1)
Mandatory review.
(i) Any taxpayer that has obtained a schedule of ruling amounts pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section must file a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts on or before the deemed payment deadline date for the 10th taxable year that begins after the taxable year in which the most recent schedule of ruling amounts was received. If the taxpayer calculated its most recent schedule of ruling amounts on any basis other than an order issued by a public utility commission, the taxpayer must file a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts on or before the deemed payment deadline date for the 5th taxable year that begins after the taxable year in which the most recent schedule of ruling amounts was received.
(ii)(A) Any taxpayer that has obtained a formula or method for determining a schedule of ruling amounts for any taxable year under paragraph (a)(5) of this section must file a request for a revised schedule on or before the earlier of the deemed payment deadline for the 5th taxable year that begins after its taxable year in which the
most recent formula or method was approved or the deemed payment deadline for the first taxable year that begins after a taxable year in which there is a substantial variation in the ruling amount determined under the most recent formula or method. There is a substantial variation in the ruling amount determined under the formula or method in effect for a taxable year if the ruling amount for the year and the ruling amount for any earlier year since the most recent formula or method was approved differ by more than 50 percent of the smaller amount.
(B) Any taxpayer that has determined its ruling amount for any taxable year under a formula prescribed by § 1.468A-6 (which prescribes ruling amounts for the taxable year in which there is a disposition of a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant) must file a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts on or before the deemed payment deadline for its first taxable year that begins after the disposition.
(iii) A taxpayer requesting a schedule of deduction amounts for a nuclear decommissioning fund under § 1.468A-8 must also request a revised schedule of ruling amounts for the fund. The revised schedule of ruling amounts must apply beginning with the first taxable year following the first year in which a deduction is allowed under the schedule of deduction amounts.
(iv) If the operating license of the nuclear power plant to which a nuclear decommissioning fund relates is renewed, the taxpayer maintaining the fund must request a revised schedule of ruling amounts. The request for the revised schedule must be submitted on or before the deemed payment deadline for the taxable year that includes the date on which the operating license is renewed.
(v) A request for a schedule of ruling amounts required by this paragraph (f)(1) must be made in accordance with the rules of paragraph (e) of this section. If a taxpayer does not properly file a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts by the date provided in paragraph (f)(1)(i), (ii) or (iv) of this section (whichever is applicable), the taxpayer's ruling amount for the first taxable year to which the revised schedule of ruling amounts would have applied and for all succeeding taxable years until a new schedule is obtained shall be zero dollars, unless, in its discretion, the IRS provides otherwise in such new schedule of ruling amounts. Thus, if a taxpayer is required to request a revised schedule of ruling amounts under any provision of this section, and each ruling amount in the revised schedule would equal zero dollars, the taxpayer may, instead of requesting a new schedule of ruling amounts, begin treating the ruling amounts under its most recent schedule as equal to zero dollars.
(2)
Elective review.
Any taxpayer that has obtained a schedule of ruling amounts pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section can request a revised schedule of ruling amounts. Such a request must be made in accordance with the rules of paragraph (e) of this section; thus, the IRS will not provide a revised ruling amount applicable to a taxable year in response to a request for a schedule of ruling amounts that is filed after the deemed payment deadline date for such taxable year (
see
paragraph (e)(1)(vi) of this section).
(3)
Determination of revised schedule of ruling amounts.
A revised schedule of ruling amounts for a nuclear decommissioning fund shall be determined under this section without regard to any schedule of ruling amounts for such nuclear decommissioning fund that was issued prior to such revised schedule. Thus, a ruling amount specified in a revised schedule of ruling amounts for any taxable year in the funding period can be less than one or more ruling amounts specified in a prior schedule of ruling amounts for a prior taxable year.
(g)
Special rule permitting payments to a nuclear decommissioning fund before receipt of an initial or revised ruling amount applicable to a taxable year.
(1) If an electing taxpayer has filed a timely request for an initial or revised ruling amount for a taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2006, and does not receive the ruling amount on or before the deemed payment deadline date for such taxable year, the taxpayer may make a payment to a nuclear decommissioning fund on the basis of the ruling amount proposed in the taxpayer's
request. Thus, under the preceding sentence, an electing taxpayer may make a payment to a nuclear decommissioning fund for such taxable year that does not exceed the ruling amount proposed by the taxpayer for such taxable year in a timely filed request for a schedule of ruling amounts.
(2) If an electing taxpayer makes a payment to a nuclear decommissioning fund for any taxable year pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section and the ruling amount that is provided by the IRS is greater than the ruling amount proposed by the taxpayer for such taxable year, the taxpayer is not allowed to make an additional payment to the fund for such taxable year after the deemed payment deadline date for such taxable year.
(3) If the payment or transfer that an electing taxpayer makes to a nuclear decommissioning fund for any taxable year pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section exceeds the ruling amount that is provided by the IRS for such taxable year, the following rules apply:
(i) The amount of the excess is an excess contribution (as defined in § 1.468A-5(c)(2)(ii)) for such taxable year.
(ii) The amount of the excess contribution is not deductible (
see
§ 1.468A-2(b)(2)) and must be withdrawn by the taxpayer pursuant to the rules of § 1.468A-5(c)(2)(i).
(iii) The taxpayer must withdraw the after-tax earnings on the excess contribution.
(iv) If the taxpayer claimed a deduction for the excess contribution, the taxpayer should file an amended return for the taxable year.
[T.D. 9512, 75 FR 80701, Dec. 23, 2010]
§ 1.468A-4
Treatment of nuclear decommissioning fund.
(a)
In general.
A nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to tax on all of its modified gross income (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section). The rate of tax is 20 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1995. This tax is in lieu of any other tax that may be imposed under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) on the income earned by the assets of the nuclear decommissioning fund.
(b)
Modified gross income.
For purposes of this section, the term
modified gross income
means gross income as defined under section 61 computed with the following modifications:
(1) The amount of any payment or special transfer to the nuclear decommissioning fund with respect to which a deduction is allowed under section 468A(a) or section 468A(f) is excluded from gross income.
(2) A deduction is allowed for the amount of administrative costs and other incidental expenses of the nuclear decommissioning fund (including taxes, legal expenses, accounting expenses, actuarial expenses and trustee expenses, but not including decommissioning costs) that are otherwise deductible and that are paid by the nuclear decommissioning fund to any person other than the electing taxpayer. An expense is otherwise deductible for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2) if it would be deductible under chapter 1 of the Code in determining the taxable income of a corporation. For example, because Federal income taxes are not deductible under chapter 1 of the Code in determining the taxable income of a corporation, the tax imposed by section 468A(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section is not deductible in determining the modified gross income of a nuclear decommissioning fund. Similarly, because certain expenses allocable to tax-exempt interest income are not deductible under section 265 in determining the taxable income of a corporation, such expenses are not deductible in determining the modified gross income of a nuclear decommissioning fund.
(3) A deduction is allowed for the amount of an otherwise deductible loss that is sustained by the nuclear decommissioning fund in connection with the sale, exchange or worthlessness of any investment. A loss is otherwise deductible for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3) if such loss would be deductible by a corporation under section 165(f) or (g) and sections 1211(a) and 1212(a).
(4) A deduction is allowed for the amount of an otherwise deductible net operating loss of the nuclear decommissioning fund. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the net operating loss of a nuclear decommissioning fund for a
taxable year is the amount by which the deductions allowable under paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section exceed the gross income of the nuclear decommissioning fund computed with the modification described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. A net operating loss is otherwise deductible for purposes of this paragraph (b)(4) if such a net operating loss would be deductible by a corporation under section 172(a).
(c)
Special rules
—(1)
Period for computation of modified gross income.
The modified gross income of a nuclear decommissioning fund must be computed on the basis of the taxable year of the electing taxpayer. If an electing taxpayer changes its taxable year, each nuclear decommissioning fund of the electing taxpayer must change to the new taxable year.
See
section 442 and § 1.442-1 for rules relating to the change to a new taxable year.
(2)
Gain or loss upon distribution of property by a fund.
A distribution of property by a nuclear decommissioning fund (whether an actual distribution or a deemed distribution) shall be considered a disposition of property by the nuclear decommissioning fund for purposes of section 1001. In determining the amount of gain or loss from such disposition, the amount realized by the nuclear decommissioning fund shall be the fair market value of the property on the date of disposition.
(3)
Denial of credits against tax.
The tax imposed on the modified gross income of a nuclear decommissioning fund under paragraph (a) of this section is not to be reduced or offset by any credits against tax provided by part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code other than the credit provided by section 31(c) for amounts withheld under section 3406 (back-up withholding).
(4)
Other corporate taxes inapplicable.
Although the modified gross income of a nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to tax at the rate specified by section 468A(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section, a nuclear decommissioning fund is not subject to the other taxes imposed on corporations under subtitle A of the Code. For example, a nuclear decommissioning fund is not subject to the alternative minimum tax imposed by section 55, the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531, the personal holding company tax imposed by section 541, and the alternative tax imposed on a corporation under section 1201(a).
(d)
Treatment as corporation for purposes of subtitle F.
For purposes of subtitle F of the Code and §§ 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9, a nuclear decommissioning fund is to be treated as if it were a corporation and the tax imposed by section 468A(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section is to be treated as a tax imposed by section 11. Thus, for example, the following rules apply:
(1) A nuclear decommissioning fund must file a return with respect to the tax imposed by section 468A(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section for each taxable year (or portion thereof) that the fund is in existence even though no amount is included in the gross income of the fund for such taxable year. The return is to be made on Form 1120-ND in accordance with the instructions relating to such form. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), a nuclear decommissioning fund is in existence for the period that—
(i) Begins on the date that the first deductible payment is actually made to such nuclear decommissioning fund; and
(ii) Ends on the date of termination (
see
§ 1.468A-5(d)), the date that the entire fund is disqualified (
see
§ 1.468A-5(c)), or the date that the electing taxpayer disposes of its entire qualifying interest in the nuclear power plant to which the nuclear decommissioning fund relates (other than in connection with the transfer of the entire fund to the person acquiring such interest), whichever is applicable.
(2) For each taxable year of the nuclear decommissioning fund, the return described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be filed on or before the 15th day of the third month following the close of such taxable year unless the nuclear decommissioning fund is granted an extension of time for filing under section 6081. If such an extension is granted for any taxable year, the return for such taxable year must be filed on or before the extended due date for such taxable year.
(3) A nuclear decommissioning fund must provide its employer identification number on returns, statements and other documents as required by the forms and instructions relating thereto. The employer identification number is obtained by filing a Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification Number, in accordance with the instructions relating thereto.
(4) A nuclear decommissioning fund must deposit all payments of tax imposed by section 468A(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section (including any payments of estimated tax) with an authorized government depositary in accordance with § 1.6302-1.
(5) A nuclear decommissioning fund is subject to the addition to tax imposed by section 6655 in case of a failure to pay estimated income tax. For purposes of section 6655 and this section—
(i) The tax with respect to which the amount of the underpayment is computed in the case of a nuclear decommissioning fund is the tax imposed by section 468A(e)(2) and paragraph (a) of this section; and
(ii) The taxable income with respect to which the nuclear decommissioning fund's status as a large corporation is measured is modified gross income (as defined by paragraph (b) of this section).
[T.D. 9512, 75 FR 80701, Dec. 23, 2010]
§ 1.468A-5
Nuclear decommissioning fund—miscellaneous provisions.
(a)
Qualification requirements
—(1)
In general.
(i) A nuclear decommissioning fund must be established and maintained at all times in the United States pursuant to an arrangement that qualifies as a trust under State law. Such trust must be established for the exclusive purpose of providing funds for the decommissioning of one or more nuclear power plants, but a single trust agreement may establish multiple funds for such purpose. Thus, for example—
(A) Two or more nuclear decommissioning funds can be established and maintained pursuant to a single trust agreement; and
(B) One or more funds that are to be used for the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant and that do not qualify as nuclear decommissioning funds under this paragraph (a) can be established and maintained pursuant to a trust agreement that governs one or more nuclear decommissioning funds.
(ii) A separate nuclear decommissioning fund is required for each electing taxpayer and for each nuclear power plant with respect to which an electing taxpayer possesses a qualifying interest. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will issue a separate schedule of ruling amounts with respect to each nuclear decommissioning fund, and each nuclear decommissioning fund must file a separate income tax return even if other nuclear decommissioning funds or nonqualified funds are established and maintained pursuant to the trust agreement governing such fund or the assets of other nuclear decommissioning funds or nonqualified funds are pooled with the assets of such fund.
(iii) An electing taxpayer can maintain only one nuclear decommissioning fund for each nuclear power plant with respect to which the taxpayer elects the application of section 468A. If a nuclear power plant is subject to the ratemaking jurisdiction of two or more public utility commissions and any such public utility commission requires a separate fund to be maintained for the benefit of ratepayers whose rates are established or approved by the public utility commission, the separate funds maintained for such plant (whether or not established and maintained pursuant to a single trust agreement) shall be considered a single nuclear decommissioning fund for purposes of section 468A and §§ 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-4, this section and §§ 1.468A-7 through 1.468A-9. Thus, for example, the IRS will issue one schedule of ruling amounts with respect to such nuclear power plant, the nuclear decommissioning fund must file a single income tax return (
see
§ 1.468A-4(d)(1)), and, if the IRS disqualifies the nuclear decommissioning fund, the assets of each separate fund are treated as distributed on the date of disqualification (
see
paragraph (c)(3) of this section).
(iv) If assets of a nuclear decommissioning fund are (or will be) invested
through an unincorporated organization, within the meaning of § 301.7701-2 of this chapter, the IRS will rule, if requested, whether the organization is an association taxable as a corporation for Federal tax purposes. A request for this ruling may be made by the electing taxpayer as part of its request for a schedule of ruling amounts or as part of a request under § 1.468A-8 for a schedule of deduction amounts.
(2)
Limitation on contributions.
Except as otherwise provided in § 1.468A-8 (relating to special transfers under section 468A(f)), a nuclear decommissioning fund is not permitted to accept any contributions in cash or property other than cash payments with respect to which a deduction is allowed under section 468A(a) and § 1.468A-2(a). Thus, for example, except in the case of a special transfer pursuant to § 1.468A-8, securities may not be contributed to a nuclear decommissioning fund even if the taxpayer or a fund established by the taxpayer previously held such securities for the purpose of providing funds for the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant.
(3)
Limitation on use of fund
—(i)
In general.
The assets of a nuclear decommissioning fund are to be used exclusively—
(A) To satisfy, in whole or in part, the liability of the electing taxpayer for decommissioning costs of the nuclear power plant to which the nuclear decommissioning fund relates;
(B) To pay administrative costs and other incidental expenses of the nuclear decommissioning fund; and
(C) To the extent that the assets of the nuclear decommissioning fund are not currently required for the purposes described in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, to make investments.
(ii)
Definition of administrative costs and expenses.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the term
administrative costs and other incidental expenses of a nuclear decommissioning fund
means all ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the nuclear decommissioning fund. Such term includes the tax imposed by section 468A(e)(2) and § 1.468A-4(a), any State or local tax imposed on the income or the assets of the fund, legal expenses, accounting expenses, actuarial expenses and trustee expenses. Such term does not include decommissioning costs or the payment of insurance premiums on a policy to pay for the nuclear decommissioning costs of a nuclear power plant. Such term also does not include the excise tax imposed on the trustee or other disqualified person under section 4951 or the reimbursement of any expenses incurred in connection with the assertion of such tax unless such expenses are considered reasonable and necessary under section 4951(d)(2)(C) and it is determined that the trustee or other disqualified person is not liable for the excise tax.
(4)
Trust provisions.
Each qualified nuclear decommissioning fund trust agreement must provide that assets in the fund must be used as authorized by section 468A and §§ 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9 and that the agreement may not be amended so as to violate section 468A or §§ 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9.
(b)
Prohibitions against self-dealing
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), the excise taxes imposed by section 4951 shall apply to each act of self-dealing between a disqualified person and a nuclear decommissioning fund.
(2)
Self-dealing defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term
self-dealing
means any act described in section 4951(d), except—
(i) A payment by a nuclear decommissioning fund for the purpose of satisfying, in whole or in part, the liability of the electing taxpayer for decommissioning costs of the nuclear power plant to which the nuclear decommissioning fund relates, whether such payment is made to an unrelated party in satisfaction of the decommissioning liability or to the plant operator or other otherwise disqualified person as reimbursement solely for actual expenses paid by such person in satisfaction of the decommissioning liability;
(ii) A withdrawal of an excess contribution by the electing taxpayer pursuant to the rules of paragraph (c)(2) of this section;
(iii) A withdrawal by the electing taxpayer of amounts that have been treated as distributed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section;
(iv) A payment of amounts remaining in a nuclear decommissioning fund to the electing taxpayer after the termination of such fund (as determined under paragraph (d) of this section);
(v) Any act described in section 4951(d)(2)(B) or (C). Whether payments under section 4951(c)(2)(C) are not excessive is determined under § 1.162-7. See § 53.4941(d)-3(c)(1). The fact that the amount of such payments that are not excessive are also more than the disqualified person's actual expenses for such personal services does not cause the payments to constitute acts of self-dealing, even if the difference is properly characterized as profit, or direct or indirect overhead;
(vi) Any act that is described in § 53.4951-1(c) of this chapter and is undertaken to facilitate the temporary investment of assets or the payment of reasonable administrative expenses of the nuclear decommissioning fund; or
(vii) A payment by a nuclear decommissioning fund for the performance of trust functions and certain general banking services by a bank or trust company that is a disqualified person if the banking services are reasonable and necessary to carry out the purposes of the fund and the compensation paid to the bank or trust company for such services, taking into account the fair interest rate for the use of the funds by the bank or trust company, is not excessive.
(3)
Disqualified person defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term
disqualified person
includes each person described in section 4951(e)(4) and § 53.4951-1(d).
(4)
General banking services.
The general banking services allowed by paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section are—
(i) Checking accounts, as long as the bank does not charge interest on any overwithdrawals;
(ii) Savings accounts, as long as the fund may withdraw its funds on no more than 30 days' notice without subjecting itself to a loss of interest on its money for the time during which the money was on deposit; and
(iii) Safekeeping activities (
see
§ 53.4941(d)-3(c)(2),
Example 3,
of this chapter).
(c)
Disqualification of nuclear decommissioning fund
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Disqualification events.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the IRS may, in its discretion, disqualify all or any portion of a nuclear decommissioning fund if at any time during a taxable year of the fund—
(A) The fund does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; or
(B) The fund and a disqualified person engage in an act of self-dealing (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section).
(ii)
Date of disqualification.
(A) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii), the date on which a disqualification under this paragraph (c) will take effect (date of disqualification) is the date that the fund does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section or the date on which the act of self-dealing occurs, whichever is applicable.
(B) If the IRS determines, in its discretion, that the disqualification should take effect on a date subsequent to the date specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the date of disqualification is such subsequent date.
(iii)
Notice of disqualification.
The IRS will notify the electing taxpayer of the disqualification of a nuclear decommissioning fund and the date of disqualification by registered or certified mail to the last known address of the electing taxpayer (the notice of disqualification). For further guidance regarding the definition of last known address,
see
§ 301.6212-2 of this chapter.

In general.
A nuclear decommissioning fund will not be disqualified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by reason of an excess contribution or the withdrawal of such excess contribution by an electing taxpayer if the amount of the excess contribution is withdrawn by the electing taxpayer on or before the date prescribed by law (including extensions) for filing the return of the nuclear decommissioning fund for the taxable year to which the excess contribution relates. In the case of an excess contribution that is the result of a payment made pursuant to § 1.468A-3(g)(1), a nuclear decommissioning fund
will not be disqualified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section if the amount of the excess contribution is withdrawn by the electing taxpayer on or before the later of—
(A) The date prescribed by law (including extensions) for filing the return of the nuclear decommissioning fund for the taxable year to which the excess contribution relates; or
(B) The date that is 30 days after the date that the taxpayer receives the ruling amount for such taxable year.
(ii)
Excess contribution defined.
For purposes of this section, an excess contribution is the amount by which cash payments made (or deemed made) to a nuclear decommissioning fund during any taxable year exceed the payment limitation contained in section 468A(b) and § 1.468A-2(b). The amount of a special transfer permitted under § 1.468A-8 is not treated as a cash payment for this purpose.
(iii)
Taxation of income attributable to an excess contribution.
The income of a nuclear decommissioning fund attributable to an excess contribution is required to be included in the gross income of the nuclear decommissioning fund under § 1.468A-4(b).
(3)
Disqualification treated as distribution.
If all or any portion of a nuclear decommissioning fund is disqualified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the portion of the nuclear decommissioning fund that is disqualified is treated as distributed to the electing taxpayer on the date of disqualification. Such a distribution shall be treated for purposes of section 1001 as a disposition of property held by the nuclear decommissioning fund (
see
§ 1.468A-4(c)(2)). In addition, the electing taxpayer must include in gross income for the taxable year that includes the date of disqualification an amount equal to the fair market value of the distributable assets of the nuclear decommissioning fund multiplied by the fraction of the nuclear decommissioning fund that was disqualified under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For this purpose, the fair market value of the distributable assets of the nuclear decommissioning fund is equal to the fair market value of the assets of the fund determined as of the date of disqualification, reduced by—
(i) The amount of any excess contribution that was not withdrawn before the date of disqualification if no deduction was allowed with respect to such excess contribution;
(ii) The amount of any deemed distribution that was not actually distributed before the date of disqualification (as determined under § 1.468A-2(d)(2)(iii)) if the amount of the deemed distribution was included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer for the taxable year in which the deemed distribution occurred; and
(iii) The amount of any tax that—
(A) Is imposed on the income of the fund;
(B) Is attributable to income taken into account before the date of disqualification or as a result of the disqualification; and
(C) Has not been paid as of the date of disqualification.
(4)
Further effects of disqualification.
Contributions made to a disqualified fund after the date of disqualification are not deductible under section 468A(a) and § 1.468A-2(a), or, if the fund is disqualified only in part, are deductible only to the extent provided in the notice of disqualification. In addition, if any assets of the fund that are deemed distributed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section are held by the fund after the date of disqualification (or if additional assets are acquired with nondeductible contributions made to the fund after the date of disqualification), the income earned by such assets after the date of disqualification must be included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer (
see
section 671) to the extent that such income is otherwise includible under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). An electing taxpayer can establish a nuclear decommissioning fund to replace a fund that has been disqualified in its entirety only if the IRS specifically consents to the establishment of a replacement fund in connection with the issuance of an initial schedule of ruling amounts for such replacement fund.
(d)
Termination of nuclear decommissioning fund upon substantial completion of decommissioning
—(1)
In general.
Upon substantial completion of the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant to which a nuclear decommissioning fund
relates, such nuclear decommissioning fund shall be considered terminated and treated as having distributed all of its assets on the date the termination occurs (the termination date). Such a distribution shall be treated for purposes of section 1001 as a disposition of property held by the nuclear decommissioning fund (
see
§ 1.468A-4(c)(2)). In addition, the electing taxpayer shall include in gross income for the taxable year in which the termination occurs an amount equal to the fair market value of the assets of the fund determined as of the termination date, reduced by—
(i) The amount of any deemed distribution that was not actually distributed before the termination date if the amount of the deemed distribution was included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer for the taxable year in which the deemed distribution occurred; and
(ii) The amount of any tax that—
(A) Is imposed on the income of the fund;
(B) Is attributable to income taken into account before the termination date or as a result of the termination; and
(C) Has not been paid as of the termination date.
(2)
Additional rules.
Contributions made to a nuclear decommissioning fund after the termination date are not deductible under section 468A(a) and § 1.468A-2(a). In addition, if any assets are held by the fund after the termination date, the income earned by such assets after the termination date must be included in the gross income of the electing taxpayer (
see
section 671) to the extent that such income is otherwise includible under chapter 1 of the Code. Finally, under § 1.468A-2(e), an electing taxpayer using an accrual method of accounting is allowed a deduction for nuclear decommissioning costs that are incurred during any taxable year even if such costs are incurred after substantial completion of decommissioning (for example, expenses incurred to monitor or safeguard the plant site).
(3)
Substantial completion of decommissioning and termination date.
(i) The substantial completion of the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant occurs on the date on which all Federal, state, local, and contractual decommissioning requirements are fully satisfied (the substantial completion date). Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, the substantial completion date is also the termination date.
(ii) If a significant portion of the total estimated decommissioning costs with respect to a nuclear power plant are not incurred on or before the substantial completion date, an electing taxpayer may request, and the IRS will issue, a ruling that designates a date subsequent to the substantial completion date as the termination date. The termination date designated in the ruling will not be later than the last day of the third taxable year after the taxable year that includes the substantial completion date. The request for a ruling under this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) must be filed during the taxable year that includes the substantial completion date and must comply with the procedural rules in effect at the time of the request.
[T.D. 9512, 75 FR 80701, Dec. 23, 2010, as amended by T.D. 9906, 85 FR 55190, Sept. 4, 2020]
§ 1.468A-6
Disposition of an interest in a nuclear power plant.
(a)
In general.
This section describes the Federal income tax consequences of a transfer of the assets of a nuclear decommissioning fund (Fund) within the meaning of § 1.468A-1(b)(4) in connection with a sale, exchange, or other disposition by a taxpayer (transferor) of all or a portion of its qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant to another taxpayer (transferee). This section also explains how a schedule of ruling amounts will be determined for the transferor and transferee. For purposes of this section, a nuclear power plant includes a plant that previously qualified as a nuclear power plant and that has permanently ceased to produce electricity.
(b)
Requirements.
This section applies if—
(1) Immediately before the disposition, the transferor maintained a Fund with respect to the interest disposed of;
(2) Immediately after the disposition—
(i) The transferee maintains a Fund with respect to the interest acquired;
(ii) The interest acquired is a qualifying interest of the transferee in the nuclear power plant;
(3) In connection with the disposition, either—
(i) The transferee acquires part or all of the transferor's qualifying interest in the plant and a proportionate amount of the assets of the transferor's Fund (all such assets if the transferee acquires the transferor's entire qualifying interest in the plant) is transferred to a Fund of the transferee; or
(ii) The transferee acquires the transferor's entire qualifying interest in the plant and the transferor's entire Fund is transferred to the transferee; and
(4) The transferee continues to satisfy the requirements of § 1.468A-5(a)(1)(iii), which permits an electing taxpayer to maintain only one Fund for each plant.
(c)
Tax consequences.
A disposition that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section will have the following tax consequences at the time it occurs:
(1)
The transferor and its Fund.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, neither the transferor nor the transferor's Fund will recognize gain or loss or otherwise take any income or deduction into account by reason of the transfer of a proportionate amount of the assets of the transferor's Fund to the transferee's Fund (or by reason of the transfer of the transferor's entire Fund to the transferee). For purposes of §§ 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9, this transfer (or the transfer of the transferor's Fund) will not be considered a distribution of assets by the transferor's Fund.
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, if the transferor has made a special transfer under § 1.468A-8 prior to the transfer of the Fund or Fund assets, any deduction with respect to that special transfer allowable under section 468A(f)(2) for a taxable year ending after the date of the transfer of the Fund or Fund assets (the unamortized special transfer deduction) is allowed under section 468A(f)(2)(C) for the taxable year that includes the date of the transfer of the Fund or Fund assets. If the taxpayer transfers only a portion of its interest in a nuclear power plant, only the corresponding portion of the unamortized special transfer deduction qualifies for the acceleration under section 468A(f)(2)(C).
(2)
The transferee and its Fund.
Neither the transferee nor the transferee's Fund will recognize gain or loss or otherwise take any income or deduction into account by reason of the transfer of a proportionate amount of the assets of the transferor's Fund to the transferee's Fund (or by reason of the transfer of the transferor's Fund to the transferee). For purposes of §§ 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9, this transfer (or the transfer of the transferor's Fund) will not constitute a payment or a contribution of assets by the transferee to its Fund.
(3)
Basis.
Transfers of assets of a Fund to which this section applies do not affect basis. Thus, the transferee's Fund will have a basis in the assets received from the transferor's Fund that is the same as the basis of those assets in the transferor's Fund immediately before the disposition.
(d)
Determination of proportionate amount.
For purposes of this section, a transferor of a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant is considered to transfer a proportionate amount of the assets of its Fund to a Fund of a transferee of the interest if, on the date of the transfer of the interest, the percentage of the fair market value of the Fund's assets attributable to the assets transferred equals the percentage of the transferor's qualifying interest that is transferred.
(e)
Calculation of schedule of ruling amounts and schedule of deduction amounts for dispositions described in this section
—(1)
Transferor.
If a transferor disposes of all or a portion of its qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant in a transaction to which this section applies, the transferor's schedule of ruling amounts with respect to the interests disposed of and retained (if any) and, if applicable, the amount allowable as a deduction for a special transfer under § 1.468A-8 will be determined under the following rules:
(i)
Taxable year of disposition; ruling amount.
If the transferor does not file a request for a revised schedule of ruling
amounts on or before the deemed payment deadline for the taxable year of the transferor in which the disposition of its interest in the nuclear power plant occurs (that is, the date that is two and one-half months after the close of that year), the transferor's ruling amount with respect to that plant for that year will equal the sum of—
(A) The ruling amount contained in the transferor's current schedule of ruling amounts with respect to that plant for that taxable year multiplied by the portion of the qualifying interest that is retained (if any); and
(B) The ruling amount contained in the transferor's current schedule of ruling amounts with respect to that plant for that taxable year multiplied by the product of—
(
1
) The portion of the transferor's qualifying interest that is disposed of; and
(
2
) A fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in that taxable year that precede the date of disposition, and the denominator of which is the number of days in that taxable year.
(ii)
Taxable year of disposition; deduction under § 1.468A-8.
If the transferor has elected to make a special transfer under section 468A(f), the amount allowable as a deduction under § 1.468A-8 for the taxable year in which it transfers a portion of its interest in the nuclear plant is equal to the deduction amount for that taxable year from its existing schedule of deduction amounts multiplied by the percentage of its interest that it retains. This deduction is in addition to the deduction described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(iii)
Taxable years after the year of disposition.
A transferor that retains a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant must file a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts (and, if applicable, a revised schedule of deduction amounts) with respect to that interest on or before the deemed payment deadline for the first taxable year of the transferor beginning after the disposition.
See
§§ 1.468A-3(f)(1)(ii)(B) and 1.468A-8(c)(3). If the transferor does not timely file such a request, the transferor's ruling amount and the transferor's deduction amount under § 1.468A-8 with respect to that interest for the affected year or years will be zero, unless the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) waives the application of this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) upon a showing of good cause for the delay.
(2)
Transferee.
If a transferee acquires all or a portion of a transferor's qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant in a transaction to which this section applies, the transferee's schedule of ruling amounts with respect to the interest acquired will be determined under the following rules:
(i)
Taxable year of disposition.
If the transferee does not file a request for a schedule of ruling amounts on or before the deemed payment deadline for the taxable year of the transferee in which the disposition occurs (that is, the date that is two and one-half months after the close of that year), the transferee's ruling amount with respect to the interest acquired in the nuclear power plant for that year is equal to the amount contained in the transferor's current schedule of ruling amounts for that plant for the taxable year of the transferor in which the disposition occurred, multiplied by the product of—
(A) The portion of the transferor's qualifying interest that is transferred; and
(B) A fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable year of the transferor including and following the date of disposition, and the denominator of which is the number of days in that taxable year.
(ii)
Taxable years after the year of disposition.
A transferee of a qualifying interest in a nuclear power plant must file a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts with respect to that interest on or before the deemed payment deadline for the first taxable year of the transferee beginning after the disposition.
See
§ 1.468A-3(f)(1)(ii)(B). If the transferee does not timely file such a request, the transferee's ruling amount with respect to that interest for the affected year or years will be zero, unless the IRS waives the application of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) upon a showing of good cause for the delay.
(3)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (e):

# Example 1.
(i) X Corporation is a calendar year taxpayer engaged in the sale of electric
energy generated by a nuclear power plant. The plant is owned entirely by X. On May 27, 2010, X transfers a 60-percent qualifying interest in the plant to Y Corporation, a calendar year taxpayer. Before the transfer, X had received a schedule of ruling amounts containing an annual ruling amount of $10 million for the taxable years 2005 through 2025. For 2010, neither X nor Y files a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts.
(ii) Under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, X's ruling amount for 2010 is calculated as follows: ($10,000,000 × .40) + ($10,000,000 × .60 × 146/365) = $6,400,000. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, Y's ruling amount for 2010 is calculated as follows: $10,000,000 × .60 × 219/365 = $3,600,000. Under paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section, X and Y must file requests for revised schedules of ruling amounts by March 15, 2012.

# Example 2.
Y Corporation, the sole owner of a nuclear power plant, is a calendar year taxpayer. In year 1, Y elects to make a special transfer under section 468A(f)(1) to the nuclear decommissioning fund Y maintains with respect to the plant. The amount of the special transfer is $100 × , and the remaining useful life of the plant is 20 years. Y obtains a schedule of deduction amounts under § 1.468A-8T(c) permitting a $5 × deduction each year over the 20-year remaining useful life, and deducts $5 × of the special transfer amount in year 1, year 2, year 3, and year 4. On the first day of year 5, Y transfers a 25% interest in the plant to an unrelated party. Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, Y may deduct in Year 5 the unamortized special transfer deduction corresponding to the portion of the plant transferred (25 percent of $80 × or $20 × ). In addition, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, Y may deduct the portion of the deduction amount for year 5 from the schedule of deduction amounts corresponding to its retained interest in the plant (75 percent of $5 × or $3.75 × ). Pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, Y must file a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts by March 15 of year 7.
(f)
Anti-abuse provision.
The IRS may treat a disposition as satisfying the requirements of this section if the IRS determines that this treatment is necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of section 468A and §§ 1.468A-1 through 1.468A-9.
[T.D. 9512, 75 FR 80701, Dec. 23, 2010, as amended by 76 FR 3837, Jan. 21, 2011]
§ 1.468A-7
Manner of and time for making election.
(a)
In general.
An eligible taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the taxable year in which the taxpayer makes a cash payment (or is deemed to make a cash payment) to a nuclear decommissioning fund or for a special transfer under § 1.468A-8 only if the taxpayer elects the application of section 468A. A separate election is required for each nuclear decommissioning fund and for each taxable year with respect to which payments are to be deducted under section 468A or a special transfer is made under § 1.468A-8. In the case of an affiliated group of corporations that join in the filing of a consolidated return for a taxable year, the common parent must make a separate election on behalf of each member whose payments to a nuclear decommissioning fund during such taxable year are to be deducted under section 468A and each member that makes a special transfer under § 1.468A-8 with respect to such year. The election under section 468A for any taxable year is irrevocable and must be made by attaching a statement (Election Statement) and a copy of the schedule of ruling amounts provided pursuant to the rules of § 1.468A-3 to the taxpayer's Federal income tax return (or, in the case of an affiliated group of corporations that join in the filing of a consolidated return, the consolidated return) for such taxable year. The return to which the Election Statement and a copy of the schedule of ruling amounts is attached must be filed on or before the time prescribed by law (including extensions) for filing the return for the taxable year with respect to which payments are to be deducted under section 468A.
(b)
Required information.
The Election Statement must include the following information:
(1) The legend “Election Under Section 468A” typed or legibly printed at the top of the first page.
(2) The electing taxpayer's name, address and taxpayer identification number (or, in the case of an affiliated group of corporations that join in the filing of a consolidated return, the name, address and taxpayer identification number of each electing taxpayer).
(3) The taxable year for which the election is made.
(4) For each nuclear decommissioning fund for which an election is made—
(i) The name and location of the nuclear power plant to which the fund relates;
(ii) The name and employer identification number of the nuclear decommissioning fund;
(iii) The total amount of actual cash payments made to the nuclear decommissioning fund during the taxable year that were not treated as deemed cash payments under § 1.468A-2(c)(1) for a prior taxable year;
(iv) The total amount of cash payments deemed made to the nuclear decommissioning fund under § 1.468A-2(c)(1) for the taxable year;
(v) The total amount of any special transfers (whether in cash or property) made to the nuclear decommissioning fund under § 1.468A-8 during the taxable year that were not treated as deemed transfers under § 1.468A-8(a)(4) for a prior taxable year;
(vi) The total amount of any special transfers (whether in cash or property) deemed made to the nuclear decommissioning fund under § 1.468A-8(a)(4) for the taxable year; and
(vii) For each item of property included in the amounts described in paragraph (b)(4)((v) or (vi) of this section, the amount of the item of property and whether the basis of the item of property is determined under § 1.468A-8(b)(5)(iii)(A) or § 1.468A-8(b)(5)(iii)(B).
[T.D. 9512, 75 FR 80701, Dec. 23, 2010]
§ 1.468A-8
Special transfers to qualified funds pursuant to section 468A(f).
(a)
General rule
—(1)
In general.
Under section 468A(f), a taxpayer maintaining a qualified nuclear decommissioning fund with respect to a nuclear power plant may transfer cash or property into the fund (a special transfer). The special transfer is not subject to the ruling amount limitation in section 468A(b) and is not treated as a cash payment for purposes of that limitation. Thus, a taxpayer may, in the same taxable year, pay the ruling amount and make a special transfer into the fund. A special transfer may be made in cash, property, or both cash and property. The amount of a special transfer (that is, the amount of cash and the fair market value of property transferred) may not exceed the present value of the pre-2005 nonqualifying amount of nuclear decommissioning costs with respect to the nuclear power plant. The taxpayer is entitled to a deduction against income for a special transfer, as described in paragraph (b) of this section. A special transfer may not be made to a nuclear decommissioning fund before the first taxable year in which a deduction amount is applicable to the nuclear decommissioning fund (
see
paragraph (c) of this section).
(2)
Pre-2005 nonqualifying amount
—(i)
In general.
The present value of the pre-2005 nonqualifying amount of nuclear decommissioning costs with respect to a nuclear power plant is the amount equal to the pre-2005 nonqualifying percentage of the present value of the estimated future decommissioning costs (as defined in § 1.468A-1(b)(6)) with respect to the nuclear power plant as of the first day of the taxable year of the taxpayer in which the special transfer is made or deemed made (or a later date that is on or before the date on which the special transfer is expected to be made if the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the IRS that the determination of present value as of such date is reasonable and consistent with the principles and provisions of this section). For this purpose, the pre-2005 nonqualifying percentage for the plant is 100 percent reduced by the sum of—
(A) The qualifying percentage (within the meaning of § 1.468A-3(d)(4) as in effect on December 31, 2005) used in determining the taxpayer's last schedule of ruling amounts for the nuclear decommissioning fund under the law in effect before the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (that is, the percentage of the plant's total nuclear decommissioning costs that were permitted to be funded through the fund under the law in effect before the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005); and
(B) The percentage of decommissioning costs transferred in any previous special transfer (that is, the amount transferred as a percentage of the present value of the estimated future costs of decommissioning as of the
first day of the taxable year in which such previous transfer was made).
(ii)
Pre-2005 nonqualifying amount of transferee.
If there is a transfer of a nuclear decommissioning fund or part or all of its assets and § 1.468A-6 applies to the transfer, the pre-2005 nonqualifying amount determined with respect to the transferee is equal to the pre-2005 nonqualifying amount (or a proportionate part of the pre-2005 nonqualifying amount) that would have been determined with respect to the transferor but for such transfer.
(3)
Transfers in multiple years.
A taxpayer making a special transfer is not required to transfer the entire eligible amount in a single year. The requirements of paragraph (c) of this section apply separately to each year in which a special transfer is made. In calculating the amount of any subsequent transfer, the taxpayer must reduce the pre-2005 nonqualifying percentage under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to take into account all previous transfers. For example, if a taxpayer has a pre-2005 nonqualifying percentage of 40 percent, and transfers half of the eligible amount in a special transfer, any subsequent transfer must be calculated on the basis of a pre-2005 nonqualifying percentage of 20 percent.
(4)
Deemed payment rules
—(i)
In general.
The amount of any special transfer (whether in cash or property) described in § 1.468A-8 and made by an electing taxpayer to a nuclear decommissioning fund on or before the 15th day of the third calendar month after the close of any taxable year (the deemed payment deadline date) shall be deemed made during such taxable year if the electing taxpayer irrevocably designates the amount as relating to such taxable year on its timely filed Federal income tax return for such taxable year or, in the case of special transfers described in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, on an amended return for such taxable year (
see
§ 1.468A-7(b)(4)(v) and (vi) for rules relating to such designation).
(ii)
Special rule for certain special transfers.
Special transfers that the electing taxpayer designates as relating to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2005, and ending before January 1, 2010, which are actually made within 90 days after the electing taxpayer receives a ruling from the Secretary relating to the special transfer are deemed made during the taxable year designated as the year to which the special transfer relates.
(b)
Deduction for amounts transferred
—(1)
In general.
(i) Except as provided in this paragraph (b), the deduction for any special transfer is allowed ratably over the remaining useful life of the nuclear power plant. The amount of the deduction for any taxable year is the deduction amount for such year specified in the schedule of deduction amounts required under paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (b), the remaining useful life of the nuclear power plant is the period beginning on the first day of the taxable year during which the transfer is made and ending on the last day of the taxable year that includes the last day of the estimated useful life of the nuclear power plant. The last day of the estimated useful life of the nuclear power plant is determined for this purpose under the rules of § 1.468A-3(c)(2).
(2)
Amount of deduction
—(i)
General rule.
Except as provided in this paragraph (b)(2), the deduction for property contributed in a special transfer is limited to the lesser of the fair market value of the property contributed or the taxpayer's basis in that property.
(ii)
Election
—(
A
)
In general.
If the fair market value of the property contributed is less than the taxpayer's adjusted basis in such property as of the date the property is contributed and the fund elects to treat the fair market value of the property as its adjusted basis in the property, the taxpayer may deduct an amount equal to the adjusted basis of the contributed property.
(B)
Manner of making election.
The election described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section is made for property contributed in a special transfer by attaching a description of the property and a statement that the fund is making an election under § 1.468A-8(b)(2)(ii) with respect to the property to the return of the fund for the taxable year in which the property is contributed to the fund.
(
C
)
Election allowed for property transferred prior to December 23, 2010.
The election described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section may be made and a deduction equal to adjusted basis will be allowed for property contributed in a special transfer prior to December 23, 2010. The election in such a case may be made on an amended return of the fund for the taxable year in which the property is contributed to the fund and the transferor may amend previously filed returns to claim a deduction calculated by reference to the adjusted basis of the property.
(3)
Denial of deduction for previously deducted amounts.
If a deduction (other than a deduction under section 468A) has been allowed to the taxpayer (or a predecessor) on account of expected decommissioning costs for a nuclear power plant (a nonconforming deduction) or an amount otherwise includible in income has been excluded from the gross income of the taxpayer (or a predecessor) on account of such expected decommissioning costs (a nonconforming exclusion), the deduction allowed for a special transfer to the nuclear decommissioning fund maintained with respect to the plant is reduced. In the case of a single special transfer of the full eligible amount, the reduction is equal to the aggregate amount of all nonconforming deductions and nonconforming exclusions. In the case of a transfer of less than the full eligible amount, the reduction is a ratable portion of such aggregate amount.
(4)
Transfers of qualified nuclear decommissioning funds.
(i) If a special transfer is made to any qualified nuclear decommissioning fund, there is a subsequent transfer of the fund or the assets of the fund (a fund transfer), and § 1.468-6 applies to the fund transfer, any amount of the deduction under paragraph (b) of this section allocable to taxable years ending after the date of the fund transfer will be allowed as a current deduction to the transferor for the taxable year that includes the date of the fund transfer.
See
§ 468A-6(c) for additional rules concerning transfers of decommissioning funds, including the transfer of a portion of the taxpayer's interest in a nuclear power plant. If a taxpayer transfers only part of the fund or the fund's assets, the rules in this paragraph (b)(4) apply only to the corresponding portion of the deduction under paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii) If a deduction is allowed to the transferor under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section and the transferee is related to the transferor, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will not approve the transferee's schedule of ruling amounts for taxable years beginning after the date of the transfer unless the ruling amounts are deferred in a manner that results in recapture of the acceleration amount. For this purpose—
(A) The acceleration amount is the difference between the deduction allowed under this paragraph (b)(4) and the present value as of the beginning of the acceleration period of the deductions that, but for the transfer, would have been allowed under this paragraph (b) for taxable years during the acceleration period;
(B) The acceleration amount is recaptured if the aggregate present value of the ruling amounts at the beginning of the acceleration period is equal to the amount by which the aggregate present value of the ruling amounts that would have been approved but for this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) exceeds the acceleration amount;
(C) The acceleration period is the period from the first day of the transferor's first taxable year beginning after the date of the transfer until the end of the plant's remaining useful life;
(D) Present values will be determined using the assumptions that are used in determining the transferee's first schedule of ruling amounts; and
(E) A transferor and a transferee are related if their relationship is specified in section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1) or they are treated as a single taxpayer under section 41(f)(1)(A) or (B).
(5)
Special rules
—(i)
Gain or loss not recognized on transfers to fund.
No gain or loss will be recognized on any special transfer.
(ii)
Taxpayer basis in fund.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and regulations, the taxpayer's basis in the fund is not increased by reason of the special transfer.
(iii)
Fund basis in transferred property
—(
A
)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, the fund's basis in any property transferred in a special transfer is the same as the transferor's basis in the property immediately before the transfer.
(
B
)
Basis in case of election.
If a fund makes the election described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the fund's basis in the property transferred is the fair market value of the property on the date of transfer.
(c)
Schedule of deductions required
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer may not make a special transfer to a qualified nuclear decommissioning fund unless the taxpayer requests from the IRS a schedule of deduction amounts in connection with such transfer. A schedule of deduction amounts for a nuclear decommissioning fund (schedule of deduction amounts) is a ruling (within the meaning of § 601.201(a)(2) of this chapter) specifying the annual deductions (deduction amounts) that, over the taxable years in the remaining useful life of the nuclear power plant, will result in the deduction of the entire amount of the special transfer. Such a request may be combined with a request for a schedule of ruling amounts under § 1.468A-3(a). In the case of a combined request, the schedule of deduction amounts requested under this paragraph (c)(1) must be stated separately from the schedule of ruling amounts requested under § 1.468A-3(a) and approval of the schedule of deduction amounts under this section will constitute a separate ruling. A request for a schedule of deduction amounts must comply with all provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Transfers in multiple taxable years.
A taxpayer making a special transfer in more than one taxable year pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section must request a separate schedule of deduction amounts in connection with each special transfer. More than one schedule of deduction amounts can be requested in a single ruling request to the Secretary and the Secretary will provide, in a single ruling, separate schedules of deduction amounts for each of a series of special transfers provided that each request for a separate schedule of deduction amounts complies with all requirements of this paragraph.
(3)
Transfer of partial interest in fund.
If a taxpayer transfers part of a fund or a fund's assets and is allowed a deduction under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the taxpayer must request a new schedule of deduction amounts in connection with the transfer.
(4)
Special transfer permitted before receipt of schedule.
If an electing taxpayer has filed a timely request for a schedule of deduction amounts in connection with a special transfer for a taxable year and does not receive the schedule of deduction amounts before the deemed payment deadline for such taxable year, the taxpayer may make a special transfer to the nuclear decommissioning fund on the basis of the special transfer amount proposed in the taxpayer's request. If the schedule of deduction amounts provided by the Secretary is based on a special transfer amount that differs from the special transfer amount proposed in the taxpayer's request, rules similar to the rules of § 1.468A-3(g)(2) and (3) shall apply.
(d)
Manner of requesting schedule of deduction amounts
—(1)
In general.
(i) In order to receive a deduction amount for any taxable year, a taxpayer must file a request for a schedule of deduction amounts that complies with the requirements of this paragraph (d), the applicable procedural rules set forth in § 601.201(e) of this chapter (Statement of Procedural Rules) and the requirements of any applicable revenue procedure that is in effect on the date the request is filed.
(ii) A separate request for a schedule of deduction amounts is required for each nuclear decommissioning fund established by a taxpayer (
see
§ 1.468A-5(a) for rules relating to the number of nuclear decommissioning funds that a taxpayer can establish).
(iii) Except as provided by § 1.468A-5(a)(1)(iv) (relating to certain unincorporated organizations that may be taxable as corporations) and § 1.468A-3 (relating to a request for a schedule of ruling amounts), a request for a schedule of deduction amounts must not contain a request for a ruling on any other issue, whether the issue involves
section 468A or another section of the Code.
(iv) In the case of an affiliated group of corporations that join in the filing of a consolidated return, the common parent of the group may request a schedule of deduction amounts for each member of the group that possesses a qualifying interest in the same nuclear power plant by filing a single submission with the IRS.
(v) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of this section, the IRS will not provide or revise a deduction amount applicable to a taxable year in response to a request for a schedule of deduction amounts that is filed after the deemed payment deadline date (as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section) for such taxable year.
(vi) For special transfers relating to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005, and before January 1, 2010, the IRS will not provide a deduction amount in response to a request for a schedule of deduction amounts that is filed after February 22, 2011.
(vii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(viii) of this section, a request for a schedule of deduction amounts shall be considered filed only if such request complies substantially with the requirements of this paragraph (d). In determining the date when a request is filed, the principles of sections 7502 and 7503 shall apply.
(viii) If a request does not comply substantially with the requirements of this paragraph (d), the IRS will notify the taxpayer of that fact. If the information or materials necessary to comply substantially with the requirements of this paragraph (d) are provided to the IRS within 30 days after this notification, the request will be considered filed on the date of the original submission. In addition, the request will be considered filed on the date of the original submission in a case in which the information and materials are provided more than 30 days after the notification if the IRS determines that the electing taxpayer made a good faith effort to provide the applicable information or materials within 30 days after notification and also determines that treating the request as filed on the date of the original submission is consistent with the purposes of section 468A. In any other case in which the information or materials necessary to comply substantially with the requirements of this paragraph (d) are not provided within 30 days after the notification, the request will be considered filed on the date that all information or materials necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (d) are provided.
(2)
Information required.
A request for a schedule of deduction amounts must contain the following information:
(i) The taxpayer's name, address and taxpayer identification number.
(ii) Whether the request is for an initial schedule of deduction amounts or a schedule of deduction amounts for a subsequent special transfer.
(iii) The name and location of the nuclear power plant with respect to which a schedule of deduction amounts is requested.
(iv) A description of the taxpayer's qualifying interest in the nuclear power plant and the percentage of such nuclear power plant that the qualifying interest of the taxpayer represents.

(vi) A description of the assumptions, estimates and other factors that were used by the taxpayer to determine the amount of decommissioning costs, including each of the following if applicable:
(A) A description of the proposed method of decommissioning the nuclear power plant (for example, prompt removal/dismantlement, safe storage entombment with delayed dismantlement, or safe storage mothballing with delayed dismantlement).
(B) The estimated year in which substantial decommissioning costs will first be incurred.
(C) The estimated year in which the decommissioning of the nuclear power plant will be substantially complete (

§ 1.468A-5(d)(3) for a definition of substantial completion of decommissioning).
(D) The total estimated cost of decommissioning expressed in current dollars (that is, based on price levels in effect at the time of the current determination).
(E) The total estimated cost of decommissioning expressed in future dollars (that is, based on anticipated price levels when expenses are expected to be paid).
(F) For each taxable year in the period that begins with the year specified in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(B) of this section (the estimated year in which substantial decommissioning costs will first be incurred) and ends with the year specified in paragraph (d)(2)(vi)(C) of this section (the estimated year in which the decommissioning of the nuclear power plant will be substantially complete), the estimated cost of decommissioning expressed in future dollars.
(G) A description of the methodology used in converting the estimated cost of decommissioning expressed in current dollars to the estimated cost of decommissioning expressed in future dollars.

(ix) If the request is for a subsequent schedule of deduction amounts, the amount of the previous special transfer and the present value of the estimated future decommissioning costs (as defined in § 1.468A-1(b)(6)) with respect to the taxpayer's qualifying interest in the nuclear power plant as of the first day of the taxable year of the taxpayer in which the previous special transfer was made.
(x) If the request is for a subsequent schedule of deduction amounts, a copy of all schedules of deduction amounts that relate to the nuclear power plant to which the request relates and that were previously issued to the taxpayer making the request.
(xi) If the request for a schedule of deduction amounts contains a request, pursuant to § 1.468A-5(a)(1)(iv), that the IRS rule whether an unincorporated organization through which the assets of the fund are invested is an association taxable as a corporation for Federal tax purposes, a copy of the legal documents establishing or otherwise governing the organization.
(xii) Any other information required by the IRS that may be necessary or useful in determining the schedule of deduction amounts.
(3)
Statement required.
A taxpayer requesting a schedule of deduction amounts under this paragraph (d) must submit a statement that any nonconforming deductions and nonconforming exclusions have reduced the deduction allowed for the special transfer in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(4)

§ 1.468B
Designated settlement funds.
A designated settlement fund, as defined in section 468B(d)(2), is taxed in the manner described in § 1.468B-2.

§ 1.468B-1
Qualified settlement funds.
(a)
In general.
A qualified settlement fund is a fund, account, or trust that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Coordination with other entity classifications.
If a fund, account, or trust that is a qualified settlement fund could be classified as a trust within the meaning of § 301.7701-4 of this chapter, it is classified as a qualified settlement fund for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). If a fund, account, or trust, organized as a trust under applicable state law, is a qualified settlement fund, and could be classified as either an association (within the meaning of § 301.7701-2 of this chapter) or a partnership (within the meaning of § 301.7701-3 of this chapter), it is classified as a qualified settlement fund for all purposes of the Code. If a fund, account, or trust, established for contested liabilities pursuant to § 1.461-2(c)(1) is a qualified settlement fund, it is classified as a qualified settlement fund for all purposes of the Code.
(c)
Requirements.
A fund, account, or trust satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (c) if—
(1) It is established pursuant to an order of, or is approved by, the United States, any state (including the District of Columbia), territory, possession, or political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality (including a court of law) of any of the foregoing and is subject to the continuing jurisdiction of that governmental authority;
(2) It is established to resolve or satisfy one or more contested or uncontested claims that have resulted or may result from an event (or related series of events) that has occurred and that has given rise to at least one claim asserting liability—
(i) Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (hereinafter referred to as CERCLA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 9601
et seq.
; or
(ii) Arising out of a tort, breach of contract, or violation of law; or
(iii) Designated by the Commissioner in a revenue ruling or revenue procedure; and
(3) The fund, account, or trust is a trust under applicable state law, or its assets are otherwise segregated from other assets of the transferor (and related persons).
(d)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section—
(1)
Transferor.
A “transferor” is a person that transfers (or on behalf of whom an insurer or other person transfers) money or property to a qualified settlement fund to resolve or satisfy claims described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section against that person.
(2)
Related person.
A “related person” is any person who is related to the transferor within the meaning of sections 267(b) or 707(b)(1).
(e)
Governmental order or approval requirement
—(1)
In general.
A fund, account, or trust is “ordered by” or “approved by” a governmental authority described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section when the authority issues its initial or preliminary order to establish, or grants its initial or preliminary approval of, the fund, account, or trust, even if that order or approval may be subject to review or revision. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the governmental authority's order or approval has no retroactive effect and does not permit a fund, account, or trust to be a qualified settlement fund prior to the date the order is issued or the approval is granted.
(2)
Arbitration panels.
An arbitration award that orders the establishment of, or approves, a fund, account, or trust is an order or approval of a governmental authority described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section if—
(i) The arbitration award is judicially enforceable;
(ii) The arbitration award is issued pursuant to a bona fide arbitration proceeding in accordance with rules that are approved by a governmental authority described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section (such as self-regulatory organization-administered arbitration
proceedings in the securities industry); and
(iii) The fund, account, or trust is subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the arbitration panel, the court of law that has jurisdiction to enforce the arbitration award, or the governmental authority that approved the rules of the arbitration proceeding.
(f)
Resolve or satisfy requirement
—(1)
Liabilities to provide services or property.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, a liability is not described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section if it is a liability for the provision of services or property, unless the transferor's obligation to provide services or property is extinguished by a transfer or transfers to the fund, account, or trust.
(2)
CERCLA liabilities.
A transferor's liability under CERCLA to provide services or property is described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section if following its transfer to a fund, account, or trust the transferor's only remaining liability to the Environmental Protection Agency (if any) is a remote, future obligation to provide services or property.
(g)
Excluded liabilities.
A liability is not described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section if it—
(1) Arises under a workers compensation act or a self-insured health plan;
(2) Is an obligation to refund the purchase price of, or to repair or replace, products regularly sold in the ordinary course of the transferor's trade or business;
(3) Is an obligation of the transferor to make payments to its general trade creditors or debtholders that relates to a title 11 or similar case (as defined in section 368(a)(3)(A)), or a workout; or
(4) Is designated by the Commissioner in a revenue ruling or a revenue procedure (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter).
(h)
Segregation requirement
—(1)
In general.
If it is not a trust under applicable state law, a fund, account, or trust satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section if its assets are physically segregated from other assets of the transferor (and related persons). For example, cash held by a transferor in a separate bank account satisfies the segregation requirement of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(2)
Classification of fund established to resolve or satisfy allowable and non-allowable claims.
If a fund, account, or trust is established to resolve or satisfy claims described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section as well as other types of claims (
i.e.,
non-allowable claims) arising from the same event or related series of events, the fund is a qualified settlement fund. However, under § 1.468B-3(c), economic performance does not occur with respect to transfers to the qualified settlement fund for non-allowable claims.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Classification of fund prior to satisfaction of requirements in paragraph (c) of this section
—(1)
In general.
If a fund, account, or trust is established to resolve or satisfy claims described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the assets of the fund, account, or trust are treated as owned by the transferor of those assets until the fund, account, or trust also meets the requirements of paragraphs (c) (1) and (3) of this section. On the date the fund, account, or trust satisfies all the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, the transferor is treated as transferring the assets to a qualified settlement fund.
(2)
Relation-back rule
—(i)
In general.
If a fund, account, or trust meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section prior to the time it meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the transferor and administrator (as defined in § 1.468B-2(k)(3)) may jointly elect (a relation-back election) to treat the fund, account, or trust as coming into existence as a qualified settlement fund on the later of the date the fund, account, or trust meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section or January 1 of the calendar year in which all the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are met. If a relation-back election is made, the assets held by the fund, account, or trust on the date the qualified settlement fund is treated as coming into existence are treated as transferred to the qualified settlement fund on that date.
(ii)
Relation-back election.
A relation-back election is made by attaching a copy of the election statement, signed
by each transferor and the administrator, to (and as part of) the timely filed income tax return (including extensions) of the qualified settlement fund for the taxable year in which the fund is treated as coming into existence. A copy of the election statement must also be attached to (and as part of) the timely filed income tax return (including extensions), or an amended return that is consistent with the requirements of §§ 1.468B-1 through 1.468B-4, of each transferor for the taxable year of the transferor that includes the date on which the qualified settlement fund is treated as coming into existence. The election statement must contain—
(A) A legend, “§ 1.468B-1 Relation-Back Election”, at the top of the first page;
(B) Each transferor's name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
(C) The qualified settlement fund's name, address, and employer identification number;
(D) The date as of which the qualified settlement fund is treated as coming into existence; and
(E) A schedule describing each asset treated as transferred to the qualified settlement fund on the date the fund is treated as coming into existence. The schedule of assets does not have to identify the amount of cash or the property treated as transferred by a particular transferor. If the schedule does not identify the transferor of each asset, however, each transferor must include with the copy of the election statement that is attached to its income tax return (or amended return) a schedule describing each asset the transferor is treated as transferring to the qualified settlement fund.
(k)
Election to treat a qualified settlement fund as a subpart E trust
—(1)
In general.
If a qualified settlement fund has only one transferor (as defined in paragraph (d)(1) of this section), the transferor may make an election (grantor trust election) to treat the qualified settlement fund as a trust all of which is owned by the transferor under section 671 and the regulations thereunder. A grantor trust election may be made whether or not the qualified settlement fund would be classified, in the absence of paragraph (b) of this section, as a trust all of which is treated as owned by the transferor under section 671 and the regulations thereunder. A grantor trust election may be revoked only for compelling circumstances upon consent of the Commissioner by private letter ruling.
(2)
Manner of making grantor trust election
—(i)
In general.
To make a grantor trust election, a transferor must attach an election statement satisfying the requirements of paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section to a timely filed (including extensions) Form 1041, “U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts,” that the administrator files on behalf of the qualified settlement fund for the taxable year in which the qualified settlement fund is established. However, if a Form 1041 is not otherwise required to be filed (for example, because the provisions of § 1.671-4(b) apply), then the transferor makes a grantor trust election by attaching an election statement satisfying the requirements of paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section to a timely filed (including extensions) income tax return of the transferor for the taxable year in which the qualified settlement fund is established. See § 1.468B-5(c)(2) for transition rules.
(ii)
Requirements for election statement.
The election statement must include a statement by the transferor that the transferor will treat the qualified settlement fund as a grantor trust. The election statement must include the transferor's name, address, taxpayer identification number, and the legend, “§ 1.468B-1(k) Election.” The election statement and the statement described in § 1.671-4(a) may be combined into a single statement.
(3)
Effect of making the election.
If a grantor trust election is made—
(i) Paragraph (b) of this section, and §§ 1.468B-2, 1.468B-3, and 1.468B-5(a) and (b) do not apply to the qualified settlement fund. However, this section (except for paragraph (b) of this section) and § 1.468B-4 apply to the qualified settlement fund;
(ii) The qualified settlement fund is treated, for Federal income tax purposes, as a trust all of which is treated as owned by the transferor under section 671 and the regulations thereunder;
(iii) The transferor must take into account in computing the transferor's income tax liability all items of income, deduction, and credit (including capital gains and losses) of the qualified settlement fund in accordance with § 1.671-3(a)(1); and
(iv) The reporting obligations imposed by § 1.671-4 on the trustee of a trust apply to the administrator.
(l)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1.
In a class action brought in a United States federal district court, the court holds that the defendant, Corporation X, violated certain securities laws and must pay damages in the amount of $150 million. Pursuant to an order of the court, Corporation X transfers $50 million in cash and transfers property with a fair market value of $75 million to a state law trust. The trust will liquidate the property and distribute the cash proceeds to the plaintiffs in the class action. The trust is a qualified settlement fund because it was established pursuant to the order of a federal district court to resolve or satisfy claims against Corporation X for securities law violations that have occurred.

# Example 2.
(i) Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that Corporation X and the class of plaintiffs reach an out-of-court settlement that requires Corporation X to establish and fund a state law trust before the settlement agreement is submitted to the court for approval.
(ii) The trust is not a qualified settlement fund because it neither is established pursuant to an order of, nor has it been approved by, a governmental authority described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

# Example 3.
On June 1, 1994, Corporation Y establishes a fund to resolve or satisfy claims against it arising from the violation of certain securities laws. On that date, Corporation Y transfers $10 million to a segregated account. On December 1, 1994, a federal district court approves the fund. Assuming Corporation Y and the administrator of the qualified settlement fund do not make a relation-back election, Corporation Y is treated as the owner of the $10 million, and is taxable on any income earned on that money, from June 1 through November 30, 1994. The fund is a qualified settlement fund beginning on December 1, 1994.

# Example 4.
(i) On September 1, 1993, Corporation X, which has a taxable year ending on October 31, enters into a settlement agreement with a plaintiff class for asserted tort liabilities. Under the settlement agreement, Corporation X makes two $50 million payments into a segregated fund, one on September 1, 1993, and one on October 1, 1993, to resolve or satisfy the tort liabilities. A federal district court approves the settlement agreement on November 1, 1993.
(ii) The administrator of the fund and Corporation X elect to treat the fund as a qualified settlement fund prior to governmental approval under the relation-back rule of paragraph (j)(2) of this section. The administrator must attach the relation-back election statement to the fund's income tax return for calendar year 1993, and Corporation X must attach the election to its original or amended income tax return for its taxable year ending October 31, 1993.
(iii) Pursuant to the relation-back election, the fund begins its existence as a qualified settlement fund on September 1, 1993, and Corporation X is treated as transferring $50 million to the qualified settlement fund on September 1, 1993, and $50 million on October 1, 1993.
(iv) With respect to these transfers, Corporation X must provide the statement described in § 1.468B-3(e) to the administrator of the qualified settlement fund by February 15, 1994, and must attach a copy of this statement to its original or amended income tax return for its taxable year ending October 31, 1993.

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 4,
except that the court approves the settlement on May 1, 1994. The administrator must attach the relation-back election statement to the fund's income tax return for calendar year 1994, and Corporation X must attach the election statement to its original or amended income tax return for its taxable year ending October 31, 1994. Pursuant to this election, the fund begins its existence as a qualified settlement fund on January 1, 1994. In addition, Corporation X is treated as transferring to the qualified settlement fund all amounts held in the fund on January 1, 1994. With respect to the transfer, Corporation X must provide the statement described in § 1.468B-3(e) to the administrator of the qualified settlement fund by February 15, 1995, and must attach a copy of this statement to its income tax return for its taxable year ending October 31, 1994.

# Example 6.
Corporation Z establishes a fund that meets all the requirements of section 468B(d)(2) for a designated settlement fund, except that Corporation Z does not make the election under section 468B(d)(2)(F). Although the fund does not qualify as a designated settlement fund, it is a qualified settlement fund because the fund meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.

# Example 7.
Corporation X owns and operates a landfill in State A. State A requires Corporation X to transfer money to a trust annually based on the total tonnage of material placed in the landfill during the year. Under the laws of State A, Corporation X will be required to perform (either itself or through contractors) specified closure activities when the landfill is full, and the trust
assets will be used to reimburse Corporation X for those closure costs. The trust is not a qualified settlement fund because it is established to secure the liability of Corporation X to perform the closure activities.
[T.D. 8459, 57 FR 60989, Dec. 23, 1992; 58 FR 7865, Feb. 10, 1993, as amended by T.D. 9249, 71 FR 6201, Feb. 7, 2006]
§ 1.468B-2
Taxation of qualified settlement funds and related administrative requirements.
(a)
In general.
A qualified settlement fund is a United States person and is subject to tax on its modified gross income for any taxable year at a rate equal to the maximum rate in effect for that taxable year under section 1(e).
(b)
Modified gross income.
The “modified gross income” of a qualified settlement fund is its gross income, as defined in section 61, computed with the following modifications—
(1) In general, amounts transferred to the qualified settlement fund by, or on behalf of, a transferor to resolve or satisfy a liability for which the fund is established are excluded from gross income. However, dividends on stock of a transferor (or a related person), interest on debt of a transferor (or a related person), and payments in compensation for late or delayed transfers, are not excluded from gross income.
(2) A deduction is allowed for administrative costs and other incidental expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the qualified settlement fund that would be deductible under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code in determining the taxable income of a corporation. Administrative costs and other incidental expenses include state and local taxes, legal, accounting, and actuarial fees relating to the operation of the qualified settlement fund, and expenses arising from the notification of claimants and the processing of their claims. Administrative costs and other incidental expenses do not include legal fees incurred by, or on behalf of, claimants.
(3) A deduction is allowed for losses sustained by the qualified settlement fund in connection with the sale, exchange, or worthlessness of property held by the fund to the extent the losses would be deductible in determining the taxable income of a corporation under section 165 (f) or (g), and sections 1211(a) and 1212(a).
(4) A deduction is allowed for the amount of a net operating loss of the qualified settlement fund to the extent the loss would be deductible in determining the taxable income of a corporation under section 172(a). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4), the net operating loss of a qualified settlement fund for a taxable year is the amount by which the deductions allowed under paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section exceed the gross income of the fund computed with the modification described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(c)
Partnership interests held by a qualified settlement fund on February 14, 1992
—(1)
In general.
For taxable years ending prior to January 1, 2003, a qualified settlement fund that holds a partnership interest it acquired prior to February 15, 1992, is allowed a deduction for its distributive share of that partnership's items of loss, deduction, or credit described in section 702(a) that would be deductible in determining the taxable income (or in the case of a credit, the income tax liability) of a corporation to the extent of the fund's distributive share of that partnership's items of income and gain described in section 702(a) for the same taxable year. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), a distributive share of a partnership credit is treated as a deduction in an amount equal to the amount of the credit divided by the rate described in paragraph (a) of this section.
(2)
Limitation on changes in partnership agreements and capital contributions.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, changes in a qualified settlement fund's distributive share of items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit are disregarded if—
(i) They result from a change in the terms of the partnership agreement on or after December 18, 1992, or a capital contribution to the partnership on or after December 18, 1992, unless the partnership agreement as in effect prior to December 18, 1992, requires the contribution; and
(ii) A principal purpose of the change in the terms of the partnership agreement or the capital contribution is to
circumvent the limitation described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(d)
Distributions to transferors and claimants.
Amounts that are distributed by a qualified settlement fund to, or on behalf of, a transferor or a claimant are not deductible by the fund.
(e)
Basis of property transferred to a qualified settlement fund.
A qualified settlement fund's initial basis in property it receives from a transferor (or from an insurer or other person on behalf of a transferor) is the fair market value of that property on the date of transfer to the fund.
(f)
Distribution of property.
A qualified settlement fund must treat a distribution of property as a sale or exchange of that property for purposes of section 1001(a). In computing gain or loss, the amount realized by the qualified settlement fund is the fair market value of the property on the date of distribution.
(g)
Other taxes.
The tax imposed under paragraph (a) of this section is in lieu of any other taxation of the income of a qualified settlement fund under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code. Thus, a qualified settlement fund is not subject to the alternative minimum tax of section 55, the accumulated earnings tax of section 531, the personal holding company tax of section 541, or the maximum capital gains rate of section 1(h). A qualified settlement fund is, however, subject to taxes that are not imposed on the income of a taxpayer, such as the tax on transfers of property to foreign entities under section 1491.
(h)
Denial of credits against tax.
The tax imposed on the modified gross income of a qualified settlement fund under paragraph (a) of this section may not be reduced or offset by any credits against tax provided by part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Taxable year and accounting method.
The taxable year of a qualified settlement fund is the calendar year. A qualified settlement fund must use an accrual method of accounting within the meaning of section 446(c).
(k)
Treatment as corporation for purposes of subtitle F.
Except as otherwise provided in § 1.468B-5(b), for purposes of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code, a qualified settlement fund is treated as a corporation and any tax imposed under paragraph (a) of this section is treated as a tax imposed by section 11. Subtitle F rules that apply to qualified settlement funds include, but are not limited to—
(1) A qualified settlement fund must file an income tax return with respect to the tax imposed under paragraph (a) of this section for each taxable year that the fund is in existence, whether or not the fund has gross income for that taxable year.
(2) A qualified settlement fund is in existence for the period that—
(i) Begins on the first date on which the fund is treated as a qualified settlement fund under § 1.468B-1; and
(ii) Ends on the earlier of the date the fund—
(A) No longer satisfies the requirements of § 1.468B-1; or
(B) No longer has any assets and will not receive any more transfers. (See paragraph (m) of this section for procedures for the prompt assessment of tax.)
(3) The income tax return of the qualified settlement fund must be filed on or before March 15 of the year following the close of the taxable year of the qualified settlement fund unless the fund is granted an extension of time for filing under section 6081. The return must be made by the administrator of the qualified settlement fund. The “administrator” (which may include a trustee if the qualified settlement fund is a trust) of a qualified settlement fund is, in order of priority—
(i) The person designated, or approved, by the governmental authority that ordered or approved the fund for purposes of § 1.468B-1(c)(1);
(ii) The person designated in the escrow agreement, settlement agreement, or other similar agreement governing the fund;
(iii) The escrow agent, custodian, or other person in possession or control of the fund's assets; or
(iv) The transferor or, if there are multiple transferors, all the transferors, unless an agreement signed by all the transferors designates a single transferor as the administrator.
(4) The administrator of a qualified settlement fund must obtain an employer identification number for the fund.
(5) A qualified settlement fund must deposit all payments of tax imposed under paragraph (a) of this section (including any payments of estimated tax) with an authorized government depositary in accordance with § 1.6302-1.
(6) A qualified settlement fund is subject to the addition to tax imposed by section 6655 in the case of an underpayment of estimated tax computed with respect to the tax imposed under paragraph (a) of this section. For purposes of section 6655(g)(2), a qualified settlement fund's taxable income is its modified gross income and a transferor is not considered a predecessor of a qualified settlement fund.
(l)
Information reporting and withholding requirements
—(1)
Payments to a qualified settlement fund.
Payments to a qualified settlement fund are treated as payments to a corporation for purposes of the information reporting requirements of part III of subchapter A of chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code.
(2)
Payments and distributions by a qualified settlement fund
—(i)
In general.
Payments and distributions by a qualified settlement fund are subject to the information reporting requirements of part III of subchapter A of chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), and the withholding requirements of subchapter A of chapter 3 of subtitle A and subtitle C of the Code.
(ii)
Special rules.
The following rules apply with respect to payments and distributions by a qualified settlement fund—
(A) A qualified settlement fund must make a return for, or must withhold tax on, a distribution to a claimant if one or more transferors would have been required to make a return or withhold tax had that transferor made the distribution directly to the claimant;
(B) For purposes of sections 6041(a) and 6041A, if a qualified settlement fund makes a payment or distribution to a transferor, the fund is deemed to make the payment or distribution to the transferor in the course of a trade or business;
(C) For purposes of sections 6041(a) and 6041A, if a qualified settlement fund makes a payment or distribution on behalf of a transferor or a claimant, the fund is deemed to make the payment or distribution to the recipient of that payment or distribution in the course of a trade or business;
(D) With respect to a distribution or payment described in paragraph (1)(2)(ii)(C) of this section and the information reporting requirements of part III of subchapter A of chapter 61 of the Internal Revenue Code, the qualified settlement fund is also deemed to have made the distribution or payment to the transferor or claimant.
(m)
Request for prompt assessment.
A qualified settlement fund is eligible to request the prompt assessment of tax under section 6501(d). For purposes of section 6501(d), a qualified settlement fund is treated as dissolving on the date the fund no longer has any assets (other than a reasonable reserve for potential tax liabilities and related professional fees) and will not receive any more transfers.
(n)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1.
On June 30, 1993, a United States federal district court approves the settlement of a lawsuit under which Corporation X must transfer $10,833,000 to a qualified settlement fund on August 1, 1993. The $10,833,000 includes $10 million of damages incurred by plaintiffs on October 1, 1992, and $833,000 of interest calculated at 10 percent annually from October 1, 1992, to August 1, 1993. The $833,000 of interest is not a payment to the qualified settlement fund in compensation for a late or delayed transfer to the fund within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section because the payment of $10,833,000 to the fund is not due until August 1, 1993.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that the settlement agreement also provides for interest to accrue at a rate of 12 percent annually on any amount not transferred to the qualified settlement fund on August 1, 1993, and the only transfer Corporation X makes to the fund is $11,374,650 on January 1, 1994. The additional payment of $541,650 ($11,374,650 paid on January 1, 1994, less $10,833,000 due on August 1, 1993) is a payment to the qualified settlement fund in compensation for a late or delayed transfer to the fund within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
[T.D. 8459, 57 FR 60991, Dec. 23, 1992; 58 FR 7865, Feb. 10, 1993]
§ 1.468B-3
Rules applicable to the transferor.
(a)
Transfer of property
—(1)
In general.
A transferor must treat a transfer of property to a qualified settlement fund as a sale or exchange of that property for purposes of section 1001(a). In computing the gain or loss, the amount realized by the transferor is the fair market value of the property on the date the transfer is made (or is treated as made under § 1.468B-1(g)) to the qualified settlement fund. Because the issuance of a transferor's debt, obligation to provide services or property in the future, or obligation to make a payment described in § 1.461-4(g), is generally not a transfer of property by the transferor, it generally does not result in gain or loss to the transferor under this paragraph (a)(1). If a person other than the transferor transfers property to a qualified settlement fund, there may be other tax consequences as determined under general federal income tax principles.
(2)
Anti-abuse rule.
The Commissioner may disallow a loss resulting from the transfer of property to a qualified settlement fund if the Commissioner determines that a principal purpose for the transfer was to claim the loss and—
(i) The transferor places significant restrictions on the fund's ability to use or dispose of the property; or
(ii) The property (or substantially similar property) is distributed to the transferor (or a related person).
(b)
Qualified appraisal requirement for transfers of certain property
—(1)
In general.
A transferor must obtain a qualified appraisal to support a loss or deduction it claims with respect to a transfer to a qualified settlement fund of the following types of property—
(i) Nonpublicly traded securities (as defined in § 1.170A-13(c)(7)(ix)) issued by the transferor (or a related person); and
(ii) Interests in the transferor (if the transferor is a partnership) and in a partnership in which the transferor (or a related person) is a direct or indirect partner.
(2)
Provision of copies.
The transferor must provide a copy of the qualified appraisal to the administrator of the qualified settlement fund no later than February 15 of the year following the calendar year in which the property is transferred. The transferor also must attach a copy of the qualified appraisal to (and as part of) its timely filed income tax return (including extensions) for the taxable year of the transferor in which the transfer is made.
(3)
Qualified appraisal.
A “qualified appraisal” is a written appraisal that—
(i) Is made within 60 days before or after the date the property is transferred to the qualified settlement fund;
(ii) Is prepared, signed, and dated by an individual who is a qualified appraiser within the meaning of § 1.170A-13(c)(5);
(iii) Includes the information required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and
(iv) Does not involve an appraisal fee of the type prohibited by § 1.170A-13(c)(6).
(4)
Information included in a qualified appraisal.
A qualified appraisal must include the following information—
(i) A description of the appraised property;
(ii) The date (or expected date) of the property's transfer to the qualified settlement fund;
(iii) The appraised fair market value of the property on the date (or expected date) of transfer;
(iv) The method of valuing the property, such as the comparable sales approach;
(v) The specific basis for the valuation, such as specific comparable sales or statistical sampling, including a justification for using comparable sales or statistical sampling and an explanation of the procedure employed;
(vi) The terms of any agreement or understanding entered into (or expected to be entered into) by or on behalf of the transferor (or a related person) or the qualified settlement fund that relates to the use, sale, or other disposition of the transferred property, including, for example, the terms of any agreement or understanding that temporarily or permanently—
(A) Restricts the qualified settlement fund's right to use or dispose of the property; or
(B) Reserves to, or confers upon, any person other than the qualified settlement fund any right (including designating another person as having the
right) to income from the property, to possess the property (including the right to purchase or otherwise acquire the property), or to exercise any voting rights with respect to the property;
(vii) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the qualified appraiser; and if the qualified appraiser is acting in his or her capacity as a partner in a partnership, an employee of any person, or an independent contractor engaged by a person other than the transferor, the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the partnership or the person who employs or engages the qualified appraiser;
(viii) The qualifications of the qualified appraiser, including the appraiser's background, experience, education, and membership, if any, in professional appraisal associations; and
(ix) A statement that the appraisal was prepared for income tax purposes.
(5)
Effect of signature of the qualified appraiser.
Any appraiser who falsely or fraudulently overstates the value of the transferred property referred to in a qualified appraisal may be subject to a civil penalty under section 6701 for aiding and abetting an understatement of tax liability and may have appraisals disregarded pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 330(c).
(c)
Economic performance
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (c), for purposes of section 461(h), economic performance occurs with respect to a liability described in § 1.468B-1(c)(2) (determined with regard to § 1.468B-1(f) and (g)) to the extent the transferor makes a transfer to a qualified settlement fund to resolve or satisfy the liability.
(2)
Right to a refund or reversion
—(i)
In general.
Economic performance does not occur to the extent—
(A) The transferor (or a related person) has a right to a refund or reversion of a transfer if that right is exercisable currently and without the agreement of an unrelated person that is independent or has an adverse interest (e.g., the court or agency that approved the fund, or the fund claimants); or
(B) Money or property is transferred under conditions that allow its refund or reversion by reason of the occurrence of an event that is certain to occur, such as the passage of time, or if restrictions on its refund or reversion are illusory.
(ii)
Right extinguished.
With respect to a transfer described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, economic performance is deemed to occur on the date, and to the extent, the transferor's right to a refund or reversion is extinguished.
(3)
Obligations of a transferor.
Economic performance does not occur when a transferor transfers to a qualified settlement fund its debt (or the debt of a related person). Instead, economic performance occurs as the transferor (or related person) makes principal payments on the debt. Similarly, economic performance does not occur when a transferor transfers to a qualified settlement fund its obligation (or the obligation of a related person) to provide services or property in the future, or to make a payment described in § 1.461-4(g). Instead, economic performance with respect to such an obligation occurs as services, property or payments are provided or made to the qualified settlement fund or a claimant.
(d)
Payment of insurance amounts.
No deduction is allowed to a transferor for a transfer to a qualified settlement fund to the extent the transferred amounts represent amounts received from the settlement of an insurance claim and are excludable from gross income. If the settlement of an insurance claim occurs after a transferor makes a transfer to a qualified settlement fund for which a deduction has been taken, the transferor must include in income the amounts received from the settlement of the insurance claim to the extent of the deduction.
(e)
Statement to the qualified settlement fund and the Internal Revenue Service
—(1)
In general.
A transferor must provide the statement described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section to the administrator of a qualified settlement fund no later than February 15 of the year following each calendar year in which the transferor (or an insurer or other person on behalf of the transferor) makes a transfer to the fund. The transferor must attach a copy of the statement to (and as part of) its
timely filed income tax return (including extensions) for the taxable year of the transferor in which the transfer is made.
(2)
Required statement
—(i)
In general.
The statement required by this paragraph (e) must provide the following information—
(A) A legend, “§ 1.468B-3 Statement”, at the top of the first page;
(B) The transferor's name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
(C) The qualified settlement fund's name, address, and employer identification number;
(D) The date of each transfer;
(E) The amount of cash transferred; and
(F) A description of property transferred and its fair market value on the date of transfer.
(ii)
Combined statements.
If a qualified settlement fund has more than one transferor, any two or more of the transferors may provide a combined statement to the administrator that does not identify the amount of cash or the property transferred by a particular transferor. If a combined statement is used, however, each transferor must include with its copy of the statement that is attached to its income tax return a schedule describing each asset that the transferor transferred to the qualified settlement fund.
(f)
Distributions to transferors
—(1)
In general.
A transferor must include in gross income any distribution (including a deemed distribution described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section) it receives from a qualified settlement fund. If property is distributed, the amount includible in gross income and the basis in that property, is the fair market value of the property on the date of the distribution.
(2)
Deemed distributions
—(i)
Other liabilities.
If a qualified settlement fund makes a distribution on behalf of a transferor to a person that is not a claimant, or to a claimant to resolve or satisfy a liability of the transferor (or a related person) other than a liability described in § 1.468B-1(c)(2) for which the fund was established, the distribution is deemed made by the fund to the transferor. The transferor, in turn, is deemed to have made a payment to the actual recipient.
(ii)
Constructive receipt.
To the extent a transferor acquires a right to a refund or reversion described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section of all or a portion of the assets of a qualified settlement fund subsequent to the transfer of those assets to the fund, the fund is deemed to distribute those assets to the transferor on the date the right is acquired.
(3)
Tax benefit rule.
A distribution described in paragraph (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this section is excluded from the gross income of a transferor to the extent provided by section 111(a).
(g)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this section:

On March 1, 1993, Individual A transfers $1 million to a qualified settlement fund to resolve or satisfy claims against him resulting from certain violations of securities laws. Individual A uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. Since Individual A does not use the accrual method of accounting, the economic performance rules of paragraph (c) of this section are not applicable. Therefore, whether, when, and to what extent Individual A can deduct the transfer is determined under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, such as sections 162 and 461.
[T.D. 8459, 57 FR 60992, Dec. 23, 1992]
§ 1.468B-4
Taxability of distributions to claimants.
Whether a distribution to a claimant is includible in the claimant's gross income is generally determined by reference to the claim in respect of which the distribution is made and as if the distribution were made directly by the transferor. For example, to the extent a distribution is in satisfaction of damages on account of personal injury or sickness, the distribution may be excludable from gross income under section 104(a)(2). Similarly, to the extent a distribution is in satisfaction of a claim for foregone taxable interest, the distribution is includible in the claimant's gross income under section 61(a)(4).
[T.D. 8459, 57 FR 60994, Dec. 23, 1992]
§ 1.468B-5
Effective dates and transition rules applicable to qualified settlement funds.
(a)
In general.
Section 468B, including section 468B(g), is effective as provided in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and the
Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988. Except as otherwise provided in this section, §§ 1.468B-1 through 1.468-4 are effective on January 1, 1993. Thus, the regulations apply to income of a qualified settlement fund earned after December 31, 1992, transfers to a fund after December 31, 1992, and distributions from a fund after December 31, 1992. For purposes of § 1.468B-3(c) (relating to economic performance), previously transferred assets held by a qualified settlement fund on the date these regulations first apply to the fund (i.e., January 1, 1993, or the earlier date provided under paragraph (b)(2) of this section) are treated as transferred to the fund on that date, to the extent no taxpayer has previously claimed a deduction for the transfer.
(b)
Taxation of certain pre-1996 fund income
—(1)
Reasonable method
—(i)
In general.
With respect to a fund, account, or trust established after August 16, 1986, but prior to February 15, 1992, that satisfies (or, if it no longer exists, would have satisfied) the requirements of § 1.468B-1(c), the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge a reasonable, consistently applied method of taxation for transfers to the fund, income earned by the fund, and distributions made by the fund after August 16, 1986, but prior to January 1, 1996. A method is generally considered reasonable if, depending on the facts and circumstances, all transferors and the administrator of the fund have consistently treated transfers to the fund, income earned by the fund, and distributions made by the fund after August 16, 1986, as if the fund were—
(A) A grantor trust and the transferors are the grantors;
(B) A complex trust and the transferors are the grantors; or
(C) A designated settlement fund.
(ii)
Qualified settlement funds established after February 14, 1992, but before January 1, 1993.
With respect to a fund, account, or trust established after February 14, 1992, but prior to January 1, 1993, that satisfies the requirements of § 1.468B-1(c), the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge a reasonable, consistently applied method of taxation as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for transfers to, income earned by, and distributions made by the fund prior to January 1, 1993. However, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, sections 1.468B-1 through 1.468B-4 apply to transfers to, income earned by, and distributions made by the qualified settlement fund after 1992.
(iii)
Use of cash method of accounting.
For purposes of paragraphs (b)(i) and (b)(ii) of this section, for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1996, the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge the use of the cash receipts and disbursement method of accounting by a fund, account, or trust.
(iv)
Unreasonable position.
In no event is it a reasonable position to assert, pursuant to Rev. Rul. 71-119 (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter), that there is no current taxation of the income of a fund established after August 16, 1986.
(v)
Waiver of penalties.
For taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1993, if a fund, account or trust is subject to section 468B(g) and the Internal Revenue Service does not challenge the method of taxation for transfers to, income earned by, and distributions made by, the fund pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section, penalties will not be imposed in connection with the use of such method. For example, the penalties under section 6655 for failure to pay estimated tax, section 6651(a)(1) for failure to file a return, section 6651(a)(2) for failure to pay tax, section 6656 for failure to make deposit of taxes, and section 6662 for accuracy-related underpayments will generally not be imposed.
(2)
Election to apply qualified settlement fund rules
—(i)
In general.
The person that will be the administrator of a qualified settlement fund may elect to apply §§ 1.468B-1 through 1.468B-4 to transfers to, income earned by, and distributions made by, the fund in taxable years ending after August 16, 1986. The election is effective beginning on the first day of the earliest open taxable year of the qualified settlement fund. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), a taxable year is considered open if the period for assessment and collection of tax has not expired pursuant to the rules of section 6501. The election
statement must provide the information described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section and must be signed by the person that will be the administrator. Such person must also provide each transferor of the qualified settlement fund with a copy of the election statement on or before March 15, 1993.
(ii)
Election statement.
The election statement must provide the following information—
(A) A legend, “§ 1.468B-5(b)(2) Election”, at the top of the first page;
(B) Each transferor's name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
(C) The qualified settlement fund's name, address, and employer identification number; and
(D) The date the qualified settlement fund was established within the meaning of § 1.468B-1(j).
(iii)
Due date of returns and amended returns.
The election statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section must be filed with, and as part of, the qualified settlement fund's timely filed tax return for the taxable year ended December 31, 1992. In addition, the qualified settlement fund must file an amended return that is consistent with the requirements of §§ 1.468B-1 through 1.468B-4 for any taxable year to which the election applies in which the fund took a position inconsistent with those requirements. Any such amended return must be filed no later than March 15, 1993, and must include a copy of the election statement described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
(iv)
Computation of interest and waiver of penalties.
For purposes of section 6601 and section 6611, the income tax return for each taxable year of the qualified settlement fund to which the election applies is due on March 15 of the year following the taxable year of the fund. For taxable years of a qualified settlement fund ending prior to January 1, 1993, the income earned by the fund is deemed to have been earned on December 31 of each taxable year for purposes of section 6655. Thus, the addition to tax for failure to pay estimated tax under section 6655 will not be imposed. The penalty for failure to file a return under section 6651(a)(1), the penalty for failure to pay tax under section 6651(a)(2), the penalty for failure to make deposit of taxes under section 6656, and the accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 will not be imposed on a qualified settlement fund if the fund files its tax returns for taxable years ending prior to January 1, 1993, and pays any tax due for those taxable years, on or before March 15, 1993.
(c)
Grantor trust elections under § 1.468B-1(k)
—(1)
In general.
A transferor may make a grantor trust election under § 1.468B-1(k) if the qualified settlement fund is established after February 3, 2006.
(2)
Transition rules.
A transferor may make a grantor trust election under § 1.468B-1(k) for a qualified settlement fund that was established on or before February 3, 2006, if the applicable period of limitation on filing an amended return has not expired for both the qualified settlement fund's first taxable year and all subsequent taxable years and the transferor's corresponding taxable year or years. A grantor trust election under this paragraph (c)(2) requires that the returns of the qualified settlement fund and the transferor for all affected taxable years are consistent with the grantor trust election. This requirement may be satisfied by timely filed original returns or amended returns filed before the applicable period of limitation expires.
(3)
Qualified settlement funds established by the U.S. government on or before
February 3, 2006. If the U.S. government, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, established a qualified settlement fund on or before February 3, 2006, and the fund would have been classified as a trust all of which is treated as owned by the U.S. government under section 671 and the regulations thereunder without regard to the regulations under section 468B, then the U.S. government is deemed to have made a grantor trust election under § 1.468B-1(k), and the election is applicable for all taxable years of the fund.
[T.D. 8459, 57 FR 60994, Dec. 23, 1992, as amended by T.D. 9249, 71 FR 6201, Feb. 7, 2006]
§ 1.468B-6
Escrow accounts, trusts, and other funds used during deferred exchanges of like-kind property under section 1031(a)(3).
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules under section 468B(g) relating to the
current taxation of escrow accounts, trusts, and other funds used during deferred exchanges.
(b)
Definitions.
The definitions in this paragraph (b) apply for purposes of this section.
(1)
In general. Deferred exchange, escrow agreement, escrow holder, exchange agreement, qualified escrow account, qualified intermediary, qualified trust, relinquished property, replacement property, taxpayer, trust agreement
, and
trustee
have the same meanings as in § 1.1031(k)-1; deferred exchange also includes any exchange intended to qualify as a deferred exchange, and qualified intermediary also includes any person or entity intended by a taxpayer to be a qualified intermediary within the meaning of § 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4).
(2)
Exchange funds. Exchange funds
means relinquished property, cash, or cash equivalent that secures an obligation of a transferee to transfer replacement property, or proceeds from a transfer of relinquished property, held in a qualified escrow account, qualified trust, or other escrow account, trust, or fund in a deferred exchange.
(3)
Exchange facilitator. Exchange facilitator
means a qualified intermediary, transferee, escrow holder, trustee, or other party that holds exchange funds for a taxpayer in a deferred exchange pursuant to an escrow agreement, trust agreement, or exchange agreement.
(4)
Transactional expenses
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section,
transactional expenses
means transactional items within the meaning of § 1.1031(k)-1(g)(7)(ii).
(ii)
Special rule for certain fees for exchange facilitator services.
The fee for the services of an exchange facilitator is not a transactional expense unless the escrow agreement, trust agreement, or exchange agreement, as applicable, provides that—
(A) The amount of the fee payable to the exchange facilitator is fixed on or before the date of the transfer of the relinquished property by the taxpayer (either by stating the fee as a fixed dollar amount in the agreement or determining the fee by a formula, the result of which is known on or before the transfer of the relinquished property by the taxpayer); and
(B) The amount of the fee is payable by the taxpayer regardless of whether the earnings attributable to the exchange funds are sufficient to pay the fee.
(c)
Taxation of exchange funds
—(1)
Exchange funds generally treated as loaned to an exchange facilitator.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, exchange funds are treated as loaned from a taxpayer to an exchange facilitator (exchange facilitator loan). If a transaction is treated as an exchange facilitator loan under this paragraph (c)(1), the exchange facilitator must take into account all items of income, deduction, and credit (including capital gains and losses) attributable to the exchange funds. See § 1.7872-16 to determine if an exchange facilitator loan is a below-market loan for purposes of section 7872 and § 1.7872-5(b)(16) to determine if an exchange facilitator loan is exempt from section 7872.
(2)
Exchange funds not treated as loaned to an exchange facilitator
—(i)
Scope.
This paragraph (c)(2) applies if, in accordance with an escrow agreement, trust agreement, or exchange agreement, as applicable, all the earnings attributable to a taxpayer's exchange funds are paid to the taxpayer.
(ii)
Earnings attributable to the taxpayer's exchange funds
—(A)
Separately identified account.
If an exchange facilitator holds all of the taxpayer's exchange funds in a separately identified account, the earnings credited to that account are deemed to be all the earnings attributable to the taxpayer's exchange funds for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. In general, a separately identified account is an account established under the taxpayer's name and taxpayer identification number with a depository institution. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a sub-account will be treated as a separately identified account if the master account under which the sub-account is created is established with a depository institution, the depository institution identifies the sub-account by the taxpayer's
name and taxpayer identification number, and the depository institution specifically credits earnings to the sub-account.
(B)
Allocation of earnings in commingled accounts.
If an exchange facilitator commingles (for investment or otherwise) the taxpayer's exchange funds with other funds or assets, all the earnings attributable to the taxpayer's exchange funds are paid to the taxpayer if all of the earnings attributable to the commingled funds or assets that are allocable on a pro-rata basis (using a reasonable method that takes into account the time that the exchange funds are in the commingled account, actual rate or rates of return, and the respective account balances) to the taxpayer's exchange funds either are paid to the taxpayer or are treated as paid to the taxpayer under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.
(C)
Transactional expenses.
Any payment from the taxpayer's exchange funds, or from the earnings attributable to the taxpayer's exchange funds, for a transactional expense of the taxpayer (as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section) is treated as first paid to the taxpayer and then paid by the taxpayer to the recipient.
(iii)
Treatment of the taxpayer.
If this paragraph (c)(2) applies, exchange funds are not treated as loaned from a taxpayer to an exchange facilitator. The taxpayer must take into account all items of income, deduction, and credit (including capital gains and losses) attributable to the exchange funds.
(d)
Information reporting requirements.
A payor (as defined in § 1.6041-1) must report the income attributable to exchange funds to the extent required by the information reporting provisions of subpart B, Part III, subchapter A, chapter 61, Subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code, and the regulations under those provisions. See § 1.6041-1(f) for rules relating to the amount to be reported when fees, expenses or commissions owed by a payee to a third party are deducted from a payment.
(e)
Examples.
The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples in which T is a taxpayer that uses a calendar taxable year and the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1. All earnings attributable to exchange funds paid to taxpayer.
(i) T enters into a deferred exchange with R. The sales agreement provides that T will transfer property (the relinquished property) to R and R will transfer replacement property to T. R's obligation to transfer replacement property to T is secured by cash equal to the fair market value of the relinquished property, which R will deposit into a qualified escrow account that T establishes with B, a depository institution. T enters into an escrow agreement with B that provides that all the earnings attributable to the exchange funds will be paid to T.
(ii) On November 1, 2008, T transfers property to R and R deposits $2,100,000 in T's qualified escrow account with B. Between November 1 and December 31, 2008, B credits T's account with $14,000 of interest. During January 2009, B credits T's account with $7000 of interest. On February 1, 2009, R transfers replacement property worth $2,100,000 to T and B pays $2,100,000 from the qualified escrow account to R. Additionally, on February 1, 2009, B pays the $21,000 of interest to T.
(iii) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the $2,100,000 deposited with B constitutes exchange funds and B is an exchange facilitator. Because all the earnings attributable to the exchange funds are paid to T in accordance with the escrow agreement, paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. The exchange funds are not treated as loaned from T to B. T must take into account in computing T's income tax liability for 2008 the $14,000 of earnings credited to the qualified escrow account in 2008 and for 2009 the $7,000 of earnings credited to the qualified escrow account in 2009.

# Example 2. Payment of transactional expenses from earnings.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
, except that the escrow agreement provides that, prior to paying the earnings to T, B may deduct any amounts B has paid to third parties for T's transactional expenses. B pays a third party $350 on behalf of T for a survey of the replacement property. After deducting $350 from the earnings attributable to T's qualified escrow account, B pays T the remainder ($20,650) of the earnings.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the cost of the survey is a transactional expense. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the $350 that B pays for the survey is treated as first paid to T and then from T to the third party. Therefore, all the earnings attributable to T's exchange funds are paid or treated as paid to T in accordance with the escrow agreement, and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. The exchange funds are not treated as loaned from T to B,
and T must take into account in computing T's income tax liability the $21,000 of earnings credited to the qualified escrow account.

# Example 3. Earnings retained by exchange facilitator as compensation for services.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
, except that the escrow agreement provides that B also may deduct any outstanding fees owed by T for B's services in facilitating the deferred exchange. In accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, the escrow agreement provides for a fixed fee of $1,200 for B's services, which is payable by T regardless of the amount of earnings attributable to the exchange funds. Because the earnings on the exchange funds in this case exceed $1,200, B retains $1,200 as the unpaid portion of its fee and pays T the remainder ($19,800) of the earnings.
(ii) Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, B's fee is treated as a transactional expense. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the $1200 that B retains for its fee is treated as first paid to T and then from T to B. Therefore, all the earnings attributable to T's exchange funds are paid or treated as paid to T in accordance with the escrow agreement, and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. The exchange funds are not treated as loaned from T to B, and T must take into account in computing T's income tax liability the $21,000 of earnings credited to the qualified escrow account.

# Example 4. Exchange funds deposited by exchange facilitator with related depository institution in account in taxpayer's name.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that, instead of entering into an escrow agreement, T enters into an exchange agreement with QI, a qualified intermediary. The exchange agreement provides that R will pay $2,100,000 to QI, QI will deposit $2,100,000 into an account with a depository institution under T's name and taxpayer identification number (TIN), and all the earnings attributable to the account will be paid to T.
(ii) On May 1, 2008, T transfers property to QI, QI transfers the property to R, R delivers $2,100,000 to QI, and QI deposits $2,100,000 into a money market account with depository institution B under T's name and TIN. B and QI are members of the same consolidated group of corporations within the meaning of section 1501. Between May 1 and September 1, 2008, the account earns $28,000 of interest at the stated rate established by B. During the period May 1 to September 1, 2008, B invests T's exchange funds and earns $40,000. On September 1, 2008, QI uses $2,100,000 of the funds in the account to purchase replacement property identified by T and transfers the replacement property to T. B pays to T the $28,000 of interest earned on the money market account at the stated rate.
(iii) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the $2,100,000 QI receives from R for the relinquished property is exchange funds and QI is an exchange facilitator. B is not an exchange facilitator. T has not entered into an escrow agreement, trust agreement, or exchange agreement with B, and QI, not B, holds the exchange funds on behalf of T. Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the $40,000 B earns from investing T's exchange funds are not treated as earnings attributable to T's exchange funds. Because all the earnings attributable to T's exchange funds are paid to T in accordance with the exchange agreement, paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. The exchange funds are not treated as loaned from T to QI, and T must take into account in computing T's income tax liability for 2008 the $28,000 of interest earned on the money market account.

# Example 5. Earnings of related depository institution credited to exchange facilitator.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 4
, except that at the end of each taxable year, B credits a portion of its earnings on deposits to QI. The amount credited is based on the total amount of exchange funds QI has deposited with B during the year. At the end of the 2008 taxable year, B credits $152,500 of B's earnings to QI.
(ii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, no part of the $152,500 credited by B to QI is earnings attributable to T's exchange funds. Therefore, all of the earnings attributable to the exchange funds are paid to T in accordance with the exchange agreement, and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. The exchange funds are not treated as loaned from T to QI, and T must take into account in computing T's income tax liability for 2008 the $28,000 of interest earned on T's account.

# Example 6. Exchange funds deposited by exchange facilitator with unrelated depository institution in sub-account in taxpayer's name.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 4
, except that QI and B are unrelated and the money market account in which QI deposits the $2,100,000 received from T is a sub-account within a master account QI maintains with B in QI's name and TIN. The master account includes other sub-accounts, each in the name and TIN of a taxpayer that has entered into an exchange agreement with QI, into which QI deposits each taxpayer's exchange funds. Each month, B transfers to QI's master account an additional amount of interest based upon the average daily balance of all exchange funds within the master account during the month. At the end of the 2008 taxable year, B has credited $152,500 of additional interest to QI.
(ii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, no part of the $152,500 credited by B to QI is earnings attributable to T's exchange funds. Therefore, all of the earnings attributable to the exchange funds are paid
to T in accordance with the exchange agreement, and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. The exchange funds are not treated as loaned from T to QI, and T must take into account in computing T's income tax liability for 2008 the $28,000 of interest earned on T's account.

# Example 7. Marketing fee paid to exchange facilitator.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 4
, except that at the end of each taxable year, B pays a marketing fee to QI for using B as its depository institution for exchange funds. The amount of the fee is based on the total amount of exchange funds QI has deposited with B during the year.
(ii) Under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, no part of the marketing fee that B pays to QI is earnings attributable to T's exchange funds. Therefore, all of the earnings attributable to the exchange funds are paid to T in accordance with the exchange agreement, and paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. The exchange funds are not treated as loaned from T to QI, and T must take into account in computing T's income tax liability for 2008 the $28,000 of interest earned on T's account.

# Example 8. Stated rate of interest on account less than earnings attributable to exchange funds.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 4
, except that the exchange agreement provides only that QI will pay T a stated rate of interest. QI invests the exchange funds and earns $40,000. The exchange funds earn $28,000 at the stated rate of interest, and QI pays the $28,000 to T.
(ii) Paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies and the exchange funds are treated as loaned from T to QI. QI must take into account in computing QI's income tax liability all items of income, deduction, and credit (including capital gains and losses) attributable to the exchange funds. Paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not apply because QI does not pay all the earnings attributable to the exchange funds to T. See §§ 1.7872-5 and 1.7872-16 for rules relating to exchange facilitator loans.

# Example 9. All earnings attributable to commingled exchange funds paid to taxpayer.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 4
, except that the exchange agreement does not specify how the $2,100,000 QI receives from R must be invested.
(ii) On May 1, 2008, QI deposits the $2,100,000 with B in a pre-existing interest-bearing account under QI's name and TIN. The account has a total balance of $5,275,000 immediately thereafter. On the last day of each month between May and September, 2008, the account earns interest as follows: $17,583 in May, $17,642 in June, $18,756 in July, and $17,472 in August. On July 11, 2008, QI deposits $500,000 in the account. On August 15, 2008, QI withdraws $1,175,000 from the account.
(iii) QI calculates T's pro-rata share of the earnings allocable to the $2,100,000 based on the actual return, the average daily principal balances, and a 30-day month convention, as follows:
Month
Account's avg. daily bal.

(iv) On September 1, 2008, QI uses $2,100,000 of the funds to purchase replacement property identified by T and transfers the property to T. QI pays $28,410, the earnings of the account allocated to T's exchange funds, to T.
(v) Because QI uses a reasonable method to calculate the pro-rata share of account earnings allocable to T's exchange funds in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, and pays all those earnings to T, paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies. The exchange funds are not treated as loaned from T to QI. T must take into account in computing T's income tax liability for 2008 the $28,410 of earnings attributable to T's exchange funds.
(f)
Effective/applicability dates
—(1)
In general.
This section applies to transfers of relinquished property made by taxpayers on or after October 8, 2008.
(2)
Transition rule.
With respect to transfers of relinquished property made by taxpayers after August 16, 1986, but before October 8, 2008, the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge a reasonable, consistently applied method of taxation for income attributable to exchange funds.
[T.D. 9413, 73 FR 39620, July 10, 2008]
§ 1.468B-7
Pre-closing escrows.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules under section 468B(g) for the current taxation of income of a pre-closing escrow.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section—
(1) A
pre-closing escrow
is an escrow account, trust, or fund—
(i) Established in connection with the sale or exchange of real or personal property;
(ii) Funded with a down payment, earnest money, or similar payment that is deposited into the escrow prior to the sale or exchange of the property;
(iii) Used to secure the obligation of the purchaser to pay the purchase price for the property;
(iv) The assets of which, including any income earned thereon, will be paid to the purchaser or otherwise distributed for the purchaser's benefit when the property is sold or exchanged (for example, by being distributed to the seller as a credit against the purchase price); and
(v) Which is not an escrow account or trust established in connection with a deferred exchange under section 1031(a)(3).
(2)
Purchaser
means, in the case of an exchange, the intended transferee of the property whose obligation to pay the purchase price is secured by the pre-closing escrow;
(3)
Purchase price
means, in the case of an exchange, the required consideration for the property; and
(4)
Administrator
means the escrow agent, escrow holder, trustee, or other person responsible for administering the pre-closing escrow.
(c)
Taxation of pre-closing escrows.
The purchaser must take into account in computing the purchaser's income tax liability all items of income, deduction, and credit (including capital gains and losses) of the pre-closing escrow. In the case of an exchange with a single pre-closing escrow funded by two or more purchasers, each purchaser must take into account in computing the purchaser's income tax liability all items of income, deduction, and credit (including capital gains and losses) earned by the pre-closing escrow with respect to the money or property deposited in the pre-closing escrow by or on behalf of that purchaser.
(d)
Reporting obligations of the administrator.
For each calendar year (or portion thereof) that a pre-closing escrow is in existence, the administrator must report the income of the pre-closing escrow on Form 1099 to the extent required by the information reporting provisions of subpart B, Part III, subchapter A, chapter 61, Subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. See § 1.6041-1(f) for rules relating to the amount to be reported when fees, expenses, or commissions owed by a payee to a third party are deducted from a payment.
(e)
Examples.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
P enters into a contract with S for the purchase of residential property owned by S for the price of $200,000. P is required to deposit $10,000 of earnest money into an escrow. At closing, the $10,000 and the interest earned thereon will be credited against the purchase price of the property. The escrow is a pre-closing escrow. P is taxable on the interest earned on the pre-closing escrow prior to closing.

# Example 2.
X and Y enter into a contract in which X agrees to exchange certain construction equipment for residential property owned by Y. The contract requires X and Y to each deposit $10,000 of earnest money into an escrow. At closing, $10,000 and the interest earned thereon will be paid to X and $10,000 and the interest earned thereon will be paid to Y. The escrow is a pre-closing escrow. X is taxable on the interest earned prior to closing on the $10,000 of funds X deposited in the pre-closing escrow. Similarly, Y is taxable on the interest earned prior to closing on the $10,000 of funds Y deposited in the pre-closing escrow.
(f)

[T.D. 9249, 71 FR 6202, Feb. 7, 2006]
§ 1.468B-8
Contingent-at-closing escrows. [Reserved]
§ 1.468B-9
Disputed ownership funds.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides rules under section 468B(g) relating to the current taxation of income of a disputed ownership fund.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section—
(1)
Disputed ownership fund
means an escrow account, trust, or fund that—
(i) Is established to hold money or property subject to conflicting claims of ownership;
(ii) Is subject to the continuing jurisdiction of a court;
(iii) Requires the approval of the court to pay or distribute money or property to, or on behalf of, a claimant, transferor, or transferor-claimant; and
(iv) Is not a qualified settlement fund under § 1.468B-1, a bankruptcy estate (or part thereof) resulting from the commencement of a case under title 11 of the United States Code, or a liquidating trust under § 301.7701-4(d) of this chapter (except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section);
(2)
Administrator
means a person designated as such by a court having jurisdiction over a disputed ownership fund, however, if no person is designated, the administrator is the escrow agent, escrow holder, trustee, receiver, or other person responsible for administering the fund;
(3)
Claimant
means a person who claims ownership of, in whole or in part, or a legal or equitable interest in, money or property immediately before and immediately after that property is transferred to a disputed ownership fund;
(4)
Court
means a court of law or equity of the United States or of any state (including the District of Columbia), territory, possession, or political subdivision thereof;
(5)
Disputed property
means money or property held in a disputed ownership fund subject to the claimants' conflicting claims of ownership;
(6)
Related person
means any person that is related to a transferor within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1);
(7)
Transferor
means, in general, a person that transfers disputed property to a disputed ownership fund, except that—
(i) If disputed property is transferred by an agent, fiduciary, or other person acting in a similar capacity, the transferor is the person on whose behalf the agent, fiduciary, or other person acts; and
(ii) A payor of interest or other income earned by a disputed ownership fund is not a transferor within the meaning of this section (unless the payor is also a claimant);
(8)
Transferor-claimant
means a transferor that claims ownership of, in whole or in part, or a legal or equitable interest in, the disputed property immediately before and immediately after that property is transferred to the disputed ownership fund. Because a transferor-claimant is both a transferor and a claimant, generally the terms
transferor
and
claimant
also include a transferor-claimant. See paragraph (d) of this section for rules applicable only to transferors that are not transferor-claimants and paragraph (e) of this section for rules applicable only to transferors that are also transferor-claimants.
(c)
Taxation of a disputed ownership fund
—(1)
In general.
For Federal income tax purposes, a disputed ownership fund is treated as the owner of all assets that it holds. A disputed ownership fund is treated as a C corporation for purposes of subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code, and the administrator of the fund must obtain an employer identification number for the fund, make all required income tax and information returns, and deposit all tax payments. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a disputed ownership fund is taxable as—
(i) A C corporation, unless all the assets transferred to the fund by or on behalf of transferors are passive investment assets. For purposes of this section, passive investment assets are assets of the type that generate portfolio income within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i); or
(ii) A qualified settlement fund, if all the assets transferred to the fund by or on behalf of transferors are passive investment assets. A disputed ownership fund taxable as a qualified settlement fund under this section is subject to all the provisions contained in § 1.468B-2, except that the rules contained in paragraphs (c)(3), (4), and (c)(5)(i) of this section apply in lieu of the rules in § 1.468B-2(b)(1), (d), (e), (f) and (j).
(2)
Exceptions.
(i) The claimants to a disputed ownership fund may submit a private letter ruling request proposing a method of taxation different than the method provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(ii) The trustee of a liquidating trust established pursuant to a plan confirmed by the court in a case under title 11 of the United States Code may, in the liquidating trust's first taxable year, elect to treat an escrow account, trust, or fund that holds assets of the liquidating trust that are subject to disputed claims as a disputed ownership fund. Pursuant to this election, creditors holding disputed claims are not treated as transferors of the money or property transferred to the disputed ownership fund. A trustee makes the election by attaching a statement to the timely filed Federal income tax return of the disputed ownership fund for the taxable year for which the election becomes effective. The election statement must include a statement that the trustee will treat the escrow account, trust, or fund as a disputed ownership fund and must include a legend, “§ 1.468B-9(c) Election,” at the top of the page. The election may be revoked only upon consent of the Commissioner by private letter ruling.
(3)
Property received by the disputed ownership fund
—(i)
Generally excluded from income.
In general, a disputed ownership fund does not include an amount in income on account of a transfer of disputed property to the disputed ownership fund. However, the accrual or receipt of income from the disputed property in a disputed ownership fund is not a transfer of disputed property to the fund. Therefore, a disputed ownership fund must include in income all income received or accrued from the disputed property, including items such as—
(A) Payments to a disputed ownership fund made in compensation for late or delayed transfers of money or property;
(B) Dividends on stock of a transferor (or a related person) held by the fund; and
(C) Interest on debt of a transferor (or a related person) held by the fund.
(ii)
Basis and holding period.
In general, the initial basis of property transferred by, or on behalf of, a transferor to a disputed ownership fund is the fair market value of the property on the date of transfer to the fund, and the fund's holding period begins on the date of the transfer. However, if the transferor is a transferor-claimant, the fund's initial basis in the property is the same as the basis of the transferor-claimant immediately before the transfer to the fund, and the fund = s holding period for the property is determined under section 1223(2).
(4)
Property distributed by the disputed ownership fund
—(i)
Computing gain or loss.
Except in the case of a distribution or deemed distribution described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a disputed ownership fund must treat a distribution of disputed property as a sale or exchange of that property for purposes of section 1001(a). In computing gain or loss, the amount realized by the disputed ownership fund is the fair market value of that property on the date of distribution.
(ii)
Denial of deduction.
A disputed ownership fund is not allowed a deduction for a distribution of disputed property or of the net after-tax income earned by the disputed ownership fund made to or on behalf of a transferor or claimant.
(5)
Taxable year and accounting method.
(i) A disputed ownership fund taxable as a C corporation under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section may compute taxable income under any accounting method allowable under section 446 and is not subject to the limitations contained in section 448. A disputed ownership fund taxable as a C corporation may use any taxable year allowable under section 441.
(ii) A disputed ownership fund taxable as a qualified settlement fund under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section may compute taxable income under any accounting method allowable under section 446 and may use any taxable year allowable under section 441.
(iii) Appropriate adjustments must be made by a disputed ownership fund or transferors to the fund to prevent the fund and the transferors from taking into account the same item of income, deduction, gain, loss, or credit (including capital gains and losses)
more than once or from omitting such items. For example, if a transferor that is not a transferor-claimant uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and transfers an account receivable to a disputed ownership fund that uses an accrual method of accounting, at the time of the transfer of the account receivable to the disputed ownership fund, the transferor must include in its gross income the value of the account receivable because, under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the disputed ownership fund will take a fair market value basis in the receivable and will not include the fair market value in its income when received from the transferor or when paid by the customer. If the account receivable were transferred to the disputed ownership fund by a transferor-claimant using the cash receipts and disbursements method, however, the disputed ownership fund would take a basis in the receivable equal to the transferor's basis, or $0, and would be required to report the income upon collection of the account.
(6)
Unused carryovers.
Upon the termination of a disputed ownership fund, if the fund has an unused net operating loss carryover under section 172, an unused capital loss carryover under section 1212, or an unused tax credit carryover, or if the fund has, for its last taxable year, deductions in excess of gross income, the claimant to which the fund's net assets are distributable will succeed to and take into account the fund's unused net operating loss carryover, unused capital loss carryover, unused tax credit carryover, or excess of deductions over gross income for the last taxable year of the fund. If the fund's net assets are distributable to more than one claimant, the unused net operating loss carryover, unused capital loss carryover, unused tax credit carryover, or excess of deductions over gross income for the last taxable year must be allocated among the claimants in proportion to the value of the assets distributable to each claimant from the fund. Unused carryovers described in this paragraph (c)(6) are not money or other property for purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section and thus are not deemed transferred to a transferor-claimant before being transferred to the claimants described in this paragraph (c)(6).
(d)
Rules applicable to transferors that are not transferor-claimants.
The rules in this paragraph (d) apply to transferors (as defined in paragraph (b)(7) of this section) that are not transferor-claimants (as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section).
(1)
Transfer of property.
A transferor must treat a transfer of property to a disputed ownership fund as a sale or other disposition of that property for purposes of section 1001(a). In computing the gain or loss on the disposition, the amount realized by the transferor is the fair market value of the property on the date the transfer is made to the disputed ownership fund.
(2)
Economic performance
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of section 461(h), if a transferor using an accrual method of accounting has a liability for which economic performance would otherwise occur under § 1.461-4(g) when the transferor makes payment to the claimant or claimants, economic performance occurs with respect to the liability when and to the extent that the transferor makes a transfer to a disputed ownership fund to resolve or satisfy that liability.
(ii)
Obligations of the transferor.
Economic performance does not occur when a transferor using an accrual method of accounting issues to a disputed ownership fund its debt (or provides the debt of a related person). Instead, economic performance occurs as the transferor (or related person) makes principal payments on the debt. Economic performance does not occur when the transferor provides to a disputed ownership fund its obligation (or the obligation of a related person) to provide property or services in the future or to make a payment described in § 1.461-4(g)(1)(ii)(A). Instead, economic performance occurs with respect to such an obligation as property or services are provided or payments are made to the disputed ownership fund or a claimant. With regard to interest on a debt issued or provided to a disputed ownership fund, economic performance occurs as determined under § 1.461-4(e).
(3)
Distributions to transferors
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in section 111(a) and paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this
section, the transferor must include in gross income any distribution to the transferor (including a deemed distribution described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section) from the disputed ownership fund. If property is distributed, the amount includible in gross income and the basis in that property are generally the fair market value of the property on the date of distribution.
(ii)
Exception.
A transferor is not required to include in gross income a distribution of money or property that it previously transferred to the disputed ownership fund if the transferor did not take into account, for example, by deduction or capitalization, an amount with respect to the transfer either at the time of the transfer to, or while the money or property was held by, the disputed ownership fund. The transferor's gross income does not include a distribution of money from the disputed ownership fund equal to the net after-tax income earned on money or property transferred to the disputed ownership fund by the transferor while that money or property was held by the fund. Money distributed to a transferor by a disputed ownership fund will be deemed to be distributed first from the money or property transferred to the disputed ownership fund by that transferor, then from the net after-tax income of any money or property transferred to the disputed ownership fund by that transferor, and then from other sources.
(iii)
Deemed distributions.
If a disputed ownership fund makes a distribution of money or property on behalf of a transferor to a person that is not a claimant, the distribution is deemed made by the fund to the transferor. The transferor, in turn, is deemed to make a payment to the actual recipient.
(e)
Rules applicable to transferor-claimants.
The rules in this paragraph (e) apply to transferor-claimants (as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section).
(1)
Transfer of property.
A transfer of property by a transferor-claimant to a disputed ownership fund is not a sale or other disposition of the property for purposes of section 1001(a).
(2)
Economic performance
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of section 461(h), if a transferor-claimant using an accrual method of accounting has a liability for which economic performance would otherwise occur under § 1.461-4(g) when the transferor-claimant makes payment to another claimant, economic performance occurs with respect to the liability when and to the extent that the disputed ownership fund transfers money or property to the other claimant to resolve or satisfy that liability.
(ii)
Obligations of the transferor-claimant.
Economic performance does not occur when a disputed ownership fund transfers the debt of a transferor-claimant (or of a person related to the transferor-claimant) to another claimant. Instead, economic performance occurs as principal payments on the debt are made to the other claimant. Economic performance does not occur when a disputed ownership fund transfers to another claimant the obligation of a transferor-claimant (or of a person related to the transferor-claimant) to provide property or services in the future or to make a payment described in § 1.461-4(g)(1)(ii)(A). Instead, economic performance occurs with respect to such an obligation as property or services are provided or payments are made to the other claimant. With regard to interest on a debt issued or provided to a disputed ownership fund, economic performance occurs as determined under § 1.461-4(e).
(3)
Distributions to transferor-claimants
—(i)
In general.
The gross income of a transferor-claimant does not include a distribution to the transferor-claimant (including a deemed distribution described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section) of money or property from a disputed ownership fund that the transferor-claimant previously transferred to the fund, or the net after-tax income earned on that money or property while it was held by the fund. If such property is distributed to the transferor-claimant by the disputed ownership fund, then the transferor-claimant's basis in the property is the same as the disputed ownership fund's basis in the property immediately before the distribution.
(ii)
Deemed distributions.
If a disputed ownership fund makes a distribution of money or property to a claimant or
makes a distribution of money or property on behalf of a transferor-claimant to a person that is not a claimant, the distribution is deemed made by the fund to the transferor-claimant. The transferor-claimant, in turn, is deemed to make a payment to the actual recipient.
(f)
Distributions to claimants other than transferor-claimants.
Whether a claimant other than a transferor-claimant must include in gross income a distribution of money or property from a disputed ownership fund generally is determined by reference to the claim in respect of which the distribution is made.
(g)
Statement to the disputed ownership fund and the Internal Revenue Service with respect to transfers of property other than cash
—(1)
In general.
By February 15 of the year following each calendar year in which a transferor (or other person acting on behalf of a transferor) makes a transfer of property other than cash to a disputed ownership fund, the transferor must provide a statement to the administrator of the fund setting forth the information described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. The transferor must attach a copy of this statement to its return for the taxable year of transfer.
(2)
Combined statements.
If a disputed ownership fund has more than one transferor, any two or more transferors may provide a combined statement to the administrator. If a combined statement is used, each transferor must attach a copy of the combined statement to its return and maintain with its books and records a schedule describing each asset that the transferor transferred to the disputed ownership fund.
(3)
Information required on the statement.
The statement required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section must include the following information—
(i) A legend, “§ 1.468B-9 Statement,” at the top of the first page;
(ii) The transferor's name, address, and taxpayer identification number;
(iii) The disputed ownership fund's name, address, and employer identification number;
(iv) A statement declaring whether the transferor is a transferor-claimant;
(v) The date of each transfer;
(vi) A description of the property (other than cash) transferred; and
(vii) The disputed ownership fund's basis in the property and holding period on the date of transfer as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(h)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) X Corporation petitions the United States Tax Court in 2006 for a redetermination of its tax liability for the 2003 taxable year. In 2006, the Tax Court determines that X Corporation is liable for an income tax deficiency for the 2003 taxable year. X Corporation files an appellate bond in accordance with section 7485(a) and files a notice of appeal with the appropriate United States Court of Appeals. In 2006, the Court of Appeals affirms the decision of the Tax Court and the United States Supreme Court denies X Corporation's petition for a writ of certiorari.
(ii) The appellate bond that X Corporation files with the court for the purpose of staying assessment and collection of deficiencies pending appeal is not an escrow account, trust or fund established to hold property subject to conflicting claims of ownership. Although X Corporation was found liable for an income tax deficiency, ownership of the appellate bond is not disputed. Rather, the bond serves as security for a disputed liability. Therefore, the bond is not a disputed ownership fund.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as
Example 1
, except that X Corporation deposits United States Treasury bonds with the Tax Court in accordance with section 7845(c)(2) and 31 U.S.C. 9303.
(ii) The deposit of United States Treasury bonds with the court for the purpose of staying assessment and collection of deficiencies while X Corporation prosecutes an appeal does not create a disputed ownership fund because ownership of the bonds is not disputed.

# Example 3.
(i) Prior to A's death, A was the insured under a life insurance policy issued by X, an insurance company. X uses an accrual method of accounting. Both A's current spouse and A's former spouse claim to be the beneficiary under the policy and entitled to the policy proceeds ($1 million). In 2005, X files an interpleader action and deposits $1 million into the registry of the court. On June 1, 2006, a final determination is made that A's current spouse is the beneficiary under the policy and entitled to the money held in the registry of the court. The interest earned on the registry account is $12,000. The money in the registry account is distributed to A's current spouse.
(ii) The money held in the registry of the court consisting of the policy proceeds and
the earnings thereon are a disputed ownership fund taxable as if it were a qualified settlement fund. See paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The fund's gross income does not include the $1 million transferred to the fund by X, however, the $12,000 interest is included in the fund's gross income in accordance with its method of accounting. See paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the fund is not allowed a deduction for a distribution to A's current spouse of the $1 million or the interest income earned by the fund.
(iii) X is a transferor that is not a transferor-claimant. See paragraphs (b)(7) and (b)(8) of this section.
(iv) Whether A's current spouse must include in income the $1 million insurance proceeds and the interest received from the fund is determined under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. See paragraph (f) of this section.

# Example 4.
(i) Corporation B and unrelated individual C claim ownership of certain rental property. B uses an accrual method of accounting. The rental property is property used in a trade or business. B claims to have purchased the property from C's father. However, C asserts that the purported sale to B was ineffective and that C acquired ownership of the property through intestate succession upon the death of C's father. For several years, B has maintained and received the rent from the property.
(ii) Pending the resolution of the title dispute between B and C, the title to the rental property is transferred to a court-supervised registry account on February 1, 2005. On that date the court appoints R as receiver for the property. R collects the rent earned on the property and hires employees necessary for the maintenance of the property. The rents paid to R cannot be distributed to B or C without the court's approval.
(iii) On June 1, 2006, the court makes a final determination that the rental property is owned by C. The court orders C to refund to B the purchase price paid by B to C's father plus interest on that amount from February 1, 2005. The court also orders that a distribution be made to C of all funds held in the court registry consisting of the rent collected by R and the income earned thereon. C takes title to the rental property.
(iv) The rental property and the funds held by the court registry are a disputed ownership fund under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The fund is taxable as if it were a C corporation because the rental property is not a passive investment asset within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
(v) The fund's gross income does not include the value of the rental property transferred to the fund by B. See paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section. Under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the fund's initial basis in the property is the same as B's adjusted basis immediately before the transfer to the fund and the fund's holding period is determined under section 1223(2). The fund's gross income includes the rents collected by R and any income earned thereon. For the period between February 1, 2005, and June 1, 2006, the fund may be allowed deductions for depreciation and for the costs of maintenance of the property because the fund is treated as owning the property during this period. See sections 162, 167, and 168. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the fund may not deduct the distribution to C of the property, or the rents (or any income earned thereon) collected from the property while the fund holds the property. No gain or loss is recognized by the fund from this distribution or from the fund's transfer of the rental property to C pursuant to the court's determination that C owns the property. See paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (e)(3) of this section.
(vi) B is the transferor to the fund. Under paragraphs (b)(8) and (e)(1) of this section, B is a transferor-claimant and does not recognize gain or loss under section 1001(a) on transfer of the property to the disputed ownership fund. The money and property distributed from the fund to C is deemed to be distributed first to B and then transferred from B to C. See paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. Under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, economic performance occurs when the disputed ownership fund transfers the property and any earnings thereon to C. The income tax consequences of the deemed transfer from B to C as well as the income tax consequences of C's refund to B of the purchase price paid to C's father and interest thereon are determined under other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Effective dates
—(1)
In general.
This section applies to disputed ownership funds established after February 3, 2006.
(2)
Transition rule.
With respect to a disputed ownership fund established after August 16, 1986, but on or before February 3, 2006, the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge a reasonable, consistently applied method of taxation for income earned by the fund, transfers to the fund, and distributions made by the fund.

General rules.

(c)(9)-(d)(1) [Reserved]
(d)(2)
Coordination with sections 613A (d) and 1211.
A passive activity deduction that is not disallowed for the taxable year under section 469 and the regulations thereunder may nonetheless be disallowed for the taxable year under section 613A(d) or 1211. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (d)(2):

# Example.
In 1993, an individual derives $10,000 of ordinary income from passive activity X, no gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets or assets used in a trade or
business, $12,000 of capital loss from passive activity Y, and no income, gain, deductions, or losses from any other passive activity. The capital loss from activity Y is a passive activity deduction (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(d)). Under section 469 and the regulations thereunder, the taxpayer is allowed $10,000 of the $12,000 passive activity deduction and has a $2,000 passive activity loss for the taxable year. Since the $10,000 passive activity deduction allowed under section 469 is a capital loss, such deduction is allowable for the taxable year only to the extent provided under section 1211. Therefore, the taxpayer is allowed $3,000 of the $10,000 capital loss under section 1211 and has a $7,000 capital loss carryover (within the meaning of section 1212(b)) to the succeeding taxable year.
(d)(3)-(e)(1) [Reserved]
(e)(2)
Trade or business activities. Trade or business activities
are activities that constitute trade or business activities within the meaning of § 1.469-4(b)(1).
(e)(3)(i)-(e)(3)(ii) [Reserved]
(e)(3)(iii)
Average period of customer use
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), the average period of customer use for property held in connection with an activity (the
activity's average period of customer use
) is the sum of the average use factors for each class of property held in connection with the activity.
(B)
Average use factor.
The average use factor for a class of property held in connection with an activity is the average period of customer use for that class of property multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—
(
1
) The activity's gross rental income attributable to that class of property; by
(
2
) The activity's gross rental income.
(C)
Average period of customer use for class of property.
In determining an activity's average period of customer use for a taxable year, the average period of customer use for a class of property held in connection with an activity is determined by dividing—
(
1
) The aggregate number of days in all periods of customer use for property in the class (taking into account only periods that end during the taxable year or that include the last day of the taxable year); by
(
2
) The number of those periods of customer use.
(D)
Period of customer use.
Each period during which a customer has a continuous or recurring right to use an item of property held in connection with the activity (without regard to whether the customer uses the property for the entire period or whether the right to use the property is pursuant to a single agreement or to renewals thereof) is treated for purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) as a separate period of customer use. The duration of a period of customer use that includes the last day of a taxable year may be determined on the basis of reasonable estimates.
(E)
Class of property.
Taxpayers may organize property into classes for purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii) using any method under which items of property for which the amount of the daily rent differs significantly are not included in the same class.
(F)
Gross rental income and daily rent.
In determining an activity's average period of customer use for a taxable year—
(
1
) The activity's gross rental income is the gross income from the activity for the taxable year taking into account only income that is attributable to amounts paid for the use of property;
(
2
) The activity's gross rental income attributable to a class of property is the gross income from the activity for the taxable year taking into account only income that is attributable to amounts paid for the use of property in that class; and
(
3
) The daily rent for items of property may be determined on any basis that reasonably reflects differences during the taxable year in the amounts ordinarily paid for one day's use of those items of property.
(e)(3)(iv)-(e)(3)(vi)(C) [Reserved]
(e)(3)(vi)(D)
Lodging rented for convenience of employer.
The provision of lodging to an employee or to an employee's spouse or dependents is treated as incidental to the activity (or activities) of the taxpayer in which the employee performs services if the lodging is furnished for the taxpayer's convenience (within the meaning of section 119).
(E)
Unadjusted basis.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(vi), the term
unadjusted basis
means adjusted basis determined without regard to any adjustment described in section 1016 that decreases basis.
(e)(3)(vii)-(e)(4)(iii) [Reserved]
(e)(4)(iv)
Definition of “working interest.”
For purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder, the term
working interest
means a working or operating mineral interest in any tract or parcel of land (within the meaning of § 1.612-4(a)).
(e)(4)(v)-(f)(3) [Reserved]
(f)(4)
Carryover of disallowed deductions and credits
—(i)
In general.
In the case of an activity of a taxpayer with respect to which any deductions or credits are disallowed for a taxable year under § 1.469-1T (f)(2) or (f)(3) (the loss activity)—
(A) The disallowed deductions or credits is allocated among the taxpayer's activities for the succeeding taxable year in a manner that reasonably reflects the extent to which each activity continues the loss activity; and
(B) The disallowed deductions or credits allocated to an activity under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section shall be treated as deductions or credits from the activity for the succeeding taxable year.
(ii)
Business continued through C corporations or similar entities.
If a taxpayer continues part or all of a loss activity through a C corporation or similar entity (C corporation entity), the taxpayer's interest in the C corporation entity shall be treated for purposes of this paragraph (f)(4) as an interest in a passive activity that continues that loss activity in whole or part. An entity is similar to a C corporation for this purpose if the owners of interests in the entity derive only portfolio income (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)) from the interests.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f)(4). In each example, the taxpayer is an individual whose taxable year is the calendar year.

# Example 1.
(i) The taxpayer owns interests in a convenience store and an apartment building. In each taxable year, the taxpayer's interests in the convenience store and the apartment building are treated under § 1.469-4 as interests in two separate passive activities of the taxpayer. A $5,000 loss from the convenience-store activity and a $3,000 loss from the apartment-building activity are disallowed under § 1.469-1T(f)(2) for 1993. Under § 1.469-1T(f)(2), the $5,000 loss from the convenience-store activity is allocated among the passive activity deductions from that activity for 1993, and the $3,000 loss from the apartment-building activity is treated similarly.
(ii) In 1994, the convenience store is continued in a single activity, and the section 469 activities that constituted the apartment building is similarly continued in a separate activity. Thus, the disallowed deductions from the convenience-store activity for 1993 must be allocated under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section to the taxpayer's convenience-store activity in 1994. Similarly, the disallowed deductions from the apartment-building activity for 1993 must be allocated to the taxpayer's apartment-building activity in 1994. Under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the disallowed deductions allocated to the convenience-store activity in 1994 are treated as deductions from that activity for 1994, and the disallowed deductions allocated to the apartment-building activity for 1994 are treated as deductions from the apartment-building activity for 1994.

# Example 2.
(i) In 1993, the taxpayer acquires a restaurant and a catering business. Assume that in 1993 and 1994 the restaurant and the catering business are treated under § 1.469-4 as an interest in a single passive activity of the taxpayer (the restaurant and catering activity). A $10,000 loss from the activity is disallowed under § 1.469-1T(f)(2) for 1994. Assume that in 1995, the taxpayer's interests in the restaurant and the catering business are treated under § 1.469-4 as interests in two separate passive activities of the taxpayer.
(ii) Under § 1.469-1T(f)(2), the $10,000 loss from the restaurant and catering activity is allocated among the passive activity deductions from that activity for 1994. In 1995, the businesses that constituted the restaurant and catering activity are continued, but are treated as two separate activities under § 1.469-4. Thus, the disallowed deductions from the restaurant and catering activity for 1994 must be allocated under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section between the restaurant activity and the catering activity in 1995 in a manner that reasonably reflects the extent to which each of the activities continues the single restaurant and catering activity. Under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the disallowed deductions allocated to the restaurant activity in 1995 are treated as deductions from the restaurant activity for 1995, and the disallowed deductions allocated to the catering activity in 1995 are treated as deductions from the catering activity for 1995.

# Example 3.
(i) In 1993, the taxpayer acquires a restaurant and a catering business. Assume that in 1993 and 1994 the restaurant and the catering business are treated under§ 1.469-4 as an interest in a single passive activity of the taxpayer (the restaurant and catering activity). A $10,000 loss from the activity is
disallowed under § 1.469-1T(f)(2) for 1994. Assume that in 1995, the taxpayer's interests in the restaurant and the catering business are treated under § 1.469-4 as interestes in two separate passive activities of the taxpayer. In addition, a $20,000 loss from the activity was disallowed under § 1.469-1T(f)(2) for 1993, and the gross income and deductions (including deductions that were disallowed for 1993 under § 1.469-1T(f)(2)) from the restaurant and catering business for 1993 and 1994 are as follows:
Restaurant
Catering business
1993:
Gross income
$20,000
$60,000
Deductions
40,000
60,000
Net income (loss)
(20,000)
1994:
Gross income
40,000
50,000
Deductions
1
30,000
2
70,000
Net income (loss)
10,000
(20,000)
1
Includes $8,000 of deductions that were disallowed for 1993 ($20,000 × $40,000/$100,000).
2
Includes $12,000 of deductions that were disallowed for 1993 ($20,000 × $60,000/$100,000).
(ii) Under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section, the disallowed deductions from the restaurant and catering activity must be allocated among the taxpayer's activities for the succeeding year in a manner that reasonably reflects the extent to which those activities continue the restaurant and catering activity. The remainder of this example describes a number of allocation methods that will ordinarily satisfy the requirement of paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section. The description of specific allocation methods in this example does not preclude the use of other reasonable allocation methods for purposes of paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section.
(iii) Ordinarily, an allocation of disallowed deductions from the restaurant to the restaurant activity and disallowed deductions from the catering business to the catering activity would satisfy the requirement of paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Under § 1.469-1T (f)(2)(ii), a ratable portion of each deduction from the restaurant and catering activity is disallowed for 1994. Thus, $3,000 of the 1994 deductions from the restaurant are disallowed ($10,000 × $30,000/$100,000), and $7,000 of the 1994 deductions from the catering business are disallowed ($10,000 × $70,000/$100,000). Thus, the taxpayer can ordinarily treat $3,000 of the disallowed deductions as deductions from the restaurant activity for 1995, and $7,000 of the disallowed deductions as deductions from the catering activity for 1995.
(iv) Ordinarily, an allocation of disallowed deductions between the restaurant activity and catering activity in proportion to the losses from the restaurant and from the catering business for 1994 would also satisfy the requirement of paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section. If the restaurant and the catering business had been treated as separate activities in 1994, the restaurant activity would have had net income of $10,000 and the catering activity would have had a $20,000 loss. Thus, the taxpayer can ordinarily treat all $10,000 of disallowed deductions as deductions from the catering activity for 1995.
(v) Ordinarily, an allocation of disallowed deductions between the restaurant activity and catering activity in proportion to the losses from the restaurant and from the catering business for 1994 (determined as if the restaurant and the catering business had been separate activities for all taxable years) would also satisfy the requirement of paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section. If the restaurant and the catering business had been treated as separate activities for all taxable years, the entire $20,000 loss from the restaurant in 1993 would have been allocated to the restaurant activity in 1994, and the gross income and deductions from the separate activities for 1994 would be as follows:
Restaurant
Catering business
Gross income
$40,000
$50,000
Deductions
42,000
58,000
Net income (loss)
(2,000)
(8,000)
Thus, the taxpayer can ordinarily treat $2,000 of the disallowed deductions as deductions from the restaurant activity for 1995, and $8,000 of the disallowed deductions as deductions from the catering activity for 1995.

# Example 4.
(i) The taxpayer is a partner in a law partnership that acquires a building in December 1993 for use in the partnership's law practice. In taxable year 1993, four floors that are not needed in the law practice are leased to tenants; in taxable year 1994, two floors are leased to tenants; in taxable years after 1994, only one floor is leased to tenants and the rental operations are insubstantial. Assume that under § 1.469-4, the law practice and the rental property are treated as a trade or business activity and a separate rental activity for taxable years 1993 and 1994. Assume further that the law practice and the rental operations are a single trade or business activity for taxable years after 1994 under § 1.469-4. The trade or business activity is not a passive activity of the taxpayer. The rental activity, however, is a passive activity. Under § 1.469-T(f)(2), a $12,000 loss from the rental activity is disallowed for 1993 and a $9,000 loss from the rental activity is disallowed for 1994.
(ii) Under § 1.469-1T(f)(2), the $12,000 loss from the rental activity for 1993 is allocated among the passive activity deductions from that activity for 1993. In 1994, the business of
the rental activity is continued in two separate activities. Only two floors of the building remain in the rental activity, and the other two floors (
i.e.,
the floors that were leased to tenants in 1993, but not in 1994) are used in the taxpayer's law-practice activity. Thus, the disallowed deductions from the rental activity for 1993 must be allocated under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section between the rental activity and the law-practice activity in a manner that reasonably reflects the extent to which each of the activities continues business on the four floors that were leased to tenants in 1993. In these circumstances, the requirement of paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section would ordinarily be satisfied by any of the allocation methods illustrated in Example 3 or by an allocation of 50 percent of the disallowed deductions to each activity. Under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the disallowed deductions allocated to the rental activity in 1994 are treated as deductions from the rental activity for 1994, and the disallowed deductions ($6,000) allocated to the law-practice activity in 1994 are treated as deductions from the law-practice activity for 1994.
(iii) Under § 1.469-1T(f)(2), the $9,000 loss from the rental activity for 1994 is allocated among the passive activity deductions from that activity for 1994. In 1995, the rental activity is continued in the taxpayer's law-practice activity. Thus, the disallowed deductions from the rental activity for 1994 must be allocated under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section to the taxpayer's law-practice activity in 1995. Under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the disallowed deductions allocated to the law-practice activity are treated as deductions from the law-practice activity for 1995.
(iv) Rules relating to former passive activities will be contained in paragraph (k) of this section. Under those rules, any disallowed deductions from the rental activity that are treated as deductions from the law-practice activity will be treated as unused deductions that are allocable to a former passive activity.

# Example 5.
(i) The taxpayer owns stock in a corporation that is an S corporation for the taxpayer's 1993 taxable year and a C coporation thereafter. The only activity of the corporation is a rental activity. For 1993, the taxpayer's pro rata share of the corporation's loss from the rental activity is $5,000, and the entire loss is disallowed under § 1.469-1T(f)(2) of this section.
(ii) Under § 1.469-1T(f)(2), the taxpayer's $5,000 loss from the rental activity is allocated among the taxpayer's deductions from that activity for 1993. In 1994, the rental activity is continued through a C corporation, and the taxpayer's interest in the C corporation is treated under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section as a passive activity that continues the rental activity (the C corporation activity) for purposes of allocating the previously disallowed loss. Thus, the disallowed deductions from the rental activity for 1993 must be allocated under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section to the taxpayer's C corporation activity in 1994, and are treated under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section as deductions from the C corporation activity for 1994.
(iii) Treating the taxpayer's interest in the C corporation as an interest in a passive activity that continues the business of the rental activity does not change the character of the taxpayer's dividend income from the C corporation. Thus, the taxpayer's dividend income is portfolio income (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)) and is not included in passive activity gross income. Accordingly, the taxpayer's loss from the C corporation activity for 1994 is $5,000.

# Example 6.
(i) The taxpayer owns stock in a corporation that is an S corporation for the taxpayer's 1993 taxable year and a C corporation thereafter. The only activity of the corporation is a rental activity. For 1993, the taxpayer's pro rata share of the corporation's loss from the rental activity is $5,000, and the entire loss is disallowed under § 1.469-1T(f)(2). The taxpayer has $2,000 in income from other passive activities for 1994, and as a result, only 60% of the taxpayer's loss from the C corporation activity ($3,000) is disallowed for 1994 under § 1.469-1T(f)(2).
(ii) Under § 1.469-1T(f)(2), the $3,000 disallowed loss from the C corporation activity is allocated among the passive activity deductions from that activity for 1994. In effect, therefore, 60 percent of each disallowed deduction from the rental activity for 1993 is again disallowed for 1994.
(iii) Under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the taxpayer's interest in the C corporation is treated as a loss activity and as an interest in a passive activity that continues the business of that loss activity for 1995. Thus, the disallowed deductions from the C corporation activity for 1994 must be allocated under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section to the taxpayer's C corporation activity in 1995, and are treated under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section as deductions from that activity for 1995.
(g)(1)-(g)(4)(ii)(B) [Reserved]
(g)(4)(ii)(C) Portfolio income (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)), including any gross income that is treated as portfolio income under any other provision of the regulations (See, e.g., § 1.469-2(c)(2)(iii)(F) (relating to gain from the disposition of substantially appreciated property formerly held for investment) and § 1.469-2(f)(10) (relating to certain recharacterized passive activity gross income))

(2)
Definitions.
The definitions and nomenclature in the regulations under section 1502 apply for purposes of this paragraph (h). See, e.g., §§ 1.1502-1 (definitions of group, consolidated group, member, subsidiary, and consolidated return year), 1.1502-2 (consolidated tax liability), 1.1502-11 (consolidated taxable income), 1.1502-12 (separate taxable income), 1.1502-13 (intercompany transactions), 1.1502-21 (net operating losses, and 1.1502-22 (consolidated net capital gain and loss).

(4)
Status and participation of members
—(i)
Determination by reference to status and participation of group.
For purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder—
(A) Each member of a consolidated group shall be treated as a closely held corporation or personal service corporation, respectively, for the taxable year, if and only if the consolidated group is treated (under the rules of paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section) as a closely held corporation or personal service corporation for that year; and
(B) The determination of whether a trade or business activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section) conducted by one or more members of a consolidated group is a passive activity of the members is made by reference to the consolidated group's participation in the activity.
(ii)
Determination of status and participation of consolidated group.
For purposes of determining under § 1.469-1T(g)(2) whether a consolidated group is treated as a closely held corporation or a personal service corporation, and determining under § 1.469-1T(g)(3) whether the consolidated group materially or significantly participates in any activity conducted by one or more members of the group—
(A) The members of the consolidated group shall be treated as one corporation;
(B) Only the outstanding stock of the common parent shall be treated as outstanding stock of the corporation;
(C) An employee of any member of the group shall be treated as an employee of the corporation; and
(D) An activity is treated as the principal activity of the corporation if and only if it is the principal activity (within the meaning of § 1.441-3(e)) of the consolidated group.
(5) [Reserved]
(6)
Intercompany transactions
—(i)
In general.
Section 1.1502-13 applies to determine the treatment under section 469 of intercompany items and corresponding items from intercompany transactions between members of a consolidated group. For example, the matching rule of § 1.1502-13(c) treats the selling member (S) and the buying member (B) as divisions of a single corporation for purposes of determining whether S's intercompany items and B's corresponding items are from a passive activity. Thus, for purposes of applying § 1.469-2(c)(2)(iii) and § 1.469-2T(d)(5)(ii) to property sold by S to B in an intercompany transaction—
(A) S and B are treated as divisions of a single corporation for determining the uses of the property during the 12-month period preceding its disposition to a nonmember, and generally have an aggregate holding period for the property; and
(B) § 1.469-2(c)(2)(iv) does not apply.
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (h)(6).

# Example.
(i) P, a closely held corporation, is the common parent of the P consolidated group. P owns all of the stock of S and B. X is a person unrelated to any member of the P group. S owns and operates equipment that is not used in a passive activity. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the equipment to B at a gain. B uses the equipment in a passive activity and does not dispose of the equipment before it has been fully depreciated.
(ii) Under the matching rule of § 1.1502-13(c), S's gain taken into account as a result of B's depreciation is treated as gain from a passive activity even though S used the equipment in a nonpassive activity.
(iii) The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example, except that B sells the equipment to X on December 1 of Year 3 at a further gain. Assume that if S and B were divisions of a single corporation, gain from
the sale to X would be passive income attributable to a passive activity. To the extent of B's depreciation before the sale, the results are the same as in paragraph (ii) of this Example. B's gain and S's remaining gain taken into account as a result of B's sale are treated as attributable to a passive activity.
(iv) The facts are the same as in paragraph (iii) of this Example, except that B recognizes a loss on the sale to X. B's loss and S's gain taken into account as a result of B's sale are treated as attributable to a passive activity.
(iii)
Effective dates.
This paragraph (h)(6) applies with respect to transactions occurring in years beginning on or after July 12, 1995. For transactions occurring in years beginning before July 12, 1995, see § 1.469-1T(h)(6) (as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of April 1, 1995).

Effect of section 469 and the regulations thereunder for other purposes
—(1)
Treatment of items of passive activity income and gain.
Neither the provisions of section 469 (a)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section nor the characterization of items of income or deduction as passive activity gross income (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T (c)) or passive activity deductions (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T (d)) affects the treatment of any item of income or gain under any provision of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 469. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (d)(1):

# Example.
(i) In 1991, an individual's only income and loss from passive activities are a $10,000 capital gain from passive activity X and a $12,000 ordinary loss from passive activity Y. The taxpayer also has a $10,000 capital loss that is not derived from a passive activity.
(ii) Under § 1.469-2T (b), the taxpayer has a $2,000 passive activity loss for the taxable year. The only effect of section 469 and the regulations thereunder is to disallow a deduction for the taxpayer's $2,000 passive activity loss for the taxable year. Thus, the taxpayer's capital loss for the taxable year is allowed because the $10,000 capital gain from passive activity X is taken into account under section 1211 (b) in computing the taxpayer's allowable capital loss for the year.
(2)
Coordination with sections 613A(d) and 1211.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(d)(2) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(3)
Treatment of passive activity losses.
Except as otherwise provided by regulations, a deduction that is disallowed for a taxable year under section 469 and the regulations thereunder is not taken into account as a deduction that is allowed for the taxable year in computing the amount subject to any tax imposed by subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (d)(3):

# Example.
An individual has a $5,000 passive activity loss for a taxable year, all of which is disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. All of the disallowed loss is allocated under paragraph (f) of this section to activities that are trades or businesses (within the meaning of section 1402(c)). Such loss is not taken into account for the taxable year in computing the taxpayer's taxable income subject to tax under section 1. In addition, under this paragraph (d)(3), such loss is not taken into account for the taxable year in computing the taxpayer's net earnings from self-employment subject to tax under section 1401.
(e)
Definition of “passive activity”
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e), an activity is a passive activity of the taxpayer for a taxable year if and only if the activity—
(i) Is a trade or business activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section) in which the taxpayer does not materially participate for such taxable year; or
(ii) Is a rental activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3) of this section), without regard to whether or to what extent the taxpayer participates in such activity.
(2)
Trade or business activity.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(e)(2) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(3)
Rental activity
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(3), an activity is a rental activity for a taxable year if—
(A) During such taxable year, tangible property held in connection with the activity is used by customers or held for use by customers; and
(B) The gross income attributable to the conduct of the activity during such taxable year represents (or, in the case of an activity in which property is held for use by customers, the expected gross income from the conduct of the activity will represent) amounts paid or to be paid principally for the use of such tangible property (without regard to whether the use of the property by customers is pursuant to a lease or pursuant to a service contract or other arrangement that is not denominated a lease).
(ii)
Exceptions.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), an activity involving the use of tangible property is not a rental activity for a taxable year if for such taxable year—
(A) The average period of customer use for such property is seven days or less;
(B) The average period of customer use for such property is 30 days or less, and significant personal services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section) are provided by or on behalf of the owner of the property in connection with making the property available for use by customers;
(C) Extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section) are provided by or on behalf of the owner of the property in connection with making such property available for use by customers (without regard to the average period of customer use);
(D) The rental of such property is treated as incidental to a nonrental activity of the taxpayer under paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this section;
(E) The taxpayer customarily makes the property available during defined business hours for nonexclusive use by various customers; or
(F) The provision of the property for use in an activity conducted by a partnership, S corporation, or joint venture in which the taxpayer owns an interest is not a rental activity under paragraph (e)(3)(vii) of this section.
(iii)
Average period of customer use.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(e)(3)(iii) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(iv)
Significant personal services
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, personal services include only services performed by individuals, and do not include excluded services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) of this section). In determining whether personal services provided in connection with making property available for use by customers are significant, all of the relevant facts and circumstances shall be taken into account. Relevant facts and circumstances include the frequency with which such services are provided, the type and amount of labor required to perform such services, and the value of such services relative to the amount charged for the use of the property.
(B)
Excluded services.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, the term “excluded services” means, with respect to any property made available for use by customers—
(
1
) Services necessary to permit the lawful use of the property;
(
2
) Services performed in connection with the construction of improvements to the property, or in connection with the performance of repairs that extend the property's useful life for a period substantially longer than the average period for which such property is used by customers; and
(
3
) Services, provided in connection with the use of any improved real property, that are similar to those commonly provided in connection with long-term rentals of high-grade commercial or residential real property (e.g., cleaning and maintenance of common areas, routine repairs, trash collection, elevator service, and security at entrances or perimeters).
(v)
Extraordinary personal services.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, extraordinary personal services are provided in connection with making property available for use by customers only if the services provided in connection with the use of the property are performed by individuals,
and the use by customers of the property is incidental to their receipt of such services. For example, the use by patients of a hospital's boarding facilities generally is incidental to their receipt of the personal services provided by the hospital's medical and nursing staff. Similarly, the use by students of a boarding school's dormitories generally is incidental to their receipt of the personal services provided by the school's teaching staff.
(vi)
Rental of property incidental to a nonrental activity of the taxpayer
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(D) of this section, the rental of property shall be treated as incidental to a nonrental activity of the taxpayer only to the extent provided in this paragraph (e)(3)(vi).
(B)
Property held for investment.
The rental of property during a taxable year shall be treated as incidental to an activity of holding such property for investment if and only if—
(
1
) The principal purpose for holding the property during such taxable year is to realize gain from the appreciation of the property (without regard to whether it is expected that such gain will be realized from the sale or exchange of the property in its current state of development); and
(
2
) The gross rental income from the property for such taxable year is less than two percent of the lesser of—
(
i
) The unadjusted basis of such property; and
(
ii
) The fair market value of such property.
(C)
Property used in a trade or business.
The rental of property during a taxable year shall be treated as incidental to a trade or business activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section) if and only if—
(
1
) The taxpayer owns an interest in such trade or business activity during the taxable year;
(
2
) The property was predominantly used in such trade or business activity during the taxable year or during at least two of the five taxable years that immediately precede the taxable year; and
(
3
) The gross rental income from such property for the taxable year is less than two percent of the lesser of—
(
i
) The unadjusted basis of such property; and
(
ii
) The fair market value of such property.
(D)
Lodging for convenience of employer.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(e)(3)(vi)(D) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(E)
Unadjusted basis.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(e)(3)(vi)(E) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(vii)
Property made available for use in a nonrental activity conducted by a partnership, S corporation, or joint venture in which the taxpayer owns an interest.
If the taxpayer owns an interest in a partnership, S corporation, or joint venture conducting an activity other than a rental activity, and the taxpayer provides property for use in the activity in the taxpayer's capacity as an owner of an interest in such partnership, S corporation, or joint venture, the provision of such property is not a rental activity. Thus, if a partner contributes the use of property to a partnership, none of the partner's distributive share of partnership income is income from a rental activity unless the partnership is engaged in a rental activity. In addition, a partner's gross income attributable to a payment described in section 707(c) is not income from a rental activity under any circumstances (see § 1.469-2T (e)(2)). The determination of whether property used in an activity is provided by the taxpayer in the taxpayer's capacity as an owner of an interest in a partnership, S corporation, or joint venture shall be made on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances.
(viii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(3):

# Example 1.
The taxpayer is engaged in an activity of leasing photocopying equipment. The average period of customer use for the equipment exceeds 30 days. Pursuant to the lease agreements, skilled technicians employed by the taxpayer maintain the equipment and service malfunctioning equipment for no additional charge. Service calls occur frequently (three times per week on average) and require substantial labor. The value of the maintenance and repair services (measured by the cost to the taxpayer of employees performing these services) exceeds 50 percent of the amount charged for the use of the
equipment. Under these facts, services performed by individuals are provided in connection with the use of the photocopying equipment, but the customers' use of the photocopying equipment is not incidental to their receipt of the services. Therefore, extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section) are not provided in connection with making the photocopying equipment available for use by customers, and the activity is a rental activity.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the average period of customer use for the photocopying equipment exceeds seven days but does not exceed 30 days. Under these facts, significant personal services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section) are provided in connection with making the photocopying equipment available for use by customers and, under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, the activity is not a rental activity.

# Example 3.
The taxpayer is engaged in an activity of transporting goods for customers. In conducting the activity, the taxpayer provides tractor-trailers to transport goods for customers pursuant to arrangements under which the tractor-trailers are selected by the taxpayer, may be replaced at the sole option of the taxpayer, and are operated and maintained by drivers and mechanics employed by the taxpayer. The average period of customer use for the tractor-trailers exceeds 30 days. Under these facts, the use of tractor-trailers by the taxpayer's customers is incidental to their receipt of personal services provided by the taxpayer. Accordingly, the services performed in the activity are extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section) and, under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, the activity is not a rental activity.

# Example 4.
The taxpayer is engaged in an activity of owning and operating a residential apartment hotel. For the taxable year, the average period of customer use for apartments exceeds seven days but does not exceed 30 days. In addition to cleaning public entrances, exists, stairways, and lobbies, and collecting and removing trash, the taxpayer provides a daily maid and linen service at no additional charge. All of the services other than maid and linen service are excluded services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) of this section), because such services are similar to those commonly provided in connection with long-term rentals of high-grade residential real property. The value of the maid and linen services (measured by the cost to the taxpayer of employees performing such services) is less than 10 percent of the amount charged to tenants for occupancy of apartments. Under these facts, neither significant personal services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section) nor extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(3)(v) of this section) are provided in connection with making apartments available for use by customers. Accordingly, the activity is a rental activity.

# Example 5.
The taxpayer owns 1,000 acres of unimproved land with a fair market value of $350,000 and an unadjusted basis of $210,000. The taxpayer holds the land for the principal purpose of realizing gain from appreciation. In order to defray the cost of carrying the land, the taxpayer leases the land to a rancher, who uses the land to graze cattle and pays rent of $4,000 per year. Thus, the gross rental income from the land is less than two percent of the lesser of the fair market value and the unadjusted basis of the land (.02 × $210,000 = $4,200). Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(D) of this section, the rental of the land is not a rental activity because the rental is treated under paragraph (e)(3)(vi)(B) of this section as incidental to an activity of holding the property for investment.

# Example 6.
(i) A calendar year taxpayer owns an interest in a farming activity which is a trade or business activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section) and owns farmland which was used in the farming activity in 1985 and 1986. The fair market value of the farmland is $350,000 and its unadjusted basis is $210,000. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, the taxpayer continues to own an interest in the farming activity but does not use the land in the activity. In 1987, the taxpayer leases the land for $4,000 to a rancher, who uses the land to graze cattle. In 1988, the taxpayer leases the land for $10,000 to a film production company, which uses the land to film scenes for a movie. In 1989, the taxpayer again leases the land for $4,000 to the rancher.
(ii) For 1987 and 1989, the taxpayer owns an interest in a trade or business activity, and the farmland which the taxpayer leases to the rancher was used in such activity for two out of the five immediately preceding taxable years. In addition, the gross rental income from the land ($4,000) is less than two percent of the lesser of the fair market value and the unadjusted basis of the land (.02 × $210,000 = $4,200). Accordingly, the taxpayer's rental of the land is treated under paragraph (e)(3)(vi)(C) of this section as incidental to the taxpayer's farming activity, and is not a rental activity.
(iii) Because the taxpayer's gross rental income from the land for 1988 ($10,000) is not less than two percent of the lesser of the fair market value and the unadjusted basis of the land, the requirement of paragraph (e)(3)(vi)(C)(
3
) of this section is not met. Therefore, the taxpayer's rental of the land in 1988 is not treated as incidental to the taxpayer's farming activity and is a rental activity.

# Example 7.
(i) In 1988, the taxpayer acquires vacant land for the purpose of constructing a shopping mall. Before commencing construction, the taxpayer leases the land under a one-year lease to an automobile dealer, who uses the land to park cars held in its inventory. The taxpayer commences construction of the shopping mall in 1989.
(ii) The taxpayer acquired the land for the principal purpose of constructing the shopping mall, not for the principal purpose of realizing gain from the appreciation of the property. Therefore, the rental of the property in 1988 is not treated under paragraph (e)(3)(vi)(B) of this section as incidental to an activity of holding the property for investment.
(iii) The land has not been used in any taxable year in any trade or business of the taxpayer. Therefore, the rental of the property in 1988 is not treated under paragraph (e)(3)(vi)(C) of this section as incidental to a trade or business activity.
(iv) Since the rental of the land in 1988 is not treated under paragraph (e)(3)(vi) of this section as incidental to a nonrental activity of the taxpayer, the rental of the land in 1988 is a rental activity. See § 1.469-2T(f)(3) for a special rule relating to the treatment of gross income from the rental of nondepreciable property.

# Example 8.
The taxpayer makes farmland available to a tenant farmer pursuant to an arrangement designated a “crop-share lease.” Under the arrangement, the tenant is required to use the tenant's best efforts to farm the land and produce marketable crops. The taxpayer is obligated to pay 50 percent of the costs incurred in the activity (without regard to whether any crops are successfully produced or marketed), and is entitled to 50 percent of the crops produced (or 50 percent of the proceeds from marketing the crops). For purposes of paragraph (e)(3)(vii) of this section, the taxpayer is treated as providing the farmland for use in a farming activity conducted by a joint venture in the taxpayer's capacity as an owner of an interest in the joint venture. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(F) of this section, the taxpayer is not engaged in a rental activity, without regard to whether the taxpayer performs any services in the farming activity.

# Example 9.
The taxpayer owns a taxicab which the taxpayer operates during the day and leases to another driver for use at night under a one-year lease. Under the terms of the lease, the other driver is charged a fixed rental for use of the taxicab. Assume that, under the rules to be contained in § 1.469-4T, the taxpayer is engaged in two separate activities, an activity of operating the taxicab and an activity of making the taxicab available for use by the other driver. Under these facts, the period for which the other driver uses the taxicab exceeds 30 days, and the taxpayer does not provide extraordinary personal services in connection with making the taxicab available to the other driver. Accordingly, the lease of the taxicab is a rental activity.

# Example 10.
The taxpayer operates a golf course. Some customers of the golf course pay green fees upon each use of the golf course, while other customers purchase weekly, monthly, or annual passes. The golf course is open to all customers from sunrise to sunset every day of the year except certain holidays and days on which the taxpayer determines that the course is too wet for play. The taxpayer thus makes the golf course available during prescribed hours for nonexclusive use by various customers. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(E) of this section, the taxpayer is not engaged in a rental activity, without regard to the average period of customer use for the golf course.
(4)
Special rule for oil and gas working interests
—(i)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, an interest in an oil or gas well drilled or operated pursuant to a working interest (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(iv) of this section) of a taxpayer is not an interest in a passive activity for the taxpayer's taxable year (without regard to whether the taxpayer materially participates in such activity) if at any time during such taxable year the taxpayer holds such working interest either—
(A) Directly; or
(B) Through an entity that does not limit the liability of the taxpayer with respect to the drilling or operation of such well pursuant to such working interest.
(ii)
Exception for deductions attributable to a period during which liability is limited
—(A)
In general.
If paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section applies for a taxable year to the taxpayer's interest in an oil or gas well that would, but for the application of paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, by an interest in a passive activity for the taxable year, and the taxpayer has a net loss (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(C)(
3
) of this section) from the well for the taxable year—
(
1
) The taxpayer's disqualified deductions (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(C)(
2
) of this section) from such oil or gas well for such year shall be treated as passive activity deductions for such year (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(d)); and
(
2
) A ratable portion (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(C)(
4
) of this section) of the taxpayer's gross income from such oil or gas well for such year shall be treated as passive activity gross income for such year (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)).
(B)
Coordination with rules governing the identification of disallowed passive activity deductions.
If gross income and deductions from an activity for a taxable year are treated as passive activity gross income and passive activity deductions under paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, such activity shall be treated as a passive activity for such year for purposes of applying paragraph (f) (2) and (4) of this section.
(C)
Meaning of certain terms.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4)(ii), the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:
(
1
)
Allocable deductions.
The deductions allocable to a taxable year are any deductions that arise in such year (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T (d)(8)) and any deductions that are treated as deductions for such year under paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
(
2
)
Disqualified deductions.
The taxpayer's “disqualified deductions” from an oil or gas well for a taxable year are the taxpayer's deductions—
(
i
) That are attributable to such well and allocable to the taxable year; and
(
ii
) With respect to which economic performance (within the meaning of section 461(h), without regard to section 461 (h)(3) or (i)(2)) occurs at a time during which the taxpayer's only interest in the working interest is held through an entity that limits the taxpayer's liability with respect to the drilling or operation of such well.
(
3
)
Net loss.
The “net loss” of a taxpayer from an oil or gas well for a taxable year equals the amount by which the taxpayer's deductions that are attributable to such oil or gas well and allocable to such year exceeds the gross income of the taxpayer from such well for such year.
(
4
)
Ratable portion.
The “ratable portion” of the taxpayer's gross income from an oil or gas well for a taxable year equals the total amount of such gross income multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—
(
i
) The disqualified deductions from such oil or gas well for the taxable year; by
(
ii
) The total amount of the deductions that are attributable to such oil or gas well and allocable to the taxable year.
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (e)(4) (i) and (ii) of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) A, a calendar year individual, acquires on January 1, 1987, a general partnership interest in P, a calendar year partnership that holds a working interest in an oil or gas property. Pursuant to the partnership agreement, A is entitled to convert the general partnership interest into a limited partnership interest at any time. On December 1, 1987, pursuant to a contract with D, an independent drilling contractor, P commences drilling a single well pursuant to the working interest. Under the drilling contract, P pays D for the drilling only as the work is performed. All drilling costs are deducted by P in the year in which they are paid. At the end of 1987, A converts the general partnership interest into a limited partnership interest, effective immediately. The drilling of the well is completed on February 28, 1988. A's interest in the well would but for this paragraph (e)(4) be an interest in a passive activity.
(ii) Throughout 1987, A holds the working interest through an entity that does not limit A's liability with respect to the drilling of the well pursuant to the working interest. In 1988, however, A holds the working interest through an entity that limits A's liability with respect to the drilling and operation of the well throughout such year. Accordingly, under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section, A's interest in P's well is not an interest in a passive activity for 1987 but is an interest in a passive activity for 1988. Moreover, since economic performance occurs in 1987 with respect to all items of deduction for drilling costs that are allocable to 1987, A has no disqualified deductions for 1987.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that all costs of drilling under the contract with D (including costs of drilling performed after 1987) are paid before the end of 1987 and A has a net loss for 1987. In addition, A has $15,000 of total deductions that are attributable to the well and allocable to 1987, but economic performance (as that term is used in paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(C)(
2
)(
ii
) of this section) does not occur with respect to $5,000 of those deductions until 1988. Under paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, the $5,000 of deductions with respect to which economic performance occurs in 1988 are disqualified deductions and are treated as passive activity deductions for 1987. In addition, one-third ($5,000/$15,000) of
A's gross income from the well for 1987 is treated as passive activity gross income.
(iv)
Definition of “working interest.”
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(e)(4)(iv) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(v)
Entities that limit liability
—(A)
General rule.
For purposes of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section, an entity limits the liability of the taxpayer with respect to the drilling or operation of a well pursuant to a working interest held through such entity if the taxpayer's interest in the entity is in the form of—
(
1
) A limited partnership interest in a partnership in which the taxpayer is not a general partner;
(
2
) Stock in a corporation; or
(
3
) An interest in any entity (other than a limited partnership or corporation) that, under applicable State law, limits the potential liability of a holder of such an interest for all obligations of the entity to a determinable fixed amount (for example, the sum of the taxpayer's capital contributions).
(B)
Other limitations disregarded.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), protection against loss through any of the following is not taken into account in determining whether a taxpayer holds a working interest through an entity that limits the taxpayer's liability:
(
1
) An indemnification agreement;
(
2
) A stop loss arrangement;
(
3
) Insurance;
(
4
) Any similar arrangement; or
(
5
) Any combination of the foregoing.
(C)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e)(4)(v):

# Example 1.
A owns a 20 percent interest as a general partner in the capital and profits of P, a partnership which owns oil or gas working interests. The other partners of P agree to indemnify A against liability in excess of A's capital contribution for any of P's costs and expenses with respect to P's working interests. As a general partner, however, A is jointly and severally liable for all of P's liabilities and, under paragraph (e)(4)(v)(B)(
1
) of this section, the indemnification agreement is not taken into account in determining whether A holds the working interests through an entity that limits A's liability. Accordingly, the partnership does not limit A's liability with respect to the drilling or operation of wells pursuant to the working interests.

# Example 2.
B owns a 10 percent interest in X, an entity (other than a limited partnership or corporation) created under applicable State law to hold working interests in oil or gas properties. Under applicable State law, B is liable without limitation for 10 percent of X's costs and expenses with respect to X's working interests but is not liable for the remaining 90 percent of such costs and expenses. Since B's liability for the obligations of X is not limited to a determinable fixed amount (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(v)(A)(
3
) of this section), the entity does not limit B's liability with respect to the drilling or operation of wells pursuant to the working interests.

# Example 3.
C is both a general partner and a limited partner in a partnership that owns a working interest in oil or gas property. Because C owns an interest as a general partner in each well drilled pursuant to the working interest, C's entire interest in each well drilled pursuant to the working interest is treated under paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section as an interest in an activity that is not a passive activity (without regard to whether C materially participates in such activity).
(vi)
Cross reference to special rule for income from certain oil or gas properties.
A special rule relating to the treatment of income from certain interests in oil or gas properties is contained in § 1.469-2T(c)(6).
(5)
Rental of dwelling unit.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-2(d)(2)(xii) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(6)
Activity of trading personal property
—(i)
In general.
An activity of trading personal property for the account of owners of interests in the activity is not a passive activity (without regard to whether such activity is a trade or business activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section)).
(ii)
Personal property.
For purposes of this paragraph (e)(6), the term “personal property” means personal property (within the meaning of section 1092(d), without regard to paragraph (3) thereof).
(iii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (e)(6):

# Example.
A partnership is a trader of stocks, bonds, and other securities (within the meaning of section 1236(c)). The capital employed by the partnership in the trading activity consists of amounts contributed by the partners in exchange for their partnership interests, and funds borrowed by the partnership. The partnership derives gross income from the activity in the form of interest, dividends, and capital gains. Under
these facts, the partnership is treated as conducting an activity of trading personal property for the account of its partners. Accordingly, under this paragraph (e)(6), the activity is not a passive activity.
(f)
Treatment of disallowed passive activity losses and credits
—(1)
Scope of this paragraph.
The rules in this paragraph (f)—
(i) Identify the passive activity deductions that are disallowed for any taxable year in which all or a portion of the taxpayer's passive activity loss is disallowed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section;
(ii) Identify the credits from passive activities that are disallowed for any taxable year in which all or a portion of the taxpayer's passive activity credit is disallowed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section; and
(iii) Provide for the carryover of disallowed deductions and credits.
(2)
Identification of disallowed passive activity deductions
—(i)
Allocation of disallowed passive activity loss among activities
—(A)
General rule.
If all or any portion of the taxpayer's passive activity loss is disallowed for the taxable year under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, a ratable portion of the loss (if any) from each passive activity of the taxpayer is disallowed. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the ratable portion of a loss from an activity is computed by multiplying the passive activity loss that is disallowed for the taxable year by the fraction obtained by dividing—
(
1
) The loss from the activity for the taxable year; by
(
2
) The sum of the losses for the taxable year from all activities having losses for such year.
(B)
Loss from an activity.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2)(i), the term “loss from an activity” means—
(
1
) The amount by which the passive activity deductions from the activity for the taxable year (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(d)) exceed the passive activity gross income from the activity for the taxable year (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)); reduced by
(
2
) Any part of such amount that is allowed under section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T (relating to the $25,000 allowance for certain rental real estate activities).
(C)
Significant participation passive activities.
If the taxpayer's passive activity gross income from significant participation passive activities (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(f)(2)(ii)) for the taxable year (determined without regard to § 1.469-2T(f)(2) through (4)) exceeds the taxpayer's passive activity deductions from such activities for the taxable year, such activities shall be treated, solely for purposes of applying this paragraph (f)(2)(i) for the taxable year, as a single activity that does not have a loss for such taxable year.
(D)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f)(2)(i):

# Example 1.
An individual holds interests in three passive activities, A, B, and C. The gross income and deductions from these activities for the taxable year are as follows:
A
B
C
Total
Gross income
$7,000
$4,000
$12,000
$23,000
Deductions
(16,000)
(20,000)
(8,000)
(44,000)
Net income (loss)
($9,000)
($16,000)
$4,000
($21,000)
The taxpayer's $21,000 passive activity loss for the taxable year is disallowed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. Therefore, a ratable portion of the losses from activities A and B is disallowed. The disallowed portion of each loss is determined as follows:
A: $21,000 × $9,000/$25,000
$7,560
B: $21,000 × $16,000/$25,000
$13,440
Total
$21,000

# Example 2.
An individual holds interests in four passive activities, A, B, C, and D. The results of operations of these activities for the taxable year are as follows:
A
B
C
D
Total
Gross income
15,000
5,000
10,000
10,000
40,000
Deductions

(20,000)
(8,000)
(43,000)
Net income (loss)
10,000
(5,000)
(10,000)
2,000
(3,000)
Activities A and B are significant participation passive activities (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(f)(2)(ii)). The gross income from these activities for the taxable year ($20,000) exceeds the passive activity deductions from those activities for the taxable year ($15,000) by $5,000 and, under § 1.469-2T(f)(2), $5,000 of gross income from those activities is treated as not from a passive activity. Therefore, solely for purposes of applying this paragraph (f)(2)(i) for the taxable year, activities A and B are treated as a single activity that does not have a loss for the taxable year. Under § 1.469-2T(b), the taxpayer's passive activity loss for the taxable year is $8,000 ($43,000 of passive activity deductions minus $35,000 of passive activity gross income). The results of treating activities A and B as a single activity that does not have a loss for the taxable year is that none of the $8,000 passive activity loss is allocated under this paragraph (f)(2)(i) to activity B for the taxable year, even though the taxpayer incurred a loss in that activity for the taxable year.
(ii)
Allocation within loss activities
—(A)
In general.
If all or any portion of a taxpayer's loss from an activity is disallowed under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section for the taxable year, a ratable portion of each passive activity deduction (other than an excluded deduction (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section)) of the taxpayer from such activity is disallowed. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the ratable portion of a passive activity deduction of a taxpayer is the amount of the disallowed portion of the taxpayer's loss from the activity (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section) for the taxable year multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—
(
1
) The amount of such deduction; by
(
2
) The sum of all passive activity deductions (other than excluded deductions (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section)) of the taxpayer from such activity from the taxable year.
(B)
Excluded deductions.
The term “excluded deduction” means any passive activity deduction of a taxpayer that is taken into account in computing the taxpayer's net income from an item of property for a taxable year in which an amount of the taxpayer's gross income from such item of property is treated as not from a passive activity under § 1.469-2T(c)(6) or § 1.469-2T(f) (5), (6), or (7).
(iii)
Separately identified deductions.
In identifying the deductions from an activity that are disallowed under this paragraph (f)(2), the taxpayer need not account separately for a deduction unless such deduction may, if separately taken into account, result in an income tax liability for any taxable year different from that which would result were such deduction not taken into account separately. For related rules applicable to partnerships and S corporations, see § 1.702-1(a)(8)(ii) and section 1366(a)(1)(A), respectively. Deductions that must be accounted for separately include (but are not limited to) deductions that—
(A) Arise in a rental real estate activity (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in taxable years in which the taxpayer actively participates (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in such activity;
(B) Arise in a rental real estate activity (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in taxable years in which the taxpayer does not actively participate (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in such activity; or
(C) Are taken into account under section 1211 (relating to the limitation on capital losses) or section 1231 (relating to property used in a trade or business and involuntary conversions).
(3)
Identification of disallowed credits from passive activities
—(i)
General rule.
If all or any portion of the taxpayer's passive activity credit is disallowed for the taxable year under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, a ratable portion of each credit from each passive activity of the taxpayer is disallowed. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the ratable portion of a credit of a taxpayer is computed by multiplying the
portion of the taxpayer's passive activity credit that is disallowed for the taxable year by the fraction obtained by dividing—
(A) The amount of the credit; by
(B) The sum of all of the taxpayer's credits from passive activities for the taxable year.
(ii)
Coordination rule.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, the credits from a passive activity do not include any credit or portion of a credit that—
(A) Is allowed for the taxable year under section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T (relating to the $25,000 allowance for certain rental real estate activities); or
(B) Increases the basis of property during the taxable year under section 469(j)(9) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-6T (relating to the election to increase the basis of certain property by disallowed credits).
(iii)
Separately identified credits.
In identifying the credits from an activity that are disallowed under this paragraph (f)(3), the taxpayer need not account separately for any credit unless such credit may, if separately taken into account, result in an income tax liability for any taxable year different from that which would result were such credit not taken into account separately. For related rules applicable to partnerships and S corporations, see § 1.702-1(a)(8)(ii) and section 1366(a)(1)(A), respectively. Credits that must be accounted for separately include (but are not limited to)—
(A) Credits (other than the low-income housing and rehabilitation investment credits) from a rental real estate activity (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) that arise in a taxable year in which the taxpayer actively participates (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in such activity;
(B) Credits (other than the low-income housing and rehabilitation investment credits) from a rental real estate activity (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) that arise in a taxable year in which the taxpayer does not actively participate (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T) in such activity;
(C) Low-income housing and rehabilitation investment credits from a rental real estate activity (within the meaning of section 469(i) and the rules to be contained in § 1.469-9T); and
(D) Any credit that is subject to the limitations of sections 26(a), 28(d)(2), 29(b)(5), or 38(c) in a manner that differs from the manner in which any other credit is subject to such limitations.
(4)
Carryover of disallowed deductions and credits.
[Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(f)(4) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(g)
Application of these rules to C corporations
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in the rules to be contained in paragraph (k) of this section, section 469 and the regulations thereunder do not apply to any corporation that is not a personal service corporation or a closely held corporation for the taxable year. See paragraphs (g) (4) and (5) of this section for special rules for computing the passive activity loss and passive activity credit, respectively, of a closely held corporation.
(2)
Definitions.
For purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder—
(i) The term
personal service corporation
means a C corporation that is a personal service corporation for the taxable year (within the meaning of § 1.441-3(c)); and
(ii) The term
closely held corporation
means a C corporation that meets the stock ownership requirements of section 542(a)(2) (taking into account the modifications in section 465(a)(3)) for the taxable year and is not a personal service corporation for such year.
(3)
Participation of corporations
—(i)
Material participation.
For purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder, a corporation described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section shall be treated as materially participating in an activity for a taxable year if and only if—
(A) One or more individuals, each of whom is treated under paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section as materially participating in such activity for the taxable year, directly or indirectly hold (in the aggregate) more than 50
percent (by value) of the outstanding stock of such corporation; or
(B) In the case of a closely held corporation (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section), the requirements of section 465(c)(7)(C) (without regard to clause (iv) thereof and taking into account section 465(c)(7)(D)) are met with respect to such activity.
(ii)
Significant participation.
For purposes of § 1.469-2T(f)(2), an activity of a corporation described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section shall be treated as a significant participation passive activity for a taxable year if and only if—
(A) The corporation is not treated as materially participating in such activity for the taxable year; and
(B) One or more individuals, each of whom is treated under paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section as significantly participating in such activity, directly or indirectly hold (in the aggregate) more than 50 percent (by value) of the outstanding stock of such corporation.
(iii)
Participation of individual.
Whether an individual is treated for purposes of this paragraph (g)(3) as materially participating or significantly participating in an activity of a corporation shall be determined under the rules of § 1.469-5T, except that in applying such rules—
(A) All activities of the corporation shall be treated as activities in which the individual holds an interest in determining whether the individual participates (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T(f)) in an activity of the corporation; and
(B) The individual's participation in all activities other than activities of the corporation shall be disregarded in determining whether the individual's participation in an activity of the corporation is treated as material participation under § 1.469-5T(a)(4) (relating to material participation in significant participation activities).
(4)
Modified computation of passive activity loss in the case of closely held corporations
—(i)
In general.
A closely held corporation's passive activity loss for the taxable year is the amount, if any, by which the corporation's passive activity deductions for the taxable year (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(d)) exceed the sum of—
(A) The corporation's passive activity gross income for the taxable year (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)); and
(B) The corporation's net active income for the taxable year.
(ii)
Net active income.
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(4), a corporation's net active income for the taxable year is such corporation's taxable income for the taxable year, determined without regard to the following items for the year:
(A) Passive activity gross income;
(B) Passive activity deductions;
(C) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(g)(4)(ii)(C) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(D) Gross income that is treated under § 1.469-2T(c)(6) (relating to gross income from certain oil or gas properties) as not from a passive activity;
(E) Gross income and deductions from any trade or business activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section) that is described in paragraph (e)(6) of this section (relating to certain activities of trading personal property) but only if the corporation did not materially participate in such activity for the taxable year;
(F) Deductions described in § 1.469-2T(d)(2)(i), (ii), and (iv) (relating to certain deductions attributable to portfolio income); and
(G) Interest expense allocated under § 1.163-8T to a portfolio expenditure (within the meaning of § 1.163-8T(b)(6)).
(iii)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (g)(4):

# Example 1.
(i) For 1987, X, a closely held corporation, is engaged in two activities, a trade or business activity in which X materially participates for 1987 and a rental activity. X also holds portfolio investments. For 1987, X has the following gross income and deductions:
Gross income:
Rents
$60,000
Gross income from business
100,000
Portfolio income
35,000
Total
$195,000
Deductions:
Rental deductions
($100,000)
Business deductions (80,000)
Interest expense allocable to portfolio expenditures under § 1.163-8T
(10,000)
Deductions (other than interest expense) clearly and directly allocable to portfolio income
(5,000)
Total
($195,000)
(ii) The corporation's net active income for 1987 is $20,000, computed as follows:
Gross income
$195,000
Amounts not taken into account in computing net active income:
Rents (see paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(A) of this section)
$60,000
Portfolio income (see paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(C) of this section)
$35,000
$95,000
($95,000)
Gross income taken into account in computing net active income
$100,000
$100,000
Deductions
($195,000)
Amounts not taken into account in computing net active income:
Rental deductions (see paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(B) of this section)
($100,000)
Interest expense allocated to portfolio expenditures (see paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(G) of this section)
($10,000)
Other deductions clearly and directly allocable to portfolio income (see paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(F) of this section)
($5,000)
($115,000)
$115,000
Deductions taken into account in computing net active income
($80,000)
($80,000)
Net active income
$20,000
(iii) Under paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section, X's passive activity loss for 1987 is $20,000, the amount by which the passive activity deductions for the taxable year ($100,000) exceed the sum of (a) the passive activity gross income for the taxable year ($60,000) and (b) the net active income for the taxable year ($20,000). Under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the $20,000 of deductions from X's rental activity that are disallowed for 1987 are treated as deductions from the rental activity for 1988. If computed without regard to the net active income for the taxable year, X's passive activity loss would be $40,000 ($100,000 of rental deductions minus $60,000 of rental income). Thus, the effect of the rule in paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this section is to reduce the corporation's passive activity loss for the taxable year by the amount of the corporation's net active income for such year.
(iv) Under these facts, X's taxable income for 1987 is $20,000, computed as follows:
Gross income
$195,000
Deductions:
Total deductions
($195,000)
Passive activity loss
$20,000
Allowable deductions
($175,000)
($175,000)
Taxable income
$20,000

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that, in 1988, X has a loss from the trade or business activity, and a net operating loss (“NOL”) of $15,000 that is carried back under section 172(b) to 1987. Since NOL carrybacks are taken into account in computing net active income, X's net active income for 1987 must be recomputed as follows:
Net active income before NOL carryback
$20,000
NOL carryback
($15,000)
Net active income
$5,000
(ii) Under these facts, X's disallowed passive activity loss for 1987 is $35,000, the amount by which the passive activity deductions for the taxable year ($100,000) exceed the sum of (a) the passive activity gross income for the taxable year ($60,000) and (b) the net active income for the taxable year ($5,000).
(iii) Under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the $35,000 of deductions from X's rental activity that are disallowed for 1987 are treated as deductions from the rental activity for 1988. X's taxable income for 1987 is $20,000, computed as follows:
Gross income
$195,000
Deductions:
Total deductions
($210,000)
Passive activity loss
$35,000
Allowable deductions
($175,000)
($175,000)
Taxable income
$20,000
Thus, taking the NOL carryback into account in computing net active income for 1987 does not affect X's taxable income for 1987, but increases the deductions treated under paragraph (f)(4) as deductions from X's rental activity for 1988 and decreases X's NOL carryover to years other than 1987.
(5)
Allowance of passive activity credit of closely held corporations to extent of
net active income tax liability
—(i)
In general.
Solely for purposes of determining the amount disallowed under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, a closely held corporation's passive activity credit for the taxable year shall be reduced by such corporation's net active income tax liability for such year.
(ii)
Net active income tax liability.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section, a corporation's net active income tax liability for a taxable year is the amount (if any) by which—
(A) The corporation's regular tax liability (within the meaning of section 26(b)) for the taxable year, determined by reducing the corporation's taxable income for such year by an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the corporation's passive activity gross income for such year over the corporation's passive activity deductions for such year; exceeds
(B) The sum of—
(
1
) The corporation's regular tax liability for the taxable year, determined by reducing the corporation's taxable income for such year by an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the sum of the corporation's net active income (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section) and passive activity gross income for such year over the corporation's passive activity deductions for such year; and
(
2
) The corporation's credits (other than credits from passive activities) that are allowable for the taxable year (without regard to the limitations contained in sections 26(a), 28(d)(2), 29(b)(5), 38(c), and 469).
(h)
Special rules for affiliated group filing consolidated return.
(1)-(2) [Reserved]
(3)
Disallowance of consolidated group's passive activity loss or credit.
A consolidated group's passive activity loss or passive activity credit for the taxable year shall be disallowed to the extent provided in paragraph (a) of this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a consolidated group's passive activity loss and passive activity credit shall be determined by taking into account the following items of each member of such group:
(i) Passive activity gross income;
(ii) Passive activity deductions;
(iii) Net active income (in the case of a consolidated group treated as a closely held corporation under paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section); and
(iv) Credits from passive activities.
(4) [Reserved]. See § 1.469-1(h)(4) for rules relating to this paragraph.
(5)
Modification of rules for identifying disallowed passive activity deductions and credits
—(i)
Identification of disallowed deductions.
In applying paragraphs (f) (2) and (4) of this section to a consolidated group for purposes of identifying the passive activity deductions of such consolidated group and of each member of such consolidated group that are disallowed for the taxable year and treated as deductions from activities for the succeeding taxable year, the following rules shall apply:
(A) A ratable portion (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this section) of the passive activity loss of the consolidated group that is disallowed for the taxable year shall be allocated to each member of the group;
(B) Pararaph (f)(2) of this section shall then be applied to each member of the group as if—
(
1
) Such member were a separate taxpayer; and
(
2
) The amount allocated to such member under paragraph (h)(5)(i)(A) of this section were the amount of such member's passive activity loss that is disallowed for the taxable year; and
(C) Paragraph (f)(4) of this section shall be applied to each member of the group as if it were a separate taxpayer.
(ii)
Ratable portion of disallowed passive activity loss.
For purposes of paragraph (h)(5)(i)(A) of this section, a member's ratable portion of the disallowed passive activity loss of the consolidated group is the amount of such disallowed loss multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing—
(A) The amount of the passive activity loss of such member of the consolidated group that would be disallowed for the taxable year if the items of gross income and deduction of such member were the only items of the group for such year; by
(B) The sum of the amounts described in paragraph (h)(5)(ii)(A) of this section for all members of the group.
(iii)
Identification of disallowed credits.
In applying paragraph (f)(3) of this section to a consolidated group for purposes of identifying the credits from passive activities of members of such consolidated group that are disallowed for the taxable year, the consolidated group shall be treated as one taxpayer. Thus, a ratable portion of each of the group's credits from passive activities is disallowed.
(6) [Reserved]
(7)
Disposition of stock of a member of an affiliated group.
Any gain recognized by a member on the disposition of stock of a subsidiary (including income resulting from the recognition of an excess loss account under § 1.1502-19) shall be treated as portfolio income (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T (c)(3)(i)).
(8)
Dispositions of property used in multiple activities.
The determination of whether § 1.469-2T(c)(2)(ii) or (iii) or (d)(5)(ii) applies to a disposition (including a deemed disposition described in paragraph (h)(6)(iii)(C)(
1
) of this section) of property by a member of a consolidated group shall be made by treating such member as having held the property for the entire period that the group has owned such property and as having used the property in all of the activities in which the group has used such property
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Spouses filing joint return
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in the regulations under section 469, spouses filing a joint return for a taxable year shall be treated for such year as one taxpayer for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder Thus, for example, spouses filing a joint return are treated as one taxpayer for purposes of—
(i) Section 1.469-2T (relating generally to the computation of such taxpayer's passive activity loss); and
(ii) Paragraph (f) of this section (relating to the allocation of such taxpayer's disallowed passive activity loss and passive activity credit among activities and the identification of disallowed passive activity deductions and credits from passive activities).
(2)
Exceptions to treatment as one taxpayer
—(i)
Identification of disallowed deductions and credits.
For purposes of paragraphs (f)(2)(iii) and (3)(iii) of this section, spouses filing a joint return for the taxable year must account separately for the deductions and credits attributable to the interests of each spouse in any activity.
(ii)
Treatment of deductions disallowed under sections 704(d), 1366(d), and 465.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or § 1.469-2T, this paragraph (j) shall not affect the application of section 704(d), section 1366(d), or section 465 to taxpayers filing a joint return for the taxable year.
(iii)
Treatment of losses from working interests.
Paragraph (e)(4) of this section (relating to losses and credits from certain interests in oil and gas wells) shall be applied by treating a husband and wife (whether or not filing a joint return) as separate taxpayers.
(3)
Joint return no longer filed.
If an individual—
(A) Does not file a joint return for the taxable years; and
(B) Filed a joint return for the immediately preceding taxable year;
then the passive activity deductions and credits allocable to such individual's activities for the taxable year under paragraph (f)(4) of this section shall be determined by taking into account the items of deduction and credit attributable to such individual's interests in passive activities for the immediately preceding taxable year. See paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section.
(4)
Participation of spouses.
Rules treating an individual's participation in an activity as participation of such individual's spouse in such activity (without regard to whether the spouses file a joint return) are contained in § 1.469-5T(f)(3).

§ 1.469-2
Passive activity loss.
(a)-(c)(2)(ii) [Reserved]
(c)(2)(iii)
Disposition of substantially appreciated property formerly used in
nonpassive activity
—(A)
In general.
If an interest in property used in an activity is substantially appreciated at the time of its disposition, any gain from the disposition shall be treated as not from a passive activity unless the interest in property was used in a passive activity for either—
(
1
) 20 percent of the period during which the taxpayer held the interest in property; or
(
2
) The entire 24-month period ending on the date of the disposition.
(B)
Date of disposition.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), a disposition of an interest in property is deemed to occur on the date that the interest in property becomes subject to an oral or written agreement that either requires the owner or gives the owner an option to transfer the interest in property for consideration that is fixed or otherwise determinable on that date.
(C)
Substantially appreciated property.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), an interest in property is substantially appreciated if the fair market value of the interest in property exceeds 120 percent of the adjusted basis of the interest.
(D)
Investment property.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii), an interest in property is treated as an interest in property used in an activity other than a passive activity and as an interest in property held for investment for any period during which the interest is held through a C corporation or similar entity. An entity is similar to a C corporation for this purpose if the owners of interests in the entity derive only portfolio income (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T) from the interests.
(E)
Coordination with § 1.469-2T(c)(2)(ii).
If § 1.469-2T(c)(2)(ii) applies to the disposition of an interest in property, this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) applies only to that portion of the gain from the disposition of the interest in property that is characterized as gain from a passive activity after the application of § 1.469-2T(c)(2)(ii).
(F)
Coordination with section 163(d).
Gain that is treated as not from a passive activity under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) is treated as income described in section 469(e)(1)(A) and § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i) if and only if the gain is from the disposition of an interest in property that was held for investment for more than 50 percent of the period during which the taxpayer held that interest in property in activities other than passive activities.
(G)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii):

# Example 1.
A acquires a building on January 1, 1993, and uses the building in a trade or business activity in which A materially participates until March 31, 2004. On April 1, 2004, A leases the building to B. On December 31, 2005, A sells the building. At the time of the sale, A's interest in the building is substantially appreciated (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C) of this section). Assuming A's lease of the building to B constitutes a rental activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)), the building is used in a passive activity for 21 months (April 1, 2004, through December 31, 2005). Thus, the building was not used in a passive activity for the entire 24-month period ending on the date of the sale. In addition, the 21-month period during which the building was used in a passive activity is less than 20 percent of A's holding period for the building (13 years). Therefore, the gain from the sale is treated under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) as not from a passive activity.

# Example 2.
(i) A, an individual, is a stockholder of corporation X. X is a C corporation until December 31, 1993, and is an S corporation thereafter. X acquires a building on January 1, 1993, and sells the building on March 1, 1994. At the time of the sale, A's interest in the building held through X is substantially appreciated (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C) of this section). The building is leased to various tenants at all times during the period in which it is held by X. Assume that the lease of the building would constitute a rental activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(e)(3)) with respect to a person that holds the building directly or through an S corporation.
(ii) Paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(D) of this section provides that an interest in property is treated for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) as used in an activity other than a passive activity and as held for investment for any period during which the interest is held through a C corporation. Thus, for purposes of determining the character of A's gain from the sale of the building, A's interest in the building is treated as an interest in property held for investment for the period from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993, and as an interest in property used in a passive activity for the period from January 1, 1994, to February 28, 1994.
(iii) A's interest in the building was not used in a passive activity for the entire 24-month period ending on the date of the sale.
In addition, the 2-month period during which A's interest in the building was used in a passive activity is less than 20 percent of the period during which A held an interest in the building (14 months). Therefore, the gain from the sale is treated under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) as not from a passive activity.
(iv) Under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(F) of this section, gain that is treated as nonpassive under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) is treated as portfolio income (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)) if the gain is from the disposition of an interest in property that was held for investment for more than 50 percent of the period during which the taxpayer held the interest in activities other than passive activities. In this case, A's interest in the building was treated as held for investment for the entire period during which it was used in activities other than passive activities (
i.e.,
the 12-month period from January 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993). Accordingly, A's gain from the sale is treated under this paragraph (c)(2)(iii) as portfolio income.
(iv)
Taxable acquisitions.
If a taxpayer acquires an interest in property in a transaction other than a nonrecognition transaction (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(45)), the ownership and use of the interest in property before the transaction is not taken into account for purposes of applying this paragraph (c)(2) to any subsequent disposition of the interest in property by the taxpayer.

Property held for sale to customers

Sale incidental to another activity

Applicability
—(
i
)
In general.
This paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) applies to the disposition of a taxpayer's interest in property if and only if—
(
A
) At the time of the disposition, the taxpayer holds the interest in property in an activity that, for purposes of section 1221(1), involves holding the property or similar property primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business (a dealing activity);
(
B
) One or more other activities of the taxpayer do not involve holding similar property for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business (nondealing activities) and the interest in property was used in the nondealing activity or activities for more than 80 percent of the period during which the taxpayer held the interest in property; and
(
C
) The interest in property was not acquired and held by the taxpayer for the principal purpose of selling the interest to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.
(
ii
)
Principal purpose.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A), a taxpayer is rebuttably presumed to have acquired and held an interest in property for the principal purpose of selling the interest to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business if—
(
A
) The period during which the interest in property was used in nondealing activities of the taxpayer does not exceed the lesser of 24 months or 20 percent of the recovery period (within the meaning of section 168) applicable to the property; or
(
B
) The interest in property was simultaneously offered for sale to customers and used in a nondealing activity of the taxpayer for more than 25 percent of the period during which the interest in property was used in nondealing activities of the taxpayer.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, an interest in property is not considered to be offered for sale to customers solely because a lessee of the property has been granted an option to purchase the property.
(

)
Dealing activity not taken into account.
If paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) applies to the disposition of a taxpayer's interest in property, holding the interest in the dealing activity is treated, for purposes of § 1.469-2T(c)(2), as the use of the interest in the last nondealing activity of the taxpayer in which the interest in property was used prior to its disposition.
(B)
Use in a nondealing activity incidental to sale.
If paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section does not apply to the disposition of a taxpayer's interest in property that is held in a dealing activity of the taxpayer at the time of disposition, the use of the interest in property in a nondealing activity of the taxpayer for any period during which the interest in property is also offered for sale to customers is treated, for purposes of § 1.469-2T(c)(2), as the use of the interest in property in the dealing activity of the taxpayer.
(C)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(2)(v):

# Example 1.
(i) The taxpayer acquires a residential apartment building on January 1,
1993, and uses the building in a rental activity. In January 1996, the taxpayer converts the apartments into condominium units. After the conversion, the taxpayer holds the condominium units for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business of dealing in condominium units. (Assume that these are dealing operations treated as separate activities under § 1.469-4, and that the taxpayer materially participates in the activity.) In addition, the taxpayer continues to use the units in the rental activity until they are sold. The units are first held for sale on January 1, 1996, and the last unit is sold on December 31, 1996.
(ii) This paragraph (c)(2)(v) provides that holding an interest in property in a dealing activity (the marketing of the property) is treated for purposes of § 1.469-2T(c)(2) as the use of the interest in a nondealing activity if the marketing of the property is incidental to the nondealing use. Under paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(
2
) of this section, the interests in property are treated as used in the last nondealing activity in which they were used prior to their disposition. In addition, paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(
1
) of this section provides rules for determining whether the marketing of the property is incidental to the use of an interest in property in a nondealing activity. Under these rules, the marketing of the property is treated as incidental to the use in a nondealing activity if the interest in property was used in nondealing activities for more than 80 percent of the taxpayer's holding period in the property (the holding period requirement) and the taxpayer did not acquire and hold the interest in property for the principal purpose of selling it to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business (a dealing purpose).
(iii) In this case, the apartments were used in a rental activity for the entire period during which they were held by the taxpayer. Thus, the apartments were used in a nondealing activity for more than 80 percent of the taxpayer's holding period in the property, and the marketing of the property satisfies the holding period requirement.
(iv) Paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(
1
)(
ii
) of this section provides that a taxpayer is rebuttably presumed to have a dealing purpose unless the interest in property was used in nondealing activities for more than 24 months or 20 percent of the property's recovery period (whichever is less). The same presumption applies if the interest in property was offered for sale to customers during more than 25 percent of the period in which the interest was held in nondealing activities. In this case, the taxpayer used each apartment in a nondealing activity (the rental activity) for a period of 36 to 48 months (
i.e.,
from January 1, 1993, to the date of sale in the period from January through December 1996). Thus, the apartments were used in nondealing activities for more than 24 months, and the first of the rebuttable presumptions described above does not apply. In addition, the apartments were offered for sale to customers for up to 12 months (depending on the month in which the apartment was sold) during the period in which the apartments were used in a nondealing activity. The percentage obtained by dividing the period during which an apartment was held for sale to customers by the period during which the apartment was used in nondealing activities ranges from zero in the case of apartments sold on January 1, 1996, to 25 percent (
i.e.,
12 months/48 months) in the case of apartments sold on December 31, 1996. Thus, no apartment was offered for sale to customers during more than 25 percent of the period in which it was used in nondealing activities, and the second rebuttable presumption does not apply.
(v) Because neither of the rebuttable presumptions in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(
1
)((
ii
) of this section applies in this case, the taxpayer will not be treated as having a dealing purpose unless other facts and circumstances establish that the taxpayer acquired and held the apartments for the principal purpose of selling the apartments to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Assume that none of the facts and circumstances suggest that the taxpayer had such a purpose. If that is the case, the taxpayer does not have a dealing purpose.
(vi) The marketing of the property satisfies the holding period requirement, and the taxpayer does not have a dealing purpose. Thus, holding the apartments in the taxpayer's dealing activity is treated for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2) as the use of the apartments in a nondealing activity. In this case, the rental activity is the only nondealing activity in which the apartments were used prior to their disposition. Thus, the apartments are treated under paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A)(
2
) of this section as interests in property that were used only in the rental activity for the entire period during which the taxpayer held the interests. Accordingly, the rules in § 1.469-2T(c)(2)(ii) and paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section do not apply, and all gain from the sale of the apartments is treated as passive activity gross income.

# Example 2.
(i) The taxpayer acquires a residential apartment building on January 1, 1993, and uses the building in a rental activity. The taxpayer converts the apartments into condominium units on July 1, 1993. After the conversion, the taxpayer holds the condominium units for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business of dealing in condominium units. (Assume that these are dealing operations treated as separate activities under § 1.469-4, and that the taxpayer materially participates in the activities.) In addition, the taxpayer continues to use the units in the rental activity until
they are sold. The first unit is sold on January 1, 1994, and the last unit is sold on December 31, 1996.
(ii) In this case, all of the apartments were simultaneously offered for sale to customers and used in a nondealing activity of the taxpayer for more than 25 percent of the period during which the apartments were used in nondealing activities. Thus, the taxpayer is rebuttably presumed to have acquired the apartments (including apartments that are used in the rental activity for at least 24 months) for the principal purpose of selling them to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Assume that the facts and circumstances do not rebut this presumption. If that is the case, the taxpayer has a dealing purpose, and paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section does not apply to the disposition of the apartments.
(iii) Paragraph (c)(2)(v)(B) of this section provides that if paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section does not apply to the disposition of a taxpayer's interest in property that is held in a dealing activity of the taxpayer at the time of the disposition, the use of the interest in property in any nondealing activity of the taxpayer for any period during which the interest is also offered for sale to customers is treated as incidental to the use of the interest in the dealing activity. Accordingly, for purposes of applying the rules of § 1.469-2T(c)(2) to the disposition of the apartments, the rental of the apartments after July 1, 1993, is treated as the use of the apartments in the taxpayer's dealing activity.

# Example 3.
(i) The taxpayer acquires a residential apartment building on January 1, 1993, and uses the building in a rental activity. In January 1996, the taxpayer converts the apartments into condominium units. After the conversion, the taxpayer holds the condominium units for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business of dealing in condominium units. (Assume that these are dealing operations treated as separate activities under § 1.469-4, and that the taxpayer materially participates in the activities.) In addition, the taxpayer continues to use the units in the rental activity until they are sold. The units are first held for sale on January 1, 1996, and the last unit is sold in 1997.
(ii) The treatment of apartments sold in 1996 is the same as in Example 1. The apartments sold in 1997, however, were simultaneously offered for sale to customers and used in a nondealing activity for more than 25 percent of the period during which the apartments were used in nondealing activities. (For example, an apartment that is sold on January 31, 1997, has been offered for sale for 13 months or 26.1 percent of the 49-month period during which it was used in nondealing activities.) Thus, the taxpayer is rebuttably presumed to have acquired the apartments sold in 1997 for the principal purpose of selling them to customers in the ordinary course of a trade of business. Assume that the facts and circumstances do not rebut this presumption. In that case, the marketing of the apartments sold in 1997 does not satisfy the principal purpose requirement, and paragraph (c)(2)(v)(A) of this section does not apply to the disposition of those apartments. Accordingly, for purposes of applying the rules of § 1.469-2T(c)(2) to the disposition of the apartments sold in 1997, the rental of the apartments after January 1, 1996, is treated, under paragraph (c)(2)(v)(B) of this section, as the use of the apartments in the taxpayer's dealing activity.

Gross income from certain oil or gas properties
—(i)
In general.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the regulations under section 469, passive activity gross income for any taxable year does not include an amount of the taxpayer's gross passive income for the year from a property described in this paragraph (c)(6)(i) equal to the taxpayer's net passive income from the property for the year. Property is described in this paragraph (c)(6)(i) if the property is—
(A) An oil or gas property that includes an oil or gas well if, for any prior taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, any of the taxpayer's loss from the well was treated, solely by reason of § 1.469-1T(e)(4) (relating to a special rule for losses from oil and gas working interests), and not by reason of the taxpayer's material participation in the activity, as a loss that is not from a passive activity; or
(B) Any property the basis of which is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of property described in paragraph (c)(6)(i)(A) of this section.
(ii)
Gross and net passive income from the property.
For purposes of this paragraph (c)(6)—
(A) The taxpayer's gross passive income for any taxable year from any property described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section is any passive activity gross income for the year (determined without regard to this paragraph (c)(6) and § 1.469-2T(f)) from the property;
(B) The taxpayer's net passive income for any taxable year from any property described in paragraph
(c)(6)(i) of this section is the excess, if any, of—
(
1
) The taxpayer's gross passive income for the taxable year from the property; over
(
2
) Any passive activity deductions for the taxable year (including any deduction treated as a deduction for the year under § 1.469-1T(f)(4)) that are reasonably allocable to the income; and
(C) if any oil or gas well or other item of property (the item) is included in two or more properties described in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section (the properties), the taxpayer must allocate the passive activity gross income (determined without regard to this paragraph (c)(6) and § 1.469-2T(f) from the item and the passive activity deductions reasonably allocable to the item among the properties.
(iii)
Property.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(6)(i)(A) of this section, the term “property” does not have the meaning given the term by section 614(a) or the regulations thereunder, and an oil or gas property that includes an oil or gas well is—
(A) The well; and
(B) Any other item of property (including any oil or gas well) the value of which is directly enhanced by any drilling, logging, seismic testing, or other activities the costs of which were taken into account in determining the amount of the taxpayer's income or loss from the well.
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c)(6):

# Example 1.
A is a general partner in partnership P and a limited partner in partnership R. P and R own oil and gas working interests in two separate tracts of land acquired from two separate landowners. In 1993, P drills a well on its tract, and A's distributive share of P's losses from drilling the well are treated under § 1.469-1T(e)(4) as not from a passive activity. In the course of selecting the drilling site and drilling the well, P develops information indicating that the reservior in which the well was drilled underlies R's tract as well as P's. Under these facts, P's and R's tracts are treated as one property for purposes of this paragraph (c)(6), even if A's interests in the mineral deposits in the tracts are treated as separate properties under section 614(a). Accordingly, in 1994 and subsequent years, A's distributive share of both P's and R's income and expenses from their respective tracts is taken into account in computing A's net passive income from the property for purposes of this paragraph (c)(6).

# Example 2.
B is a general partner in partnership S. S owns an oil and gas working interest in a single tract of land. In 1993, S drills a well, and B's distributive share of S's losses from drilling the well is treated under § 1.469-1T(e)(4) as not from a passive activity. In the course of drilling the well, S discovers two oil-bearing formations, one underlying the other. On December 1, 1993, S completes the well in the underlying formation. On January 1, 1994, B converts B's entire general partnership interest in S into a limited partnership interest. In 1994, S completes in, and commences production from, the shallow formation. Under these facts, the two mineral deposits in S's tract are treated as one property for purposes of this paragraph (c)(6), even if they are treated as separate properties under section 614(a). Accordingly, B's distributive share of S's income and expenses from both the underlying formation and from recompletion in and production from the shallow formation is taken into account in computing B's net passive income from the property for purposes of this paragraph (c)(6).

Applicability of rules in § 1.469-2T(c)(2).
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(5), a taxpayer's interests in property used in an activity and the amounts allocated to the interests shall be determined under § 1.469-2T(c)(2)(i)(C). In addition, the rules contained in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section apply in determining for purposes of this paragraph (d)(5) the activity (or activities) in which an interest in property is used at the time of its disposition and during the 12-month period ending on the date of its disposition.

(iii)
Payments in liquidation of a partner's interest in partnership property
—(A)
In general.
If any gain or loss is taken into account by a retiring partner (or any other person that owns (directly or indirectly) an interest in the partner if the partner is a passthrough entity) or a deceased partner's successor in interest as a result of a payment to which section 736(b) (relating to payments made in exchange for a retired or deceased partner's interest in partnership property) applies, the gain or loss is treated as passive activity gross income or a passive activity deduction only to the extent that the gain or loss would have been passive activity gross income or a passive activity deduction of the retiring or deceased partner (or the other person) if it had been recognized at the time the liquidation of the partner's interest commenced.
(B)
Payments in liquidation of a partner's interest in unrealized receivables and goodwill under section 736(a).
(
1
) If a payment is made in liquidation of a retiring or deceased partner's interest, the payment is described in section 736(a), and any income—
(
i
) Is taken into account by the retiring partner (or any other person that owns (directly or indirectly) an interest in the partner if the partner is a passthrough entity) or the deceased partner's successor in interest as a result of the payment; and
(
ii
) Is attributable to the portion (if any) of the payment that is allocable to the unrealized receivables (within the meaning of section 751(c)) and goodwill of the partnership;
the percentage of the income that is treated as passive activity gross income shall not exceed the percentage of passive activity gross income that would be included in the gross income
that the retiring or deceased partner (or the other person) would have recognized if the unrealized receivables and goodwill had been sold at the time that the liquidation of the partner's interest commenced.
(
2
) For purposes of this paragarph (e)(2)(iii)(B), the portion (if any) of a payment under section 736(a) that is allocable to unrealized receivables and goodwill of a partnership shall be determined in accordance with the principles employed under § 1.736-1(b) for determining the portion of a payment made under section 736 that is treated as a distribution under section 736(b).

Net income from certain property rented incidental to development activity
—(i)
In general.
An amount of the taxpayer's gross rental activity income for the taxable year from an item of property equal to the net rental activity income for the year from the item of property shall be treated as not from a passive activity if—
(A) Any gain from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of the item of property is included in the taxpayer's income for the taxable year;
(B) The taxpayer's use of the item of property in an activity involving the rental of the property commenced less than 12 months before the date of the disposition (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section) of such property; and
(C) The taxpayer materially participated (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T) or significantly participated (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T(c)(2)) for any taxable year in an activity that involved for such year the performance of services for the purpose of enhancing the value of such item of property (or any other item of property if the basis of the item of property that is sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such other item of property).
(ii)
Commencement of use
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(5)(i)(B) of this section, a taxpayer's use of an item of property in an activity involving the rental of the property commences on the first date on which—
(
1
) The taxpayer owns an interest in the property;
(
2
) Substantially all of the property is rented (or is held out for rent and is in a state of readiness for rental); and
(
3
) No significant value-enhancing services (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B) of this section) remain to be performed.
(B)
Value-enhancing services.
For purposes of this paragraph (f)(5)(ii), the term value-enhancing services means the services described in paragraphs (f)(5) (i)(C) and (iii) of this section, except that the term does not include lease-up. Thus, in cases in which this paragraph (f)(5) applies solely because substantial lease-up remains to be performed (see paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(C) of this section), the twelve month period described in paragraph (f)(5)(i)(B) of this section will begin when the taxpayer acquires an interest in the property if substantially all of the property is held out for rent and is in a state of readiness for rental on that date.
(iii)
Services performed for the purpose of enhancing the value of property.
For purposes of paragraph (f)(5)(i)(C) of this section, services that are treated as performed for the purpose of enhancing the value of an item of property include but are not limited to—
(A) Construction;
(B) Renovation; and
(C) Lease-up (unless more than 50 percent of the property is leased on the date that the taxpayer acquires an interest in the property).
(iv)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (f)(5):

# Example 1.
(i) A, a calendar year individual, is a partner in P, a calendar year partnership, which develops real estate. In 1993, P acquires an interest in undeveloped land and arranges for the financing and construction of an office building on the land. Construction is completed in February 1995, and substantially all of the building is either rented or held out for rent and in a state of readiness for rental beginning on March 1, 1995. Twenty percent of the building is leased as of March 1, 1995.
(ii) P rents the building (or holds it out for rent) for the remainder of 1995 and all of 1996, and sells the building on February 1, 1997, pursuant to a contract entered into on January 15, 1996. P did not hold the building (or any other buildings) for sale to customers in the ordinary course of P's trade or business (see paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section). A's distributive share of P's taxable losses from the rental of the building is $50,000 for 1995 and $30,000 for 1996. All of A's losses from the rental of the building are disallowed under 1.469-1(a)(1)(i) (relating to the disallowance of the passive activity loss for the taxable year). A's distributive share of P's gain from the sale of the building is $150,000. A has no other gross income or deductions from the activity of renting the building.
(iii) The real estate development activity that A holds through P in 1993, 1994, and 1995 involves the performance of services (e.g., construction) for the purpose of enhancing the value of the building. Accordingly, an amount equal to A's net rental activity income from the building may be treated as gross income that is not from a passive activity if A's use of the building in an activity involving the rental of the building commenced less that 12 months before the date of the disposition of the building. In this case, the date of the disposition of the building is January 15, 1996, the date of the binding contract for its sale.
(iv)(A) A taxpayer's use of an item of property in an activity involving the rental of the property commences on the first date on which—
(
1
) The taxpayer owns an interest in the item of property;
(
2
) Substantially all of the property is rented (or is held out for rent and is in a state of readiness for rental); and
(
3
) No significant value-enhancing services (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B) of this section) remain to be performed.
(B) In this case, A's use of the building in an activity involving the rental of the building commenced on March 1, 1995, less than 12 months before January 15, 1996, the date of disposition. Accordingly, if A materially (or significantly) participated in the real estate development activity in 1993, 1994, or 1995 (without regard to whether A materially participated in the activity in more than one of those years), an amount of A's gross rental activity income from the building for 1997 equal to A's net rental activity income from the building for 1997 is treated under this paragraph (f)(5) as gross income that is not from a passive activity. Under paragraph (f)(9)(iv) of this section, A's net rental activity income from the building for 1997 is $70,000 ($150,000 distributive share of gain from the disposition of the building minus $80,000 of reasonably allocable passive activity deductions).

# Example 2.
(i) X, a calendar year taxpayer subject to section 469, acquires a building on February 1, 1994, when the building is 25 percent leased. During 1994, X rents the building (or holds it out for rent) and materially participates in an activity that involves the lease-up of the building. X's activities do not otherwise involve the performance of construction or other services for the purpose of enhancing the value of the building, and X does not hold the building (or any other building) for sale to customers in the ordinary course of X's trade or business. X sells the building on December 1, 1994.
(ii)(A) Under paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(C) of this section, lease-up is considered a service performed for the purpose of enhancing the value of property unless more than 50 percent of the property is leased on the date the taxpayer acquires an interest in the property. Under paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, however, lease-up is not considered a value-enhancing service for purposes of determining when the taxpayer commences using an item of property in an activity involving the rental of the property. Accordingly, X's acquisition of the building constitutes a commencement of X's use of the building in a rental activity, because February 1, 1994, is the first date on which—
(
1
) The taxpayer owns an interest in the item of property;
(
2
) Substantially all of the property is held out for rent; and
(
3
) No significant value-enhancing services (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(5)(ii)(B) of this section) remain to be performed.
(B) In this case, X disposes of the property within 12 months of the date X commenced using the building in a rental activity. Accordingly, an amount of X's gross rental activity income for 1994 equal to X's net rental activity income from the building for 1994 is treated under this paragraph (f)(5) as gain that is not from a passive activity.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that at the time X acquires the building it is 60 percent leased. Under paragraph (f)(5)(iii)(C) of this section, lease-up is not considered a service performed for the purpose of enhancing the value of property if more than 50 percent of the property is leased on the date the taxpayer acquires an interest in the property. Therefore, additional lease-up performed by X is not taken into account under this paragraph (f)(5). Since X's activities do not otherwise involve the performance of services for the purpose of enhancing the value of the building, none of X's gross rental activity income from the building will be treated as income that is not from a passive activity under this paragraph (f)(5).
(f)(6)
Property rented to a nonpassive activity.
An amount of the taxpayer's gross rental activity income for the taxable year from an item of property equal to the net rental activity income for the year from that item of property is treated as not from a passive activity if the property—
(i) Is rented for use in a trade or business activity (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section) in which the taxpayer materially participates (within the meaning of § 1.469-5T) for the taxable year; and
(ii) Is not described in § 1.469-2T(f)(5).
(f)(7)-(f)(9)(ii) [Reserved]
(f)(9)(iii) The gross rental activity income for a taxable year from an item of property is any passive activity gross income (determined without regard to § 1.469-2T(f)(2) through (f)(6)) that—
(A) Is income for the year from the rental or disposition of such item of property; and
(B) In the case of income from the disposition of such item of property, is income from an activity that involved the rental of such item of property during the 12-month period ending on the date of the disposition (see § 1.469-2T(c)(2)(ii)); and
(iv) The net rental activity income from an item of property for the taxable year is the excess, if any, of—
(A) The gross rental activity income from the item of property for the taxable year; over
(B) Any passive activity deductions for the taxable year (including any deduction treated as a deduction for the year under § 1.469-1(f)(4)) that are reasonably allocable to the income.
(10)
Coordination with section 163(d).
Gross income that is treated as not from a passive activity under § 1.469-2T(f)(3), (4), or (7) is treated as income described in section 469(e)(1)(A) and § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i) except in determining whether—
(i) Any property is treated for purposes of section 469(e)(1)(A)(ii)(I) and § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)(C) as property that produces income of a type described in § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)(A);
(ii) Any property is treated for purposes of section 469(e)(1)(A)(ii)(II) and § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)(D) as property held for investment;
(iii) An expense (other than interest expense) is treated for purposes of section 469(e)(1)(A)(i)(II) and § 1.469-2T(d)(4) as clearly and directly allocable to portfolio income (within the meaning of § 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i); and
(iv) Interest expense is allocated under § 1.163-8T to an investment expenditure (within the meaning of § 1.163-8T(b)(3)) or to a passive activity expenditure (within the meaning of § 1.163-8T(b)(4)).

§ 1.469-2T
Passive activity loss (temporary).
(a)
Scope of this section.
This section contains rules for determining the amount of the taxpayer's passive activity loss for the taxable year for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder. The rules contained in this section—
(1) Provide general guidance for identifying items of income and deduction that are taken into account in determining the amount of the passive activity loss for the taxable year;
(2) Specify particular items of income and deduction that are not taken into account in determining the amount of the passive activity loss for the taxable year; and
(3) Specify the manner in which provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations, other than section 469 and the regulations thereunder, are applied for purposes of determining the
extent to which items of deduction are taken into account for a taxable year in computing the amount of the passive activity loss for such year.
(b)
Definition of passive activity loss
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a taxpayer other than a closely held corporation (within the meaning of § 1.469-1T(g)(2)(ii)), the passive activity loss for the taxable year is the amount, if any, by which the passive activity deductions for the taxable year exceed the passive activity gross income for the taxable year.
(2)
Cross references.
See paragraph (c) of this section for the definition of “passive activity gross income,” paragraph (d) of this section for the definition of “passive activity deduction,” and § 1.469-1T(g)(4) for the computation of the passive activity loss of a closely held corporation.
(c)
Passive activity gross income
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in the regulations under section 469, passive activity gross income for a taxable year includes an item of gross income if and only if such income is from a passive activity.
(2)
Treatment of gain from disposition of an interest in an activity or an interest in property used in an activity
—(i)
In general
—(A)
Treatment of gain.
Except as otherwise provided in the regulations under section 469, any gain recognized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition (a “disposition”) of an interest in property used in an activity at the time of the disposition or of an interest in an activity held through a partnership or S corporation is treated in the following manner:
(
1
) The gain is treated as gross income from such activity for the taxable year or years in which it is recognized;
(
2
) If the activity is a passive activity of the taxpayer for the taxable year of the disposition, the gain is treated as passive activity gross income for the taxable year or years in which it is recognized; and
(
3
) If the activity is not a passive activity of the taxpayer for the taxable year of the disposition, the gain is treated as not from a passive activity.
(B)
Dispositions of partnership interests and S corporation stock.
A partnership interest or S corporation stock is not property used in an activity for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2). See paragraph (e)(3) of this section for rules treating the gain recognized upon the disposition of a partnership interest or S corporation stock as gain from the disposition of interests in the activities in which the partnership or S corporation has an interest.
(C)
Interest in property.
