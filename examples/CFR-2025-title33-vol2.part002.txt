The procedures for the damage assumption calculations contained in this Appendix conform to Regulations 24, 25, and 26 of Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution from Ships, 1973, done at London, November 2, 1973.
2.
Assumptions.
For the purpose of calculating hypothetical outflow from tank vessels, three dimensions of the extent of damage of a parallelepiped on the side and bottom of the vessel are assumed.
(a) For side damage, the conditions are as follows:

B/5
—or 11.5 m, whichever is less.
(3) Vertical extent (
v

)
From the base line upwards without limit.
(b) For bottom damage, two conditions to be applied individually to the stated portions of the vessel, as follows:

B
/15 or 6 meters, whichever is less
B
/15 or 6 meters, whichever is less.
3.
Hypothetical Outflow of Oil.
(a) The hypothetical outflow of oil in the case of side damage (O
c
) and bottom damage (O
s
) is calculated by the following formula with respect to compartments breached by damage to all conceivable locations along the length of the vessel to the extent as defined in section 2 of this Appendix.
(1) For side damages: Formula

Where:
W

W

for a segregated ballast tank may be taken equal to zero;
C
i
= Volume of a center tank assumed to be breached by the damage as specified in section 2 of this Appendix;
C
i
for a segregated ballast tank may be taken equal to zero;

is equal to zero;
b
i
= Minimum width of wing tank under consideration measured inboard from the vessel's side at right angles to the centerline at the level corresponding to the assigned summer freeboard; and
h
i
= Minimum depth of the double bottom under consideration; where no double bottom is fitted,
h
i
is equal to zero.
(b) If a void space or segregated ballast tank of a length less than
l
c
is located between wing oil tanks,
O
c
in formula I of this section may be calculated on the basis of volume
W
i
being the actual volume of one such tank (where they are of equal capacity)
or the smaller of the two tanks (if they differ in capacity), adjacent to such space, multiplied by
S
i
as defined below and taking for all other wing tanks involved in such a collision the value of the actual full volume.
EC15NO91.182
Where
l
i
= length of void space or segregated ballast tank under consideration.
(c) Credit is only given in respect to double bottom tanks which are either empty or carrying clean water when cargo is carried in the tanks above.
(1) If the double bottom does not extend for the full length and width of the tank involved, the double bottom is considered nonexistent and the volume of the tanks above the area of the bottom damage must be included in formula II of this section even if the tank is not considered breached because of the installation of such a partial double bottom.
(2) Suction wells may be neglected in the determination of the value
h
i
if such wells are not excessive in area and extend below the tank for a minimum distance and in no case more than half the height of the double bottom. If the depth of such a well exceeds half the height of the double bottom,
h
i
is taken equal to the double bottom height minus the well height.
(d) In the case where bottom damage simultaneously involves four center tanks, the value of
O
s
may be calculated according to formula III as follows:
O
s
=
1/4
(
Σ
Z

)
(e) Credit for reduced oil outflow from bottom damage may be applied to formula III for an installed emergency high suction cargo transfer system that:
(1) transfers within two hours oil equal to one half of the volume of the largest tank involved;
(2) has sufficient ballast or cargo tankage available to receive the transferred oil; and
(3) has the high suction piping installed at a height not less than the vertical extent of bottom damage (
v
s
).
4.
Allowable volumes of cargo tanks.
(a) The allowable volume of a wing cargo tank (VOL
w
) is equal to seventy-five percent of
O
A
. In a segregated ballast tank vessel VOL
w
may equal
O
A
for a wing cargo oil tank located between two segregated ballast tanks each of length greater than
l
c
and width greater than
t
c
.
(b) The allowable volume of a center cargo tank (VOL
c
) is 50,000 cubic meters.
5.
Allowable length of cargo tanks.
The length of each cargo tank (
1
a) must not exceed 10 meters or the distance calculated from (a), (b), or (c), as appropriate, whichever is greater:
(a) Where no longitudinal bulkhead is provided inside the cargo tanks:
1
a=[0.5(bi/B) + 0.1] L, but not to exceed 0.2L.
(b) Where a centerline longitudinal bulkhead is provided inside the cargo tanks:
1
a=[0.25(bi/B) + 0.15] L, but not to exceed 0.2L.
(c) Where two or more longitudinal bulkheads are provided inside the cargo tanks:
(1) For wing cargo tanks:
1
a = 0.2L.
(2) For center cargo tanks:
(i) If (bi/B) is equal to or greater than 0.2,
1
a = 0.2L.
(ii) If (bi/B) is less than 0.2:
(A) Where no centerline longitudinal bulkhead is provided,
1
a = [0.5(bi/B) + 0.1] L.
(B) Where a centerline longitudinal bulkhead is provided,
1
a = [0.25(bi/B) + 0.15] L.
(d) “bi” is the minimum distance from the ship's side to the outer longitudinal bulkhead of the tank in question, measured inboard at right angles to the centerline at the level corresponding to the assigned summer freeboard.

# Appendix B to Part 157—Subdivision and Stability Assumptions
1.
Source.
The procedures for the loading assumption calculations contained in this Appendix conform to Regulation 28 of Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution from Ships, 1973, done at London, November 2, 1973.
2.
Loading Assumptions.
For the purpose of calculating subdivision and damage stability for a tank vessel, the operating drafts must reflect actual partial or full load conditions consistent with trim and strength of the vessel. Ballast conditions need not be considered if the tank vessel is not carrying oil in cargo tanks excluding oily residues. Loading condition must reflect the specific gravities of the cargo.
3.
Damage Assumptions.
(a) Damage is applied to all conceivable locations along the length of the vessel as follows:
(1) For a vessel of more than 225 meters in length, anywhere in the vessel's length.
(2) For a vessel of more than 150 meters, but not exceeding 225 meters in length, anywhere in the vessel's length except where the after or forward bulkhead bounding a machinery space located aft is involved in the damage assumption. The machinery space is calculated as a single floodable compartment.
(3) For a vessel 150 meters or less in length, anywhere in the vessel's length between adjacent transverse bulkheads except the machinery space.
(b) The extent and the character of the assumed side or bottom damage, as defined in section 2 of Appendix A of this part, must be applied except longitudinal bottom damage within 0.3L from the forward perpendicular must be assumed to be the same as that for side damage. If any damage of lesser extent results in a more severe condition, such damage must be assumed.
(c) If damage involves transverse bulkheads as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, transverse watertight bulkheads must be spaced at least at a distance equal to the longitudinal extent of the assumed damage specified in paragraph (b) of this section in order to be considered effective. Where transverse bulkheads are spaced at a lesser distance, one or more of these bulkheads within such extent of damage must be assumed as nonexistent for the purpose of determining flooded compartments.
(d) If the damages between adjacent transverse watertight bulkheads is within the definition contained in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, no main transverse bulkhead or a transverse bulkhead bounding side tanks or double bottom tanks is to be assumed damaged, unless:
(1) the spacing of the adjacent bulkheads is less than the longitudinal extent of assumed damage defined in paragraph (b) of this section; or
(2) there is a step or a recess in a transverse bulkhead of more than 3.05 meters in length, located within the extent of penetrations of assumed damage. The step formed by the after peak bulkhead and after peak tank top is not regarded as a step for these calculations.
(e) If pipes, ducts, or tunnels are situated within the assumed extent of damage, there must be arrangements so that progressive flooding may not thereby extend to compartments other than those assumed to be floodable for each case of damage.
(f) For oil tankers of 20,000 DWT and above, the damage assumptions must be supplemented by the following assumed bottom raking damage:
(1) Longitudinal extent:
(i) For ships of 75,000 DWT and above, 0.6L measured from the forward perpendicular.
(ii) For ships of less than 75,000 DWT, 0.4L measured from the forward perpendicular.
(2) Transverse extent: B/3 anywhere in the bottom.
(3) Vertical extent: Breach of the outer hull.
4.
Characteristic and Condition Assumption for Calculations.
(a) Account must be taken of any empty or partially filled tanks, the specific gravity of cargoes carried, and any outflow of liquids from damaged compartments.
(b) The permeabilities are assumed as follows:
Intended space use
Permeability
Stores
0.60
Accommodation
0.95
Machinery
0.85
Voids
0.95
Consumable liquids
1
0 or 0.95
Other liquids
2
10 or 0.95
1
Whichever results in the more severe requirements.
2
The permeability of partially filled compartments must be consistent with actual density and the amount of liquid carried.
(c) The buoyancy of any superstructure directly above the side damage is to be disregarded. The unflooded parts of superstructures beyond the extent of damage may be taken into consideration if they are separated from the damaged space by watertight bulkheads and no progressive flooding of these intact spaces takes place. Class I doors are allowed in watertight bulkheads in the superstructure.
(d) The free surface effect is to be calculated:
(1) at an angle of heel of 5 degrees for each individual compartment; or
(2) by assessing the shift of liquids by moment of transference calculations.
(e) In calculating the effect of free surfaces of consumable liquids, it is to be assumed that, for each type of liquid, at least one transverse pair or a single centerline tank has a free surface and the tank or combination of tanks to be taken into account is to be those where the effect of free surface is the greatest.

PA
s
= J[L
t
(B + 2D)]
Where:
PA
c
= the side shell area in square meters based on projected molded dimensions for each segregated ballast tank, void, or other space that does not carry cargo and which complies with paragraph 2(b) of this appendix;
PA
s
= the bottom shell area in square meters based on projected molded dimensions for each segregated ballast tank, void, or other space that does not carry cargo and which complies with paragraph 2(b) of this appendix;
L
t
= the length in meters between the forward and after extremities of the cargo tanks;
B = the maximum breadth of the ship in meters measured amidship to the molded line of the frame; and
D = the molded depth in meters measured vertically from the top of the keel plate to the top of the freeboard deck beam at the side amidships. In tank vessels having rounded gunwales, the molded depth is measured from the top of the keel plate to the point of intersection of the molded lines of the deck and side shell plating, the lines being extended as though the gunwale were of angular design.
(a)
Method of determining a value for J.
(1) For tank vessels for 20,000 DWT, J = 0.45.
(2) For tank vessels of 200,000 DWT or more:
(i) J = 0.30; or
(ii) J = the greater of 0.20, or

where:
a = 0.25 for tank vessels of 200,000 DWT.
a = 0.40 for tank vessels of 300,000 DWT.
a = 0.50 for tank vessels of 420,000 DWT.
For values of DWT between 200,000 and 300,000 DWT, 300,000 and 420,000 DWT, and greater than 420,000 DWT, the value of “a” is determined by linear interpolation.

Criteria for determining the segregated ballast tanks, voids, and other spaces that do not carry cargo.
The following criteria are to be met for a segregated ballast tank, void, or space that does not carry cargo, to be used in determining PA
c
and PA
s
:
(1) The minimum width of each wing tank or space, either of which extends for the full depth of the vessel's side or from the main deck to the top of the double bottoms is 2 meters or more. The width is measured inboard from the vessel's side shell plating at right angles to the vessel's center line. If a wing tank or space has a width anywhere within it that is less than 2 meters, that wing tank or space is not used when calculating PA
c
.
(2) The minimum vertical depth of each double bottom tank or space is B/15 or 2 meters, whichever is smaller. If a double bottom tank or space has a depth less than B/15 or 2 meters, whichever is smaller, anywhere within it, the double bottom or space is not to be used when calculating PA

(3) The minimum width of a wing tank or space is not measured in the way of—
(i) the turn of the bilge area; or
(ii) a rounded gunwale area.
(4) The minimum depth of a double bottom tank or space is not measured in the way of the turn of the bilge area.

# Appendix E to Part 157—Specifications for the Design, Installation and Operation of a Part Flow System for Control of Overboard Discharges
Source.
Appendix 2 to Annex 5 of IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee document MEPC/Circ. 97. Paragraphs 1 and 2 are printed for information. Paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 are incorporated into §§ 157.11 and 157.37.

# Note:
Information in square brackets on Figure 1 has been added by the Coast Guard for clarity.

# 1
Purpose
The purpose of these Specifications is to provide specific design criteria and installation and operational requirements for the part flow system referred to in Regulation 18(6)(e) of Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto.

# 2
Application
2.1 Existing oil tankers may, in accordance with Regulation 18(6)(e) of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78, discharge dirty ballast water and oil contaminated water from cargo tank areas below the waterline, provided part of the flow is led through permanent piping to a readily accessible location on the upper deck or above where it may be visually observed during the discharge operation and provided that the arrangements comply with the requirements established by the Administration and which shall at least contain all the provisions of these Specifications.
2.2 The part flow concept is based on the principle that the observation of a representative part flow of the overboard effluent is equivalent to observing the entire effluent stream. These specifications provide the details of the design installation, and operation of a part flow system.

# 3
General Provisions
3.1 The part flow system shall be so fitted that it can effectively provide a representative sample of the overboard effluent for visual display under all normal operating conditions.
3.2 The part flow system is in many respects similar to the sampling system for an oil discharge monitoring and control system but shall have pumping and piping arrangements separate from such a system, or combined equivalent arrangements acceptable to the Administration.
3.3 The display of the part flow shall be arranged in a sheltered and readily accessible location on the upper deck or above, approved by the Administration (e.g. the entrance to the pump room). Regard should be given to effective communication between the location of the part flow display and the discharge control position.
3.4 Samples shall be taken from relevant sections of the overboard discharge piping and be passed to the display arrangement through a permanent piping system.
3.5 The part flow system shall include the following components:
.1 Sampling probes;
.2 Sample water piping system;
.3 Sample feed pump(s);
.4 Display arrangement;
.5 Sample discharge arrangement; and, subject to the diameter of the sample piping:
.6 Flushing arrangement.
.3.6 The part flow system shall comply with the applicable safety requirements.

# 4
System Arrangement
4.1 Sampling points.
4.1.1 Sampling point locations:
.1 Sampling points shall be so located that relevant samples can be obtained of the effluent being discharged through outlets below the waterline which are being used for operational discharges.
.2 Sampling points shall as far as practicable be located in pipe sections where a turbulent flow is normally encountered.
.3 Sampling points shall as far as practicable be arranged in accessible locations in vertical sections of the discharge piping.
4.1.2 Sampling probes:
.1 Sampling probes shall be arranged to protrude into the pipe a distance of about one fourth of the pipe diameter.
.2 Sampling probes shall be arranged for easy withdrawal for cleaning.
.3 The part flow system shall have a stop valve fitted adjacent to each probe, except that were the probe is mounted in a cargo line, two stop valves shall be fitted in series, in the sample line.
.4 Sampling probes should be of corrosion resistant and oil resistant material, of adequate strength, properly jointed and supported.
.5 Sampling probes shall have a shape that is not prone to becoming clogged by particle contaminants and should not generate high hydrodynamic pressures at the sampling probe tip. Figure 1 is an example of one suitable shape of a sampling probe.
.6 Sampling probes shall have the same nominal bore as the sample piping.
4.2 Sample piping:
.1 The sample piping shall be arranged as straight as possible between the sampling points and the display arrangement. Sharp bends and pockets where settled oil or sediment may accumulate should be avoided.
.2 The sample piping shall be so arranged that sample water is conveyed to the display arrangement within 20 seconds. The flow velocity in the piping should not be less than 2 metres per second.
.3 The diameter of the piping shall not be less than 40 millimetres if no fixed flushing arrangement is provided and shall not be less than 25 millimetres if a pressurized flushing arrangement as detailed in paragraph 4.4 is installed.
.4 The sample piping should be of corrosion-resistant and oil-resistant material, of adequate strength, properly jointed and supported.
.5 Where several sampling points are installed the piping shall be connected to a valve chest at the suction side of the sample feed pump.
4.3 Sample feed pump:
.1 The sample feed pump capacity shall be suitable to allow the flow rate of the sample water to comply with 4.2.2.
4.4 Flushing arrangement:
.1 If the diameter of sample piping is less than 40 millimetres, a fixed connexion from a pressurized sea or fresh water piping system shall be installed to enable flushing of the sample piping system.
4.5 Display arrangement:
.1 The display arrangement shall consist of a display chamber provided with a sight glass. The chamber should be of a size that will allow a free fall stream of the sample water to be clearly visible over a length of at least 200 millimetres. The Administration may approve equivalent arrangements.
.2 The display arrangement shall incorporate valves and piping in order to allow a part of the sample water to bypass the display chamber to obtain a laminar flow for display in the chamber.
.3 The display arrangement shall be designed to be easily opened and cleaned.
.4 The internal of the display chamber shall be white except for the background wall which shall be so coloured in order to facilitate the observation of any change in the quality of the sample water.
.5 The lower part of the display chamber shall be shaped as a funnel for collection of the sample water.
.6 A test cock for taking a grab sample shall be provided in order that a sample of the water can be examined independent of that in the chamber.
.7 The display arrangement shall be adequately lighted to facilitate visual observation of the sample water.
4.6 Sample discharge arrangement:
.1 The sample water leaving the display chamber shall be routed to the sea or to a slop tank through piping of adequate diameter.

# 5
Operation
5.1 When a discharge of dirty ballast water or other oil contaminated water from the cargo tank area is taking place through an outlet below the waterline, the part flow system shall provide sample water from the relevant discharge outlet at all times.
5.2 The sample water should be observed particularly during those phases of the discharge operation when the greatest possibility of oil contamination occurs. The discharge shall be stopped whenever any traces of oil are visible in the flow and when the oil content meter reading indicates oil content exceeds permissible limits.
5.3 On those systems that are fitted with flushing arrangements, the sample piping should be flushed after contamination has been observed and additionally it is recommended that the sample piping be flushed after each period of usage.
5.4 The ship's cargo and ballast handling manuals and, where applicable, those manuals required for crude oil washing systems or dedicated clean ballast tanks operation shall clearly describe the use of the part flow system in conjunction with the ballast discharge and the slop tank decanting procedures.

# Note:
Double sides and double bottoms must meet the requirements in § 157.10d(c) or (d), as appropriate. A vessel will be considered to have a single hull if it does not have double sides and a double bottom that meet the requirements in § 157.10d(c) and § 157.10d(d). To determine a tank vessel's double hull compliance date under OPA 90, use the vessel's hull configuration (
i.e.,
single hull; single hull with double sides; or single hull with double bottom) on August 18, 1990. The conversion of a single hull tank vessel to include only double sides or only a double bottom after August 18, 1990, will not result in a change of the vessel's originally scheduled phase-out date. The conversion of a single hull tank vessel to a double hull tank vessel meeting the requirements of § 157.10d complies with OPA 90.

# Subpart A—Vessel Traffic Services

# General Rules
§ 161.1
Purpose and Intent.
(a) The purpose of this part is to promulgate regulations implementing and enforcing certain sections of the 46 U.S.C. Chapter 700 “Ports and Waterways Safety setting up a national system of Vessel Traffic Services that will enhance navigation, vessel safety, and marine environmental protection, and promote safe vessel movement by reducing the potential for collisions, rammings, and groundings, and the loss of lives and property associated with these incidents within VTS areas established hereunder.
(b) Vessel Traffic Services provide the mariner with information related to the safe navigation of a waterway. This information, coupled with the mariner's compliance with the provisions set forth in this part, enhances the safe routing of vessels through congested waterways or waterways of particular hazard. Under certain circumstances, a VTS may issue directions to control the movement of vessels in order to minimize the risk of collision between vessels, or damage to property or the environment.
(c) The owner, operator, charterer, master, or person directing the movement of a vessel remains at all times responsible for the manner in which the vessel is operated and maneuvered, and is responsible for the safe navigation of the vessel under all circumstances. Compliance with these rules or with a direction of the VTS is at all times contingent upon the exigencies of safe navigation.
(d) Nothing in this part is intended to relieve any vessel, owner, operator, charterer, master, or person directing the movement of a vessel from the consequences of any neglect to comply with this part or any other applicable law or regulation (e.g., the International Regulations for Prevention of Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS) or the Inland Navigation Rules) or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.
[CGD 90-020, 59 FR 36324, July 15, 1994, as amended by USCG-2020-0304, 85 FR 58280, Sept. 18, 2020]
§ 161.2
Definitions.
For the purposes of this part:
Center
means a Vessel Traffic Center or Vessel Movement Center.
Cooperative Vessel Traffic Services (CVTS)

(3) Equipped with a required Coast Guard type-approved Automatic Identification System (AIS).
VTS User's Manual
means the manual established and distributed by the VTS to provide the mariner with a description of the services offered and rules in force for that VTS. Additionally, the manual may include chartlets showing the area and zone boundaries, general navigational information about the area, and procedures, radio frequencies,
reporting provisions and other information which may assist the mariner while in the VTS area.
[CGD 90-020, 59 FR 36324, July 15, 1994, as amended by CGE 97-023, 62 FR 33364, June 19, 1997; USCG-2003-14757, 68 FR 39364, July 1, 2003; USCG-1998-4399, 75 FR 66314, Oct. 28, 2010; USCG-2005-21869, 80 FR 5334, Jan. 30, 2015; 80 FR 17327, Apr. 1, 2015; USCG-2018-0874, 84 FR 30880, June 28, 2019]
§ 161.3
Applicability.
The provisions of this subpart shall apply to each VTS User and may also apply to any vessel while underway or at anchor on the navigable waters of the United States within a VTS area, to the extent the VTS considers necessary.
§ 161.4
Requirement to carry the rules.
Each VTS User shall carry on board and maintain for ready reference a copy of these rules.

# Note 1 to § 161.4:
These rules are contained in the applicable U.S. Coast Pilot, the VTS User's Manual which may be obtained by contacting the appropriate VTS or downloaded from the Coast Guard Navigation Center website (
https://www.navcen.uscg.gov

§ 161.5
Deviations from the rules.
(a) Requests to deviate from any provision in this part, either for an extended period of time or if anticipated before the start of a transit, must be submitted in writing to the appropriate District Commander. Upon receipt of the written request, the District Commander may authorize a deviation if it is determined that such a deviation provides a level of safety equivalent to that provided by the required measure or is a maneuver considered necessary for safe navigation under the circumstances. An application for an authorized deviation must state the need and fully describe the proposed alternative to the required measure.
(b) Requests to deviate from any provision in this part due to circumstances that develop during a transit or immediately preceding a transit may be made to the appropriate VTC. Requests to deviate must be made as far in advance as practicable. Upon receipt of the request, the VTC may authorize a deviation if it is determined that, based on vessel handling characteristics, traffic density, radar contacts, environmental conditions and other relevant information, such a deviation provides a level of safety equivalent to that provided by the required measure or is a maneuver considered necessary for safe navigation under the circumstances.
[CGD 90-020, 59 FR 36324, July 15, 1994, as amended by USCG-2005-21531, 70 FR 36350, June 23, 2005; USCG-2005-21869, 80 FR 5334, Jan. 30, 2015; USCG-2018-0874, 84 FR 30880, June 28, 2019]
§ 161.6
Preemption.
The regulations in this part have preemptive impact over State laws or regulations on the same subject matter. The Coast Guard has determined, after considering the factors developed by the Supreme Court in
U.S.
v.
Locke,
529 U.S. 89 (2000), that by enacting 46 U.S.C. Chapter 700 'Ports and Waterways Safety', Congress intended that Coast Guard regulations preempt State laws or regulations regarding vessel traffic services in United States ports and waterways.

Notes:
1
Maritime Mobile Service Identifier (MMSI) is a unique nine-digit number assigned that identifies ship stations, ship earth stations, coast stations, coast earth stations, and group calls for use by a digital selective calling (DSC) radio, an INMARSAT ship earth station or AIS. AIS requirements are set forth in § 161.21. The requirements set forth in §§ 161.21 and 164.46 of this subchapter apply in those areas denoted with an MMSI number, except for Louisville and Los Angeles/Long Beach.
2
In the event of a communication failure, difficulties or other safety factors, the Center may direct or permit a user to monitor and report on any other designated monitoring frequency or the bridge-to-bridge navigational frequency, 156.650 MHz (Channel 13) or 156.375 MHz (Channel 67), to the extent that doing so provides a level of safety beyond that provided by other means. The bridge-to-bridge navigational frequency, 156.650 MHz (Ch. 13) is used in certain monitoring areas where the level of reporting does not warrant a designated frequency.
3
All geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) are expressed in North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).
4
Some monitoring areas extend beyond navigable waters. Although not required, users are strongly encouraged to maintain a listening watch on the designated monitoring frequency in these areas. Otherwise, they are required to maintain watch as stated in 47 CFR 80.148.
5
In addition to the vessels denoted in § 161.16, requirements set forth in subpart B of this part also apply to any vessel transiting VMRS Buzzards Bay required to carry a bridge-to-bridge radiotelephone by part 26 of this chapter.
6
Until otherwise directed, full VTS services will not be available in the Calcasieu Channel, Calcasieu River Channel, and the ICW from MM 260 to MM 191. Vessels may contact Port Arthur Traffic on the designated VTS frequency to request advisories, but are not required to monitor the VTS frequency in this zone.
7
A Cooperative Vessel Traffic Service was established by the United States and Canada within adjoining waters. The appropriate Center administers the rules issued by both nations; however, enforces only its own set of rules within its jurisdiction. Note: the bridge-to-bridge navigational frequency, 156.650 MHz (Ch. 13), is not so designated in Canadian waters, therefore users are encouraged and permitted to make passing arrangements on the designated monitoring frequencies.
(d) As soon as is practicable, a VTS User shall notify the VTS of any of the following:
(1) A marine casualty as defined in 46 CFR 4.05-1;
(2) Involvement in the ramming of a fixed or floating object;
(3) A pollution incident as defined in § 151.15 of this chapter;
(4) A defect or discrepancy in an aid to navigation;
(5) A hazardous condition as defined in § 160.202 of this chapter;
(6) Improper operation of vessel equipment required by part 164 of this chapter;
(7) A situation involving hazardous materials for which a report is required by 49 CFR 176.48; and
(8) A hazardous vessel operating condition as defined in § 161.2.

§ 161.13
VTS Special Area operating requirements.
The following operating requirements apply within a VTS Special Area:
(a) A VTS User shall, if towing astern, do so with as short a hawser as safety and good seamanship permits.
(b) A VMRS User shall: (1) Not enter or get underway in the area without prior approval of the VTS;
(2) Not enter a VTS Special Area if a hazardous vessel operating condition or circumstance exists;
(3) Not meet, cross, or overtake any other VMRS User in the area without prior approval of the VTS; and
(4) Before meeting, crossing, or overtaking any other VMRS User in the area, communicate on the designated vessel bridge-to-bridge radiotelephone frequency, intended navigation movements, and any other information necessary in order to make safe passing arrangements. This requirement does not relieve a vessel of any duty prescribed by the International Regulations for Prevention of Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS) or the Inland Navigation Rules.

# Subpart B—Vessel Movement Reporting System
§ 161.15
Purpose and intent.
(a) A Vessel Movement Reporting System (VMRS) is a system used to monitor and track vessel movements within a VTS or VMRS area. This is accomplished by requiring that vessels provide information under established procedures as set forth in this part, or as directed by the Center.
(b) To avoid imposing an undue reporting burden or unduly congesting radiotelephone frequencies, reports shall be limited to information which is essential to achieve the objectives of the VMRS. These reports are consolidated into three reports (sailing plan, position, and final).
[CGD 90-020, 59 FR 36324, July 15, 1994, as amended by USCG-2003-14757, 68 FR 39366, July 1, 2003; USCG-2011-0257, 76 FR 31838, June 2, 2011]

(a)
Applicability.
The regulations in this section are applicable to that part of the inland waterway from Delaware River to Chesapeake Bay, Del. and Md., between Reedy Point, Delaware River, and Old Town Point Wharf, Elk River.
(b)
Speed.
No vessel in the waterway shall be raced or crowded alongside another vessel. Vessels of all types, including pleasure craft, are required to travel at all times at a safe speed throughout the canal and its approaches so as to avoid damage by suction or wave wash to wharves, landings, riprap protection, or other boats, or injury to persons. Pilots and vessel operators transiting the canal and its approaches are warned that violation of this rule may result in having their privilege to transit the canal suspended. Passages of vessels through the canal will be monitored and specific cases will be investigated where damage by suction or wave wash does occur. Owners and operators of yachts, motorboats, rowboats and other craft are cautioned that large deep draft ocean-going vessels and other large commercial vessels ply the canal, and such owners and operators should be
particularly careful to moor or anchor well away from the main ship channels, with moorings and lines which are sufficient and proper.

Large vessels or tows must not overtake and attempt to pass other large vessels or tows in the waterway. All small pleasure craft shall relinquish the right-of-way to deeper draft vessels, which have a limited maneuvering ability due to their draft and size.
(d)
Stopping in waterway.
Vessels will not be permitted to stop or anchor in the ship channel.
(e)
Water skiing.
Water skiing in the waterway is prohibited between Reedy Point and Welch Point.
(f)
Sailboats.

§ 162.65
All waterways tributary to the Atlantic Ocean south of Chesapeake Bay and all waterways tributary to the Gulf of America east and south of St. Marks, Fla.
(a)
Description.
This section applies to the following:
(1)
Waterways.
All navigable waters of the United States, natural or artificial, including bays, lakes, sounds, rivers, creeks, intracoastal waterways, as well as canals and channels of all types, which are tributary to or connected by other waterways with the Atlantic Ocean south of Chesapeake Bay or with the Gulf of America east and south of St. Marks, Florida.
(2)
United States property.
All river and harbor lands owned by the United States in or along the waterways described in paragraph (a)(1) of this paragraph, including lock sites and all structures thereon, other sites for Government structures and for the accommodation and use of employees of the United States, and rights of way and spoil disposal areas to the extent of Federal interest therein.
(3)
Vessels and rafts.
The term “vessel” as used in this section includes all floating things moved over these waterways other than rafts.
(b)
Waterways—(
1)
Fairway.
A clear channel shall at all times be left open to permit free and unobstructed navigation by all types of vessels and rafts that normally use the various waterways or sections thereof. The District Commander may specify the width of the fairway required in the various waterways under his charge.
(2)
Stoppage in waterway, anchorage or mooring.
(i) No vessels or rafts shall anchor or moor in any of the land cuts or other narrow parts of the waterway, except in case of an emergency. Whenever it becomes necessary for a vessel or raft to stop in any such portions of the waterway it shall be securely fastened to one bank and as close to the bank as possible. This shall be done only at such a place and under such conditions as will not obstruct or prevent the passage of other vessels or craft. Stoppages shall be only for such periods as may be necessary.
(ii) No vessel or raft will be allowed to use any portion of the fairway as a mooring place except temporarily as authorized above without the written permission from the District Commander.
(iii) When tied up, all vessels must be moored by bow and stern lines. Rafts and tows shall be secured at sufficiently close intervals to insure their not being drawn away from the bank by winds, currents or the suction of passing vessels. Tow lines shall be shortened so that the different parts of the tow shall be as close together as possible. In narrow sections, no vessel or raft shall be tied abreast of another.
(iv) Lights shall be displayed in accordance with provisions of the Navigation Rules (33 CFR Subchapter E).
(v) No vessel, even if fastened to the bank as prescribed in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, shall be left without a sufficient crew to care for it properly.
(vi) Vessels will not be permitted to load or unload in any of the land cuts except as a regular established landing or wharf without written permission secured in advance from the District Commander.
(vii) No vessel, regardless of size, shall anchor in a dredged channel or narrow portion of a waterway for the
purpose of fishing, if navigation is obstructed, thereby.
(viii) Except in cases of emergency the dropping of anchors, weights, or other ground tackle, within areas occupied by submarine cable or pipe crossings, is prohibited. Such crossings will ordinarily be marked by signboards on each bank of the shore or indicated on coast charts.
(3)
Speed.
(i) Vessels shall proceed at a speed which will not endanger other vessels or structures and will not interfere with any work in progress incident to maintaining, improving, surveying or marking the channel.
(ii) Official signs indicating limiting speeds through critical portions of the waterways shall be strictly obeyed.
(iii) Vessels approaching and passing through a bridge shall so govern their speed as to insure passage through the bridge without damage to the bridge or its fenders.
(4)
Assembly and handling of tows.
(i) All vessels drawing tows and equipped with rudders shall use two tow lines or a bridle and shorten them to the greatest possible extent so as to have full control at all times. The various parts of a tow shall be securely assembled with the individual units connected by lines as short as practicable. If necessary, as in the case of lengthy or cumbersome tows or tows in restricted channels, the District Commander may require that tows be broken up and may require the installation of a rudder, drag or other approved steering device on the tow in order to avoid obstructing navigation or damaging the property of others, including aids to navigation maintained by the United States or under its authorization, by collision or otherwise.
(ii) No tow shall be drawn by a vessel that has insufficient power or crew to permit ready maneuverability and safe handling.
(iii) Tows desiring to pass a bridge shall approach the opening along the axis of the channel so as to pass through without danger of striking the bridge or its fenders. No vessel or tow shall navigate through a drawbridge until the movable span is fully opened.
(iv) In the event that it is evident to the master of a towing vessel that a tow cannot be safely handled through a bridge, it will be brought to anchor and the towed vessels will be taken through the bridge in small units, or singly if necessary, or the tow will wait until navigation conditions have improved to such an extent that the tow can pass through the bridge without damage.
(5)
Projections from vessels.
No vessel carrying a deck load which overhangs or projects over the side of said vessel, or whose rigging projects over the side of the vessel so as to endanger passing vessels, wharves or other property, will enter or pass through any of the narrow parts of the waterway.
(6)
Meeting and passing.
Vessels, on meeting or overtaking, shall give the proper signals and pass in accordance with the Navigation Rules (33 CFR Subchapter E). Rafts shall give to vessels the side demanded by proper signal. All vessels approaching dredges or other plant engaged on improvements to a waterway, shall give the signal for passing and slow down sufficiently to stop if so ordered or if no answering signal is received. On receiving the answering signal, they shall then proceed to pass at a speed sufficiently slow to insure safe navigation.

(1)
Waterways.
All navigable waters of the U.S. tributary to or connected by other waterways with the Gulf of America between St. Marks, Fla., and the Rio Grande, Tex. (both inclusive), and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway; except the Mississippi River, its tributaries, South and Southwest Passes, and the Atchafalaya River above its junction with the Morgan City-Port Allen Route.
(2)
Bridges, wharves, and other structures.
All bridges, wharves, and other structures in or over these waterways.
(3)
Vessels.
The term “vessels” as used in this section includes all floating craft other than rafts.
(b) Waterways:
(1) A clear channel shall at all times be left open to permit free and unobstructed navigation by all types of vessels and tows normally using the various waterways covered by the regulations of this section
(2) Fairway: The District Commander may specify the width of the fairway required in the various waterways under his charge.
(3) Anchoring or mooring:
(i) Vessels or tows shall not anchor or moor in any of the land cuts or other narrow parts of the waterway, except in an emergency, or with permission of the District Commander. Whenever it becomes necessary for a vessel or tow to stop in any such portions of the waterway, it shall be securely fastened to one bank and as close to the bank as possible. This shall be done only at such a place and under such conditions as will not obstruct or prevent the passage of other vessels or tows. Stoppages shall be only for such periods as may be necessary.
(ii) When tied up individually, all vessels and tows shall be moored by bow and stern lines. Tows shall be secured at sufficiently frequent intervals to insure their not being drawn away form the bank by winds, currents, or the suction of passing vessels. Lines shall be shortened so that the various barges in a tow will be as close together as possible.
(iii) Lights shall be displayed in accordance with provisions of the Inland Navigation Rules (33 CFR Subchapter E).
(iv) Whenever any vessel or tow is moored to the bank (paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section) at least one crew member shall always remain on board to see that proper signals are displayed and that the vessel or tow is properly moored at all times.
(v) No vessel, regardless of size, shall anchor in a dredged channel or narrow portion of a waterway for the purpose of fishing if navigation is obstructed thereby.
(4) Speed: Speeding in narrow sections is prohibited. Official signs indicating limited speeds shall be obeyed. Vessels shall reduce speed sufficiently to prevent damage when passing other vessels or structures in or along the waterway.
(5) Size, assembly, and handling of tows:
(i) On waterways 150 feet wide or less, tows which are longer than 1,180 feet, including the towing vessel, but excluding the length of the hawser, or wider than one-half of the bottom width of the channel or 55 feet, whichever is less will not be allowed, except when the District Commander has given special permission or the waterway has been exempted from these restrictions by the District Commander. Before entering any narrow section of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, tows in excess of one-half the channel width, or 55 feet, will be required to stand by until tows which are less than one-half the channel width or 55 feet wide have cleared the channel. When passing is necessary in narrow channels, overwidth tows shall yield to the maximum. Separate permission must be received from the District Commander for each overlength or overwidth movement. In addition, the following exceptions are allowed:
(ii) Gulf Intracoastal Waterway—Between mile 6.2 EHL (Inner Harbor Navigation Canal Lock) and mile 33.6 EHL tows of 78 feet in width will be allowed.
(iii) Gulf Intercoastal Waterway—Between mile 33.6 EHL and the Mobile Bay Ship Channel, tows of 108 feet in width will be allowed if under 750 feet in length including the towboat but excluding the length of the hawser.
(iv) Gulf Intracoastal Waterway—Mobile Bay Ship Channel to St. Marks, Fla., for tows made up of empty barges on the off or shallow side, a width of 75 feet will be allowed.
(v) All vessels pulling tows not equipped with rudders in restricted channels and land cuts shall use two towlines, or a bridle on one towline, shortened as much as safety of the towing vessel permits, so as to have maximum control at all times. The various parts of a tow shall be securely assembled with the individual units connected by lines as short as practicable.
In open water, the towlines and fastenings between barges may be lengthened so as to accommodate the wave surge. In the case of lengthy or cumbersome tows, or tows in restricted channels, the District Commander may require that tows be broken up, and may require the installation of a rudder or other approved steering device on the tow in order to avoid obstructing navigation or damaging the property of others. Pushing barges with towing vessel astern, towing barges with towing vessel alongside, or pushing and pulling barges with units of the tow made up both ahead and astern of the towing vessel are permissible provided that adequate power is employed to keep the tows under full control at all times. No tow shall be drawn by a vessel that has insufficient power or crew to permit ready maneuverability and safe handling.
(vi) All tows navigating the Pass Manchac bridges in Louisiana are limited to no more than two barges, not to exceed a combined tow length of 400 feet (excluding the towboat). Vessel operators for tows exceeding these limits must request and receive permission from the COTP New Orleans prior to navigating the bridges. Requests should be made by telephoning the COTP at 504-365-2200 or 504-365-2545. Any decision made by the COTP is final agency action.
(6) Projections from vessels: Vessels or tows carrying a deck load which overhangs or projects over the side, or whose rigging projects over the side, so as to endanger passing vessels, wharves, or other property, shall not enter or pass through any of the narrow parts of the waterway without prior approval of the District Commander.
(7) Meeting and passing: Passing vessels shall give the proper signals and pass in accordance with the Inland Navigation Rules (33 CFR Subchapter E), where applicable. At certain intersections where strong currents may be encountered, sailing directions may be issued through navigation bulletins or signs posted on each side of the intersections.

§ 162.100
Ohio River at Louisville, KY.
(a)
Emergency Mooring Buoys.
The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers has established four pairs of emergency mooring bouys. Each buoy is 10 feet in diameter with retro-reflective sides. The two buoys which comprise each pair are 585 feet apart and are located approximately at:
(1) Indiana Bank—Mile 582.3 (near 18 Mile Island);
(2) Six Mile Island—Mile 597.5;
(3) Six Mile Island—Mile 598.2; and
(4) Kentucky Bank—Mile 599.8 (Cox's Park).

# Note:
All buoys, except those at Six Mile Island—Mile 598.2, are removed between May 1 and September 30. Due to the close proximity of the municipal water intakes, mooring of tank vessels laden with petroleum products or hazardous materials is not authorized on the Kentucky Bank, Mile 599.8 (Cox's Park).
(b)
The regulations.

§ 162.205
Suisun Bay, San Joaquin River, Sacramento River, and connecting waters, CA.
(a)
San Joaquin River Deep Water Channel between Suisun Bay and the easterly end of the channel at Stockton; use, administration and navigation
—(1)
Maximum speed.
The maximum speed for all ocean-going craft shall not exceed 10 miles per hour above the lower end of New York Slough, seven miles per hour above Criminal Point, or five miles per hour while passing any wharf, dock, or moored craft. As used in this paragraph, the speed of a vessel when navigating with the current shall be its rate of movement in excess of the velocity of the current.
(2)
Passing.
All craft passing other boats, barges, scows, etc., in motion, moored or anchored, shall slow down and take every necessary precaution to avoid damage.
(3)
Right of way.
(i) United States dredges, tugs, launches, derrick boats, and similar plant of contractors executing river and harbor improvement work for the United States, and displaying the signals prescribed by the regulations contained in part 83 of this chapter shall have the right of way and other craft shall exercise special caution to avoid interference with the work on which the plant is engaged. Dredges, whether Federal or contractors' plant, working the channel must however, take special care to give ocean-going vessels sufficient room for passing, and must lift both spuds and the ladder, and pull clear, if an adequate width of clear channelway cannot otherwise be provided. Ocean-going vessels may show at the masthead a black ball not more than 20 inches in diameter as a signal to the dredge, and may also blow five long blasts of the whistle when within reasonable hearing distance of the dredge, such signal to be followed at the proper time by the passing signal described in the local pilot rules. The dredge shall promptly acknowledge both signals in the usual manner.
(ii) Light-draft vessels when meeting or being overtaken by ocean-going vessels, shall give the right of way to such vessels by making use of the shallower portions of the waterway.
(iii) Rafts and tows must promptly give the channel side demanded upon proper signal by a vessel, and must be handled in such a manner as not to obstruct or interfere with the free use of the waterway by other craft.
(4)
Collisions.
(i) Ocean-going vessels in collision in the channel or turning basin must, if still afloat and in a condition making anchorage necessary, be immediately removed to an approved anchorage ground, or if in such condition that beaching is necessary, they shall be temporarily beached on the northwest side of Mandeville Island or in the Old River.
(ii) Light-draft vessels suffering collision shall be disposed of as directed by the District Commander or his authorized representative.
(5)
Wrecks.
In no case following accidents of fire or collision will a vessel be allowed to remain either anchored or grounded in the channel, or beached at any place where it endangers other vessels, while settlement is pending with the underwriters.
(6)
Other laws and regulations.
In all other respects, the existing Federal laws and rules and regulations affecting navigable waters of the United States will govern in this channel.
(b)
Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel between Suisun Bay and easterly end of Turning Basin at West Sacramento; use, administration, and navigation
—(1)
Maximum speed for all ocean going craft
—(i)
Between Tolands Landing (Mile 6.2) and Rio Vista Bridge.
When going against a current of two knots or more, the maximum speed over the bottom shall not exceed 8 knots. When going with the current, in slack water, or against a current of two knots or less, the maximum speed through the water shall not exceed 10 knots.
(ii)
Between Rio Vista Bridge and Port of Sacramento.
When going against a current of two knots or more, the maximum speed over the bottom shall not exceed 5 knots. When going with the current, in slack water, or against a current of two knots or less, the maximum speed through the water shall not exceed 7 knots.
(iii)
Speed past docks or moored craft.
Within 550 feet of the centerline of the
channel the speed shall be the minimum required to maintain steerageway; wind, tide, current, etc., being taken into consideration.
(iv)
Passing.
All craft passing other boats, barges, scows, etc., underway, moored or anchored, shall take every necessary precaution to avoid damage.
(v)
Speed, high-water precautions.
When passing another vessel (underway, anchored, or tied up); a wharf or other structure; work under construction; plant engaged in river and harbor improvement; levees withstanding flood waters; buildings partially or wholly submerged by high water; or any other structure liable to damage by collision, suction or wave action; vessels shall give as much leeway as circumstances permit and reduce their speed sufficiently to preclude causing damage to the vessel or structure being passed. As deemed necessary for public safety during high river stages, floods, or other emergencies, the District Commander may prescribe, by navigation bulletins or other means, the limiting speed in knots or temporarily close the waterway or any reach of it to traffic. Since this subparagraph pertains directly to the manner in which vessels are operated, masters of vessels shall be held responsible for strict observance and full compliance herewith.
(2)
Right of way.
(i) Dredges, tugs, launches, derrick boats and other similar equipment, executing river and harbor improvement work for the United States, and displaying the signals prescribed by the regulations contained in part 83 of this chapter, shall have the right-of-way and other craft shall exercise special caution to avoid interference with the work on which the plant is engaged. Dredges, whether Federal or contractor's plant, working the channel must however, take special care to give ocean-going vessels sufficient room for passing, and must lift both spuds and the ladder, and pull clear, if an adequate width of clear channelway cannot otherwise be provided.
(ii) Vessels intending to pass dredges or other types of floating plant working in navigable channels, when within a reasonable distance therefrom and not in any case over a mile, shall indicate such intention by one long blast of the whistle, and shall be directed to the proper side for passage by the sounding, by the dredge or other floating plant, of the signal prescribed in the inland pilot rules for vessels underway and approaching each other from opposite directions, which shall be answered in the usual manner by the approaching vessel. If the channel is not clear, the floating plant shall sound the alarm or danger signal and the approaching vessel shall slow down or stop and await further signal from the plant.
(iii) When the pipeline from a dredge crosses the channel in such a way that an approaching vessel cannot pass safely around the pipeline or dredge, there shall be sounded immediately from the dredge the alarm or danger signal and the approaching vessel shall slow down or stop and await further signal from the dredge. The pipeline shall then be opened and the channel cleared as soon as practicable; when the channel is clear for passage the dredge shall so indicate by sounding the usual passing signal as prescribed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The approaching vessel shall answer with a corresponding signal and pass promptly.
(iv) When any pipeline or swinging dredge shall have given an approaching vessel or tow the signal that the channel is clear, the dredge shall straighten out within the cut for the passage of the vessel or tow.
(v) Shallow draft vessels when meeting or being overtaken by ocean-going vessels, shall give the right-of-way to such vessels by making use of the shallower portions of the waterway, wherever possible.
(vi) Tows should promptly give the channel side requested by proper signal from a vessel, and should be handled in such a manner as not to obstruct or interfere with the free use of the waterway by other craft.
(3)
Obstruction of traffic.
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section no person shall willfully or carelessly obstruct the free navigation of the waterway, or delay any vessel having the right to use the waterway.
(ii) No vessel shall anchor within the channel except in distress or under stress of weather. Any vessel so anchored shall be moved as quickly as
possible to such anchorage as will leave the channel clear for the passage of vessels.
(iii) Motorboats, sailboats, rowboats, and other small craft shall not anchor or drift in the regular ship channel except under stress of weather or in case of breakdown. Such craft shall be so operated that they will not interfere with or endanger the movement of commercial or public vessels.
(4)
Collisions.
(i) Ocean-going vessels in collision in the channel or turning basin, must if still afloat and in a condition making anchorage necessary, be immediately removed to an approved anchorage ground, or if in such condition that beaching is necessary, they shall be temporarily beached on the southwest side of Ryer Island from Mile 15.0 to Mile 16.3 or in the Harbor and Turning Basin at West Sacramento.
(ii) Light-draft vessels suffering collision shall be disposed of as directed by the District Commander or his authorized representative.
(5)
Marine accidents.
Masters, mates, pilots, owners, or other persons using the waterway to which this paragraph applies shall notify the District Commander and in the case of undocumented vessels, the State Division of Small Craft Harbors also, by the most expeditious means available of all marine accidents, such as fire, collision, sinking or stranding, where there is possible obstruction of the channel or interference with navigation or where damage to Government property is involved, furnishing a clear statement as to the name, address, and ownership of the vessel or vessels involved, the time and place, and the action taken. In all cases, the owner of the sunken vessel shall take immediate steps to mark the wreck properly.
(6)
Other laws and regulations.
In all other respects, existing Federal laws and rules and regulations affecting navigable waters of the United States will govern in this channel.

§ 164.11
Navigation under way: General.
The owner, master, or person in charge of each vessel underway shall ensure that:
(a) The wheelhouse is constantly manned by persons who:
(1) Direct and control the movement of the vessel; and
(2) Fix the vessel's position;
(b) Each person performing a duty described in paragraph (a) of this section is competent to perform that duty;
(c) The position of the vessel at each fix is plotted on a chart of the area and the person directing the movement of the vessel is informed of the vessel's position;
(d) Electronic and other navigational equipment, external fixed aids to navigation, geographic reference points, and hydrographic contours are used when fixing the vessel's position;
(e) Buoys alone are not used to fix the vessel's position;

# Note:
Buoys are aids to navigation placed in approximate positions to alert the mariner to hazards to navigation or to indicate the orientation of a channel. Buoys may not maintain an exact position because strong or varying currents, heavy seas, ice, and collisions with vessels can move or sink them or set them adrift. Although buoys may corroborate a position fixed by other means, buoys cannot be used to fix a position: however, if no other aids are available, buoys alone may be used to establish an estimated position.
(f) The danger of each closing visual or each closing radar contact is evaluated and the person directing the movement of the vessel knows the evaluation;
(g) Rudder orders are executed as given;
(h) Engine speed and direction orders are executed as given;
(i) Magnetic variation and deviation and gyrocompass errors are known and correctly applied by the person directing the movement of the vessel;
(j) A person whom he has determined is competent to steer the vessel is in the wheelhouse at all times;

See also 46 U.S.C. 8702(d), which requires an able seaman at the wheel on U.S. vessels of 100 gross tons or more in narrow or crowded waters during low visibility.
(k) If a pilot other than a member of the vessel's crew is employed, the pilot is informed of the draft, maneuvering characteristics, and peculiarities of the vessel and of any abnormal circumstances on the vessel that may affect its safe navigation.
(l) Current velocity and direction for the area to be transited are known by the person directing the movement of the vessel;
(m) Predicted set and drift are known by the person directing movement of the vessel;
(n) Tidal state for the area to be transited is known by the person directing movement of the vessel;
(o) The vessel's anchors are ready for letting go;
(p) The person directing the movement of the vessel sets the vessel's speed with consideration for:
(1) The prevailing visibility and weather conditions;
(2) The proximity of the vessel to fixed shore and marine structures;
(3) The tendency of the vessel underway to squat and suffer impairment of maneuverability when there is small underkeel clearance;
(4) The comparative proportions of the vessel and the channel;
(5) The density of marine traffic;
(6) The damage that might be caused by the vessel's wake;
(7) The strength and direction of the current; and
(8) Any local vessel speed limit;
(q) The tests required by § 164.25 are made and recorded in the vessel's log; and
(r) The equipment required by this part is maintained in operable condition.
(s) Upon entering U.S. waters, the steering wheel or lever on the navigating bridge is operated to determine if the steering equipment is operating properly under manual control, unless the vessel has been steered under manual control from the navigating bridge within the preceding 2 hours, except when operating on the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters.
(t) At least two of the steering-gear power units on the vessel are in operation when such units are capable of simultaneous operation, except when the vessel is sailing on the Great Lakes and their connecting and tributary waters, and except as required by paragraph (u) of this section.
(u) On each passenger vessel meeting the requirements of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960 (SOLAS 60) and on each cargo vessel meeting the requirements of SOLAS 74 as amended in 1981, the number of steering-gear power units necessary to move the rudder from 35° on either side to 30° on the other in not more than 28 seconds must be in simultaneous operation.

§ 164.13
Navigation underway: tankers.
(a) As used in this section, “tanker” means a self-propelled tank vessel, including integrated tug barge combinations, constructed or adapted primarily to carry oil or hazardous material in bulk in the cargo spaces and inspected and certificated as a tanker.
(b) Each tanker must have an engineering watch capable of monitoring the propulsion system, communicating with the bridge, and implementing manual control measures immediately when necessary. The watch must be physically present in the machinery spaces or in the main control space and must consist of at least an engineer with an appropriately endorsed license or merchant mariner credential.
(c) Each tanker must navigate with at least two deck officers with an appropriately endorsed license or merchant mariner credential on watch on the bridge, one of whom may be a pilot. In waters where a pilot is required, the second officer, must be an individual holding an appropriately endorsed license or merchant mariner credential and assigned to the vessel as master, mate, or officer in charge of a navigational watch, who is separate and distinct from the pilot.
(d) This paragraph (d) has preemptive effect over State or local regulation within the same field. A tanker may navigate using a heading or track control system only if:
(1) The tanker is at least one-half nautical mile (1,012 yards) beyond the territorial sea baseline, as defined in 33 CFR 2.20;
(i) Not within waters specified in 33 CFR part 110 (anchorages), or;
(ii) Not within waters specified as precautionary areas in 33 CFR part 167, and;
(2) There is a person, competent to steer the vessel, present to assume manual control of the steering station at all times including, but not limited to, the conditions listed in 46 CFR 35.20-45(a) through (c); and
(3) The system meets the heading or track control specifications of either IEC 62065 (2002-03) or IEC 62065 (2014-02) (incorporated by reference, see § 164.03).

# Appendix A to § 164.38—Performance Standards For Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA)

# 1 Introduction
1.1 The Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA) should, in order to improve the standard of collision avoidance at sea:
.1 Reduce the work-load of observers by enabling them to automatically obtain information so that they can perform as well with multiple targets as they can by manually plotting a single target; and
.2 Provide continuous, accurate and rapid situation evaluation.
1.2 In addition to the General Requirements for Electronic Navigational Aids ([IMO] Res. A.281(VII)), the ARPA should comply with the following minimum performance standards.

# 2 Definitions
2.1 Definitions of terms in these performance standards are given in Annex 1.

# 3 Performance Standards
3.1
Detection
3.1.1 Where a separate facility is provided for detection of targets, other than by the radar observer, it should have a performance not inferior to that which could be obtained by the use of the radar display.
3.2
Acquisition
3.2.1 Target acquisition may be manual or automatic. However, there should always be a facility to provide for manual acquisition and cancellation. ARPA with automatic acquisition should have a facility to suppress acquisition in certain areas. On any range scale where acquisition is suppressed over a certain area, the area of acquisition should be indicated on the display.
3.2.2 Automatic or manual acquisition should have a performance not inferior to that which could be obtained by the user of the radar display.
3.3
Tracking
3.3.1 The ARPA should be able to automatically track, process, simultaneously display and continuously update the information on at least:
.1 20 targets, if automatic acquisition is provided, whether automatically or manually acquired; or
.2 10 targets, if only manual acquisition is provided.
3.3.2 If automatic acquisition is provided, description of the criteria of selection of targets for tracking should be provided to the user. If the ARPA does not track all targets visible on the display, targets which are being tracked should be clearly indicated on the display. The reliability of tracking should not be less than that obtainable using manual recording of successive target positions obtained from the radar display.
3.3.3 Provided the target is not subject to target swop, the ARPA should continue to track an acquired target which is clearly distinguishable on the display for 5 out of 10 consecutive scans.
3.3.4 The possibility of tracking errors, including target swop, should be minimized by ARPA design. A qualitative description of the effects of error sources on the automatic tracking and corresponding errors should be provided to the user, including the effects of low signal to noise and low signal to clutter ratios caused by sea returns, rain, snow, low clouds and non-synchronous emission.
3.3.5 The ARPA should be able to display on request at least four equally time-spaced past positions of any targets being tracked over a period of at least eight minutes.
3.4
Display
3.4.1 The Display may be a separate or integral part of the ship's radar. However, the ARPA display should include all the data required to be provided by a radar display in accordance with the performance standards for navigational radar equipment adopted by the Organization.
3.4.2 The design should be such that any malfunction of ARPA parts producing information additional to information to be produced by the radar as required by the performance standards for navigational equipment adopted by IMO should not affect the integrity of the basic radar presentation.
3.4.3 The display on which ARPA information is presented should have an effective diameter of at least 340 mm.
3.4.4 The ARPA facilities should be available on at least the following range scales:
.1 12 or 16 miles;
.2 3 or 4 miles.
3.4.5 There should be a positive indication of the range scale in use.
3.4.6 The ARPA should be capable of operating with a relative motion display with “north-up” and either “head-up” or “course-up” azimuth stabilization. In addition, the ARPA may also provide for a true motion display. If true motion is provided, the operator should be able to select for his display either true or relative motion. There should be a positive indication of the display mode and orientation in use.
3.4.7 The course and speed information generated by the ARPA for acquired targets should be displayed in a vector or graphic form which clearly indicates the target's predicted motion. In this regard:
.1 ARPA presenting predicted information in vector form only should have the option of both true and relative vectors;
.2 An ARPA which is capable of presenting target course and speed information in graphic form, should also, on request, provide the target's true and/or relative vector;
.3 Vectors displayed should be either time adjustable or have a fixed time-scale;
.4 A positive indication of the time-scale of the vector in use should be given.
3.4.8 The ARPA information should not obscure radar information in such a manner as to degrade the process of detecting targets. The display of ARPA data should be under the control of the radar observer. It should be possible to cancel the display of unwanted ARPA data.
3.4.9 Means should be provided to adjust independently the brilliance of the ARPA data and radar data, including complete elimination of the ARPA data.
3.4.10 The method of presentation should ensure that the ARPA data is clearly visible in general to more than one observer in the conditions of light normally experienced on the bridge of a ship by day and by night. Screening may be provided to shade the display from sunlight but not to the extent that it will impair the observer's ability to maintain a proper lookout. Facilities to adjust the brightness should be provided.
3.4.11 Provisions should be made to obtain quickly the range and bearing of any object which appears on the ARPA display.
3.4.12 When a target appears on the radar display and, in the case of automatic acquisition, enters within the acquisition area chosen by the observer or, in the case of manual acquisition, has been acquired by the observer, the ARPA should present in a period of not more than one minute an indication of the target's motion trend and display within three minutes the target's predicted motion in accordance with paragraphs 3.4.7, 3.6, 3.8.2 and 3.8.3.
3.4.13 After changing range scales on which the ARPA facilities are available or resetting the display, full plotting information should be displayed within a period of time not exceeding four scans.
3.5
Operational Warnings
3.5.1 The ARPA should have the capability to warn the observer with a visual and/or audible signal of any distinguishable target which closes to a range or transits a zone chosen by the observer. The target causing the warning should be clearly indicated on the display.
3.5.2 The ARPA should have the capability to warn the observer with a visual and/or audible signal of any tracked target which is predicted to close to within a minimum range and time chosen by the observer. The target causing the warning should be clearly indicated on the display.
3.5.3 The ARPA should clearly indicate if a tracked target is lost, other than out of range, and the target's last tracked position should be clearly indicated on the display.
3.5.4 It should be possible to activate or de-activate the operational warnings.
3.6
Data Requirements
3.6.1 At the request of the observer the following information should be immediately available from the ARPA in alphanumeric form in regard to any tracked target:
1. Present range to the target;
2. Present bearing of the target;.
.3 Predicted target range at the closest point of approach (CPA);
.4 Predicted time to CPA (TCPA);
.5 Calculated true course of target;
.6 Calculated true speed of target.
3.7
Trial Manoeuvre
3.7.1 The ARPA should be capable of simulating the effect on all tracked targets of an own ship manoeuvre without interrupting the updating of target information. The simulation should be initiated by the depression either of a spring-loaded switch, or of a function key, with a positive identification on the display.
3.8
Accuracy
3.8.1 The ARPA should provide accuracies not less than those given in paragraphs 3.8.2 and 3.8.3 for the four scenarios defined in Annex 2. With the sensor errors specified in Annex 3, the values given relate to the best possible manual plotting performance under environmental conditions of plus and minus ten degrees of roll.
3.8.2 An ARPA should present within one minute of steady state tracking the relative motion trend of a target with the following accuracy values (95 percent probability values):

3.8.5 The ARPA should be designed in such a manner that under the most favorable conditions of own ship motion the error contribution from the ARPA should remain insignificant compared to the errors associated with the input sensors, for scenarios of Annex 2.
3.9
Connections with other equipment
3.9.1 The ARPA should not degrade the performance of any equipment providing sensor inputs. The connection of the ARPA to any other equipment should not degrade the performance of that equipment.
3.10
Performance test and warnings
3.10.1 The ARPA should provide suitable warnings of ARPA malfunction to enable the observer to monitor the proper operation of the system. Additionally test programmes should be available so that the overall performance of ARPA can be assessed periodically against a known solution.
3.11

A collision system designed as a supplement to both surface search navigational radars via interswitching shall be installed. The system shall provide unattended monitoring of all radar echoes and automatic audio and visual alarm signals that will alert the watch officer of a possible threat. The display shall be contained within a console capable of being installed adjacent to the radar displays in the wheelhouse and may form a part of the bridge console.
Provision for signal input from the ship's radars, gyro compass, and speed log, without modification to these equipments shall be made. The collision avoidance system, whether operating normally or having failed, must not introduce any spurious signals or otherwise degrade the performance of the radars, the gyro compass or the speed log.
Computer generated display data for each acquired target shall be in the form of a line or vector indicating true or relative target course, speed and both present and extrapolated future positions. Data shall be automatically displayed on a cathode ray tube or other suitable display contrivance sufficiently bright and unobstructed to permit viewing by more than one person at a time.
In addition to displaying the collision potential of the most threatening fixed and moving targets, the system shall be capable of simultaneously showing land masses.
The system display shall include a heading indication and bearing ring. The system shall also have the capability of allowing the operator to select “head-up” and to cancel the vector or line presentation of any of the targets. The presentation shall be non-smearing when changing modes or display
scales in order to permit rapid evaluation of the displayed data.
Target acquisition, for display data purposes, may be manual, automatic or both, as specified by Owner.
For any manual acquisition system the alarms shall be initiated by a preset minimum range; and likewise for any automatic acquisition system the alarms shall be initiated by a preset minimum acceptable passing distance (CPA—Closest Point of Approach) and a preset advance warning time (TCPA—Time to Closest Point of Approach). Means shall be provided to silence the audio alarm for a given threat but the alarm shall resound upon a subsequent threat. The visual alarm shall continue to operate until all threats have been eliminated. If the collision avoidance system fails to perform as indicated above, after the system is set for unattended monitoring, the system shall produce both audio and visual warning alarms.
The system shall be capable of simulating a trial maneuver.
In addition to the target display, an alpha-numeric readout shall be provided which can present range, bearing, course, speed, CPA and TCPA for any selected target, either on the target display or by other display means.
The collision avoidance system shall be energized from the interior communications panel board in the wheelhouse.
The collision avoidance function may be incorporated in an integrated conning system, provided that failure of any other integrated system component will not degrade the collision avoidance function.

§ 164.46
Automatic Identification System.
(a)
Definitions.
As used in this section—
Automatic Identification Systems
or
AIS
means a maritime navigation safety communications system standardized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), that—
(1) Provides vessel information, including the vessel's identity, type, position, course, speed, navigational status and other safety-related information automatically to appropriately equipped shore stations, other ships, and aircraft;
(2) Receives automatically such information from similarly fitted ships, monitors and tracks ships; and
(3) Exchanges data with shore-based facilities.
Gross tonnage
means tonnage as defined under the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969.
International voyage
means a voyage from a country to which the present International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea applies to a port outside such country, or conversely.
Properly installed, operational
means an Automatic Identification System (AIS) that is installed and operated using the guidelines set forth by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Resolution A.917(22) and Safety of Navigation Circulars (SN/Circ.) 227, 244, 245, and SN.1/Circ.289; or National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) Installation Standard 0400-3.10 in lieu of SN/Circ.227 and 245 (incorporated by reference, see § 164.03).
(b)
AIS carriage
—(1)
AIS Class A device.
The following vessels must have on board a properly installed, operational Coast Guard type-approved AIS Class A device:
(i) A self-propelled vessel of 65 feet or more in length, engaged in commercial service.
(ii) A towing vessel of 26 feet or more in length and more than 600 horsepower, engaged in commercial service.
(iii) A self-propelled vessel that is certificated to carry more than 150 passengers.
(iv) A self-propelled vessel engaged in dredging operations in or near a commercial channel or shipping fairway in a manner likely to restrict or affect navigation of other vessels.
(v) A self-propelled vessel engaged in the movement of—
(A) Certain dangerous cargo as defined in subpart C of part 160 of this chapter, or
(B) Flammable or combustible liquid cargo in bulk that is listed in 46 CFR 30.25-1, Table 30.25-1.
(2)
AIS Class B device.
Use of a Coast Guard type-approved AIS Class B device in lieu of an AIS Class A device is permissible on the following vessels if they are not subject to pilotage by other than the vessel Master or crew:
(i) Fishing industry vessels;
(ii) Vessels identified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section that are certificated to carry less than 150 passengers and that—
(A) Do not operate in a Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) or Vessel Movement Reporting System (VMRS) area defined in Table 161.12(c) of § 161.12 of this chapter, and
(B) Do not operate at speeds in excess of 14 knots; and
(iii) Vessels identified in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section engaged in dredging operations.

# Note to paragraph (
b

# ):
Under 46 U.S.C. 70002 and 33 CFR 160.111, a Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) may restrict the operation of a vessel if he or she determines that by reason of weather, visibility, sea conditions, port congestion, other hazardous circumstances, or the condition of such vessel, the restriction is justified in the interest of safety. In certain circumstances, if a COTP is concerned that the operation of a vessel not subject to § 164.46 would be unsafe, the COTP may determine that voluntary installation of AIS by the operator would mitigate that concern. Fishing industry vessels include fishing vessels, fish processing vessels, and fish tender vessels as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101.
(c)
SOLAS provisions.
The following self-propelled vessels must comply with International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), as amended, Chapter V, regulation 19.2.1.6 (Positioning System), 19.2.4 (AIS Class A), and 19.2.3.5 (Transmitting Heading Device) or 19.2.5.1 (Gyro Compass) as applicable (Incorporated by reference, see § 164.03):
(1) A vessel of 300 gross tonnage or more, on an international voyage.
(2) A vessel of 150 gross tonnage or more, when carrying more than 12 passengers on an international voyage.
(d)
Operations.
The requirements in this paragraph are applicable to any vessel equipped with AIS.
(1) Use of AIS does not relieve the vessel of the requirements to sound whistle signals or display lights or shapes in accordance with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), 28 U.S.T. 3459, T.I.A.S. 8587, or Inland Navigation Rules, 33 CFR part 83; nor of the radio requirements of the Vessel Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act, 33 U.S.C. 1201-1208, part 26 of this chapter, and 47 CFR part 80.
(2) AIS must be maintained in effective operating condition, which includes—
(i) The ability to reinitialize the AIS, which requires access to and knowledge of the AIS power source and password;
(ii) The ability to access AIS information from the primary conning position of the vessel;
(iii) The accurate broadcast of a properly assigned Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number;
(iv) The accurate input and upkeep of all AIS data fields and system updates; and
(v) For those vessels denoted in paragraph (b) of this section, the continual operation of AIS and its associated devices (e.g., positioning system, gyro, converters, displays) at all times while the vessel is underway or at anchor, and, if moored, at least 15 minutes prior to getting underway; except when its operation would compromise the
safety or security of the vessel or a security incident is imminent. The AIS should be returned to continuous operation as soon as the compromise has been mitigated or the security incident has passed. The time and reason for the silent period should be recorded in the ship's official log and reported to the nearest Captain of the Port or Vessel Traffic Center (VTC).
(3) AIS safety-related text messaging must be conducted in English and solely to exchange or communicate pertinent navigation safety information (analogous to a SECURITE broadcast). Although not prohibited, AIS text messaging should not be relied upon as the primary means for broadcasting distress (MAYDAY) or urgent (PAN PAN) communications. (47 CFR 80.1109, Distress, urgency, and safety communications).
(4) AIS application-specific messaging (ASM) is permissible, but is limited to applications adopted by the International Maritime Organization (such as IMO SN.1/Circ.289) or those denoted in the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities' (IALA) ASM Collection for use in the United States or Canada, and to no more than one ASM per minute.

# Note 1 to § 164.46(d):
The Coast Guard has developed the “USCG AIS Encoding Guidance” to help ensure consistent and accurate data encoding (input) by AIS users. This Guide is available at our “AIS Frequently Asked Questions” (FAQ #2) World Wide Web page at
www.navcen.uscg.gov/ais-frequently-asked-questions#2
. Although of great benefit, the interfacing or installation of other external devices or displays (e.g., transmitting heading device, gyro, rate of turn indicator, electronic charting systems, and radar), is not currently required except as denoted in § 164.46(c). Most application-specific messages require interfacing to an external system that is capable of their portrayal, such as equipment certified to meet Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services (RTCM) electronic chart system (ECS) standard 10900 series.
(e)
Watchkeeping.
AIS is primarily intended for use by the Master or person in charge of the vessel, or by the person designated by the Master or person in charge to pilot or direct the movement of the vessel, who must maintain a periodic watch for AIS information.
(f)
Portable AIS.
The use of a portable AIS is permissible only to the extent that electromagnetic interference does not affect the proper function of existing navigation and communication equipment on board and such that only one AIS device may be transmitting on board a vessel at any one time.
(g)
AIS Pilot Plug.
The AIS Pilot Plug on any vessel subject to pilotage by other than the vessel Master or crew must be readily available and easily accessible from the primary conning position of the vessel and permanently affixed (not an extension cord) and adjacent (within 3 feet) to a 120-volt 50/60 Hz AC power receptacle (NEMA 5-15).
(h)
Exceptions.
The following vessels may seek up to a 5-year deviation from the AIS requirements of this section by requesting a deviation under § 164.55.
(1) Vessels that operate solely within a very confined area (e.g., less than a 1 nautical-mile radius, shipyard, or barge fleeting facility);
(2) Vessels that conduct only short voyages (less than 1 nautical mile) on a fixed schedule (e.g., a bank-to-bank river ferry service or a tender vessel);
(3) Vessels that are not likely to encounter other AIS-equipped vessels;
(4) Vessels whose design or construction makes it impracticable to operate an AIS device (e.g., those that lack electrical power, have an exposed or open cabin, or are submersible); or
(5) Vessels denoted in paragraph (b)(2) that seek a deviation from requirements in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (e) of this section because their AIS Class B device lacks a display.
(i)
Prohibition.
Except for maritime support stations (see 47 CFR 80.5) licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), broadcasts from AIS Class A or B devices on aircraft, non-self propelled vessels or from land are prohibited.
(j)
Implementation date.
Those vessels identified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section that were not previously subject to AIS carriage must install AIS no later than March 1, 2016.

[CGD 94-020, 61 FR 35075, July 3, 1996]
§ 164.78
Navigation under way: Towing vessels.
(a) The owner, master, or operator of each vessel towing shall ensure that each person directing and controlling the movement of the vessel—
(1) Understands the arrangement of the tow and the effects of maneuvering on the vessel towing and on the vessel, barge, or object being towed;
(2) Can fix the position of the vessel using installed navigational equipment, aids to navigation, geographic reference-points, and hydrographic contours;
(3) Does not fix the position of the vessel using buoys alone (Buoys are aids to navigation placed in approximate positions either to alert mariners to hazards to navigation or to indicate the orientation of a channel. They may not maintain exact charted positions, because strong or varying currents, heavy seas, ice, and collisions with vessels can move or sink them or set them adrift. Although they may corroborate a position fixed by other means, they cannot fix a position; however, if no other aids are available, buoys alone may establish an estimated position.);
(4) Evaluates the danger of each closing visual or radar contact;
(5) Knows and applies the variation and deviation, where a magnetic compass is fitted and where charts or maps have enough detail to enable this type of correction;
(6) Knows the speed and direction of the current, and the set, drift, and tidal state for the area to be transited;
(7) Proceeds at a safe speed taking into account the weather, visibility, density of traffic, draft of tow, possibility of wake damage, speed and direction of the current, and local speed-limits; and
(8) Monitors the voyage plan required by § 164.80.
(b) The owner, master, or operator of each vessel towing shall ensure that the tests and inspections required by § 164.80 are conducted and that the results are entered in the log or other record carried on board.
[CGD 94-020, 61 FR 35075, July 3, 1996, as amended by USCG-2000-6931, 68 FR 22610, Apr. 29, 2003; 69 FR 34068, June 18, 2004]
§ 164.80
Tests, inspections, and voyage planning.
(a) The owner, master, or operator of each towing vessel of less than 1,600 GT shall ensure that the following tests and inspections of gear occur before the vessel embarks on a voyage of more than 24 hours or when each new master or operator assumes command:
(1)
Steering-systems.
A test of the steering-gear-control system; a test of the main steering gear from the alternative power supply, if installed; a verification of the rudder-angle indicator relative to the actual position of the rudder; and a visual inspection of the steering gear and its linkage.

Tests of onboard equipment as required by § 164.25.
(2)
Terminal gear.
Visual inspection of tackle; of connections of bridle and towing pendant, if applicable; of chafing gear; and of the winch brake, if installed.
(c)(1) The voyage-planning requirements outlined in this section do not apply to you if your towing vessel is—
(i) Used solely for any of the following services or any combination of these services—
(A) Within a limited geographic area, such as a fleeting-area for barges or a commercial facility, and used for restricted service, such as making up or breaking up larger tows;
(B) For harbor-assist;
(C) For assistance towing as defined by 46 CFR 10.103;
(D) For response to emergency or pollution;
(ii) A public vessel that is both owned, or demise chartered, and operated by the United States Government or by a government of a foreign country; and that is not engaged in commercial service;
(iii) A foreign vessel engaged in innocent passage; or
(iv) Exempted by the Captain of the Port (COTP).
(2) If you think your towing vessel should be exempt from these voyage planning requirements for a specified route, you should submit a written request to the appropriate COTP. The COTP will provide you with a written response granting or denying your request.
(3) If any part of a towing vessel's intended voyage is seaward of the baseline (
i.e.,
the shoreward boundary) of the territorial sea of the U.S., then the owner, master, or operator of the vessel, employed to tow a barge or barges, must ensure that the voyage with the barge or barges is planned, taking into account all pertinent information before the vessel embarks on the voyage. The master must check the planned route for proximity to hazards before the voyage begins. During a voyage, if a decision is made to deviate substantially from the planned route, then the master or mate must plan the new route before deviating from the planned route. The voyage plan must follow company policy and consider the following (related requirements noted in parentheses):
(i) Applicable information from nautical charts and publications (also see paragraph (b) of section 164.72), including Coast Pilot, Coast Guard Light List, and Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners for the port of departure, all ports of call, and the destination;
(ii) Current and forecast weather, including visibility, wind, and sea state for the port of departure, all ports of call, and the destination (also see paragraphs (a)(7) of section 164.78 and (b) of section 164.82);
(iii) Data on tides and currents for the port of departure, all ports of call, and the destination, and the river stages and forecast, if appropriate;
(iv) Forward and after drafts of the barge or barges and under-keel and vertical clearances (air-gaps) for all bridges, ports, and berthing areas;
(v) Pre-departure checklists;
(vi) Calculated speed and estimated time of arrival at proposed waypoints;
(vii) Communication contacts at any Vessel Traffic Services, bridges, and facilities, and any port-specific requirements for VHF radio;
(viii) Any master's or operator's standing orders detailing closest points of approach, special conditions, and critical maneuvers; and
(ix) Whether the towing vessel has sufficient power to control the tow under all foreseeable circumstances.
[CGD 94-020, 61 FR 35075, July 3, 1996, as amended by USCG-2000-6931, 68 FR 22610, Apr. 29, 2003; 69 FR 34068, June 18, 2004]
§ 164.82
Maintenance, failure, and reporting.
(a)
Maintenance.
The owner, master, or operator of each towing vessel shall maintain operative the navigational-safety equipment required by § 164.72.
(b)
Failure.
If any of the navigational-safety equipment required by § 164.72 fails during a voyage, the owner, master, or operator of the towing vessel
shall exercise due diligence to repair it at the earliest practicable time. He or she shall enter its failure in the log or other record carried on board. The failure of equipment, in itself, does not constitute a violation of this rule; nor does it constitute unseaworthiness; nor does it obligate an owner, master, or operator to moor or anchor the vessel. However, the owner, master, or operator shall consider the state of the equipment—along with such factors as weather, visibility, traffic, and the dictates of good seamanship—in deciding whether it is safe for the vessel to proceed.
(c)
Reporting.
The owner, master, or operator of each towing vessel whose equipment is inoperative or otherwise impaired while the vessel is operating within a Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) Area shall report the fact as required by 33 CFR Table 161.18(a) row Q.
(d)
Deviation and authorization.
The owner, master, or operator of each towing vessel unable to repair within 96 hours an inoperative marine radar required by § 164.72(a) shall so notify the Captain of the Port (COTP) and shall seek from the COTP both a deviation from the requirements of this section and an authorization for continued operation in the area to be transited. Failure of redundant navigational-safety equipment, including but not limited to failure of one of two installed radars, where each satisfies § 164.72(a), does not necessitate either a deviation or an authorization.
(1) The initial notice and request for a deviation and an authorization may be spoken, but the request must also be written. The written request must explain why immediate repair is impracticable, and state when and by whom the repair will be made.
(2) The COTP, upon receiving even a spoken request, may grant a deviation and an authorization from any of the provisions of §§ 164.70 through 164.82 for a specified time if he or she decides that they would not impair the safe navigation of the vessel under anticipated conditions.

Definitions.
The following definitions apply to this section:
Bare steerage way
means the minimum speed necessary for a ship to maintain control over its heading.
Bollard pull
means an industry standard used for rating tug capabilities and is the pulling force imparted by the tug to the towline. It means the power that an escort tug can apply to its working line(s) when operating in a direct mode.
Direct mode
means a towing technique defined as a method of operation by
which a towing vessel generates towline forces by thrust alone at an angle equal to or nearly equal to the towline, or thrust forces applied directly to the escorted vessel's hull.
Heel
means the minimum quantity of liquefied natural gas (LNG) retained in an LNG tankship after unloading at the LNG facility to maintain temperature, pressure, and/or prudent operations. A quantity of LNG less than five percent (5 %) of the LNG tankship's carrying capacity shall be presumed to be heel.
Indirect mode
means a towing technique defined as a method of operation by which an escorting towing vessel generates towline forces by a combination of thrust and hydrodynamic forces resulting from a presentation of the underwater body of the towing vessel at an oblique angle to the towline. This method increases the resultant bollard pull, thereby arresting and controlling the motion of an escorted vessel.
LNG tankship
means a vessel as described in 46 CFR 154.
Operator
means the person who owns, operates, or is responsible for the operation of a facility or vessel.
Savannah River Channel Entrance Sea Buoy
