# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# COMPUTATION OF TAXABLE INCOME

# Definition of Gross Income, Adjusted Gross Income, and Taxable Income
§ 1.61-1
Gross income.
(a)
General definition.
Gross income means all income from whatever source derived, unless excluded by law. Gross income includes income realized in any form, whether in money, property, or services. Income may be realized, therefore, in the form of services, meals, accommodations, stock, or other property, as well as in cash. Section 61 lists the more common items of gross income for purposes of illustration. For purposes of further illustration, § 1.61-14 mentions several miscellaneous items of gross income not listed specifically in section 61. Gross income, however, is not limited to the items so enumerated.
(b)
Cross references.
Cross references to other provisions of the Code are to be found throughout the regulations under section 61. The purpose of these cross references is to direct attention to the more common items which are
included in or excluded from gross income entirely, or treated in some special manner. To the extent that another section of the Code or of the regulations thereunder, provides specific treatment for any item of income, such other provision shall apply notwithstanding section 61 and the regulations thereunder. The cross references do not cover all possible items.
(1) For examples of items specifically included in gross income, see Part II (section 71 and following), Subchapter B, Chapter 1 of the Code.
(2) For examples of items specifically excluded from gross income, see part III (section 101 and following), Subchapter B, Chapter 1 of the Code.
(3) For general rules as to the taxable year for which an item is to be included in gross income, see section 451 and the regulations thereunder.
§ 1.61-2
Compensation for services, including fees, commissions, and similar items.
(a)
In general.

Members of the Armed Forces, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Public Health Service.
(1) Subsistence and uniform allowances granted commissioned officers, chief warrant officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel of the Armed Forces, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Public Health Service of the United States, and amounts received by them as commutation of quarters, are excluded from gross income. Similarly, the value of quarters or subsistence furnished to such persons is excluded from gross income.
(2) For purposes of this section, quarters or subsistence includes the following allowances for expenses incurred after December 31, 1993, by members of the Armed Forces, members of the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and members of the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, to the extent that the allowances are not otherwise excluded from gross income under another provision of the Internal Revenue Code: a dislocation allowance, authorized by 37 U.S.C. 407; a temporary lodging allowance, authorized by 37 U.S.C. 405; a temporary lodging expense, authorized by 37 U.S.C. 404a; and a move-in housing allowance, authorized by 37 U.S.C. 405. No deduction is allowed under this chapter for any expenses reimbursed by such excluded allowances. For the exclusion from gross income of—

(ii) Miscellaneous items, see section 122.
(3) The per diem or actual expense allowance, the monetary allowance in lieu of transportation, and the mileage allowance received by members of the Armed Forces, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Public Health Service, while in a travel status or on temporary duty away from their permanent stations, are included in their gross income except to the extent excluded under the accountable plan provisions of § 1.62-2.
(c)
Payment to charitable, etc., organization on behalf of person rendering services.
The value of services is not includible in gross income when such services are rendered directly and gratuitously to an organization described in section 170(c). Where, however, pursuant to an agreement or understanding, services are rendered to a person for the benefit of an organization described in section 170(c) and an amount for such services is paid to such organization by the person to whom the services are rendered, the amount so paid constitutes income to the person performing the services.
(d)
Compensation paid other than in cash
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section (relating to certain property transferred after June 30, 1969), if services are paid for in property, the fair market value of the property taken in payment must be included in income as compensation. If services are paid for in exchange for other services, the fair market value of such other services taken in payment must be included in income as compensation. If the services are rendered at a stipulated price, such price will be presumed to be the fair market value of the compensation received in the absence of evidence to the contrary. For special rules relating to certain options received as compensation, see §§ 1.61-15, 1.83-7, and section 421 and the regulations thereunder. For special rules relating to premiums paid by an employer for an annuity contract which is not subject to section 403(a), see section 403(c) and the regulations thereunder and § 1.83-8(a). For special rules relating to contributions made to an employees' trust which is not exempt under section 501, see section 402(b) and the regulations thereunder and § 1.83-8(a).
(2)
Property transferred to employee or independent contractor.
(i) Except as otherwise provided in section 421 and the regulations thereunder and § 1.61-15 (relating to stock options), and paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, if property is transferred by an employer to an employee or if property is transferred to an independent contractor, as compensation for services, for an amount less than its fair market value, then regardless of whether the transfer is in the form of a sale or exchange, the difference between the amount paid for the property and the amount of its fair market value at the time of the transfer is compensation and shall be included in the gross income of the employee or independent contractor. In computing the gain or loss from the subsequent sale of such property, its basis shall be the amount paid for the property increased by the amount of such difference included in gross income
(ii)(A)
Cost of life insurance on the life of the employee.
Generally, life insurance premiums paid by an employer on the life of his employee where the proceeds of such insurance are payable to the beneficiary of such employee are part of the gross income of the employee. However, the amount includible in the employee's gross income is determined with regard to the provisions of section 403 and the regulations thereunder in the case of an individual contract issued after December 31, 1962, or a group contract, which provides incidental life insurance protection and which satisfies the requirements of section 401(g) and § 1.401-9, relating to the nontransferability of annuity contracts. For example, if an employee or independent contractor is the owner (as defined in § 1.61-22(c)(1)) of a life insurance contract and the payments with regard to such contract are not split-dollar loans under § 1.7872-15(b)(1), the employee or independent contractor must include in income the amount of any such payments by the employer or service recipient with respect to such contract during any year to the extent that the employee's or independent contractor's rights to the
life insurance contract are substantially vested (within the meaning of § 1.83-3(b)). This result is the same regardless of whether the employee or independent contractor has at all times been the owner of the life insurance contract or the contract previously has been owned by the employer or service recipient as part of a split-dollar life insurance arrangement (as defined in § 1.61-22(b)(1) or (2)) and was transferred by the employer or service recipient to the employee or independent contractor under § 1.61-22(g). For the special rules relating to the includibility in an employee's gross income of an amount equal to the cost of certain group term life insurance on the employee's life which is carried directly or indirectly by his employer, see section 79 and the regulations thereunder. For special rules relating to the exclusion of contributions by an employer to accident and health plans for the employee, see section 106 and the regulations thereunder.
(B)
Cost of group-term life insurance on the life of an individual other than an employee.
The cost (determined under paragraph (d)(2) of § 1.79-3) of group-term life insurance on the life of an individual other than an employee (such as the spouse or dependent of the employee) provided in connection with the performance of services by the employee is includible in the gross income of the employee.
(3)
Meals and living quarters.
The value of living quarters or meals which an employee receives in addition to his salary constitutes gross income unless they are furnished for the convenience of the employer and meet the conditions specified in section 119 and the regulations thereunder. For the treatment of rental value of parsonages or rental allowance paid to ministers, see section 107 and the regulations thereunder; for the treatment of statutory subsistence allowances received by police, see section 120 and the regulations thereunder.
(4)
Stock and notes transferred to employee or independent contractor.
Except as otherwise provided by section 421 and the regulations thereunder and § 1.61-15 (relating to stock options), and paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, if a corporation transfers its own stock to an employee or independent contractor as compensation for services, the fair market value of the stock at the time of transfer shall be included in the gross income of the employee or independent contractor. Notes or other evidences of indebtedness received in payment for services constitute income in the amount of their fair market value at the time of the transfer. A taxpayer receiving as compensation a note regarded as good for its face value at maturity, but not bearing interest, shall treat as income as of the time of receipt its fair discounted value computed at the prevailing rate. As payments are received on such a note, there shall be included in income that portion of each payment which represents the proportionate part of the discount originally taken on the entire note.
(5)
Property transferred on or before June 30, 1969, subject to restrictions.
Notwithstanding paragraph (d) (1), (2), or (4) of this section, if any property is transferred after September 24, 1959, by an employer to an employee or independent contractor as compensation for services, and such property is subject to a restriction which has a significant effect on its value at the time of transfer, the rules of § 1.421-6(d)(2) shall apply in determining the time and the amount of compensation to be included in the gross income of the employee or independent contractor. This (5) is also applicable to transfers subject to a restriction which has a significant effect on its value at the time of transfer and to which § 1.83-8(b) (relating to transitional rules with respect to transfers of restricted property) applies. For special rules relating to options to purchase stock or other property which are issued as compensation for services, see § 1.61-15 and section 421 and the regulations thereunder.
(6)
Certain property transferred, premiums paid, and contributions made in connection with the performance of services after June 30, 1969
—(i)
Exception.
Paragraph (d) (1), (2), (4), and (5) of this section and § 1.61-15 do not apply to the transfer of property (as defined in § 1.83-3(e)) after June 30, 1969, unless § 1.83-8 (relating to the applicability of
section 83 and transitional rules) applies. If section 83 applies to a transfer of property, and the property is not subject to a restriction that has a significant effect on the fair market value of such property, then the rules contained in paragraph (d) (1), (2), and (4) of this section and § 1.61-15 shall also apply to such transfer to the extent such rules are not inconsistent with section 83.
(ii)
Cross references.
For rules relating to premiums paid by an employer for an annuity contract which is not subject to section 403(a), see section 403(c) and the regulations thereunder. For rules relating to contributions made to an employees' trust which is not exempt under section 501(a), see section 402(b) and the regulations thereunder.

§ 1.61-3
Gross income derived from business.
(a)
In general.
In a manufacturing, merchandising, or mining business, “gross income” means the total sales, less the cost of goods sold, plus any income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources. Gross income is determined without subtraction of depletion allowances based on a percentage of income to the extent that it exceeds cost depletion which may be required to be included in the amount of inventoriable costs as provided in § 1.471-11 and without subtraction of selling expenses, losses or other items not ordinarily used in computing costs of goods sold or amounts which are of a type for which a deduction would be disallowed under section 162 (c), (f), or (g) in the case of a business expense. The cost of goods sold should be determined in accordance with the method of accounting consistently used by the taxpayer. Thus, for example, an amount cannot be taken into account in the computation of cost of goods sold any earlier than the taxable year in which economic performance occurs with respect to the amount (see § 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii)).
(b)
State contracts.
The profit from a contract with a State or political subdivision thereof must be included in gross income. If warrants are issued by a city, town, or other political subdivision of a State, and are accepted by the contractor in payment for public work done, the fair market value of such warrants should be returned as income. If, upon conversion of the warrants into cash, the contractor does not receive and cannot recover the full value of the warrants so returned, he may deduct any loss sustained from his gross income for the year in which the warrants are so converted. If, however, he realizes more than the value of the warrants so returned, he must include the excess in his gross income for the year in which realized.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7207, 37 FR 20767, Oct. 5, 1972; T.D. 7285, 38 FR 26184, Sept. 19, 1973; T.D. 8408, 57 FR 12419, Apr. 10, 1992]
§ 1.61-4
Gross income of farmers.
(a)
Farmers using the cash method of accounting.
A farmer using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting shall include in his gross income for the taxable year—
(1) The amount of cash and the value of merchandise or other property received during the taxable year from the sale of livestock and produce which he raised,
(2) The profits from the sale of any livestock or other items which were purchased,
(3) All amounts received from breeding fees, fees from rent of teams, machinery, or land, and other incidental farm income,
(4) All subsidy and conservation payments received which must be considered as income, and
(5) Gross income from all other sources.
The profit from the sale of livestock or other items which were purchased is to be ascertained by deducting the cost from the sales price in the year in which the sale occurs, except that in the case of the sale of purchased animals held for draft, breeding, or dairy purposes, the profits shall be the amount of any excess of the sales price
over the amount representing the difference between the cost and the depreciation allowed or allowable (determined in accordance with the rules applicable under section 1016(a) and the regulations thereunder). However, see section 162 and the regulations thereunder with respect to the computation of taxable income on other than the crop method where the cost of seeds or young plants purchased for further development and cultivation prior to sale is involved. Crop shares (whether or not considered rent under State law) shall be included in gross income as of the year in which the crop shares are reduced to money or the equivalent of money. See section 263A for rules regarding costs that are required to be capitalized.
(b)
Farmers using an accrual method of accounting.
A farmer using an accrual method of accounting must use inventories to determine his gross income. His gross income on an accrual method is determined by adding the total of the items described in subparagraphs (1) through (5) of this paragraph and subtracting therefrom the total of the items described in subparagraphs (6) and (7) of this paragraph. These items are as follows:
(1) The sales price of all livestock and other products held for sale and sold during the year;
(2) The inventory value of livestock and products on hand and not sold at the end of the year;
(3) All miscellaneous items of income, such as breeding fees, fees from the rent of teams, machinery, or land, or other incidental farm income;
(4) Any subsidy or conservation payments which must be considered as income;
(5) Gross income from all other sources;
(6) The inventory value of the livestock and products on hand and not sold at the beginning of the year; and
(7) The cost of any livestock or products purchased during the year (except livestock held for draft, dairy, or breeding purposes, unless included in inventory).
All livestock raised or purchased for sale shall be added in the inventory at their proper valuation determined in accordance with the method authorized and adopted for the purpose. Livestock acquired for draft, breeding, or dairy purposes and not for sale may be included in the inventory (see subparagraphs (2), (6), and (7) of this paragraph) instead of being treated as capital assets subject to depreciation, provided such practice is followed consistently from year to year by the taxpayer. When any livestock included in an inventory are sold, their cost must not be taken as an additional deduction in computing taxable income, because such deduction is reflected in the inventory. See the regulations under section 471. See section 263A for rules regarding costs that are required to be capitalized. Crop shares (whether or not considered rent under State law) shall be included in gross income as of the year in which the crop shares are reduced to money or the equivalent of money.
(c)
Special rules for certain receipts.
In the case of the sale of machinery, farm equipment, or any other property (except stock in trade of the taxpayer, or property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year, or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business), any excess of the proceeds of the sale over the adjusted basis of such property shall be included in the taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year in which such sale is made. See, however, section 453 and the regulations thereunder for special rules relating to certain installment sales. If farm produce is exchanged for merchandise, groceries, or the like, the market value of the article received in exchange is to be included in gross income. Proceeds of insurance, such as hail or fire insurance on growing crops, should be included in gross income to the extent of the amount received in cash or its equivalent for the crop injured or destroyed. See section 451(d) for special rule relating to election to include crop insurance proceeds in income for taxable year following taxable year of destruction. For taxable years beginning after July 12, 1972, where a farmer is engaged in producing crops and the process of gathering and
disposing of such crops is not completed within the taxable year in which such crops are planted, the income therefrom may, with the consent of the Commissioner (see section 446 and the regulations thereunder), be computed upon the crop method. For taxable years beginning on or before July 12, 1972, where a farmer is engaged in producing crops which take more than a year from the time of planting to the time of gathering and disposing, the income therefrom may, with the consent of the Commissioner (see section 446 and the regulations thereunder), be computed upon the crop method. In any case in which the crop method is used, the entire cost of producing the crop must be taken as a deduction for the year in which the gross income from the crop is realized, and not earlier.
(d)
Definition of “farm”.
As used in this section, the term “farm” embraces the farm in the ordinarily accepted sense, and includes stock, dairy, poultry, fruit, and truck farms; also plantations, ranches, and all land used for farming operations. All individuals, partnerships, or corporations that cultivate, operate, or manage farms for gain or profit, either as owners or tenants, are designated as farmers. For more detailed rules with respect to the determination of whether or not an individual is engaged in farming, see § 1.175-3. For rules applicable to persons cultivating or operating a farm for recreation or pleasure, see sections 162 and 165, and the regulations thereunder.
(e)
Cross references.
(1) For election to include Commodity Credit Corporation loans as income, see section 77 and regulations thereunder.
(2) For definition of gross income derived from farming for purposes of limiting deductibility of soil and water conservation expenditures, see section 175 and regulations thereunder.
(3) For definition of gross income from farming in connection with declarations of estimated income tax, see section 6073 and regulations thereunder.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7198, 37 FR 13679, July 13, 1972; T.D. 8729, 62 FR 44546, Aug. 22, 1997]
§ 1.61-5
Allocations by cooperative associations; per-unit retain certificates—tax treatment as to cooperatives and patrons.
(a)
In general.
Amounts allocated on the basis of the business done with or for a patron by a cooperative association, whether or not entitled to tax treatment under section 522, in cash, merchandise, capital stock, revolving fund certificates, retain certificates, certificates of indebtedness, letters of advice or in some other manner disclosing to the patron the dollar amount allocated, shall be included in the computation of the gross income of such patron for the taxable year in which received to the extent prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, regardless of whether the allocation is deemed, for the purpose of section 522, to be made at the close of a preceding taxable year of the cooperative association. The determination of the extent of taxability of such amounts is in no way dependent upon the method of accounting employed by the patron or upon the method, cash, accrual, or otherwise, upon which the taxable income of such patron is computed.
(b)
Extent of taxability.
(1) Amounts allocated to a patron on a patronage basis by a cooperative association with respect to products marketed for such patron, or with respect to supplies, equipment, or services, the cost of which was deductible by the patron under section 162 or section 212, shall be included in the computation of the gross income of such patron, as ordinary income, to the following extent:
(i) If the allocation is in cash, the amount of cash received.
(ii) If the allocation is in merchandise, the amount of the fair market value of such merchandise at the time of receipt by the patron.
(iii) If the allocation is in the form of revolving fund certificates, retain certificates, certificates of indebtedness, letters of advice, or similar documents, the amount of the fair market value of such document at the time of its receipt by the patron. For purposes of this subdivision, any document containing an unconditional promise to pay a fixed sum of money on demand or at a fixed or determinable time shall be considered to have a fair market value
at the time of its receipt by the patron, unless it is clearly established to the contrary. However, for purposes of this subdivision, any document which is payable only in the discretion of the cooperative association, or which is otherwise subject to conditions beyond the control of the patron, shall be considered not to have any fair market value at the time of its receipt by the patron, unless it is clearly established to the contrary.
(iv) If the allocation is in the form of capital stock, the amount of the fair market value, if any, of such capital stock at the time of its receipt by the patron.
(2) If any allocation to which subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies is received in the form of a document of the type described in subparagraph (1) (iii) or (iv) of this paragraph and is redeemed in full or in part or is otherwise disposed of, there shall be included in the computation of the gross income of the patron, as ordinary income, in the year of redemption or other disposition, the excess of the amount realized on the redemption or other disposition over the amount previously included in the computation of gross income under such subparagraph.
(3)(i) Amounts which are allocated on a patronage basis by a cooperative association with respect to supplies, equipment, or services, the cost of which was not deductible by the patron under section 162 or section 212, are not includible in the computation of the gross income of such patron. However, in the case of such amounts which are allocated with respect to capital assets (as defined in section 1221) or property used in the trade or business within the meaning of section 1231, such amounts shall, to the extent set forth in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, be taken into account by such patron in determining the cost of the property to which the allocation relates. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, to the extent that such amounts are in excess of the unrecovered cost of such property, and to the extent that such amounts relate to such property which the patron no longer owns, they shall be included in the computation of the gross income of such patron.
(ii) If any patronage dividend is allocated to the patron in the form of a document of the type described in subparagraph (1) (iii) or (iv) of this paragraph, and if such allocation is with respect to capital assets (as defined in section 1221) or property used in the trade or business within the meaning of section 1231, any amount realized on the redemption or other disposition of such document which is in excess of the amount which was taken into account upon the receipt of the document by the patron shall be taken into account by such patron in the year of redemption or other disposition as an adjustment to basis or as an inclusion in the computation of gross income, as the case may be.
(iii) Any adjustment to basis in respect of an amount to which subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph applies shall be made as of the first day of the taxable year in which such amount is received.
(iv) The application of the provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On July 1, 1959, P, a patron of a cooperative association, purchases a tractor for use in his farming business from such association for $2,200. The tractor has an estimated useful life of five years and an estimated salvage value of $200. P files his income tax returns on a calendar year basis and claims depreciation on the tractor for the year 1959 of $200 pursuant to his use of the straight-line method at the rate of $400 per year. On July 1, 1960, the cooperative association allocates to P with respect to his purchase of the tractor a dividend of $300 in cash. P will reduce his depreciation allowance with respect to the tractor for 1960 (and subsequent taxable years) to $333.33, determined as follows:
Cost of tractor, July 1, 1959
$2,200
Less:
Depreciation for 1959 (6 mos.)
$200
Adjustment as of Jan. 1, 1960, for cash patronage dividend
300
Salvage value
200
700
Basis for depreciation for the remaining 4
1/2
years of estimated life
1,500
Basis for depreciation divided by the 4
1/2
years of remaining life
333.33

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that on July 1, 1960, the cooperative association allocates a dividend to P with respect to his purchase of the tractor in the form of a revolving fund certificate having a face amount of $300. The certificate
is redeemable in cash at the discretion of the directors of the association and is subject to diminution by any future losses of the association, and has no fair market value when received by P. Since the certificate had no fair market value when received by P, no amount with respect to such certificate was taken into account by him in the year 1960. In 1965, P receives $300 cash from the association in full redemption of the certificate. Prior to 1965, he had recovered through depreciation $2,000 of the cost of the tractor, leaving an unrecovered cost of $200 (the salvage value). For the year 1965, the redemption proceeds of $300 are applied against the unrecovered cost of $200, reducing the basis to zero, and the balance of the redemption proceeds, $100, is includible in the computation of P's gross income.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that the certificate is redeemed in full on July 1, 1962. The full $300 received on redemption of the certificate will be applied against the unrecovered cost of the tractor as of January 1, 1962, computed as follows:
Cost of tractor, July 1, 1959
$2,200
Less:
Depreciation for 1959 (6 mos.)
$200
Depreciation for 1960
400
Depreciation for 1961
400
1,000
Unrecovered cost on Jan. 1, 1962
1,200
Adjustment as of Jan. 1, 1962, for proceeds of the redemption of the revolving fund certificate
300
Unrecovered cost on Jan. 1, 1962, after adjustment
900
Less: Salvage value
200
Basis for depreciation on Jan. 1, 1962
700
If P uses the tractor in his business until June 30, 1964, he would be entitled to the following depreciation allowances with respect to the tractor:
For 1962
280
For 1963
280
For 1964 (6 mos.)
140
700
Balance to be depreciated
0

# Example 4.
Assume the same facts as in example (3), except that P sells the tractor in 1961. The entire $300 received in 1962 in redemption of the revolving fund certificate is includible in the computation of P's gross income for the year 1962.
(c)
Special rule.
If, for any taxable year ending before December 3, 1959, a taxpayer treated any patronage dividend received in the form of a document described in paragraph (b) (1) (iii) or (iv) of this section in accordance with the regulations then applicable (whether such dividend is subject to paragraph (b) (1) or (3) of this section), such taxpayer is not required to change the treatment of such patronage dividends for any such prior taxable year. On the other hand, the taxpayer may, if he so desires, amend his income tax returns to treat the receipt of such patronage dividend in accordance with the provisions of this section, but no provision in this paragraph shall be construed as extending the period of limitations within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed under section 6511.
(d)
Per-unit retain certificates; tax treatment of cooperative associations; distribution and reinvestment alternative.
(1)(i) In the case of a taxable year to which this paragraph applies to a cooperative association, such association shall, in computing the amount paid or returned to a patron with respect to products marketed for such patron, take into account the stated dollar amount of any per-unit retain certificate (as defined in paragraph (g) of this section)—
(
a
) Which is issued during the payment period for such year (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) with respect to such products,
(
b
) With respect to which the patron is a qualifying patron (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph), and
(
c
) Which clearly states the fact that the patron has agreed to treat the stated dollar amount thereof as representing a cash distribution to him which he has reinvested in the cooperative association.
(ii) No amount shall be taken into account by a cooperative association by reason of the issuance of a per-unit retain certificate to a patron who was not a qualifying patron with respect to such certificate. However, any amount paid in redemption of a per-unit retain certificate which was issued to a patron who was not a qualifying patron with respect to such certificate shall be taken into account by the cooperative in the year of redemption, as an amount paid or returned to such patron with respect to products marketed for him. This subdivision shall apply only to per-unit retain certificates issued with respect to taxable years of the cooperative association to which
this paragraph applied to the association (that is, taxable years with respect to which per-unit retain certificates were issued to one or more patrons who are qualifying patrons).
(2)(i) A patron shall be considered to be a “qualifying patron” with respect to a per-unit retain certificate if there is in effect an agreement between the cooperative association and such patron which clearly provides that such patron agrees to treat the stated dollar amounts of all per-unit retain certificates issued to him by the association as representing cash distributions which he has constructively received and which he has, of his own choice, reinvested in the cooperative association. Such an agreement may be included in a by-law of the cooperative which is adopted prior to the time the products to which the per-unit retain certificates relate are marketed. However, except where there is in effect a “written agreement” described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, a patron shall not be considered to be a “qualifying patron” with respect to a per-unit retain certificate if it has been established by a determination of the Tax Court of the United States, or any other court of competent jurisdiction, which has become final, that the stated dollar amount of such certificate, or of a similar certificate issued under similar circumstances to such patron or any other patron by the cooperative association, is not required to be included (as ordinary income) in the gross income of such patron, or such other patron, for the taxable year of the patron in which received.
(ii) The “written agreement” referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph is an agreement in writing, signed by the patron, on file with the cooperative association, and revocable as provided in this subdivision. Unless such an agreement specifically provides to the contrary, it shall be effective for per-unit retain certificates issued with respect to the taxable year of the cooperative association in which the agreement is received by the association, and unless revoked, for per-unit retain certificates issued with respect to all subsequent taxable years. A “written agreement” must be revocable by the patron at any time after the close of the taxable year in which it is made. To be effective, a revocation must be in writing, signed by the patron, and furnished to the cooperative association. A revocation shall be effective only for per-unit retain certificates issued with respect to taxable years of the cooperative association following the taxable year in which it is furnished to the association. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a revocation shall not be effective for per-unit retain certificates issued with respect to products marketed for the patron under a pooling arrangement in which such patron participated before such revocation. The following is an example of an agreement which would meet the requirements of this subparagraph:
I agree that, for purposes of determining the amount I have received from this cooperative in payment for my goods, I shall treat the face amount of any per-unit retain certificates issued to me on and after _____ as representing a cash distribution which I have constructively received and which I have reinvested in the cooperative.
(

)
(3) For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (e) of this section, the payment period for any taxable year of the cooperative is the period beginning with the first day of such taxable year and ending with the 15th day of the 9th month following the close of such year.
(4) This paragraph shall apply to any taxable year of a cooperative association if, with respect to such taxable year, the association has issued per-unit retain certificates to one or more of its patrons who are qualifying patrons with respect to such certificates within the meaning of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(e)
Tax treatment of cooperative association; taxable years for which paragraph (d) does not apply.
(1) In the case of a taxable year to which paragraph (d) of this section does not apply to a cooperative association, such association shall, in computing the amount paid or returned to a patron with respect to products marketed for such patron, take into account the fair market value (at the time of issue) of any per-unit retain certificates which are
issued by the association with respect to such products during the payment period for such taxable year.
(2) An amount paid in redemption of a per-unit retain certificate issued with respect to a taxable year of the cooperative association for which paragraph (d) of this section did not apply to the association, shall, to the extent such amount exceeds the fair market value of the certificate at the time of its issue, be taken into account by the association in the year of redemption, as an amount paid or returned to a patron with respect to products marketed for such patron.
(3) For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (f)(2) of this section, any per-unit retain certificate containing an unconditional promise to pay a fixed sum of money on demand or at a fixed or determinable time shall be considered to have a fair market value at the time of its issue, unless it is clearly established to the contrary. On the other hand, any per-unit retain certificate (other than capital stock) which is redeemable only in the discretion of the cooperative association, or which is otherwise subject to conditions beyond the control of the patron, shall be considered not to have any fair market value at the time of its issue, unless it is clearly established to the contrary.
(f)
Tax treatment of patron.
(1) The following rules apply for purposes of computing the amount includible in gross income with respect to a per-unit retain certificate which was issued to a patron by a cooperative association with respect to a taxable year of such association for which paragraph (d) of this section applies.
(i) If the patron is a qualifying patron with respect to such certificate (within the meaning of paragraph (d) (2) of this section), he shall, in accordance with his agreement, include (as ordinary income) the stated dollar amount of the certificate in gross income for his taxable year in which the certificate is received by him.
(ii) If the patron is not a qualifying patron with respect to such certificate, no amount is includible in gross income on the receipt of the certificate; however, any gain on the redemption, sale, or other disposition of such certificate shall, to the extent of the stated dollar amount thereof, be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of property which is not a capital asset.
(2) The amount of the fair market value of a per-unit retain certificate which is issued to a patron by a cooperative association with respect to a taxable year of the association for which paragraph (d) of this section does not apply shall be included, as ordinary income, in the gross income of the patron for the taxable year in which the certificate is received. Any gain on the redemption, sale, or other disposition of such a per-unit retain certificate shall, to the extent its stated dollar amount exceeds its fair market value at the time of issue, be treated as gain on the redemption, sale, or other disposition of property which is not a capital asset.
(g)
“Per-unit retain certificate” defined.
For purposes of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f), of this section, the term “per-unit retain certificate” means any capital stock, revolving fund certificate, retain certificate, certificate of indebtedness, letter of advice, or other written notice—
(1) Which is issued to a patron with respect to products marketed for such patron;
(2) Which discloses to the patron the stated dollar amount allocated to him on the books of the cooperative association; and
(3) The stated dollar amount of which is fixed without reference to net earnings.
(h)
Effective date.
This section shall not apply to any amount the tax treatment of which is prescribed in section 1385 and § 1.1385-1. Paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section shall apply to per-unit retain certificates as defined in paragraph (g) of this section issued by a cooperative association during taxable years of the association beginning after April 30, 1966, with respect to products marketed for patrons during such years.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6855, 30 FR 13134, Oct. 15, 1965]
§ 1.61-6
Gains derived from dealings in property.
(a)
In general.
Gain realized on the sale or exchange of property is included in gross income, unless excluded by law. For this purpose property includes tangible items, such as a building, and intangible items, such as goodwill. Generally, the gain is the excess of the amount realized over the unrecovered cost or other basis for the property sold or exchanged. The specific rules for computing the amount of gain or loss are contained in section 1001 and the regulations thereunder. When a part of a larger property is sold, the cost or other basis of the entire property shall be equitably apportioned among the several parts, and the gain realized or loss sustained on the part of the entire property sold is the difference between the selling price and the cost or other basis allocated to such part. The sale of each part is treated as a separate transaction and gain or loss shall be computed separately on each part. Thus, gain or loss shall be determined at the time of sale of each part and not deferred until the entire property has been disposed of. This rule may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a dealer in real estate, acquires a 10-acre tract for $10,000, which he divides into 20 lots. The $10,000 cost must be equitably apportioned among the lots so that on the sale of each A can determine his taxable gain or deductible loss.

# Example 2.
B purchases for $25,000 property consisting of a used car lot and adjoining filling station. At the time, the fair market value of the filling station is $15,000 and the fair market value of the used car lot is $10,000. Five years later B sells the filling station for $20,000 at a time when $2,000 has been properly allowed as depreciation thereon. B's gain on this sale is $7,000, since $7,000 is the amount by which the selling price of the filling station exceeds the portion of the cost equitably allocable to the filling station at the time of purchase reduced by the depreciation properly allowed.
(b)
Nontaxable exchanges.
Certain realized gains or losses on the sale or exchange of property are not “recognized”, that is, are not included in or deducted from gross income at the time the transaction occurs. Gain or loss from such sales or exchanges is generally recognized at some later time. Examples of such sales or exchanges are the following:
(1) Certain formations, reorganizations, and liquidations of corporations, see sections 331, 333, 337, 351, 354, 355, and 361;
(2) Certain formations and distributions of partnerships, see sections 721 and 731;
(3) Exchange of certain property held for productive use or investment for property of like kind, see section 1031;
(4) A corporation's exchange of its stock for property, see section 1032;
(5) Certain involuntary conversions of property if replaced, see section 1033;
(6) Sale or exchange of residence if replaced, see section 1034;
(7) Certain exchanges of insurance policies and annuity contracts, see section 1035; and
(8) Certain exchanges of stock for stock in the same corporation, see section 1036.
(c)
Character of recognized gain.
Under Subchapter P, Chapter 1 of the Code, relating to capital gains and losses, certain gains derived from dealings in property are treated specially, and under certain circumstances the maximum rate of tax on such gains is 25 percent, as provided in section 1201. Generally, the property subject to this treatment is a “capital asset”, or treated as a “capital asset”. For definition of such assets, see sections 1221 and 1231, and the regulations thereunder. For some of the rules either granting or denying this special treatment, see the following sections and the regulations thereunder:
(1) Transactions between partner and partnership, section 707;
(2) Sale or exchange of property used in the trade or business and involuntary conversions, section 1231;
(3) Payment of bonds and other evidences of indebtedness, section 1232;
(4) Gains and losses from short sales, section 1233;
(5) Options to buy or sell, section 1234;
(6) Sale or exchange of patents, section 1235;
(7) Securities sold by dealers in securities, section 1236;
(8) Real property subdivided for sale, section 1237;
(9) Amortization in excess of depreciation, section 1238;
(10) Gain from sale of certain property between spouses or between an individual and a controlled corporation, section 1239;
(11) Taxability to employee of termination payments, section 1240.
§ 1.61-7
Interest.
(a)
In general.
As a general rule, interest received by or credited to the taxpayer constitutes gross income and is fully taxable. Interest income includes interest on savings or other bank deposits; interest on coupon bonds; interest on an open account, a promissory note, a mortgage, or a corporate bond or debenture; the interest portion of a condemnation award; usurious interest (unless by State law it is automatically converted to a payment on the principal); interest on legacies; interest on life insurance proceeds held under an agreement to pay interest thereon; and interest on refunds of Federal taxes. For rules determining the taxable year in which interest, including interest accrued or constructively received, is included in gross income, see section 451 and the regulations thereunder. For the inclusion of interest in income for the purpose of the retirement income credit, see section 37 and the regulations thereunder. For credit of tax withheld at source on interest on tax-free covenant bonds, see section 32 and the regulations thereunder. For rules relating to interest on certain deferred payments, see section 483 and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Interest on Government obligations
—(1)
Wholly tax-exempt interest.
Interest upon the obligations of a State, Territory, or a possession of the United States, or any political subdivision of any of the foregoing, or of the District of Columbia, is wholly exempt from tax. Interest on certain United States obligations issued before March 1, 1941, is exempt from tax to the extent provided in the acts of Congress authorizing the various issues. See section 103 and the regulations thereunder.
(2)
Partially tax-exempt interest.
Interest earned on certain United States obligations is partly tax exempt and partly taxable. For example, the interest on United States Treasury bonds issued before March 1, 1941, to the extent that the principal of such bonds exceeds $5,000, is exempt from normal tax but is subject to surtax. See sections 35 and 103, and the regulations thereunder.
(3)
Fully taxable interest.
In general, interest on United States obligations issued on or after March 1, 1941, and obligations issued by any agency or instrumentality of the United States after that date, is fully taxable; but see section 103 and the regulations thereunder. A taxpayer using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting who owns United States savings bonds issued at a discount has an election as to when he will report the interest; see section 454 and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Obligations bought at a discount; bonds bought when interest defaulted or accrued.
When notes, bonds, or other certificates of indebtedness are issued by a corporation or the Government at a discount and are later redeemed by the debtor at the face amount, the original discount is interest, except as otherwise provided by law. See also paragraph (b) of this section for the rules relating to Government bonds. If a taxpayer purchases bonds when interest has been defaulted or when the interest has accrued but has not been paid, any interest which is in arrears but has accrued at the time of purchase is not income and is not taxable as interest if subsequently paid. Such payments are returns of capital which reduce the remaining cost basis. Interest which accrues after the date of purchase, however, is taxable interest income for the year in which received or accrued (depending on the method of accounting used by the taxpayer).
(d)
Bonds sold between interest dates; amounts received in excess of original issue discount; interest on life insurance.
When bonds are sold between interest dates, part of the sales price represents interest accrued to the date of the sale and must be reported as interest income. Amounts received in excess of the original issue discount upon the retirement or sale of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness may under some circumstances constitute capital gain instead of ordinary income. See section
1232 and the regulations thereunder. Interest payments on amounts payable as employees' death benefits (whether or not section 101(b) applies thereto) and on the proceeds of life insurance policies payable by reason of the insured's death constitute gross income under some circumstances. See section 101 and the regulations thereunder for details. Where accrued interest on unwithdrawn insurance policy dividends is credited annually and is subject to withdrawal annually by the taxpayer, such interest credits constitute gross income to such taxpayer as of the year of credit. However, if under the terms of the insurance policy the interest on unwithdrawn policy dividends is subject to withdrawal only on the anniversary date of the policy (or some other date specified therein), then such interest shall constitute gross income to the taxpayer for the taxable year in which such anniversary date (or other specified date) falls.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6723, 29 FR 5342, Apr. 21, 1964; T.D. 6873, 31 FR 941, Jan. 25, 1966]
§ 1.61-8
Rents and royalties.
(a)
In general.
Gross income includes rentals received or accrued for the occupancy of real estate or the use of personal property. For the inclusion of rents in income for the purpose of the retirement income credit, see section 37 and the regulations thereunder. Gross income includes royalties. Royalties may be received from books, stories, plays, copyrights, trademarks, formulas, patents, and from the exploitation of natural resources, such as coal, gas, oil, copper, or timber. Payments received as a result of the transfer of patent rights may under some circumstances constitute capital gain instead of ordinary income. See section 1235 and the regulations thereunder. For special rules for certain income from natural resources, see Subchapter I (section 611 and following), Chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Advance rentals; cancellation payments.
Except as provided in section 467 and the regulations thereunder and except as otherwise provided by the Commissioner in published guidance (see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), gross income includes advance rentals, which must be included in income for the year of receipt regardless of the period covered or the method of accounting employed by the taxpayer. An amount received by a lessor from a lessee for cancelling a lease constitutes gross income for the year in which it is received, since it is essentially a substitute for rental payments. As to amounts received by a lessee for the cancellation of a lease, see section 1241 and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Expenditures by lessee.
As a general rule, if a lessee pays any of the expenses of his lessor such payments are additional rental income of the lessor. If a lessee places improvements on real estate which constitute, in whole or in part, a substitute for rent, such improvements constitute rental income to the lessor. Whether or not improvements made by a lessee result in rental income to the lessor in a particular case depends upon the intention of the parties, which may be indicated either by the terms of the lease or by the surrounding circumstances. For the exclusion from gross income of income (other than rent) derived by a lessor of real property on the termination of a lease, representing the value of such property attributable to buildings erected or other improvements made by a lessee, see section 109 and the regulations thereunder. For the exclusion from gross income of a lessor corporation of certain of its income taxes on rental income paid by a lessee corporation under a lease entered into before January 1, 1954, see section 110 and the regulations thereunder.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. 8820, 64 FR 26851, May 18, 1999; T.D. 9135, 69 FR 41192, July 8, 2004]
§ 1.61-9
Dividends.
(a)
In general.
Except as otherwise specifically provided, dividends are included in gross income under sections 61 and 301. For the principal rules with respect to dividends includible in gross income, see section 316 and the regulations thereunder. As to distributions made or deemed to be made by regulated investment companies, see sections 851 through 855, and the regulations thereunder. As to distributions
made by real estate investment trusts, see sections 856 through 858, and the regulations thereunder. See section 116 for the exclusion from gross income of $100 ($50 for dividends received in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964) of dividends received by an individual, except those from certain corporations. Furthermore, dividends may give rise to a credit against tax under section 34, relating to dividends received by individuals (for dividends received on or before December 31, 1964), and under section 37, relating to retirement income.
(b)
Dividends in kind; stock dividends; stock redemptions.
Gross income includes dividends in property other than cash, as well as cash dividends. For amounts to be included in gross income when distributions of property are made, see section 301 and the regulations thereunder. A distribution of stock, or rights to acquire stock, in the corporation making the distribution is not a dividend except under the circumstances described in section 305(b). However, the term “dividend” includes a distribution of stock, or rights to acquire stock, in a corporation other than the corporation making the distribution. For determining when distributions in complete liquidation shall be treated as dividends, see section 333 and the regulations thereunder. For rules determining when amounts received in exchanges under section 354 or exchanges and distributions under section 355 shall be treated as dividends, see section 356 and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Dividends on stock sold.
When stock is sold, and a dividend is both declared and paid after the sale, such dividend is not gross income to the seller. When stock is sold after the declaration of a dividend and after the date as of which the seller becomes entitled to the dividend, the dividend ordinarily is income to the seller. When stock is sold between the time of declaration and the time of payment of the dividend, and the sale takes place at such time that the purchaser becomes entitled to the dividend, the dividend ordinarily is income to him. The fact that the purchaser may have included the amount of the dividend in his purchase price in contemplation of receiving the dividend does not exempt him from tax. Nor can the purchaser deduct the added amount he advanced to the seller in anticipation of the dividend. That added amount is merely part of the purchase price of the stock. In some cases, however, the purchaser may be considered to be the recipient of the dividend even though he has not received the legal title to the stock itself and does not himself receive the dividend. For example, if the seller retains the legal title to the stock as trustee solely for the purpose of securing the payment of the purchase price, with the understanding that he is to apply the dividends received from time to time in reduction of the purchase price, the dividends are considered to be income to the purchaser.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6777, 29 FR 17807, Dec. 16, 1964]
§ 1.61-10
Alimony and separate maintenance payments; annuities; income from life insurance and endowment contracts.
(a)
In general.
Alimony and separate maintenance payments, annuities, and income from life insurance and endowment contracts in general constitute gross income, unless excluded by law. Annuities paid by religious, charitable, and educational corporations are generally taxable to the same extent as other annuities. An annuity charged upon devised land is taxable to the donee-annuitant to the extent that it becomes payable out of the rents or other income of the land, whether or not it is a charge upon the income of the land.
(b)
Cross references.
For the detailed rules relating to—
(1) Alimony and separate maintenance payments, see section 71 and the regulations thereunder;
(2) Annuities, certain proceeds of endowment and life insurance contracts, see section 72 and the regulations thereunder;
(3) Life insurance proceeds paid by reason of death of insured, employees' death benefits, see section 101 and the regulations thereunder;
(4) Annuities paid by employees' trusts, see section 402 and the regulations thereunder;
(5) Annuities purchased for employee by employer, see section 403 and the regulations thereunder.
§ 1.61-11
Pensions.
(a)
In general.
Pensions and retirement allowances paid either by the Government or by private persons constitute gross income unless excluded by law. Usually, where the taxpayer did not contribute to the cost of a pension and was not taxable on his employer's contributions, the full amount of the pension is to be included in his gross income. But see sections 72, 402, and 403, and the regulations thereunder. When amounts are received from other types of pensions, a portion of the payment may be excluded from gross income. Under some circumstances, amounts distributed from a pension plan in excess of the employee's contributions may constitute long-term capital gain, rather than ordinary income.
(b)
Cross references.
For the inclusion of pensions in income for the purpose of the retirement income credit, see section 37 and the regulations thereunder. Detailed rules concerning the extent to which pensions and retirement allowances are to be included in or excluded from gross income are contained in other sections of the Code and the regulations thereunder. Amounts received as pensions or annuities under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. ch. 7) or the Railroad Retirement Act (45 U.S.C. ch. 9) are excluded from gross income. For other partial and total exclusions from gross income, see the following:
(1) Annuities in general, section 72 and the regulations thereunder;
(2) Employees' annuities, sections 402 and 403 and the regulations thereunder;
(3) References to other acts of Congress exempting veterans' pensions and railroad retirement annuities and pensions, section 122.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6856, 30 FR 13316, Oct. 20, 1965]
§ 1.61-12
Income from discharge of indebtedness.
(a)
In general.
The discharge of indebtedness, in whole or in part, may result in the realization of income. If, for example, an individual performs services for a creditor, who in consideration thereof cancels the debt, the debtor realizes income in the amount of the debt as compensation for his services. A taxpayer may realize income by the payment or purchase of his obligations at less than their face value. In general, if a shareholder in a corporation which is indebted to him gratuitously forgives the debt, the transaction amounts to a contribution to the capital of the corporation to the extent of the principal of the debt.
(b)
Proceedings under Bankruptcy Act.
(1) Income is not realized by a taxpayer by virtue of the discharge, under section 14 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 32), of his indebtedness as the result of an adjudication in bankruptcy, or by virtue of an agreement among his creditors not consummated under any provision of the Bankruptcy Act, if immediately thereafter the taxpayer's liabilities exceed the value of his assets. Furthermore, unless one of the principal purposes of seeking a confirmation under the Bankruptcy Act is the avoidance of income tax, income is not realized by a taxpayer in the case of a cancellation or reduction of his indebtedness under—
(i) A plan of corporate reorganization confirmed under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C., ch. 10);
(ii) An “arrangement” or a “real property arrangement” confirmed under Chapter XI or XII, respectively, of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C., ch. 11, 12); or
(iii) A “wage earner's plan” confirmed under Chapter XIII of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C., ch. 13).
(2) For adjustment of basis of certain property in the case of cancellation or reduction of indebtedness resulting from a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act, see the regulations under section 1016.
(c)
Issuance and repurchase of debt instruments
—(1)
Issuance.
An issuer does not realize gain or loss upon the issuance of a debt instrument. For rules relating to an issuer's interest deduction for a debt instrument issued with bond issuance premium, see § 1.163-13.
(2)
Repurchase
—(i)
In general.
An issuer does not realize gain or loss
upon the repurchase of a debt instrument. However, if a debt instrument provides for payments denominated in, or determined by reference to, a nonfunctional currency, an issuer may realize a currency gain or loss upon the repurchase of the instrument. See section 988 and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), the term
repurchase
includes the retirement of a debt instrument, the conversion of a debt instrument into stock of the issuer, and the exchange (including an exchange under section 1001) of a newly issued debt instrument for an existing debt instrument.
(ii)
Repurchase at a discount.
An issuer realizes income from the discharge of indebtedness upon the repurchase of a debt instrument for an amount less than its adjusted issue price (within the meaning of § 1.1275-1(b)). The amount of discharge of indebtedness income is equal to the excess of the adjusted issue price over the repurchase price. See section 108 and the regulations thereunder for additional rules relating to income from discharge of indebtedness. For example, to determine the repurchase price of a debt instrument that is repurchased through the issuance of a new debt instrument, see section 108(e)(10).
(iii)
Repurchase at a premium.
An issuer may be entitled to a repurchase premium deduction upon the repurchase of a debt instrument for an amount greater than its adjusted issue price (within the meaning of § 1.1275-1(b)). See § 1.163-7(c) for the treatment of repurchase premium.
(iv)
Effective date.
This paragraph (c)(2) applies to debt instruments repurchased on or after March 2, 1998.
(d)
Cross references.
For exclusion from gross income of—
(1) Income from discharge of indebtedness in certain cases, see sections 108 and 1017, and regulations thereunder;
(2) Forgiveness of Government payments to encourage exploration, development, and mining for defense purposes, see section 621 and regulations thereunder.
(e)
Cross reference.
For rules relating to the treatment of liabilities on the sale or other disposition of encumbered property, see § 1.1001-2.

§ 1.61-13
Distributive share of partnership gross income; income in respect of a decedent; income from an interest in an estate or trust.
(a)
In general.
A partner's distributive share of partnership gross income (under section 702(c)) constitutes gross income to him. Income in respect of a decedent (under section 691) constitutes gross income to the recipient. Income from an interest in an estate or trust constitutes gross income under the detailed rules of Part I (section 641 and following), Subchapter J, Chapter 1 of the Code. In many cases, these sections also determine who is to include in his gross income the income from an estate or trust.
(b)
Creation of sinking fund by corporation.
If a corporation, for the sole purpose of securing the payment of its bonds or other indebtedness, places property in trust or sets aside certain amounts in a sinking fund under the control of a trustee who may be authorized to invest and reinvest such sums from time to time, the property or fund thus set aside by the corporation and held by the trustee is an asset of the corporation, and any gain arising therefrom is income of the corporation and shall be included as such in its gross income.
§ 1.61-14
Miscellaneous items of gross income.
(a)
In general.
In addition to the items enumerated in section 61(a), there are many other kinds of gross income. For example, punitive damages such as treble damages under the antitrust laws and exemplary damages for fraud are gross income. Another person's payment of the taxpayer's income taxes constitutes gross income to the taxpayer unless excluded by law. Illegal gains constitute gross income. Treasure trove, to the extent of its value in United States currency, constitutes gross income for the taxable year in which it is reduced to undisputed possession.

§ 1.61-15
Options received as payment of income.
(a)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in § 1.61-2(d)(6)(i) (relating to certain restricted property transferred after June 30, 1969), if any person receives an option in payment of an amount constituting compensation of such person (or any other person), such option is subject to the rules contained in § 1.421-6 for purposes of determining when income is realized in connection with such option and the amount of such income. In this regard, the rules of § 1.421-6 apply to an option received in payment of an amount constituting compensation regardless of the form of the transaction. Thus, the rules of § 1.421-6 apply to an option transferred for less than its fair market value in a transaction taking the form of a sale or exchange if the difference between the amount paid for the option and its fair market value at the time of transfer is the payment of an amount constituting compensation of the transferee or any other person. This section, for example, makes the rules of § 1.421-6 applicable to options granted in whole or partial payment for services of an independent contractor. If an amount of money or property is paid for an option to which this paragraph applies, then the amount paid shall be part of the basis of such option.
(b)
Options to which paragraph (a) does not apply.
(1) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to:
(i) An option which is subject to the rules contained in section 421; and
(ii) An option which is not granted as the payment of an amount constituting compensation, such as an option which is acquired solely as an investment (including an option which is part of an investment unit described in paragraph (b) of § 1.1232-3). For rules relating to the taxation of options described in this subdivision, see section 1234 and the regulations thereunder.
(2) If a person acquires an option which is not subject to the rules contained in section 421, and if such option has a readily ascertainable fair market value, such person may establish that such option was not acquired as payment of an amount constituting compensation by showing that the amount of money or its equivalent paid for the option equaled the readily ascertainable fair market value of the option. If a person acquires an option which is not subject to the rules contained in section 421, and if such option does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value, then to establish that such option was not acquired as payment of an amount constituting compensation, such person must show that, from an examination of all the surrounding circumstances, there was no reason for the option to have been granted as the payment of an amount constituting compensation. For example, such person must show that he had neither rendered nor was obligated to render substantial services in consideration for the granting of the option. In determining whether an option, such as an option acquired in connection with an obligation as part of an investment unit, has been granted as compensation for services, the ordinary services performed by an investor in his own self-interest in connection with his investing activities will not be treated as the consideration for the grant of the option. For example, if a small business investment company takes an active part in the management of its debtor small business company, the rendering of such management services will not be treated as the consideration for the granting of the option, provided such
services are rendered for an independent consideration, or are merely protective of the small business investment company's investment in the borrower. See paragraph (c) of § 1.421-6 for the meaning of the term “readily ascertainable fair market value.”
(c)
Statement required in connection with certain options.
(1) Any person acquiring any option to purchase securities (other than an option described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) shall attach a statement to his income tax return for the taxable year in which the option was acquired. For the definition of the term “securities”, see section 165(g)(2).
(2) The statement otherwise required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not be required with respect to the following options:
(i) Options subject to the rules contained in section 305(a) or section 421;
(ii) Options acquired as part of an investment unit consisting of an option and a debenture, note, or other similar obligation—
(
a
) If such unit is acquired as part of a public offering and the amount of money or its equivalent paid for such unit is not less than the public offering price, or
(
b
) If such unit is actively traded on an established market and the amount of money or its equivalent paid for such unit is not less than the price paid for such unit in contemporaneous purchases of such unit by persons independent of both the seller and the taxpayer;
(iii) Options acquired as part of a public offering, if the amount of money or its equivalent paid for such option is not less than the public offering price; and
(iv) Options which are actively traded on an established market and which are acquired for money or its equivalent at a price not less than the price paid for such options in contemporaneous purchases of such options by persons independent of both the seller and the taxpayer.
(3) The statement required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall contain the following information:
(i) Name and address of the taxpayer;
(ii) Description of the securities subject to the option (including number of shares of stock);
(iii) Period during which the option is exercisable;
(iv) Whether the option had a readily ascertainable fair market value at date of grant; and
(v) Whether the option is subject to paragraph (a) of this section.
(4) If the statement required by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph indicates either that the option is not subject to paragraph (a) of this section, or that the option is subject to paragraph (a) of this section but that such option had a readily ascertainable fair market value at date of grant, then such statement shall contain the following additional information:
(i) Option price;
(ii) Value at date of grant of securities subject to the option;
(iii) Restrictions (if any) on exercise or transfer of option;
(iv) Restrictions (if any) on transfer of securities subject to the option;
(v) Value of the option (if readily ascertainable);
(vi) How value of option was determined;
(vii) Amount of money (or its equivalent) paid for the option;
(viii) Person from whom the option was acquired;
(ix) A concise description of the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of the option and any other factors relied upon by the taxpayer to establish that the option is not subject to paragraph (a) of this section, or, if the option is treated by the taxpayer as subject to paragraph (a) of this section, that the option had a readily ascertainable fair market value at date of grant.
(d)
Effective date.
This section shall apply to options granted after July 11, 1963, other than options required to be granted pursuant to the terms of a written contract entered into on or before such date.
[T.D. 6696, 28 FR 13450, Dec. 12, 1963, as amended by T.D. 6706, 29 FR 2911, Mar. 3, 1964; T.D. 6984, 33 FR 19175, Dec. 24, 1968; T.D. 7554, 43 FR 31913, July 24, 1978]
§ 1.61-21
Taxation of fringe benefits.
(a)
Fringe benefits
—(1)
In general.
Section 61(a)(1) provides that, except as otherwise provided in subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, gross income includes compensation for services, including fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and similar items. For an outline of the regulations under this section relating to fringe benefits, see paragraph (a)(7) of this section. Examples of fringe benefits include: an employer-provided automobile, a flight on an employer-provided aircraft, an employer-provided free or discounted commercial airline flight, an employer-provided vacation, an employer-provided discount on property or services, an employer-provided membership in a country club or other social club, and an employer-provided ticket to an entertainment or sporting event.
(2)
Fringe benefits excluded from income.
To the extent that a particular fringe benefit is specifically excluded from gross income pursuant to another section of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, that section shall govern the treatment of that fringe benefit. Thus, if the requirements of the governing section are satisfied, the fringe benefits may be excludable from gross income. Examples of excludable fringe benefits include qualified tuition reductions provided to an employee (section 117(d)); meals or lodging furnished to an employee for the convenience of the employer (section 119); benefits provided under a dependent care assistance program (section 129); and no-additional-cost services, qualified employee discounts, working condition fringes, and de minimis fringes (section 132). Similarly, the value of the use by an employee of an employer-provided vehicle or a flight provided to an employee on an employer-provided aircraft may be excludable from income under section 105 (because, for example, the transportation is provided for medical reasons) if and to the extent that the requirements of that section are satisfied. Section 134 excludes from gross income “qualified military benefits.” An example of a benefit that is not a qualified military benefit is the personal use of an employer-provided vehicle. The fact that another section of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code addresses the taxation of a particular fringe benefit will not preclude section 61 and the regulations thereunder from applying, to the extent that they are not inconsistent with such other section. For example, many fringe benefits specifically addressed in other sections of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code are excluded from gross income only to the extent that they do not exceed specific dollar or percentage limits, or only if certain other requirements are met. If the limits are exceeded or the requirements are not met, some or all of the fringe benefit may be includible in gross income pursuant to section 61. See paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(3)
Compensation for services.
A fringe benefit provided in connection with the performance of services shall be considered to have been provided as compensation for such services. Refraining from the performance of services (such as pursuant to a covenant not to compete) is deemed to be the performance of services for purposes of this section.
(4)
Person to whom fringe benefit is taxable
—(i)
In general.
A taxable fringe benefit is included in the income of the person performing the services in connection with which the fringe benefit is furnished. Thus, a fringe benefit may be taxable to a person even though that person did not actually receive the fringe benefit. If a fringe benefit is furnished to someone other than the service provider such benefit is considered in this section as furnished to the service provider, and use by the other person is considered use by the service provider. For example, the provision of an automobile by an employer to an employee's spouse in connection with the performance of services by the employee is taxable to the employee. The automobile is considered available to the employee and use by the employee's spouse is considered use by the employee.
(ii)
All persons to whom benefits are taxable referred to as employees.
The person to whom a fringe benefit is taxable need not be an employee of the provider of the fringe benefit, but may be, for example, a partner, director, or an independent contractor. For convenience, the term “employee” includes
any person performing services in connection with which a fringe benefit is furnished, unless otherwise specifically provided in this section.
(5)
Provider of a fringe benefit referred to as an employer.
The “provider” of a fringe benefit is that person for whom the services are performed, regardless of whether that person actually provides the fringe benefit to the recipient. The provider of a fringe benefit need not be the employer of the recipient of the fringe benefit, but may be, for example, a client or customer of the employer or of an independent contractor. For convenience, the term “employer” includes any provider of a fringe benefit in connection with payment for the performance of services, unless otherwise specifically provided in this section.
(6)
Effective date.
Except as otherwise provided, this section is effective as of January 1, 1989 with respect to fringe benefits provided after December 31, 1988.

(b)
Valuation of fringe benefits
—(1)
In general.
An employee must include in gross income the amount by which the fair market value of the fringe benefit exceeds the sum of—
(i) The amount, if any, paid for the benefit by or on behalf of the recipient, and
(ii) The amount, if any, specifically excluded from gross income by some other section of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Therefore, for example, if the employee pays fair market value for what is received, no amount is includible in the gross income of the employee. In general, the determination of the fair market value of a fringe benefit must be made before subtracting out the amount, if any, paid for the benefit and the amount, if any, specifically excluded from gross income by another section of subtitle A. See paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (e)(1)(iii) of this section.
(2)
Fair market value.
In general, fair market value is determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances. Specifically, the fair market value of a fringe benefit is the amount that an individual would have to pay for the particular fringe benefit in an arm's-length transaction. Thus, for example, the effect of any special relationship that may exist between the employer and the employee must be disregarded. Similarly, an employee's subjective perception of the value of a fringe benefit is not relevant to the determination of the fringe benefit's fair market value nor is the cost incurred by the employer determinative of its fair market value. For special rules relating to the valuation of certain fringe benefits, see paragraph (c) of this section.
(3)
Exclusion from income based on cost.
If a statutory exclusion phrased in terms of cost applies to the provision of a fringe benefit, section 61 does not require the inclusion in the recipient's gross income of the difference between the fair market value and the excludable cost of that fringe benefit. For example, section 129 provides an exclusion from an employee's gross income for amounts contributed by an employer to a dependent care assistance program for employees. Even if the fair market value of the dependent care assistance exceeds the employer's cost, the excess is not subject to inclusion under section 61 and this section. However, if the statutory cost exclusion is a limited amount, the fair market value of the fringe benefit attributable to any excess cost is subject to inclusion. This would be the case, for example, where an employer pays or incurs a cost of more than $5,000 to provide dependent care assistance to an employee.
(4)
Fair market value of the availability of an employer-provided vehicle
—(i)
In general.
If the vehicle special valuation rules of paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this section do not apply with respect to an employer-provided vehicle, the value of the availability of that vehicle is determined under the general valuation principles set forth in this section. In general, that value equals the amount that an individual would have to pay in an arm's-length transaction to lease the same or comparable vehicle on the same or comparable conditions in the geographic area in which the vehicle is available for use. An example of a comparable condition is the amount of time that the vehicle is available to the employee for use, e.g., a one-year period. Unless the employee can substantiate that the same or comparable vehicle could have been leased on a cents-per-mile basis, the value of the availability of the vehicle cannot be computed by applying a cents-per-mile rate to the number of miles the vehicle is driven.
(ii)
Certain equipment excluded.
The fair market value of a vehicle does not include the fair market value of any specialized equipment not susceptible to personal use or any telephone that is added to or carried in the vehicle, provided that the presence of that equipment or telephone is necessitated by, and attributable to, the business needs of the employer. However, the value of specialized equipment must be included, if the employee to whom the vehicle is available uses the specialized
equipment in a trade or business of the employee other than the employee's trade or business of being an employee of the employer.
(5)
Fair market value of chauffeur services
—(i)
Determination of value
—(A)
In general.
The fair market value of chauffeur services provided to the employee by the employer is the amount that an individual would have to pay in an arm's-length transaction to obtain the same or comparable chauffeur services in the geographic area for the period in which the services are provided. In determining the applicable fair market value, the amount of time, if any, the chauffeur remains on-call to perform chauffeur services must be included. For example, assume that A, an employee of corporation M, needs a chauffeur to be on-call to provide services to A during a twenty-four hour period. If during that twenty-four hour period, the chauffeur actually drives A for only six hours, the fair market value of the chauffeur services would have to be the value of having a chauffeur on-call for a twenty-four hour period. The cost of taxi fare or limousine service for the six hours the chauffeur actually drove A would not be an accurate measure of the fair market value of chauffeur services provided to A. Moreover, all other aspects of the chauffeur's services (including any special qualifications of the chauffeur (e.g., training in evasive driving skills) or the ability of the employee to choose the particular chauffeur) must be taken into consideration.
(B)
Alternative valuation with reference to compensation paid.
Alternatively, the fair market value of the chauffeur services may be determined by reference to the compensation (as defined in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section) received by the chauffeur from the employer.
(C)
Separate valuation for chauffeur services.
The value of chauffeur services is determined separately from the value of the availability of an employer-provided vehicle.
(ii)
Definition of compensation
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(ii), the term “compensation” means compensation as defined in section 414(q)(7) and the fair market value of nontaxable lodging (if any) provided by the employer to the chauffeur in the current year.
(B)
Adjustments to compensation
—For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(ii), a chauffeur's compensation is reduced proportionately to reflect the amount of time during which the chauffeur performs substantial services for the employer other than as a chauffeur and is not on-call as a chauffeur. For example, assume a chauffeur is paid $25,000 a year for working a ten-hour day, five days a week and also receives $5,000 in nontaxable lodging. Further assume that during four hours of each day, the chauffeur is not on-call to perform services as a chauffeur because that individual is performing secretarial functions for the employer. Then, for purposes of determining the fair market value of this chauffeur's services, the employer may reduce the chauffeur's compensation by
4/10
or $12,000 (.4 × ($25,000 + $5,000) = $12,000). Therefore, in this example, the fair market value of the chauffeur's services is $18,000 ($30,000 −$12,000). However, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(ii), a chauffeur's compensation is not to be reduced by any amounts paid to the chauffeur for time spent “on-call,” even though the chauffeur actually performs other services for the employer during such time. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(ii), a determination that a chauffeur is performing substantial services for the employer other than as a chauffeur is based upon the facts and circumstances of each situation. An employee will be deemed to be performing substantial services for the employer other than as a chauffeur if a certain portion of each working day is regularly spent performing other services for the employer.
(iii)
Calculation of chauffeur services for personal purposes of the employee.
The fair market value of chauffeur services provided to the employee for personal purposes may be determined by multiplying the fair market value of chauffeur services, as determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(5)(i) (A) or (B) of this section, by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the sum of the hours spent by the chauffeur actually providing personal driving services to the employee and the hours spent by
the chauffeur in “personal on-call time,” and the denominator of which is equal to all hours the chauffeur spends in driving services of any kind paid for by the employer, including all hours that are “on-call.”
(iv)
Definition of on-call time.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term “on-call time” means the total amount of time that the chauffeur is not engaged in the actual performance of driving services, but during which time the chauffeur is available to perform such services. With respect to a round-trip, time spent by a chauffeur waiting for an employee to make a return trip is generally not treated as on-call time; rather such time is treated as part of the round-trip.
(v)
Definition of personal on-call time.
For purposes of this paragraph, the term “personal on-call time” means the amount of time outside the employee's normal working hours for the employer when the chauffeur is available to the employee to perform driving services.
(vi)
Presumptions.
(A) An employee's normal working hours will be presumed to consist of a ten hour period during which the employee usually conducts business activities for that employer.
(B) It will be presumed that if the chauffeur is on-call to provide driving services to an employee during the employee's normal working hours, then that on-call time will be performed for business purposes.
(C) Similarly, if the chauffeur is on-call to perform driving services to an employee after normal working hours, then that on-call time will be presumed to be “personal on-call time.”
(D) The presumptions set out in paragraph (b)(5)(vi) (A), (B), and (C) of this section may be rebutted. For example, an employee may demonstrate by adequate substantiation that his or her normal working hours consist of more than ten hours. Furthermore, if the employee keeps adequate records and is able to substantiate that some portion of the driving services performed by the chauffeur after normal working hours is attributable to business purposes, then personal on-call time may be reduced by an amount equal to such personal on-call time multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the time spent by the chauffeur after normal working hours driving the employee for business purposes, and the denominator of which is equal to the total time spent by the chauffeur driving the employee after normal working hours for all purposes.
(vii)
Examples.
The rules of this paragraph (b)(5) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
An employer makes available to employee A an automobile and a full-time chauffeur B (who performs no other services for A's employer) for an entire calendar year. Assume that the automobile lease valuation rule of paragraph (d) of this section is used and that the Annual Lease Value of the automobile is $9,250. Assume further that B's compensation for the year is $12,000 (as defined in section 414(q)(7)) and that B is furnished lodging with a value of $3,000 that is excludable from B's gross income. The maximum amount subject to inclusion in A's gross income for use of the automobile and chauffeur is therefore $24,250 ($12,000 + $3,000 + $9,250). If 70 percent of the miles placed on the automobile during the year are for A's employer's business, then $6,475 is excludable from A's gross income with respect to the automobile as a working condition fringe ($9,250 × .70). Thus, $2,775 is includible in A's gross income with respect to the automobile ($9,250−$6,475). With respect to the chauffeur, if 20 percent of the chauffeur's time is spent actually driving A or being on-call to drive A for personal purposes; then $3,000 is includible in A's income (.20 × $15,000). Eighty percent of $15,000, or $12,000, is excluded from A's income as a working condition fringe.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that in addition to providing chauffeur services, B is responsible for performing substantial non-chauffeur-related duties (such as clerical or secretarial functions) during which time B is not “on-call” as a chauffeur. If B spends only 75 percent of the time performing chauffeur services, then the maximum amount subject to inclusion in A's gross income for use of the automobile and chauffeur is $20,500 (($15,000 × .75) + $9,250). If B is actually driving A for personal purposes or is on-call to drive A for personal purposes for 20 percent of the time during which B is available to provide chauffeur services, then $2,250 is includible in A's gross income (.20 × $11,250). The income inclusion with respect to the automobile is the same as in example (1).

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2) except that while B is performing non-chauffeur-related duties, B is on call as A's chauffeur. No part of B's compensation is excluded when determining the value of the benefit provided to A. Thus, as in example
(1), $3,000 is includible in A's gross income with respect to the chauffeur.
(6)
Fair market value of a flight on an employer-provided piloted aircraft
—(i)
In general.
If the non-commercial flight special valuation rule of paragraph (g) of this section does not apply, the value of a flight on an employer-provided piloted aircraft is determined under the general valuation principles set forth in this paragraph.
(ii)
Value of flight.
If an employee takes a flight on an employer-provided piloted aircraft and that employee's flight is primarily personal (see § 1.162-2(b)(2)), the value of the flight is equal to the amount that an individual would have to pay in an arm's-length transaction to charter the same or a comparable piloted aircraft for that period for the same or a comparable flight. A flight taken under these circumstances may not be valued by reference to the cost of commercial airfare for the same or a comparable flight. The cost to charter the aircraft must be allocated among all employees on board the aircraft based on all the facts and circumstances unless one or more of the employees controlled the use of the aircraft. Where one or more employees control the use of the aircraft, the value of the flight shall be allocated solely among such controlling employees, unless a written agreement among all the employees on the flight otherwise allocates the value of such flight. Notwithstanding the allocation required by the preceding sentence, no additional amount shall be included in the income of any employee whose flight is properly valued under the special valuation rule of paragraph (g) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(6), “control” means the ability of the employee to determine the route, departure time and destination of the flight. The rules provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section will be used for purposes of this section in defining a flight. Notwithstanding the allocation required by the preceding sentence, no additional amount shall be included in the income of an employee for that portion of any such flight which is excludible from income pursuant to section 132(d) or § 1.132-5 as a working condition fringe.
(iii)
Examples.
The rules of paragraph (b)(6) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
An employer makes available to employees A and B a piloted aircraft in New York, New York. A wants to go to Los Angeles, California for personal purposes. B needs to go to Chicago, Illinois for business purposes, and then wants to go to Los Angeles, California for personal purposes. Therefore, the aircraft first flies to Chicago, and B deplanes and then boards the plane again. The aircraft then flies to Los Angeles, California where A and B deplane. The value of the flight to employee A will be no more than the amount that an individual would have to pay in an arm's length transaction to charter the same or a comparable piloted aircraft for the same or comparable flight from New York City to Los Angeles. No amount will be imputed to employee A for the stop at Chicago. As to employee B, the value of the personal flight will be no more than the value or the flight from Chicago to Los Angeles. Pursuant to the rules set forth in § 1.132-5(k), the flight from New York to Chicago will not be included in employee B's income since that flight was taken solely for business purposes. The charter cost must be allocated between A and B, since both employees controlled portions of the flight. Assume that the employer allocates according to the relative value of each employee's flight. If the charter value of A's flight from New York City to Los Angeles is $1,000 and the value of B's flight from Chicago to Los Angeles is $600 and the value of the actual flight from New York to Chicago to Los Angeles is $1,200, then the amount to be allocated to employee A is $750 ($1,000/($1,000 + $600) × $1,200) and the amount to be allocated to employee B is $450 ($600/($1000 + $600) × $1,200).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that employee A also deplanes at Chicago, Illinois, but for personal purposes. The value of the flight to employee A then becomes the value of a flight from New York to Chicago to Los Angeles,
i.e.
, $1,200. Therefore, the amount to be allocated to employee A is $800 ($1,200/($1,200 + $600) × $1,200) and the amount to be allocated to employee B is $400 ($600/($1,200 + $600) × $1,200).
(7)
Fair market value of the use of an employer-provided aircraft for which the employer does not furnish a pilot
—(i)
In general.
If the non-commercial flight special valuation rule of paragraph (g) of this section does not apply and if an employer provides an employee with the use of an aircraft without a pilot, the value of the use of the employer-provided aircraft is determined under
the general valuation principles set forth in this paragraph (b)(7).
(ii)
Value of flight.
In general, if an employee takes a flight on an employer-provided aircraft for which the employer does not furnish a pilot, the value of that flight is equal to the amount that an individual would have to pay in an arm's-length transaction to lease the same or comparable aircraft on the same or comparable terms for the same period in the geographic area in which the aircraft is used. For example, if an employer makes its aircraft available to an employee who will pilot the aircraft for a two-hour flight, the value of the use of the aircraft is the amount that an individual would have to pay in an arm's-length transaction to rent a comparable aircraft for that period in the geographic area in which the aircraft is used. As another example, assume that an employee uses an employer-provided aircraft to commute between home and work. The value of the use of the aircraft is the amount that an individual would have to pay in an arm's-length transaction to rent a comparable aircraft for commuting in the geographic area in which the aircraft is used. If the availability of the flight is of benefit to more than one employee, then such value shall be allocated among such employees on the basis of the relevant facts and circumstances.
(c)
Special valuation rules
—(1)
In general.
Paragraphs (d) through (k) of this section provide special valuation rules that may be used under certain circumstances for certain commonly provided fringe benefits. For general rules relating to the valuation of fringe benefits not eligible for valuation under the special valuation rules or fringe benefits with respect to which the special valuation rules are not used, see paragraph (b) of this section.
(2)
Use of the special valuation rules
—(i)
For benefits provided before January 1, 1993.
The special valuation rules may be used for income tax, employment tax, and reporting purposes. The employer has the option to use any of the special valuation rules. However, an employee may only use a special valuation rule if the employer uses the rule. Moreover, an employee may only use the special rule that the employer uses to value the benefit provided; the employee may not use another special rule to value that benefit. The employee may always use general valuation rules based on facts and circumstances (see paragraph (b) of this section) even if the employer uses a special rule. If a special rule is used, it must be used for all purposes. If an employer properly uses a special rule and the employee uses the special rule, the employee must include in gross income the amount determined by the employer under the special rule reduced by the sum of—
(A) Any amount reimbursed by the employee to the employer, and
(B) Any amount excludable from income under another section of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If an employer properly uses a special rule and properly determines the amount of an employee's working condition fringe under section 132 and § 1.132-5 (under the general rule or under a special rule), and the employee uses the special valuation rule, the employee must include in gross income the amount determined by the employer less any amount reimbursed by the employee to the employer. The employer and employee may use the special rules to determine the amount of the reimbursement due the employer by the employee. Thus, if an employee reimburses an employer for the value of a benefit as determined under a special valuation rule, no amount is includable in the employee's gross income with respect to the benefit. The provisions of this paragraph are effective for benefits provided before January 1, 1993.
(ii)
For benefits provided after December 31, 1992.
The special valuation rules may be used for income tax, employment tax, and reporting purposes. The employer has the option to use any of the special valuation rules. An employee may use a special valuation rule only if the employer uses that rule or the employer does not meet the condition of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, but one of the other conditions of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section is met. The employee may always use general valuation rules based on facts and circumstances (see paragraph (b) of this section) even if the employer uses
a special rule. If a special rule is used, it must be used for all purposes. If an employer properly uses a special rule and the employee uses the special rule, the employee must include in gross income the amount determined by the employer under the special rule reduced by the sum of—
(A) Any amount reimbursed by the employee to the employer; and
(B) Any amount excludable from income under another section of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If an employer properly uses a special rule and properly determines the amount of an employee's working condition fringe under section 132 and § 1.132-5 (under the general rule or under a special rule), and the employee uses the special valuation rule, the employee must include in gross income the amount determined by the employer less any amount reimbursed by the employee to the employer. The employer and employee may use the special rules to determine the amount of the reimbursement due the employer by the employee. Thus, if an employee reimburses an employer for the value of a benefit as determined under a special valuation rule, no amount is includible in the employee's gross income with respect to the benefit. The provisions of this paragraph are effective for benefits provided after December 31, 1992.
(iii)
Vehicle special valuation rules
—(A)
Vehicle by vehicle basis.
Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(7)(v) and (e)(5)(v) of this section, the vehicle special valuation rules of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section apply on a vehicle by vehicle basis. An employer need not use the same vehicle special valuation rule for all vehicles provided to all employees. For example, an employer may use the automobile lease valuation rule for automobiles provided to some employees, and the commuting and vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rules for automobiles provided to other employees. For purposes of valuing the use or availability of a vehicle, the consistency rules provided in paragraphs (d)(7) and (e)(5) of this section (relating to the automobile lease valuation rule and the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule, respectively) apply.
(B)
Shared vehicle usage.
If an employer provides a vehicle to employees for use by more than one employee at the same time, such as with an employer-sponsored vehicle commuting pool, the employer may use any of the special valuation rules that may be applicable to value the use of the vehicle by the employees. The employer must use the same special valuation rule to value the use of the vehicle by each employee who shares such use. The employer must allocate the value of the use of the vehicle based on the relevant facts and circumstances among the employees who share use of the vehicle. For example, assume that an employer provides an automobile to four of its employees and that the employees use the automobile in an employer-sponsored vehicle commuting pool. Assume further that the employer uses the automobile lease valuation rule of paragraph (d) of this section and that the Annual Lease Value of the automobile is $5,000.
The employer must treat $5,000 as the value of the availability of the automobile to the employees, and must apportion the $5,000 value among the employees who share the use of the automobile based on the relevant facts and circumstances. Each employee's share of the value of the availability of the automobile is then to be reduced by the amount, if any, of each employee's working condition fringe exclusion and the amount reimbursed by the employee to the employer.
(iv)
Commercial and noncommercial flight valuation rules.
Except as otherwise provided, if either the commercial flight valuation rule or the non-commercial flight valuation rule is used, that rule must be used by an employer to value all eligible flights taken by all employees in a calendar year. See paragraph (g)(14) of this section for the applicable consistency rules.
(3)
Additional rules for using special valuation
—(i)
Election to use special valuation rules for benefits provided before January 1, 1993.
A particular special valuation rule is deemed to have been elected by the employer (and, if applicable, by the employee), if the employer (and, if applicable, the employee) determines the value of the fringe benefit provided by applying the
special valuation rule and treats that value as the fair market value of the fringe benefit for income, employment tax, and reporting purposes. Neither the employer nor the employee must notify the Internal Revenue Service of the election. The provisions of this paragraph are effective for benefits provided before January 1, 1993.
(ii)
Conditions on the use of special valuation rules for benefits provided after December 31, 1992.
Neither the employer nor the employee may use a special valuation rule to value a benefit provided after December 31, 1992, unless one of the following conditions is satisfied—
(A) The employer treats the value of the benefit as wages for reporting purposes within the time for filing the returns for the taxable year (including extensions) in which the benefit is provided;
(B) The employee includes the value of the benefit in income within the time for filing the returns for the taxable year (including extensions) in which the benefit is provided;
(C) The employee is not a control employee as defined in paragraphs (f)(5) and (f)(6) of this section; or
(D) The employer demonstrates a good faith effort to treat the benefit correctly for reporting purposes.
(4)
Application of section 414 to employers.
For purposes of paragraphs (c) through (k) of this section, except as otherwise provided therein, the term “employer” includes all entities required to be treated as a single employer under section 414 (b), (c), (m), or (o).
(5)
Valuation formulae contained in the special valuation rules.
The valuation formula contained in the special valuation rules are provided only for use in connection with those rules. Thus, when a special valuation rule is properly applied to a fringe benefit, the Commissioner will accept the value calculated pursuant to the rule as the fair market value of that fringe benefit. However, when a special valuation rule is not properly applied to a fringe benefit (see, for example, paragraph (g)(13) of this section), or when a special valuation rule is used to value a fringe benefit by a taxpayer not entitled to use the rule, the fair market value of that fringe benefit may not be determined by reference to any value calculated under any special valuation rule. Under the circumstances described in the preceding sentence, the fair market value of the fringe benefit must be determined pursuant to the general valuation rules of paragraph (b) of this section.
(6)
Modification of the special valuation rules.
The Commissioner may, to the extent necessary for tax administration, add, delete, or modify any special valuation rule, including the valuation formulae contained herein, on a prospective basis by regulation, revenue ruling or revenue procedure.
(7)
Special accounting rule.
If the employer is using the special accounting rule provided in Announcement 85-113 (1985-31 I.R.B. 31, August 5, 1985) (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(
b
) of this chapter) (relating to the reporting of and withholding on the value of noncash fringe benefits), benefits which are deemed provided in a subsequent calendar year pursuant to that rule are considered as provided in that subsequent calendar year for purposes of the special valuation rules. Thus, if a particular special valuation rule is in effect for a calendar year, it applies to benefits deemed provided during that calendar year under the special accounting rule.
(d)
Automobile lease valuation rule
—(1)
In general
—(i)
Annual Lease Value.
Under the special valuation rule of this paragraph (d), if an employer provides an employee with an automobile that is available to the employee for an entire calendar year, the value of the benefit provided is the Annual Lease Value (determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section) of that automobile. Except as otherwise provided, for an automobile that is available to an employee for less than an entire calendar year, the value of the benefit provided is either a pro-rated Annual Lease Value or the Daily Lease Value (both as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section), whichever is applicable. Absent any statutory exclusion relating to the employer-provided automobile (see, for example, section 132(a)(3) and § 1.132-5(b)), the amount of the Annual Lease Value (or a pro-rated Annual Lease Value or the Daily Lease
Value, as applicable) is included in the gross income of the employee.
(ii)
Definition of automobile.
For purposes of this paragraph (d), the term “automobile” means any four-wheeled vehicle manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways.
(2)
Calculation of Annual Lease Value
—(i)
In general.
The Annual Lease Value of a particular automobile is calculated as follows:
(A) Determine the fair market value of the automobile as of the first date on which the automobile is made available to any employee of the employer for personal use. For an automobile first made available to any employee for personal use prior to January 1, 1985, determine the fair market value as of January l of the first year the special valuation rule of this paragraph (d) is used with respect to the automobile. For rules relating to determination of the fair market value of an automobile for purposes of this paragraph (d), see paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
(B) Select the dollar range in column 1 of the Annual Lease Value Table, set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section corresponding to the fair market value of the automobile. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d)(2) (iv) and (v) of this section, the Annual Lease Value for each year of availability of the automobile is the corresponding amount in column 2 of the Table.
(ii)
Calculation of Annual Lease Value of automobile owned or leased by both an employer and an employee
—(A)
Purchased automobiles.
Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, if an employee contributes an amount toward the purchase price of an automobile in return for a percentage ownership interest in the automobile, the Annual Lease Value or the Daily Lease Value, whichever is applicable, is determined by reducing the fair market value of the employer-provided automobile by the lesser of—
(
1
) The amount contributed, or
(
2
) An amount equal to the employee's percentage ownership interest multiplied by the unreduced fair market value of the automobile.
If the automobile is subsequently revalued, the revalued amount (determined without regard to this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A)) is reduced by an amount which is equal to the employee's percentage ownership interest in the vehicle). If the employee does not receive an ownership interest in the employer-provided automobile, then the Annual Lease Value or the Daily Lease Value, whichever is applicable, is determined without regard to any amount contributed. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A), an employee's ownership interest in an automobile will not be recognized unless it is reflected in the title of the automobile. An ownership interest reflected in the title of an automobile will not be recognized if under the facts and circumstances the title does not reflect the benefits and burdens of ownership.
(B)
Leased automobiles.
Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, if an employee contributes an amount toward the cost to lease an automobile in return for a percentage interest in the automobile lease, the Annual Lease Value or the Daily Lease Value, whichever is applicable, is determined by reducing the fair market value of the employer-provided automobile by the amount specified in the following sentence. The amount specified in this sentence is the unreduced fair market value of a vehicle multiplied by the lesser of—
(
1
) The employee's percentage interest in the lease, or
(
2
) A fraction, the numerator of which is the amount contributed and the denominator of which is the entire lease cost.
If the automobile is subsequently revalued, the revalued amount (determined without regard to this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B)) is reduced by an amount which is equal to the employee's percentage interest in the lease) multiplied by the revalued amount. If the employee does not receive an interest in the automobile lease, then the Annual Lease Value or the Daily Lease Value, whichever is applicable, is determined without regard to any amount contributed. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B), an employee's interest in an automobile lease will not be recognized unless the employee is a named co-lessee on the lease. An interest in a lease will not be
recognized if under the facts and circumstances the lease does not reflect the true obligations of the lessees.
(C)
Example.
The rules of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Assume that an employer pays $15,000 and an employee pays $5,000 toward the purchase of an automobile. Assume further that the employee receives a 25 percent interest in the automobile and is named as a co-owner on the title to the automobile. Under the rule of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the Annual Lease Value of the automobile is determined by reducing the fair market value of the automobile ($20,000) by the $5,000 employee contribution. Thus, the Annual Lease Value of the automobile under the table in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section is $4,350. If the employee in this example does not receive an ownership interest in the automobile and is provided the use of the automobile for two years, the Annual Lease Value would be determined without regard to the $5,000 employee contribution. Thus, the Annual Lease Value would be $5,600. The $5,000 employee contribution would reduce the amount includible in the employee's income after taking into account the amount, if any, excluded from income under another provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, such as the working condition fringe exclusion. Thus, if the employee places 50 percent of the mileage on the automobile for the employer's business each year, then the amount includible in the employee's income in the first year would be ($5,600-2,800-2,800), or $0, the amount includible in the employee's income in the second year would be ($5,600-2,800-2,200 ($5,000-2,800)) or $600 and the amount includible in the third year would be ($5,600-2,800) or $2,800 since the employee's contribution has been completely used in the first two years.

For vehicles having a fair market value in excess of $59,999, the Annual Lease Value is equal to: (.25 × the fair market value of the automobile) + $500.
(iv)
Recalculation of Annual Lease Value.
The Annual Lease Values determined under the rules of this paragraph (d) are based on four-year lease terms. Therefore, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section, the Annual Lease Value calculated by applying paragraph (d)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section shall remain in effect for the period that begins with the first date the special valuation rule of paragraph (d) of this section is applied by the employer to the automobile and ends on December 31 of the fourth full calendar year following that date. The Annual Lease Value for each subsequent four-year period is calculated by determining the fair market value of the automobile as of the first January 1 following the period described in the previous sentence and selecting the amount in column 2 of the Annual Lease Value Table corresponding to the appropriate dollar range in column 1 of the Table. If, however, the employer is using the special accounting rule provided in Announcement 85-113 (1985-31 I.R.B. 31, August 5, 1985) (relating to the reporting of and withholding on the
value of noncash fringe benefits), the employer may calculate the Annual Lease Value for each subsequent four-year period as of the beginning of the special accounting period that begins immediately prior to the January 1 described in the previous sentence. For example, assume that pursuant to Announcement 85-113, an employer uses the special accounting rule. Assume further that beginning on November 1, 1988, the special accounting period is November 1 to October 31 and that the employer elects to use the special valuation rule of this paragraph (d) as of January 1, 1989. The employer may recalculate the Annual Lease Value as of November 1, 1992, rather than as of January 1, 1993.
(v)
Transfer of the automobile to another employee.
Unless the primary purpose of the transfer is to reduce Federal taxes, if an employer transfers the use of an automobile from one employee to another employee, the employer may recalculate the Annual Lease Value based on the fair market value of the automobile as of January 1 of the calendar year of transfer. If, however, the employer is using the special accounting rule provided in Announcement 85-113 (1985-31 I.R.B. 31, August 5, 1985) (relating to the reporting of and withholding on the value of noncash fringe benefits), the employer may recalculate the Annual Lease Value based on the fair market value of the automobile as of the beginning of the special accounting period in which the transfer occurs. If the employer does not recalculate the Annual Lease Value, and the employee to whom the automobile is transferred uses the special valuation rule, the employee may not recalculate the Annual Lease Value.
(3)
Services included in, or excluded from, the Annual Lease Value Table
—(i)
Maintenance and insurance included.
The Annual Lease Values contained in the Annual Lease Value Table include the fair market value of maintenance of, and insurance for, the automobile. Neither an employer nor an employee may reduce the Annual Lease Value by the fair market value of any service included in the Annual Lease Value that is not provided by the employer, such as reducing the Annual Lease Value by the fair market value of a maintenance service contract or insurance. An employer or employee who wishes to take into account only the services actually provided with respect to an automobile may value the availability of the automobile under the general valuation rules of paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii)
Fuel excluded
—(A)
In general.
The Annual Lease Values do not include the fair market value of fuel provided by the employer, whether fuel is provided in kind or its cost is reimbursed by or charged to the employer. Thus, if an employer provides fuel, the fuel must be valued separately for inclusion in income.
(B)
Valuation of fuel provided in kind.
The provision of fuel in kind may be valued at fair market value based on all the facts and circumstances or, in the alternative, it may be valued at 5.5 cents per mile for all miles driven by the employee. However, the provision of fuel in kind may not be valued at 5.5 cents per mile for miles driven outside the United States, Canada or Mexico. For purposes of this section, the United States includes the United States, its possessions and its territories.
(C)
Valuation of fuel where cost reimbursed by or charged to an employer.
The fair market value of fuel, the cost of which is reimbursed by or charged to an employer, is generally the amount of the actual reimbursement or the amount charged, provided the purchase of the fuel is at arm's-length.
(D)
Fleet-average cents-per-mile fuel cost.
If an employer with a fleet of at least 20 automobiles that meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(5)(v)(D) of this section reimburses employees for the cost of fuel or allows employees to charge the employer for the cost of fuel, the fair market value of fuel provided to those automobiles may be determined by reference to the employer's fleet-average cents-per-mile fuel cost. The fleet-average cents-per-mile fuel cost is equal to the fleet-average per-gallon fuel cost divided by the fleet-average miles-per-gallon rate. The averages described in the preceding sentence must be determined by averaging the per-gallon fuel costs and miles-per-gallon rates of a representative sample of the automobiles in the fleet equal to the greater of ten percent
of the automobiles in the fleet or 20 automobiles for a representative period, such as a two-month period. In lieu of determining the fleet-average cents-per-mile fuel cost, if an employer is using the fleet-average valuation rule of paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section and if determining the amount of the actual reimbursement or the amount charged for the purchase of fuel would impose unreasonable administrative burdens on the employer, the provision of fuel may be valued under the rule provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
(iii)
Treatment of other services.
The fair market value of any service not specifically identified in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section that is provided by the employer with respect to an automobile (other than the services of a chauffeur) must be added to the Annual Lease Value of the automobile in determining the fair market value of the benefit provided. See paragraph (b) (5) of this section for rules relating to the valuation of chauffeur services.
(4)
Availability of an automobile for less than an entire calendar year
—(i)
Pro-rated Annual Lease Value used for continuous availability of at least 30 days
—(A)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, for periods of continuous availability of at least 30 days, but less than an entire calendar year, the value of the availability of an automobile provided by an employer electing to use the automobile lease valuation rule of this paragraph (d) is the pro-rated Annual Lease Value. The pro-rated Annual Lease Value is calculated by multiplying the applicable Annual Lease Value by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of availability and the denominator of which is 365.
(B)
Special rule for continuous availability of at least 30 days that straddles two reporting years.
If an employee is provided with the continuous availability of an automobile for at least 30 days, but the continuous period straddles two calendar years (or two special accounting periods if the special accounting rule of Announcement 85-113 (1985-31 I.R.B. 31, August 5, 1985) (relating to the reporting of and withholding on noncash fringe benefits) is used), the pro-rated Annual Lease Value, rather than the Daily Lease Value, may be applied with respect to such period of continuous availability.
(ii)
Daily Lease Value used for continuous availability of less than 30 days.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, for periods of continuous availability of one or more but less than 30 days, the value of the availability of the employer-provided automobile is the Daily Lease Value. The Daily Lease Value is calculated by multiplying the applicable Annual Lease Value by a fraction, the numerator of which is four times the number of days of availability and the denominator of which is 365.
(iii)
Election to treat all periods as periods of at least 30 days.
The value of the availability of an employer-provided automobile for a period of continuous availability of less than 30 days may be determined by applying the pro-rated Annual Lease Value by treating the automobile as if it had been available for 30 days, if doing so would result in a lower valuation than applying the Daily Lease Value to the shorter period of actual availability.
(iv)
Periods of unavailability
—(A)
General rule.
In general, a pro-rated Annual Lease Value (as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section) is used to value the availability of an employer-provided automobile when the automobile is available to an employee for a continuous period of at least 30 days but less than the entire calendar year. Neither an employer nor an employee, however, may use a pro-rated Annual Lease Value when the reduction of Federal taxes is the primary reason the automobile is unavailable to an employee at certain times during the calendar year.
(B)
Unavailability for personal reasons of the employee.
If an automobile is unavailable to an employee because of personal reasons of the employee, such as while the employee is on vacation, a pro-rated Annual Lease Value, if used, must not take into account such periods of unavailability. For example, assume that an automobile is available to an employee during the first five months of the year and during the last five months of the year. Assume further that the period of unavailability
occurs because the employee is on vacation. The Annual Lease Value, if it is applied, must be applied with respect to the entire 12-month period. The Annual Lease Value may not be pro-rated to take into account the two-month period of unavailability.
(5)
Fair market value
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of determining the Annual Lease Value of an automobile under the Annual Lease Value Table, the fair market value of an automobile is the amount that an individual would have to pay in an arm's-length transaction to purchase the particular automobile in the jurisdiction in which the vehicle is purchased or leased. That amount includes all amounts attributable to the purchase of an automobile such as sales tax and title fees as well as the purchase price of the automobile. Any special relationship that may exist between the employee and the employer must be disregarded. Also, the employee's subjective perception of the value of the automobile is not relevant to the determination of the automobile's fair market value, and, except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, the cost incurred by the employer in connection with the purchase or lease of the automobile is not determinative of the fair market value of the automobile.
(ii)
Safe-harbor valuation rule
—(A)
General rule.
For purposes of calculating the Annual Lease Value of an automobile under this paragraph (d), the safe-harbor value of the automobile may be used as the fair market value of the automobile.
(B)
Automobiles owned by the employer.
For an automobile owned by the employer, the safe-harbor value of the automobile is the employer's cost of purchasing the automobile (including sales tax, title, and other expenses attributable to such purchase), provided the purchase is made at arm's-length. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the safe-harbor value of this paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) is not available with respect to an automobile manufactured by the employer. Thus, for example, if one entity manufactures an automobile and sells it to an entity with which it is aggregated pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, this paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) does not apply to value the automobile by the aggregated employer. In this case, value must be determined under paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section.
(C)
Automobiles leased by the employer.
For an automobile leased but not manufactured by the employer, the safe-harbor value of the automobile is either the manufacturer's suggested retail price of the automobile less eight percent (including sales tax, title, and other expenses attributable to such purchase), or the value determined under paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section.
(iii)
Use of nationally recognized pricing sources.
The fair market value of an automobile that is—
(A) Provided to an employee prior to January 1, 1985,
(B) Being revalued pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) (iv) or (v) of this section, or
(C) A leased automobile being valued pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, may be determined by reference to the retail value of such automobile as reported by a nationally recognized pricing source that regularly reports new or used automobile retail values, whichever is applicable. That retail value must be reasonable with respect to the automobile being valued. Pricing sources consist of publications and electronic data bases.
(iv)
Fair market value of special equipment.
When determining the fair market value of an automobile, the employer may exclude the fair market value of any specialized equipment or telephone that is added to or carried in the automobile provided that the presence of that equipment or telephone is necessitated by, and attributable to, the business needs of the employer. The value of the specialized equipment must be included if the employee to whom the automobile is available uses the specialized equipment in a trade or business of the employee other than the employee's trade or business of being an employee of the employer.
(v)
Fleet-average valuation rule
—(A)
In general.
An employer with a fleet of 20 or more automobiles meeting the requirements of this paragraph (d)(5)(v) (including the business-use and fair market value conditions of paragraph (d)(5)(v)(D) of this section) may use a
fleet-average value for purposes of calculating the Annual Lease Values of the automobiles in the fleet. The fleet-average value is the average of the fair market values of all automobiles in the fleet. The fair market value of each automobile in the fleet shall be determined, pursuant to the rules of paragraphs (d)(5) (i) through (iv) of this section, as of the date described in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section.
(B)
Period for use of rule.
The fleet-average valuation rule of this paragraph (d)(5)(v) may be used by an employer as of January 1 of any calendar year following the calendar year in which the employer acquires a sufficient number of automobiles to total a fleet of 20 or more automobiles. The Annual Lease Value calculated for the automobiles in the fleet, based on the fleet-average value, shall remain in effect for the period that begins with the first January 1 the fleet-average valuation ru1e of this paragraph (d)(5)(v) is applied by the employer to the automobiles in the fleet and ends on December 31 of the subsequent calendar year. The Annual Lease Value for each subsequent two-year period is calculated by determining the fleet-average value of the automobiles in the fleet as of the first January 1 of such period. An employer may cease using the fleet-average valuation rule as of any January 1. If, however, the employer is using the special accounting rule provided in Announcement 85-113 (1985-31 I.R.B. 31, August 5, 1985) (relating to the reporting of and withholding on noncash fringe benefits), the employer may apply the rules of this paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) on the basis of the special accounting period rather than the calendar year. (This is accomplished by substituting (
1
) the beginning of the special accounting period that begins immediately prior to the January 1 described in this paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) for January 1 wherever it appears in this paragraph (d)(5)(v) (B) and (
2
) the end of such accounting period for December 31.) If the number of qualifying automobiles in the employer's fleet declines to fewer than 20 for more than 50 percent of the days in a year, then the fleet-average valuation rule does not apply as of January 1 of such year. In this case, the Annual Lease Value must be determined separately for each remaining automobile. The revaluation rules of paragraphs (d)(2) (iv) and (v) of this section do not apply to automobiles valued under this paragraph (d)(5)(v).
(C)
Automobiles included in the fleet.
An employer may include in a fleet any automobile that meets the requirements of this paragraph (d)(5)(v) and is available to any employee of the employer for personal use. An employer may include in the fleet only automobiles the availability of which is valued under the automobile lease valuation rule of this paragraph (d). An employer need not include in the fleet all automobiles valued under the automobile lease valuation rule. An employer may have more than one fleet for purposes of the fleet-average rule of this paragraph (d)(5)(v). For example, an employer may group automobiles in a fleet according to their physical type or use.
(D)
Limitations on use of fleet-average rule.
The rule provided in this paragraph (d)(5)(v) may not be used for any automobile the fair market value of which (determined pursuant to paragraphs (d)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section as of the first date on which the automobile is made available to any employee of the employer for personal use) exceeds $50,000, as adjusted by section 280F(d)(7). The first such adjustment shall be for calendar year 2019. In addition, the rule provided in this paragraph (d)(5)(v) may only be used for automobiles that the employer reasonably expects will regularly be used in the employer's trade or business. For rules concerning when an automobile is regularly used in the employer's business, see paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section.
(E)
Additional automobiles added to the fleet.
The fleet-average value in effect at the time an automobile is added to a fleet is treated as the fair market value of the additional automobile for purposes of determining the Annual Lease Value of the automobile until the fleet-average value changes pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) of this section.
(F)
Use of the fleet-average rule by employees.
An employee may only use the fleet-average rule if it is used by the employer. If an employer uses the
fleet-average rule, and the employee uses the special valuation rule of paragraph (d) of this section, the employee must use the fleet-average value determined by the employer.
(G)
Transition rule for 2018 and 2019.
Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) of this section, an employer that did not qualify to use the fleet-average valuation rule prior to January 1, 2018, with respect to any automobile (including a truck or van) because the fair market value of the vehicle exceeded the inflation-adjusted maximum value requirement of paragraph (d)(5)(v)(D) of this section, as published by the Service in a notice or revenue procedure applicable to the year the vehicle was first made available to any employee of the employer, may adopt the fleet-average valuation rule for 2018 or 2019 with respect to the vehicle, provided the fair market value of the vehicle does not exceed $50,000 on January 1, 2018, or $50,400 on January 1, 2019, respectively.
(H)
Applicability date.
Paragraphs (d)(5)(v)(D), and (G) of this section apply to taxable years beginning on or after February 5, 2020. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this paragraph (d)(5)(v)(H), any taxpayer may choose to apply paragraph (d)(5)(v)(G) of this section beginning on or after January 1, 2018.
(6)
Special rules for continuous availability of certain automobiles
—(i)
Fleet automobiles.
If an employer is using the fleet-average valuation ru1e of paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section and the employer provides an employee with the continuous availability of an automobile from the same fleet during a period (though not necessarily the same fleet automobile for the entire period), the employee is treated as having the use of a single fleet automobile for the entire period, e.g., an entire calendar year. Thus, when applying the automobile lease valuation rule of this paragraph (d), the employer may treat the fleet-average value as the fair market value of the automobile deemed available to the employee for the period for purposes of calculating the Annual Lease Value, (or pro-rated Annual Lease Value or Daily Lease Value whichever is applicable) of the automobile. If an employer provides an employee with the continuous availability of more than one fleet automobile during a period, the employer may treat the fleet-average value as the fair market value of each automobile provided to the employee provided that the rules of paragraph (d)(5)(v)(D) of this section are satisfied.
(ii)
Demonstration automobiles
—(A)
In general.
If an automobile dealership provides an employee with the continuous availability of a demonstration automobile (as defined in § 1.132-5(o)(3)) during a period (though not necessarily the same demonstration automobile for the entire period), the employee is treated as having the use of a single demonstration automobile for the entire period, e.g., an entire calendar year. If an employer provides an employee with the continuous availability of more than one demonstration automobile during a period, the employer may treat the value determined under paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section as the fair market value of each automobile provided to the employee. For rules relating to the treatment as a working condition fringe of the qualified automobile demonstration use of a demonstration automobile by a full-time automobile salesman, see § 1.132-5(o).
(B)
Determining the fair market value of a demonstration automobile.
When applying the automobile lease valuation rule of this paragraph (d), the employer may treat the average of the fair market values of the demonstration automobiles which are available to an employee and held in the dealership's inventory during the calendar year as the fair market value of the demonstration automobile deemed available to the employee for the period for purposes of calculating the Annual Lease Value of the automobile. If under the facts and circumstances it is inappropriate to take into account, with respect to an employee, certain models of demonstration automobiles, the value of the benefit is determined without reference to the fair market values of such models. For example, assume that an employee has the continuous availability for an entire calendar year of one demonstration automobile, although not the same one for the entire
year. Assume further that the fair market values of the automobiles in the dealership inventory during the year range from $8,000 to $20,000. If there is not a substantial period (such as three months) during the year when the employee uses demonstration automobiles valued at less than $16,000, then those automobiles are not considered in determining the value of the benefit provided to the employee. In this case, the average of the fair market values of the demonstration automobiles in the dealership's inventory valued at $16,000 or more is treated as the fair market value of the automobile deemed available to the employee for the calendar year for purposes of calculating the Annual Lease Value of the automobile.
(7)
Consistency rules
—(i)
Use of the automobile lease valuation rule by an employer.
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(v)(B) of this section, an employer may adopt the automobile lease valuation rule of this paragraph (d) for an automobile only if the rule is adopted to take effect by the later of—
(A) January 1, 1989, or
(B) The first day on which the automobile is made available to an employee of the employer for personal use (or, if the commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section is used when the automobile is first made available to an employee of the employer for personal use, the first day on which the commuting valuation rule is not used).
(ii)
An employer must use the automobile lease valuation rule for all subsequent years.
Once the automobile lease valuation rule has been adopted for an automobile by an employer, the rule must be used by the employer for all subsequent years in which the employer makes the automobile available to any employee except that the employer may, for any year during which (or for any employee for whom) use of the automobile qualifies for the commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section, use the commuting valuation rule with respect to the automobile.
(iii)
Use of the automobile lease valuation rule by an employee.
An employee may adopt the automobile lease valuation rule for an automobile only if the rule is adopted—
(A) By the employer, and
(B) Beginning with the first day on which the automobile for which the employer (consistent with paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section) adopted the rule is made available to that employee for personal use (or, if the commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section is used when the automobile is first made available to that employee for personal use, the first day on which the commuting valuation rule is not used).
(iv)
An employee must use the automobile lease valuation rule for all subsequent years.
Once the automobile lease valuation rule has been adopted for an automobile by an employee, the rule must be used by the employee for all subsequent years in which the automobile for which the rule is used is available to the employee. However, the employee may, for any year during which use of the automobile qualifies for use of the commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section and for which the employer uses such rule, use the commuting valuation rule with respect to the automobile.
(v)
Replacement automobiles.
Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph (d)(7) to the contrary, if the automobile lease valuation rule is used by an employer, or by an employer and an employee, with respect to a particular automobile, and a replacement automobile is provided to the employee for the primary purpose of reducing Federal taxes, then the employer, or the employer and the employee, using the rule must continue to use the rule with respect to the replacement automobile.
(e)
Vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule
—(1)
In general
—(i)
General rule.
Under the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule of this paragraph (e), if an employer provides an employee with the use of a vehicle that—
(A) The employer reasonably expects will be regularly used in the employer's trade or business throughout the calendar year (or such shorter period as the vehicle may be owned or leased by the employer), or
(B) Satisfies the requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the value of the benefit provided in the calendar year is the standard mileage rate provided in the applicable Revenue
Ruling or Revenue Procedure (“cents-per-mile rate”) multiplied by the total number of miles the vehicle is driven by the employee for personal purposes. The cents-per-mile rate is to be applied prospectively from the first day of the taxable year following the date of publication of the applicable Revenue Ruling or Revenue Procedure. An employee who uses an employer-provided vehicle, in whole or in part, for a trade or business other than the employer's trade or business, may take a deduction for such business use based upon the vehicle cents-per-mile rule as long as such deduction is at the same standard mileage rate as that used in calculating the employee's income inclusion. The standard mileage rate must be applied to personal miles independent of business miles. Thus, for example, if the standard mileage rate were 24 cents per mile for the first 15,000 miles and 11 cents per mile for all miles over 15,000 and an employee drives 20,000 personal miles and 45,000 business miles in a year, the value of the personal use of the vehicle is $4,150 ((15,000 × $.24) + (5,000 × $.11)). For purposes of this section, the use of a vehicle for personal purposes is any use of the vehicle other than use in the employee's trade or business of being an employee of the employer.
(ii)
Mileage rule.
A vehicle satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (e)(1)(ii) for a calendar year if—
(A) It is actually driven at least 10,000 miles in that year; and
(B) Use of the vehicle during the year is primarily by employees. For example, if a vehicle is used by only one employee during the calendar year and that employee drives the vehicle at least 10,000 miles during the year, the vehicle satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (e)(1)(ii) even if all miles driven by the employee are personal. A vehicle is considered used during the year primarily by employees in accordance with the requirement of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section if employees use the vehicle on a consistent basis for commuting. If the employer does not own or lease the vehicle during a portion of the year, the 10,000 mile threshold is to be reduced proportionately to reflect the periods when the employer did not own or lease the vehicle. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(1)(ii), use of the vehicle by an individual (other than the employee) whose use would be taxed to the employee is not considered use by the employee.
(iii)
Limitation on use of the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule
—(A)
In general.
The value of the use of an automobile (as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section) may not be determined under the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule of this paragraph (e) for a calendar year if the fair market value of the automobile (determined pursuant to paragraphs (d)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section as of the first date on which the automobile is made available to any employee of the employer for personal use) exceeds $50,000, as adjusted by section 280F(d)(7). The first such adjustment shall be for calendar year 2019.
(B)
Application of limitation with respect to a vehicle owned by both an employer and an employee.
If an employee contributes an amount towards the purchase price of a vehicle in return for a percentage ownership interest in the vehicle, for purposes of determining whether the limitation of this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) applies, the fair market value of the vehicle is reduced by the lesser of—
(
1
) The amount contributed, or
(
2
) An amount equal to the employee's percentage ownership interest multiplied by the unreduced fair market value of the vehicle. If the employee does not receive an ownership interest in the employer-provided vehicle, then the fair market value of the vehicle is determined without regard to any amount contributed. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(B), an employee's ownership interest in a vehicle will not be recognized unless it is reflected in the title of the vehicle. An ownership interest reflected in the title of a vehicle will not be recognized if under the facts and circumstances the title does not reflect the benefits and burdens of ownership.
(C)
Application of limitation with respect to a vehicle leased by both an employer and employee.
If an employee contributes an amount toward the cost to lease a vehicle in return for a percentage interest in the vehicle lease,
for purposes of determining whether the limitation of this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) applies, the fair market value of the vehicle is reduced by the amount specified in the following sentence. The amount specified in this sentence is the unreduced fair market value of a vehicle multiplied by the lesser of—
(
1
) The employee's percentage interest in the lease, or
(
2
) A fraction, the numerator of which is the amount contributed and the denominator of which is the entire lease cost. If the employee does not receive an interest in the vehicle lease, then the fair market value is determined without regard to any amount contributed. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(C), an employee's interest in a vehicle lease will not be recognized unless the employee is a named co-lessee on the lease. An interest in a lease will not be recognized if under the facts and circumstances, the lease does not reflect the true obligations of the lessees.
(iv)
Regular use in an employer's trade or business.
Whether a vehicle is regularly used in an employer's trade or business is determined on the basis of all facts and circumstances. A vehicle is considered regularly used in an employer's trade or business for purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A) of this section if one of the following safe harbor conditions is satisfied:
(A) At least 50 percent of the vehicle's total annual mileage is for the employer's business; or
(B) The vehicle is generally used each workday to transport at least three employees of the employer to and from work in an employer-sponsored commuting vehicle pool. Infrequent business use of the vehicle, such as for occasional trips to the airport or between the employer's multiple business premises, does not constitute regular use of the vehicle in the employer's trade or business.
(v)
Application of rule to shared usage.
If an employer regularly provides a vehicle to employees for use by more than one employee at the same time, such as with an employer-sponsored vehicle commuting pool, the employer may use the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule to value the use of the vehicle by each employee who shares such use. See § 1.61-21(c)(2)(ii)(B) for provisions relating to the allocation of the value of an automobile to more than one employee.
(2)
Definition of vehicle.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term “vehicle” means any motorized wheeled vehicle manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways. The term “vehicle” includes an automobile as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
(3)
Services included in, or excluded from, the cents-per-mile rate
—(i)
Maintenance and insurance included.
The cents-per-mile rate includes the fair market value of maintenance of, and insurance for, the vehicle. The cents-per-mile rate may not be reduced by the fair market value of any service included in the cents-per-mile rate but not provided by the employer. An employer or employee who wishes to take into account only the particular services provided with respect to a vehicle may value the availability of the vehicle under the general valuation rules of paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii)
Fuel provided by the employer
—(A)
Miles driven in the United States, Canada, or Mexico.
With respect to miles driven in the United States, Canada, or Mexico, the cents-per-mile rate includes the fair market value of fuel provided by the employer. If fuel is not provided by the employer, the cents-per-mile rate may be reduced by no more than 5.5 cents or the amount specified in any applicable Revenue Ruling or Revenue Procedure. For purposes of this section, the United States includes the United States, its possessions and its territories.
(B)
Miles driven outside the United States, Canada, or Mexico.
With respect to miles driven outside the United States, Canada, or Mexico, the fair market value of fuel provided by the employer is not reflected in the cents-per-mile rate. Accordingly, the cents-per-mile rate may be reduced but by no more than 5.5 cents or the amount specified in any applicable Revenue Ruling or Revenue Procedure. If the employer provides the fuel in kind, it must be valued based on all the facts and circumstances. If the employer reimburses the employee for the cost of fuel or allows the employee to charge
the employer for the cost of fuel, the fair market value of the fuel is generally the amount of the actual reimbursement or the amount charged, provided the purchase of fuel is at arm's length.
(iii)
Treatment of other services.
The fair market value of any service not specifically identified in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section that is provided by the employer with respect to a vehicle is not reflected in the cents-per-mile rate. See paragraph (b)(5) of this section for rules relating to valuation of chauffeur services.
(4)
Valuation of personal use only.
The vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule of this paragraph (e) may only be used to value the miles driven for personal purposes. Thus, the employer must include an amount in an employee's income with respect to the use of a vehicle that is equal to the product of the number of personal miles driven by the employee and the appropriate cents-per-mile rate. The term “personal miles” means all miles for which the employee used the automobile except miles driven in the employee's trade or business of being an employee of the employer. Unless additional services are provided with respect to the vehicle (see paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section), the employer may not include in income a greater amount; for example, the employer may not include in income 100 percent (all business and personal miles) of the value of the use of the vehicle.
(5)
Consistency rules
—(i)
Use of the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule by an employer.
An employer must adopt the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule of this paragraph (e) for a vehicle to take effect by the first day on which the vehicle is used by an employee of the employer for personal use (or, if the commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section is used when the vehicle is first used by an employee of the employer for personal use, the first day on which the commuting valuation rule is not used).
(ii)
An employer must use the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule for all subsequent years.
Once the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule has been adopted for a vehicle by an employer, the rule must be used by the employer for all subsequent years in which the vehicle qualifies for use of the rule, except that the employer may, for any year during which use of the vehicle qualifies for the commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section, use the commuting valuation rule with respect to the vehicle. If the vehicle fails to qualify for use of the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule during a subsequent year, the employer may adopt for such subsequent year and thereafter any other special valuation rule for which the vehicle then qualifies. If the employer elects to use the automobile lease valuation rule of paragraph (d) of this section for a period in which the automobile does not qualify for use of the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule, then the employer must comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(7) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (d)(7) of this section, the first day on which the automobile with respect to which the vehicle cents-per-mile rule had been used fails to qualify for use of the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule may be deemed to be the first day on which the automobile is available to an employee of the employer for personal use.
(iii)
Use of the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule by an employee.
An employee may adopt the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule for a vehicle only if the rule is adopted—
(A) By the employer, and
(B) Beginning with respect to the first day on which the vehicle for which the employer (consistent with paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section) adopted the rule is available to that employee for personal use (or, if the commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section is used when the vehicle is first used by an employee for personal use, the first day on which the commuting valuation rule is not used).
(iv)
An employee must use the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule for all subsequent years.
Once the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule has been adopted for a vehicle by an employee, the rule must be used by the employee for all subsequent years of personal use of the vehicle by the employee for which the rule is used by the employer. However, see paragraph (f) of this section for
rules relating to the use of the commuting valuation rule for a subsequent year.
(v)
Replacement vehicles.
Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph (e)(5) to the contrary, if the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule is used by an employer, or by an employer and an employee, with respect to a particular vehicle. and a replacement vehicle is provided to the employee for the primary purpose of reducing Federal taxes, then the employer, or the employer and the employee, using the rule must continue to use the rule with respect to the replacement vehicle if the replacement vehicle qualifies for use of the rule.
(vi)
Transition rule for 2018 and 2019.
For a vehicle first made available to any employee of an employer for personal use before calendar year 2018, an employer that did not qualify under this paragraph (e)(5) to adopt the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule on the first day on which the vehicle is used by the employee for personal use because the fair market value of the vehicle exceeded the inflation-adjusted limitation of paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, as published by the Service in a notice or revenue procedure applicable to the year the vehicle was first used by the employee for personal use, may first adopt the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule for the 2018 or 2019 taxable year, provided the fair market value of the vehicle does not exceed $50,000 on January 1, 2018, or $50,400 on January 1, 2019, respectively. Similarly, for a vehicle first made available to any employee of the employer for personal use before calendar year 2018, if the commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section was used when the vehicle was first used by the employee for personal use, and the employer did not qualify to switch to the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule of this paragraph (e) on the first day on which the commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section was not used because the vehicle had a fair market value in excess of the inflation-adjusted limitation of paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, as published by the Service in a notice or revenue procedure applicable to the year the commuting valuation rule was first not used, the employer may adopt the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule for the 2018 or 2019 taxable year, provided the fair market value of the vehicle does not exceed $50,000 on January 1, 2018, or $50,400 on January 1, 2019, respectively. However, in accordance with paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section, an employer that adopts the vehicle cents-per-mile valuation rule pursuant to this paragraph (e)(5)(vi) must continue to use the rule for all subsequent years in which the vehicle qualifies for use of the rule, except that the employer may, for any year during which use of the vehicle qualifies for the commuting valuation rule of paragraph (f) of this section, use the commuting valuation rule with regard to the vehicle.
(6)
Applicability date.
Paragraphs (e)(1)(iii)(A) and (e)(5)(i) and (vi) of this section apply to taxable years beginning on or after February 5, 2020. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this paragraph (e)(6), any taxpayer may choose to apply paragraph (e)(5)(vi) of this section beginning on or after January 1, 2018.
(f)
Commuting valuation rule
—(1)
In general.
Under the commuting valuation rule of this paragraph (f), the value of the commuting use of an employer-provided vehicle may be determined pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) of this section if the following criteria are met by the employer and employees with respect to the vehicle:
(i) The vehicle is owned or leased by the employer and is provided to one or more employees for use in connection with the employer's trade or business and is used in the employer's trade or business;
(ii) For bona fide noncompensatory business reasons, the employer requires the employee to commute to and/or from work in the vehicle;
(iii) The employer has established a written policy under which neither the employee, nor any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, may use the vehicle for personal purposes, other than for commuting or de minimis personal use (such as a stop for a personal errand on the way between a business delivery and the employee's home);
(iv) Except for de minimis personal use, the employee does not use the vehicle for any personal purpose other than commuting; and
(v) The employee required to use the vehicle for commuting is not a control employee of the employer (as defined in paragraphs (f) (5) and (6) of this section).
Personal use of a vehicle is all use of the vehicle by an employee that is not used in the employee's trade or business of being an employee of the employer. An employer-provided vehicle that is generally used each workday to transport at least three employees of the employer to and from work in an employer-sponsored commuting vehicle pool is deemed to meet the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.
(2)
Special rules.
Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (f)(1) of this section to the contrary, the following special rules apply—
(i)
Chauffeur-driven vehicles.
If a vehicle is chauffeur-driven, the commuting valuation rule of this paragraph (f) may not be used to value the commuting use of any person (other than the chauffeur) who rides in the vehicle. (See paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section for other vehicle special valuation rules.) The special rule of this paragraph (f) may be used to value the commuting-only use of the vehicle by the chauffeur if the conditions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section are satisfied. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), an individual will not be considered a chauffeur if he or she performs non-driving services for the employer, is not available to perform driving services while performing such other services and whose only driving services consist of driving a vehicle used for commuting by other employees of the employer.
(ii)
Control employee exception.
If the vehicle in which the employee is required to commute is not an automobile as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the restriction of paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section (relating to control employees) does not apply.
(3)
Commuting value
—(i)
$1.50 per one-way commute.
If the requirements of this paragraph (f) are satisfied, the value of the commuting use of an employer-provided vehicle is $1.50 per one-way commute (e.g., from home to work or from work to home). The value provided in this paragraph (f)(3) includes the value of any goods or services directly related to the vehicle (e.g., fuel).
(ii)
Value per employee.
If there is more than one employee who commutes in the vehicle, such as in the case of an employer-sponsored commuting vehicle pool, the amount includible in the income of each employee is $1.50 per one-way commute. Thus, the amount includible for each round-trip commute is $3.00 per employee. See paragraphs (d)(7)(vi) and (e)(5)(vi) of this section for use of the automobile lease valuation and vehicle cents-per-mile valuation special rules for valuing the use or availability of the vehicle in the case of an employer-sponsored vehicle or automobile commuting pool.
(4)
Definition of vehicle.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), the term “vehicle” means any motorized wheeled vehicle manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways. The term “vehicle” includes an automobile as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
(5)
Control employee defined—Non-government employer.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), a control employee of a non-government employer is any employee—
(i) Who is a Board- or shareholder-appointed, confirmed, or elected officer of the employer whose compensation equals or exceeds $50,000,
(ii) Who is a director of the employer,
(iii) Whose compensation equals or exceeds $100,000, or
(iv) Who owns a one-percent or greater equity, capital, or profits interest in the employer.
For purposes of determining who is a one-percent owner under paragraph (f)(5)(iv) of this section, any individual who owns (or is considered as owning under section 318(a) or principles similar to section 318(a) for entities other than corporations) one percent or more of the fair market value of an entity (the “owned entity”) is considered a one-percent owner of all entities which would be aggregated with the owned entity under the rules of section 414
(b), (c), (m), or (o). For purposes of determining who is an officer or director with respect to an employer under this paragraph (f)(5), notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, if an entity would be aggregated with other entities under the rules of section 414 (b), (c), (m), or (o), the officer definition (but not the compensation requirement) and the director definition apply to each such separate entity rather tha to the aggregated employer. An employee who is an officer or a director of an entity (the “first entity”) shall be treated as an officer or a director of all entities aggregated with the first entity under the rules of section 414 (b), (c), (m), or (o). Instead of applying the control employee definition of this paragraph (f)(5), an employer may treat all, and only, employees who are “highly compensated” employees (as defined in § 1.132-8(g)) as control employees for purposes of this paragraph (f).
(6)
Control employee defined—Government employer.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), a control employee of a government employer is any—
(i) Elected official, or
(ii) Employee whose compensation equals or exceeds the compensation paid to a Federal Government employee holding a position at Executive Level V, determined under Chapter 11 of title 2, United States Code, as adjusted by section 5318 of title 5 United States Code.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), the term “government” includes any Federal, state or local governmental unit, and any agency or instrumentality thereof. Instead of applying the control employee definition of paragraph (f)(6), an employer may treat all and only employees who are “highly compensated” employees (as defined in § 1.132-8(f)) as control employees for purposes of this paragraph (f).
(7)
“Compensation” defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (f), the term “compensation” has the same meaning as in section 414(q)(7). Compensation includes all amounts received from all entities treated as a single employer under section 414 (b), (c), (m), or (o). Levels of compensation shall be adjusted at the same time and in the same manner as provided in section 415(d). The first such adjustment shall be for calendar year 1988.
(g)
Non-commercial flight valuation rule
—(1)
In general.
Under the non-commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (g), except as provided in paragraph (g)(12) of this section, if an employee is provided with a flight on an employer-provided aircraft, the value of the flight is calculated using the aircraft valuation formula of paragraph (g)(5) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (g), the value of a flight on an employer-provided aircraft by an individual who is less than two years old is deemed to be zero. See paragraph (b)(1) of this section for rules relating to the amount includible in income when an employee reimburses the employee's employer for all or part of the fair market value of the benefit provided.
(2)
Eligible flights and eligible aircraft.
The valuation rule of this paragraph (g) may be used to value flights on all employer-provided aircraft, including helicopters. The valuation rule of this paragraph (g) may be used to value international as well as domestic flights. The valuation rule of this paragraph (g) may not be used to value a flight on any commercial aircraft on which air transportation is sold to the public on a per-seat basis. For a special valuation rule relating to certain flights on commercial aircraft, see paragraph (h) of this section.
(3)
Definition of a flight
—(i)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section (relating to intermediate stops), for purposes of this paragraph (g), a flight is the distance (in statute miles,
i.e.
, 5,280 feet per statute mile) between the place at which the individual boards the aircraft and the place at which the individual deplanes.
(ii)
Valuation of each flight.
Under the valuation rule of this paragraph (g), value is determined separately for each flight. Thus, a round-trip is comprised of at least two flights. For example, an employee who takes a personal trip on an employer-provided aircraft from New York City to Denver, then Denver to Los Angeles, and finally Los Angeles to New York City has taken three flights and must apply the aircraft valuation formula separately to each
flight. The value of a flight must be determined on a passenger-by-passenger basis. For example, if an individual accompanies an employee and the flight taken by the individual would be taxed to the employee, the employee would be taxed on the special rule value of the flight by the employee and the flight by the individual.
(iii)
Intermediate stop.
If a landing is necessitated by weather conditions, by an emergency, for purposes of refueling or obtaining other services relating to the aircraft or for any other purpose unrelated to the personal purposes of the employee whose flight is being valued, that landing is an intermediate stop. Additional mileage attributable to an intermediate stop is not considered when determining the distance of an employee's flight.
(iv)
Examples.
The rules of paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Assume that an employee's trip originates in St. Louis, Missouri, with Seattle, Washington as its destination, but, because of weather conditions, the aircraft lands in Denver, Colorado, and the employee stays in Denver overnight. Assume further that the next day the aircraft flies to Seattle where the employee deplanes. The employee's flight is the distance between the airport in St. Louis and the airport in Seattle.

# Example 2.
Assume that a trip originates in New York, New York, with five passengers and that the aircraft makes a stop in Chicago, Illinois, so that one of the passengers can deplane for a purpose unrelated to the personal purposes of the other passengers whose flights are being valued. The aircraft then goes on to Los Angeles, California, where the other four passengers will deplane. The flight of the passenger who deplaned in Chicago is the distance between the airport in New York and the airport in Chicago. The stop in Chicago is disregarded as an intermediate stop, however, when measuring the flights taken by each of the other four passengers. Their flights would be the distance between the airport in New York and the airport in Los Angeles.
(4)
Personal and non-personal flights
—(i) In
general.
The valuation rule of this paragraph (g) applies to personal flights on employer-provided aircraft. A personal flight is one the value of which is not excludable under another section of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, such as under section 132(d) (relating to a working condition fringe). However, solely for purposes of paragraphs (g)(4)(ii) and (g)(4)(iii) of this section, references to personal flights do not include flights a portion of which would not be excludable from income by reason of section 274(c).
(ii)
Trip primarily for employer's business.
If an employee combines, in one trip, personal and business flights on an employer-provided aircraft and the employee's trip is primarily for the employer's business (see § 1.162-2(b)(2)), the employee must include in income the excess of the value of all the flights that comprise the trip over the value of the flights that would have been taken had there been no personal flights but only business flights. For example, assume that an employee flies on an employer-provided aircraft from Chicago, Illinois, to Miami, Florida, for the employer's business and that from Miami the employee flies on the employer-provided aircraft to Orlando, Florida, for personal purposes and then flies back to Chicago. Assume further that the primary purpose of the trip is for the employer's business. The amount includible in income is the excess of the value of the three flights (Chicago to Miami, Miami to Orlando, and Orlando to Chicago), over the value of the flights that would have been taken had there been no personal flights but only business flights (Chicago to Miami and Miami to Chicago).
(iii)
Primarily personal trip.
If an employee combines, in one trip, personal and business flights on an employer-provided aircraft and the employee's trip is primarily personal (see § 1.162-2(b)(2)), the amount includible in the employee's income is the value of the personal flights that would have been taken had there been no business flights but only personal flights. For example, assume that an employee flies on an employer-provided aircraft from San Francisco, California, to Los Angeles, California, for the employer's business and that from Los Angeles the employee flies on an employer-provided aircraft to Palm Springs, California, primarily for personal reasons and then flies back to San Francisco. Assume further that the primary purpose of the trip is personal. The amount includible in the employee's income is the value
of personal flights that would have been taken had there been no business flights but only personal flights (San Francisco to Palm Springs and Palm Springs to San Francisco).
(iv)
Application of section 274(c).
The value of employer- provided travel outside the United States away from home may not be excluded from the employee's gross income as a working condition fringe, by either the employer or the employee, to the extent not deductible by reason of section 274(c). The valuation rule of this paragraph (g) applies to that portion of the value any flight not excludable by reason of section 274(c). Such value is includible in income in addition to the amounts determined under paragraphs (g)(4)(ii) and (g)(4)(iii) of this section.
(v)
Flights by individuals who are not personal guests.
If an individual who is not an employee of the employer providing the aircraft is on a flight, and the individual is not the personal guest of any employee of the employer, the flight by the individual is not taxable to any employee of the employer providing the aircraft. The rule in the preceding sentence applies where the individual is provided the flight by the employer for noncompensatory business reasons of the employer. For example, assume that G, an employee of company Y, accompanies A, an employee of company X, on company X's aircraft for the purpose of inspecting land under consideration for purchase by company X from company Y. The flight by G is not taxable to A. No inference may be drawn from this paragraph (g)(4)(v) concerning the taxation of a flight provided to an individual who is neither an employee of the employer nor a personal guest of any employee of the employer.
(5)
Aircraft valuation formula.
Under the valuation rule of this paragraph (g), the value of a flight is determined under the base aircraft valuation formula (also known as the Standard Industry Fare Level formula or SIFL) by multiplying the SIFL cents-per-mile rates applicable for the period during which the flight was taken by the appropriate aircraft multiple (as provided in paragraph (g)(7) of this section) and then adding the applicable terminal charge. The SIFL cents-per-mile rates in the formula and the terminal charge are calculated by the Department of Transportation and are revised semi-annually. The base aircraft valuation formula in effect from January 1, 1989 through June 30, 1989, is as follows: a terminal charge of $26.48 plus ($.1449 per mile for the first 500 miles, $.1105 per mile for miles between 501 and 1500, and $.1062 per mile for miles over 1500). For example, if a flight taken on January 15, 1989, by a non-control employee on an employer-provided aircraft with a maximum certified takeoff weight of 26,000 lbs. is 2,000 miles long, the value of the flight determined under this paragraph (g)(5) is: $100.36 ((.313 × (($.1449 × 500) + ($.1105 × 1,000) + ($.1062 × 500))) + $26.48). The aircraft valuation formula applies separately to each flight being valued under this paragraph (g). Therefore, the number of miles an employee has flown on employer-provided aircraft flights prior to the flight being valued does not affect the determination of the value of the flight.
(6)
Discretion to provide new formula.
The Commissioner may prescribe a different base aircraft valuation formula by regulation, Revenue Ruling or Revenue Procedure in the event that the calculation of the Standard Industry Fare Level is discontinued.
(7)
Aircraft multiples
—(i)
In general.
The aircraft multiples are based on the maximum certified takeoff weight of the aircraft. When applying the aircraft valuation formula to a flight, the appropriate aircraft multiple is multiplied by the product of the applicable SIFL cents-per-mile rates multiplied by the number of miles in the flight and then the terminal charge is added to the product. For purposes of applying the aircraft valuation formula described in paragraph (g)(5) of this section, the aircraft multiples are as follows:
Maximum certified take-off weight of the aircraft
Aircraft multiple for a control employee (percent)
Aircraft multiple for a non-control employee (percent)
6,000 lbs. or less
62.5
15.6
6,001-10,000 lbs.
125
23.4
10,001-25,000 lbs.
300
31.3
25,001 lbs. or more
400
31.3
(ii)
Flights treated as provided to a control employee.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(12) of this section, any fIight provided to an individual whose flight would be taxable to a control employee (as defined in paragraphs (g) (8) and (9) of this section) as the recipient shall be valued as if such flight had been provided to that control employee. For example, assume that the chief executive officer of an employer, his spouse, and his two children fly on an employer-provided aircraft for personal purposes. Assume further that the maximum certified takeoff weight of the aircraft is 12,000 lbs. The amount includible in the employee's income is 4 × ((300 percent × the applicable SIFL cents-per-mile rates provided in paragraph (g)(5) of this section multiplied by the number of miles in the flight) plus the applicable terminal charge).
(8)
Control employee defined
—
Non-government employer
—(i)
Definition.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), a control employee of a non-government employer is any employee—
(A) Who is a Board- or shareholder-appointed, confirmed, or elected officer of the employer, limited to the lesser of—
(
1
) One percent of all employees (increased to the next highest integer, if not an integer) or
(
2
) Ten employees;
(B) Who is among the top one percent most highly-paid employees of the employer (increased to the next highest integer, if not an integer) limited to a maximum of 50;
(C) Who owns a five-percent or greater equity, capital, or profits interest in the employer; or
(D) Who is a director of the employer.
(ii)
Special rules for control employee definition
—(A)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), any employee who is a family member (within the meaning of section 267(c)(4)) of a control employee is also a control employee. For purposes of paragraph (g)(8)(i)(B) of this section, the term “employee” does not include any individual unless such individual is a common-law employee, partner, or one-percent or greater shareholder of the employer. Pursuant to this paragraph (g)(8), an employee may be a control employee under more than one of the requirements listed in paragraphs (g)(8)(i) (A) through (D) of this section. For example, an employee may be both an officer under paragraph (g)(8)(i)(A) of this section and a highly-paid employee under paragraph (g)(8)(i)(B) of this section. In this case, for purposes of the officer limitation rule of paragraph (g)(8)(i)(A) of this section and the highly-paid employee limitation rule of paragraph (g)(8)(i)(B) of this section, the employee would be counted in applying both limitations. For purposes of determining the one-percent limitation under paragraphs (g)(8)(i) (A) and (B) of this section, an employer shall exclude from consideration employees described in § 1.132-8(b)(3). Instead of applying the control employee definition of this paragraph (g)(8), an employer may treat all (and only) employees who are “highly compensated” employees (as defined in § 1.132-8(f)) as control employees for purposes of this paragraph (g).
(B)
Special rules for officers, owners, and highly-paid control employees.
In no event shall an employee whose compensation is less than $50,000 be a control employee under paragraph (g)(8)(i) (A) or (B) of this section. For purposes of determining who is a five-percent (or one-percent) owner under this paragraph (g)(8), any individual who owns (or is considered as owning under section 318(a) or principles similar to section 318(a) for entities other than corporations) five percent (or one-percent) or more of the fair market value of an entity (the “owned entity”) is considered a five-percent (or one-percent) owner of all entities which would be aggregated with the owned entity under the rules of section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o). For purposes of determining who is an officer or director with respect to an employer under this paragraph (g)(8), notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, if the employer would be aggregated with other employers under the rules of section 414 (b), (c), (m), or (o), the officer definition and the limitations and the director definition are applied to each such separate employer rather than to the aggregated employer. An employee who is an officer or director of one employer (the “first employer”) shall not be counted as an officer or a director of
any other employer aggregated with the first employer under the rules of section 414 (b), (c), or (m). If applicable, the officer limitations rule of paragraph (g)(8)(i)(A) of this section is applied to employees in descending order of their compensation. Thus, if an employer has 11 board-appointed officers and the limit imposed under paragraph (g)(8)(i)(A) of this section is 10 officers, the employee with the least compensation of those officers would not be a control employee under paragraph (g)(8)(i)(A) of this section.
(9)
Control employee defined—Government employer.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), a control employee of a government employer is any—
(i) Elected official, or
(ii) Employee whose compensation equals or exceeds the compensation paid to a Federal Government employee holding a position at Executive Level V, determined under Chapter 11 of title 2, United States Code, as adjusted by section 5318 of title 5 United States Code.
For purposes of paragraph (f), the term “government” includes any Federal, state or local governmental unit, and any agency or instrumentality thereof. lnstead of applying the control employee definition of paragraph (f)(6), an employer may treat all and only employees who are “highly compensated” employees (as defined in § 1.132-8(f)) as control employees for purposes of this paragraph (f).
(10)
“Compensation” defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), the term “compensation” has the same meaning as in section 414(q)(7). Compensation includes all amounts received from all entities treated as a single employer under section 414 (b), (c), (m), or (o). Levels of compensation shall be adjusted at the same time and in the same manner as provided in section 415(d). The first such adjustment was for calendar year 1988.
(11)
Treatment of former employees.
For purposes of this paragraph (g), an employee who was a control employee of the employer (as defined in this paragraph (g)) at any time after reaching age 55, or within three years of separation from the service of the employer, is a control employee with respect to flights taken after separation from the service of the employer. An individual who is treated as a control employee under this paragraph (g)(11) is not counted when determining the limitation of paragraph (g)(8)(i) (A) and (B) of this section. Thus, the total number of individuals treated as control employees under such paragraphs may exceed the limitations of such paragraphs to the extent that this paragraph (g)(11) applies.
(12)
Seating capacity rule
—(i)
In general
—(A)
General rule.
Where 50 percent or more of the regular passenger seating capacity of an aircraft (as used by the employer) is occupied by individuals whose flights are primarily for the employer's business (and whose flights are excludable from income under section 132(d)), the value of a flight on that aircraft by any employee who is not flying primarily for the employer's business (or who is flying primarily for the employer's business but the value of whose flight is not excludable under section 132(d) by reason of section 274(c)) is deemed to be zero. See § 1.132-5 which limits the working condition fringe exclusion under section 132(d) to situations where the employee receives the flight in connection with the performance of services for the employer providing the aircraft.
(B)
Special rules
—(
1
)
Definition of “employee.”
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(12), the term “employee” includes only employees of the employer, including a partner of a partnership, providing the aircraft and does not include independent contractors and directors of the employer. A flight taken by an individual other than an “employee” as defined in the preceding sentence is considered a flight taken by an employee for purposes of this paragraph (g)(12) only if that individual is treated as an employee pursuant to section 132(f)(1) or that individual's flight is treated as a flight taken by an employee pursuant to section 132(f)(2). If—
(
i
) A flight by an individual is not considered a flight taken by an employee (as defined in this paragraph (g)(12)(i)),
(
ii
) The value of that individual's flight is not excludable under section 132(d), and
(
iii
) The seating capacity rule of this paragraph (g) (12) otherwise applies, then the value of the flight provided to such an individual is the value of a flight provided to a non-control employee pursuant to paragraph (g)(5) of this section (even if the individual who would be taxed on the value of the flight is a control employee).
(
2
)
Example.
The special rules of paragraph (g)(12)(i)(B)(
1
) of this section are illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Assume that 60 percent of the regular passenger seating capacity of an employer's aircraft is occupied by individuals whose flights are primarily for the employer's business and are excludable from income under section 132(d). If a control employee, his spouse, and his dependent child fly on the employer's aircraft for primarily personal reasons, the value of the three flights is deemed to be zero. If, however, the control employee's cousin were provided a flight on the employer's aircraft, the value of the flight taken by the cousin is determined by applying the aircraft valuation formula of paragraph (g)(5) of this section (including the terminal charge) and the non-control employee aircraft multiples of paragraph (g)(7) of this section.
(ii)
Application of 50-percent test to multiple flights.
The seating capacity rule of this paragraph (g)(12) must be met both at the time the individual whose flight is being valued boards the aircraft and at the time the individual deplanes. For example, assume that employee A boards an employer-provided aircraft for personal purposes in New York, New York, and that at that time 80 percent of the regular passenger seating capacity of the aircraft is occupied by individuals whose flights are primarily for the employer's business (and whose flights are excludable from income under section 132(d)) (“the business passengers”). If the aircraft flies directly to Hartford, Connecticut where all of the passengers, including A, deplane, the requirements of the seating capacity rule of this paragraph (g)(12) have been satisfied. If instead, some of the passengers, including A, remain on the aircraft in Hartford and the aircraft continues on to Boston, Massachusetts, where they all deplane, the requirements of the seating capacity rule of this paragraph (g)(12) will not be satisfied with respect to A's flight from New York to Boston unless at least 50 percent of the seats comprising the aircraft's regular passenger seating capacity were occupied by the business passengers at the time A deplanes in Boston.
(iii)
Regular passenger seating capacity.
(A)
General rule.
Except as otherwise provided, the regular passenger seating capacity of an aircraft is the maximum number of seats that have at any time on or prior to the date of the flight been on the aircraft (while owned or leased by the employer). Except to the extent excluded pursuant to paragraph (g)(12)(v) of this section, regular seating capacity includes all seats which may be occupied by members of the flight crew. It is irrelevant that, on a particular flight, less than the maximum number of seats are available for use because, for example, some of the seats are removed.
(B)
Special rules.
When determining the maximum number of seats that have at any time on or prior to the date of the flight been on the aircraft (while owned or leased by the employer), seats that could not at any time be legally used during takeoff and have not at any time been used during takeoff are not counted. As of the date an employer permanently reduces the seating capacity of an aircraft, the regular passenger seating capacity is the reduced number of seats on the aircraft. The previous sentence shall not apply if at any time within 24 months after such reduction any seats are added in the aircraft. Unless the conditions of this paragraph (g)(12)(iii)(B) are satisfied, jumpseats and removable seats used solely for purposes of flight crew training are counted for purposes of the seating capacity rule of this paragraph (g)(12).
(iv)
Examples.
The rules of paragraph (g)(12)(iii) of this section are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Employer A and employer B order the same aircraft, except that A orders it with 10 seats and B orders it with eight seats. A always uses its aircraft as a 10-seat aircraft; B always uses its aircraft as an eight-seat aircraft. The regular passenger seating capacity of A's aircraft is 10 and of B's aircraft is eight.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that whenever A's chief executive officer and spouse use the aircraft
eight seats are removed. Even if substantially all of the use of the aircraft is by the chief executive officer and spouse, the regular passenger seating capacity of the aircraft is 10.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that whenever more than eight people want to fly in B's aircraft, two extra seats are added. Even if substantially all of the use of the aircraft occurs with eight seats, the regular passenger seating capacity of the aircraft is 10.

# Example 4.
Employer C purchases an aircraft with 12 seats. Three months later C remodels the interior of the aircraft and permanently removes four of the seats. Upon completion of the remodeling, the regular passenger seating capacity of the aircraft is eight. If, however, any seats are added within 24 months after the remodeling, the regular seating capacity of the aircraft is treated as 12 throughout the entire period.
(v)
Seats occupied by flight crew.
When determining the regular passenger seating capacity of an aircraft, any seat occupied by a member of the flight crew (whether or not such individual is an employee of the employer providing the aircraft) shall not be counted, unless the purpose of the flight by such individual is not primarily to serve as a member of the flight crew. If the seat occupied by a member of the flight crew is not counted as a passenger seat pursuant to the previous sentence, such member of the flight crew is disregarded in applying the 50-percent test described in the first sentence of paragraph (g)(12)(i) of this section. For example, assume that prior to application of this paragraph (g)(12)(v) the regular passenger seating capacity of an aircraft is one. Assume further that an employee pilots the aircraft and that the employee's flight is nor primarily for the employer's business. If the employee's spouse occupies the other seat for personal purposes, the seating capacity rule is not met and the value of both flights must be included in the employee's income. If, however, the employee's flight were primarily for the employer's business (unrelated to serving as a member of the flight crew), then the seating capacity rule is met and the value of the flight for the employee's spouse is deemed to be zero. If the employee's flight were primarily to serve as a member of the flight crew, then the seating capacity rule is not met and the value of a flight by any passenger for primarily personal reasons is not deemed to be zero.
(13)
Erroneous use of the non-commercial flight valuation rule
—(i)
Certain errors in the case of a flight by a control employee.
If—
(A) The non-commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (g) is applied by an employer or a control employee, as the case may be, on a return as originally filed or on an amended return on the grounds that either—
(
1
) The control employee is not in fact a control employee, or
(
2
) The aircraft is within a specific weight classification, and
(B) Either position is subsequently determined to be erroneous, the valuation rule of this paragraph (g) is not available to value the flight taken by that control employee by the person or persons taking the erroneous position. With respect to the weight classifications, the previous sentence does not apply if the position taken is that the weight of the aircraft is greater than it is subsequently determined to be. If, with respect to a flight by a control employee, the seating capacity rule of paragraph (g)(12) of this section is used by an employer or the control employee, as the case may be, on a return as originally filed or on an amended return, the valuation rule of this paragraph (g) is not available to value the flight taken by that control employee by the person or persons taking the erroneous position.
(ii)
Value of flight excluded as a working condition fringe.
If either an employer or an employee, on a return as originally filed or on an amended return, excludes from the employee's income or wages all or any part of the value of a flight on the grounds that the flight was excludable as a working condition fringe under section 132, and that position is subsequently determined to be erroneous, the valuation rule of this paragraph (g) is not available to value the flight taken by that employee by the person or persons taking the erroneous position. Instead, the general valuation rules of paragraphs (b) (5) and (6) of this section apply.
(14)
Consistency rules
—(i)
Use by employer.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(13) or paragraph (g)(14)(iii) of this section or in § 1.132-
5(m)(4), if the non-commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (g) is used by an employer to value any flight provided in a calendar year, the rule must be used to value all flights provided to all employees in the calendar year.
(ii)
Use by employee.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(13) or (g)(14)(iii) of this section or in § 1.132-5(m)(4), if the non-commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (g) is used by an employee to value a flight provided by an employer in a calendar year, the rule must be used to value all flights provided to the employee by that employer in the calendar year.
(iii)
Exception for entertainment flights provided to specified individuals after October 22, 2004.
Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(14)(i) of this section, an employer may use the general valuation rules of paragraph (b) of this section to value the entertainment use of an aircraft provided after October 22, 2004, to a specified individual. An employer who uses the general valuation rules of paragraph (b) of this section to value any entertainment use of an aircraft by a specified individual in a calendar year must use the general valuation rules of paragraph (b) of this section to value all entertainment use of aircraft provided to all specified individuals during that calendar year.
(A)
Specified individuals defined.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(14)(iii) of this section,
specified individual
is defined in section 274(e)(2)(B) and § 1.274-9(b).
(B)
Entertainment defined.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(14)(iii) of this section,
entertainment
is defined in § 1.274-2(b)(1).
(h)
Commercial flight valuation rule
—(1)
In general.
Under the commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (h), the value of a space-available flight (as defined in paragraph (h) (2) of this section) on a commercial aircraft is 25 percent of the actual carrier's highest unrestricted coach fare in effect for the particular flight taken. The rule of this paragraph (h) is available only to an individual described in § 1.132-1(b)(1).
(2)
Space-available flight.
The commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (h) is available to value a space-available flight. The term “space-available flight” means a flight on a commercial aircraft—
(i) Which is subject to the same types of restrictions customarily associated with flying on an employee “stand-by” or “space-available” basis, and
(ii) Which meets the definition of a no-additional-cost service under section 132(b), except that the flight is provided to an individual other than the employee or an individual treated as the employee under section 132(f). Thus, a flight is not a space-available flight if the employer guarantees the employee a seat on the flight or if the nondiscrimination requirements of section 132(h)(1) and § 1.132-8 are not satisfied. A flight may be a space-available flight even if the airline that is the actual carrier is not the employer of the employee.
(3)
Commercial aircraft.
If the actual carrier does not offer, in the ordinary course of its business, air transportation to customers on a per-seat basis, the commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (h) is not available. Thus, if, in the ordinary course of its line of business, the employer only offers air transportation to customers on a charter basis, the commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (h) may not be used to value a space-available flight on the employer's aircraft. If the commercial flight valuation rule is not available, the flight may be valued under the non-commercial flight valuation rule of paragraph (g) of this section.
(4)
Timing of inclusion.
The date that the flight is taken is the relevant date for purposes of applying section 61(a)(1) and this section to a space-available flight on a commercial aircraft. The date of purchase or issuance of a pass or ticket is not relevant. Thus, this section applies to a flight taken on or after January 1, 1989, regardless of the date on which the pass or ticket for the flight was purchased or issued.
(5)
Consistency rules
—(i)
Use by employer.
If the commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (h) is used by an employer to value any flight provided in a calendar year, the rule must be used to value all flights eligible for use of the rule provided in the calendar year.
(ii)
Use by employee.
If the commercial flight valuation rule of this paragraph (h) is used by an employee to value a flight provided by an employer in a calendar year, the rule must be used to value all flights provided by that employer eligible for use of the rule taken by such employee in the calendar year.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Valuation of meals provided at an employer-operated eating facility for employees
—(1)
In general.
The valuation rule of this paragraph (j) may be used to value a meal provided at an employer-operated eating facility for employees (as defined in § 1.132-7). For rules relating to an exclusion for the value of meals provided at an employer-operated eating facility for employees, see section 132(e)(2) and § 1.132-7.
(2)
Valuation formula
—(i)
In general.
The value of all meals provided at an employer-operated eating facility for employees during a calendar year (“total meal value”) is 150 percent of the direct operating costs of the eating facility determined separately with respect to such eating facility whether or not the direct operating costs test is applied separately to such eating facility under § 1.132-7(b)(2). For purposes of this paragraph (j), the definition of direct operating costs provided in § 1.132-7(b) and the adjustments specified in § 1.132-7(a)(2) apply. The taxable value of meals provided at an eating facility may be determined in two ways. The “individual meal subsidy” may be treated as the taxable value of a meal provided at the eating facility (see paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section) to a particular employee. Alternatively, the employer may allocate the “total meal subsidy” among employees (see paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section).
(ii)
“Individual meal subsidy” defined.
The “individual meal subsidy” is determined by multiplying the amount paid by the employee for a particular meal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total meal value and the denominator of which is the gross receipts of the eating facility for the calendar year and then subtracting the amount paid by the employee for the meal. The taxable value of meals provided to a particular employee during a calendar year, therefore, is the sum of the individual meal subsidies provided to the employee during the calendar year. This rule is available only if there is a charge for each meal selection and if each employee is charged the same price for any given meal selection.
(iii)
Allocation of “total meal subsidy.”
Instead of using the individual meal subsidy method provided in paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section, the employer may allocate the “total meal subsidy” (total meal value less the gross receipts of the facility) among employees in any manner reasonable under the circumstances. It will be presumed reasonable for an employer to allocate the total meal subsidy on a per-employee basis if the employer has information that would substantiate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that each employee was provided approximately the same number of meals at the facility.
(k)
Commuting valuation rule for certain employees
—(1)
In general.
Under the rule of this paragraph (k), the value of the commuting use of employer-provided transportation may be determined under paragraph (k)(3) of this section if the following criteria are met by the employer and employee with respect to the transportation:
(i) The transportation is provided, solely because of unsafe conditions, to an employee who would ordinarily walk or use public transportation for commuting to or from work;
(ii) The employer has established a written policy (e.g., in the employer's personnel manual) under which the transportation is not provided for the employee's personal purposes other than for commuting due to unsafe conditions and the employer's practice in fact corresponds with the policy;
(iii) The transportation is not used for personal purposes other than commuting due to unsafe conditions; and
(iv) The employee receiving the employer-provided transportation is a qualified employee of the employer (as defined in paragraph (k)(6) of this section).
(2)
Trip-by-trip basis.
The special valuation rule of this paragraph (k) applies on a trip-by-trip basis. If an employer and employee fail to meet the criteria of paragraph (k)(1) of this section with
respect to any trip, the value of the transportation for that trip is not determined under paragraph (k)(3) of this section and the amount includible in the employee's income is determined by reference to the fair market value of the transportation.
(3)
Commuting value
—(i)
$1.50 per one-way commute.
If the requirements of this paragraph (k) are satisfied, the value of the commuting use of the employer-provided transportation is $1.50 per one-way commute (
i.e.
, from home to work or from work to home).
(ii)
Value per employee.
If transportation is provided to more than one qualified employee at the same time, the amount includible in the income of each employee is $1.50 per one-way commute.
(4)
Definition of employer-provided transportation.
For purposes of this paragraph (k), “employer-provided transportation” means transportation by vehicle (as defined in paragraph (f)(4) of this section) that is purchased by the employer (or that is purchased by the employee and reimbursed by the employer) from a party that is not related to the employer for the purpose of transporting a qualified employee to or from work. Reimbursements made by an employer to an employee to cover the cost of purchasing transportation (e.g., hiring cabs) must be made under a bona fide reimbursement arrangement.
(5)
Unsafe conditions.
Unsafe conditions exist if a reasonable person would, under the facts and circumstances, consider it unsafe for the employee to walk to or from home, or to walk to or use public transportation at the time of day the employee must commute. One of the factors indicating whether it is unsafe is the history of crime in the geographic area surrounding the employee's workplace or residence at the time of day the employee must commute.
(6)
Qualified employee defined
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (k), a qualified employee is one who meets the following requirements with respect to the employer:
(A) The employee performs services during the current year, is paid on an hourly basis, is not claimed under section 213(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (as amended), 29 U.S.C. 201-219 (FLSA), to be exempt from the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions of the FLSA, and is within a classification with respect to which the employer actually pays, or has specified in writing that it will pay, compensation for overtime equal to or exceeding one and one-half times the regular rate as provided by section 207 of the FLSA; and
(B) The employee does not receive compensation from the employer in excess of the amount permitted by section 414(q)(1)(C) of the Code.
(ii)
“Compensation” and “paid on an hourly basis” defined.
For purposes of this paragraph (k), “compensation” has the same meaning as in section 414(q)(7). Compensation includes all amounts received from all entities treated as a single employer under section 414 (b), (c), (m), or (o). Levels of compensation shall be adjusted at the same time and in the same manner as provided in section 415(d). If an employee's compensation is stated on an annual basis, the employee is treated as “paid on an hourly basis” for purposes of this paragraph (k) as long as the employee is not claimed to be exempt from the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions of the FLSA and is paid overtime wages either equal to or exceeding one and one-half the employee's regular hourly rate of pay.
(iii)
FLSA compliance required.
An employee will not be considered a qualified employee for purposes of this paragraph (k), unless the employer is in compliance with the recordkeeping requirements concerning that employee's wages, hours, and other conditions and practices of employment as provided in section 211(c) of the FLSA and 29 CFR part 516.
(iv)
Issues arising under the FLSA.
If questions arise concerning an employee's classification under the FLSA, the pronouncements and rulings of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor are determinative.
(v)
Non-qualified employees.
If an employee is not a qualified employee within the meaning of this paragraph (k)(6), no portion of the value of the commuting use of employer-provided
transportation is excluded under this paragraph (k).
(7)
Examples.
This paragraph (k) is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A and B are word-processing clerks employed by Y, an accounting firm in a large metropolitan area, and both are qualified employees under paragraph (k)(6) of this section. The normal working hours for A and B are from 11:00 p.m. until 7:00 a.m. and public transportation, the only means of transportation available to A or B, would be considered unsafe by a reasonable person at the time they are required to commute from home to work. In response, Y hires a car service to pick up A and B at their homes each evening for purposes of transporting them to work. The amount includible in the income of both A and B is $1.50 for the one-way commute from home to work.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1,
except that Y also hires a car service to return A and B to their homes each morning at the conclusion of their shifts and public transportation would not be considered unsafe by a reasonable person at the time of day A and B commute to their homes. The value of the commute from work to home is includible in the income of both A and B by reference to fair market value since unsafe conditions do not exist for that trip.

# Example 3.
C is an associate for Z, a law firm in a metropolitan area. The normal working hours for C's law firm are from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m., but C's ordinary office hours are from 10 a.m. until 8 p.m. Public transportation, the only means of transportation available to C at the time C commutes from work to home during the evening, would be considered unsafe by a reasonable person. In response, Z hires a car service to take C home each evening. C does not receive annual compensation from Z in excess of the amount permitted by section 414(q)(1)(C) of the Code. However, C is treated as an employee exempt from the provisions of the FLSA and, accordingly, is not paid overtime wages. Therefore, C is not a qualified employee within the meaning of paragraph (k)(6) of this section. The value of the commute from work to home is includible in C's income by reference to fair market value.
(8)
Effective date.
This paragraph (k) applies to employer-provided transportation provided to a qualified employee on or after July 1, 1991.
[T.D. 8256, 54 FR 28582, July 6, 1989, as amended by T.D. 8389, 57 FR 1870, Jan. 16, 1992; T.D. 8457, 57 FR 62195, Dec. 30, 1992; T.D. 9597, 77 FR 45483, Aug. 1, 2012; T.D. 9849, 84 FR 9233, Mar. 14, 2019; T.D. 9893, 85 FR 6427, Feb. 5, 2020]
§ 1.61-22

Paragraph (c) of this section defines certain other terms. Paragraph (d) of this section sets forth rules for the taxation of economic benefits provided under a split-dollar life insurance arrangement. Paragraph (e) of this section sets forth rules for the taxation of amounts received under a life insurance contract that is part of a split-dollar life insurance arrangement. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for additional tax consequences of a split-dollar life insurance arrangement, including the treatment of death benefit proceeds. Paragraph (g) of this section provides rules for the transfer of a life insurance contract (or an undivided interest in the contract) that is part of a split-dollar life insurance arrangement. Paragraph (h) of this section provides examples illustrating the application of this section. Paragraph (j) of this section provides the effective date of this section.
(b)
Split-dollar life insurance arrangement
—(1)
In general.
A split-dollar life insurance arrangement is any arrangement between an owner and a non-owner of a life insurance contract that satisfies the following criteria—
(i) Either party to the arrangement pays, directly or indirectly, all or any portion of the premiums on the life insurance contract, including a payment by means of a loan to the other party that is secured by the life insurance contract;
(ii) At least one of the parties to the arrangement paying premiums under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is entitled to recover (either conditionally or unconditionally) all or any portion of those premiums and such recovery is to be made from, or is secured by, the proceeds of the life insurance contract; and
(iii) The arrangement is not part of a group-term life insurance plan described in section 79 unless the group-term life insurance plan provides permanent benefits to employees (as defined in § 1.79-0).
(2)
Special rule
—(i)
In general.
Any arrangement between an owner and a non-owner of a life insurance contract is treated as a split-dollar life insurance arrangement (regardless of whether the criteria of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are satisfied) if the arrangement is described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section.
(ii)
Compensatory arrangements.
An arrangement is described in this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) if the following criteria are satisfied—
(A) The arrangement is entered into in connection with the performance of services and is not part of a group-term life insurance plan described in section 79;
(B) The employer or service recipient pays, directly or indirectly, all or any portion of the premiums; and
(C) Either—
(
1
) The beneficiary of all or any portion of the death benefit is designated by the employee or service provider or is any person whom the employee or service provider would reasonably be expected to designate as the beneficiary; or
(
2
) The employee or service provider has any interest in the policy cash value of the life insurance contract.
(iii)
Shareholder arrangements.
An arrangement is described in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) if the following criteria are satisfied—
(A) The arrangement is entered into between a corporation and another person in that person's capacity as a shareholder in the corporation;
(B) The corporation pays, directly or indirectly, all or any portion of the premiums; and
(C) Either—
(
1
) The beneficiary of all or any portion of the death benefit is designated by the shareholder or is any person whom the shareholder would reasonably be expected to designate as the beneficiary; or
(
2
) The shareholder has any interest in the policy cash value of the life insurance contract.
(3)
Determination of whether this section or § 1.7872-15 applies to a split-dollar life insurance arrangement
—(i)
Split-dollar life insurance arrangements involving split-dollar loans under § 1.7872-15.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section do not apply to any split-dollar loan as defined in § 1.7872-15(b)(1). Section 1.7872-15 applies to any such loan.
See
paragraph (b)(5) of this section for the treatment of a payment made by a non-owner under a split-dollar life insurance arrangement if the payment is not a split-dollar loan.
(ii)
Exceptions.
Paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section apply (and § 1.7872-15 does not apply) to any split-dollar life insurance arrangement if—
(A) The arrangement is entered into in connection with the performance of services, and the employer or service recipient is the owner of the life insurance contract (or is treated as the owner of the contract under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section); or
(B) The arrangement is entered into between a donor and a donee (for example, a life insurance trust) and the donor is the owner of the life insurance contract (or is treated as the owner of the contract under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A)(
2
) of this section).
(4)
Consistency requirement.
A split-dollar life insurance arrangement described in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section must be treated in the same manner by the owner and the non-owner of the life insurance contract under either the rules of this section or § 1.7872-15. In addition, the owner and non-owner must fully account for all amounts under the arrangement under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section, or § 1.7872-15.
(5)
Non-owner payments that are not split-dollar loans.
If a non-owner of a life insurance contract makes premium payments (directly or indirectly) under a split-dollar life insurance arrangement, and the payments are neither split-dollar loans nor consideration for economic benefits described in paragraph (d) of this section, then neither the rules of paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section nor the rules in § 1.7872-15 apply to such payments. Instead, general income tax, employment tax, self-employment tax, and gift tax principles apply to the premium payments.
See,
for example, § 1.61-2(d)(2)(ii)(A).
(6)
Waiver, cancellation, or forgiveness.
If a repayment obligation described in § 1.7872-15(a)(2) is waived, cancelled, or forgiven at any time, then the parties must take the amount waived, cancelled, or forgiven into account in accordance with the relationships between the parties (for example, as compensation in the case of an employee-employer relationship).
(7)
Change in the owner.
If payments made by a non-owner to an owner were treated as split-dollar loans under § 1.7872-15 and the split-dollar life insurance arrangement is modified such that, after the modification, the non-owner is the owner (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1) of this section) of the life insurance contract under the arrangement, paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section apply to the split-dollar life insurance arrangement from the date of the modification. The payments made (both before and after the modification) are not treated as split-dollar loans under § 1.7872-15 on or after the date of the modification. The non-owner of the life insurance contract under the modified split-dollar life insurance arrangement must fully take into account all economic benefits provided under the arrangement under paragraph (d) of this section on or after the date of the modification. For the treatment of a transfer of the contract when the unmodified arrangement is governed by paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section,
see
paragraph (g) of this section.
(c)
Definitions.
The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:
(1)
Owner
—(i)
In general.
With respect to a life insurance contract, the person named as the policy owner of such contract generally is the owner of such contract. If two or more persons are named as policy owners of a life insurance contract and each person has, at all times, all the incidents of ownership with respect to an undivided interest in the contract, each person is treated as the owner of a separate contract to the extent of such person's undivided interest. If two or more persons are named as policy owners of a life insurance contract but each person does not have, at all times, all the incidents of ownership with respect to an undivided interest in the contract, the person who is the first-named policy owner is treated as the owner of the entire contract.
(ii)
Special rule for certain arrangements
—(A)
In general.
Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section—
(
1
) An employer or service recipient is treated as the owner of a life insurance contract under a split-dollar life insurance arrangement that is entered into in connection with the performance of services if, at all times, the only economic benefit that will be provided under the arrangement is current life insurance protection as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and
(
2
) A donor is treated as the owner of a life insurance contract under a split-dollar life insurance arrangement that is entered into between a donor and a donee (for example, a life insurance trust) if, at all times, the only economic benefit that will be provided under the arrangement is current life insurance protection as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(B)
Modifications.
If an arrangement described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section is modified such that the arrangement is no longer described in
paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, the following rules apply:
(
1
) If, immediately after such modification, the employer, service recipient, or donor is the owner of the life insurance contract under the split-dollar life insurance arrangement (determined without regard to paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section), the employer, service recipient, or donor continues to be treated as the owner of the life insurance contract.
(
2
) If, immediately after such modification, the employer, service recipient, or donor is not the owner of the life insurance contract under the split-dollar life insurance arrangement (determined without regard to paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section), the employer, service recipient, or donor is treated as having made a transfer of the entire life insurance contract to the employee, service provider, or donee under the rules of paragraph (g) of this section as of the date of such modification.
(
3
) For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B), entering into a successor split-dollar life insurance arrangement that has the effect of providing any economic benefit in addition to that described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section is treated as a modification of the prior split-dollar life insurance arrangement.
(iii)
Attribution rules for compensatory arrangements.
For purposes of this section, if a split-dollar life insurance arrangement is entered into in connection with the performance of services, the employer or service recipient is treated as the owner of the life insurance contract if the owner (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section) of the life insurance contract under the split-dollar life insurance arrangement is—
(A) A trust described in section 402(b);
(B) A trust that is treated as owned (within the meaning of sections 671 through 677) by the employer or the service recipient;
(C) A welfare benefit fund within the meaning of section 419(e)(1); or
(D) A member of the employer or service recipient's controlled group (within the meaning of section 414(b)) or a trade or business that is under common control with the employer or service recipient (within the meaning of section 414(c)).
(iv)
Life insurance contracts owned by partnerships.
[Reserved]
(2)
Non-owner
—(i)
Definition.
With respect to a life insurance contract, a non-owner is any person (other than the owner of such contract under paragraph (c)(1) of this section) that has any direct or indirect interest in such contract (but not including a life insurance company acting only in its capacity as the issuer of a life insurance contract).
(ii)
Example.
The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (c)(2):

# Example.
(i) On January 1, 2009, Employer R and Trust T, an irrevocable life insurance trust that is not treated under sections 671 through 677 as owned by a grantor or other person, enter into a split-dollar life insurance arrangement in connection with the performance of services under which R will pay all the premiums on the life insurance contract until the termination of the arrangement or the death of E, an employee of R. C, the beneficiary of T, is E's child. R is the owner of the contract under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. E is the insured under the life insurance contract. Upon termination of the arrangement or E's death, R is entitled to receive the lesser of the aggregate premiums or the policy cash value of the contract and T will be entitled to receive any remaining amounts. Under the terms of the arrangement and applicable state law, the policy cash value is fully accessible by R and R's creditors but T has the right to borrow or withdraw at any time the portion of the policy cash value exceeding the amount payable to R.
(ii) Because E and T each have an indirect interest in the life insurance contract that is part of the split-dollar life insurance arrangement, each is a non-owner under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. E and T each are provided economic benefits described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section pursuant to the split-dollar life insurance arrangement. Economic benefits are provided by owner R to E as a payment of compensation, and separately provided by E to T as a gift.
(3)
Transfer of entire contract or undivided interest therein.
A transfer of the ownership of a life insurance contract (or an undivided interest in such contract) that is part of a split-dollar life insurance arrangement occurs on the date that a non-owner becomes the
owner (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1) of this section) of the entire contract or of an undivided interest in the contract.
(4)
Undivided interest.
An undivided interest in a life insurance contract consists of an identical fractional or percentage interest or share in each right, benefit, and obligation with respect to the contract. In the case of any arrangement purporting to create undivided interests where, in substance, the rights, benefits or obligations are shared to any extent among the holders of such interests, the arrangement will be treated as a split-dollar life insurance arrangement.
(5)
Employment tax.
The term employment tax means any tax imposed by, or collected under, the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA), and the Collection of Income Tax at Source on Wages.
(6)
Self-employment tax.
The term self-employment tax means the tax imposed by the Self-Employment Contributions Act of 1954 (SECA).
(d)
Economic benefits provided under a split-dollar life insurance arrangement
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a split-dollar life insurance arrangement subject to the rules of paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section, economic benefits are treated as being provided to the non-owner of the life insurance contract. The non-owner (and the owner for gift and employment tax purposes) must take into account the full value of all economic benefits described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, reduced by the consideration paid directly or indirectly by the non-owner to the owner for those economic benefits. Depending on the relationship between the owner and the non-owner, the economic benefits may constitute a payment of compensation, a distribution under section 301, a contribution to capital, a gift, or a transfer having a different tax character. Further, depending on the relationship between or among a non-owner and one or more other persons (including a non-owner or non-owners), the economic benefits may be treated as provided from the owner to the non-owner and as separately provided from the non-owner to such other person or persons (for example, as a payment of compensation from an employer to an employee and as a gift from the employee to the employee's child).
(2)
Value of economic benefits.
The value of the economic benefits provided to a non-owner for a taxable year under the arrangement equals—
(i) The cost of current life insurance protection provided to the non-owner as determined under paragraph (d)(3) of this section;
(ii) The amount of policy cash value to which the non-owner has current access within the meaning of paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section (to the extent that such amount was not actually taken into account for a prior taxable year); and
(iii) The value of any economic benefits not described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section provided to the non-owner (to the extent not actually taken into account for a prior taxable year).
(3)
Current life insurance protection
—(i)
Amount of current life insurance protection.
In the case of a split-dollar life insurance arrangement described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the amount of the current life insurance protection provided to the non-owner for a taxable year (or any portion thereof in the case of the first year or the last year of the arrangement) equals the excess of the death benefit of the life insurance contract (including paid-up additions thereto) over the total amount payable to the owner (including any outstanding policy loans that offset amounts otherwise payable to the owner) under the split-dollar life insurance arrangement, less the portion of the policy cash value actually taken into account under paragraph (d)(1) of this section or paid for by the non-owner under paragraph (d)(1) of this section for the current taxable year or any prior taxable year.
(ii)
Cost of current life insurance protection.
The cost of current life insurance protection provided to the non-owner for any year (or any portion thereof in the case of the first year or the last year of the arrangement) equals the amount of the current life insurance protection provided to the
non-owner (determined under paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section) multiplied by the life insurance premium factor designated or permitted in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (
see
§ 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter).
(4)
Policy cash value
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (d), policy cash value is determined disregarding surrender charges or other similar charges or reductions. Policy cash value includes policy cash value attributable to paid-up additions.
(ii)
Current access.
For purposes of this paragraph (d), a non-owner has current access to that portion of the policy cash value—
(A) To which, under the arrangement, the non-owner has a current or future right; and
(B) That currently is directly or indirectly accessible by the non-owner, inaccessible to the owner, or inaccessible to the owner's general creditors.
(5)
Valuation date
—(i)
General rules.
For purposes of this paragraph (d), the amount of the current life insurance protection and the policy cash value shall be determined on the same valuation date. The valuation date is the last day of the non-owner's taxable year, unless the owner and non-owner agree to instead use the policy anniversary date as the valuation date. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if the split-dollar life insurance arrangement terminates during the taxable year of the non-owner, the value of such economic benefits is determined on the day that the arrangement terminates.
(ii)
Consistency requirement.
The owner and non-owner of the split-dollar life insurance arrangement must use the same valuation date. In addition, the same valuation date must be used for all years prior to termination of the split-dollar life insurance arrangement unless the parties receive consent of the Commissioner to change the valuation date.
(iii)
Artifice or device.
Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, if any artifice or device is used to understate the amount of any economic benefit on the valuation date in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, then, for purposes of this paragraph (d), the date on which the amount of the economic benefit is determined is the date on which the amount of the economic benefit is greatest during that taxable year.
(iv)
Special rule for certain taxes.
For purposes of employment tax (as defined in paragraph (c)(5) of this section), self-employment tax (as defined in paragraph (c)(6) of this section), and sections 6654 and 6655 (relating to the failure to pay estimated income tax), the portions of the current life insurance protection and the policy cash value that are treated as provided by the owner to the non-owner shall be treated as so provided on the last day of the taxable year of the non-owner. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if the split-dollar life insurance arrangement terminates during the taxable year of the non-owner, such portions of the current life insurance protection and the policy cash value shall be treated as so provided on the day that the arrangement terminates.
(6)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (d). Except as otherwise provided, both examples assume the following facts: employer (R) is the owner (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section) and employee (E) is the non-owner (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section) of a life insurance contract that is part of a split-dollar life insurance arrangement that is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section; the contract is a life insurance contract as defined in section 7702 and not a modified endowment contract as defined in section 7702A; R does not withdraw or obtain a loan of any portion of the policy cash value and does not surrender any portion of the life insurance contract; the compensation paid to E is reasonable; E is not provided any economic benefits described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section; E does not make any premium payments; E's taxable year is the calendar year; the value of the economic benefits is determined on the last day of E's taxable year; and E reports on E's Federal income tax return for each year that the split-dollar life insurance arrangement is in effect the amount of income required to be reported under paragraph
(d) of this section. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i)
Facts.
On January 1 of year 1, R and E enter into the split-dollar life insurance arrangement. Under the arrangement, R pays all of the premiums on the life insurance contract until the termination of the arrangement or E's death. The arrangement provides that upon termination of the arrangement or E's death, R is entitled to receive the lesser of the aggregate premiums paid or the policy cash value of the contract and E is entitled to receive any remaining amounts. Under the terms of the arrangement and applicable state law, the policy cash value is fully accessible by R and R's creditors but E has the right to borrow or withdraw at any time the portion of the policy cash value exceeding the amount payable to R. To fund the arrangement, R purchases a life insurance contract with constant death benefit protection equal to $1,500,000. R makes premium payments on the life insurance contract of $60,000 in each of years 1, 2, and 3. The policy cash value equals $55,000 as of December 31 of year 1, $140,000 as of December 31 of year 2, and $240,000 as of December 31 of year 3.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under the terms of the split-dollar life insurance arrangement, E has the right for year 1 and all subsequent years to borrow or withdraw the portion of the policy cash value exceeding the amount payable to R. Thus, under paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, E has current access to such portion of the policy cash value for each year that the arrangement is in effect. In addition, because R pays all of the premiums on the life insurance contract, R provides to E all of the economic benefits that E receives under the arrangement. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, E includes in gross income the value of all economic benefits described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section provided to E under the arrangement.
(iii)
Results for year 1.
For year 1, E is provided, under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, $0 of policy cash value (excess of $55,000 policy cash value determined as of December 31 of year 1 over $55,000 payable to R). For year 1, E is also provided, under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, current life insurance protection of $1,445,000 ($1,500,000 minus $55,000 payable to R). Thus, E includes in gross income for year 1 the cost of $1,445,000 of current life insurance protection.
(iv)
Results for year 2.
For year 2, E is provided, under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, $20,000 of policy cash value ($140,000 policy cash value determined as of December 31 of year 2 minus $120,000 payable to R). For year 2, E is also provided, under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, current life insurance protection of $1,360,000 ($1,500,000 minus the sum of $120,000 payable to R and the aggregate of $20,000 of policy cash value that E actually includes in income on E's year 1 and year 2 federal income tax returns). Thus, E includes in gross income for year 2 the sum of $20,000 of policy cash value and the cost of $1,360,000 of current life insurance protection.
(v)
Results for year 3.
For year 3, E is provided, under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, $40,000 of policy cash value ($240,000 policy cash value determined as of December 31 of year 3 minus the sum of $180,000 payable to R and $20,000 of aggregate policy cash value that E actually included in gross income on E's year 1 and year 2 federal income tax returns). For year 3, E is also provided, under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, current life insurance protection of $1,260,000 ($1,500,000 minus the sum of $180,000 payable to R and $60,000 of aggregate policy cash value that E actually includes in gross income on E's year 1, year 2, and year 3 federal income tax returns). Thus, E includes in gross income for year 3 the sum of $40,000 of policy cash value and the cost of $1,260,000 of current life insurance protection.

# Example 2.
(i)
Facts.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that E cannot directly or indirectly access any portion of the policy cash value, but the terms of the split-dollar life insurance arrangement or applicable state law provide that the policy cash value in excess of the amount payable to R is inaccessible to R's general creditors.
(ii)
Analysis.
Under the terms of the split-dollar life insurance arrangement or applicable state law, the portion of the policy cash value exceeding the amount payable to R is inaccessible to R's general creditors and E has a current or future right to that portion of the cash value. Thus, under paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, E has current access to such portion of the policy cash value for each year that the arrangement is in effect. In addition, because R pays all of the premiums on the life insurance contract, R provides to E all of the economic benefits that E receives under the arrangement. Therefore, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, E includes in gross income the value of all economic benefits described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section provided to E under the arrangement.
(iii)
Results for years 1, 2 and 3.
The results for this example are the same as the results in Example 1.
(e)
Amounts received under the contract
—(1)
In general.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, any amount received under a life insurance contract that is part of a split-dollar life insurance arrangement subject to the rules of paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section (including,
but not limited to, a policy owner dividend, proceeds of a specified policy loan described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, or the proceeds of a withdrawal from or partial surrender of the life insurance contract) is treated, to the extent provided directly or indirectly to a non-owner of the life insurance contract, as though such amount had been paid to the owner of the life insurance contract and then paid by the owner to the non-owner. The amount received is taxable to the owner in accordance with the rules of section 72. The non-owner (and the owner for gift tax and employment tax purposes) must take the amount described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section into account as a payment of compensation, a distribution under section 301, a contribution to capital, a gift, or other transfer depending on the relationship between the owner and the non-owner.
(2)
Specified policy loan.
A policy loan is a specified policy loan to the extent—
(i) The proceeds of the loan are distributed directly from the insurance company to the non-owner;
(ii) A reasonable person would not expect that the loan will be repaid by the non-owner; or
(iii) The non-owner's obligation to repay the loan to the owner is satisfied or is capable of being satisfied upon repayment by either party to the insurance company.
(3)
Amount required to be taken into account.
With respect to a non-owner (and the owner for gift tax and employment tax purposes), the amount described in this paragraph (e)(3) is equal to the excess of—
(i) The amount treated as received by the owner under paragraph (e)(1) of this section; over
(ii) The amount of all economic benefits described in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section actually taken into account by the non-owner (and the owner for gift tax and employment tax purposes) plus any consideration described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section paid by the non-owner for such economic benefits described in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section. The amount determined under the preceding sentence applies only to the extent that neither this paragraph (e)(3)(ii) nor paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section previously has applied to such economic benefits.
(f)
Other tax consequences
—(1)
Introduction.
In the case of a split-dollar life insurance arrangement subject to the rules of paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section, this paragraph (f) sets forth other tax consequences to the owner and non-owner of a life insurance contract that is part of the arrangement for the period prior to the transfer (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) of the contract (or an undivided interest therein) from the owner to the non-owner.
See
paragraph (g) of this section and § 1.83-6(a)(5) for tax consequences upon the transfer of the contract (or an undivided interest therein).
(2)
Investment in the contract
—(i)
To the non-owner.
A non-owner does not receive any investment in the contract under section 72(e)(6) with respect to a life insurance contract that is part of a split-dollar life insurance arrangement subject to the rules of paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section.
(ii)
To owner.
Any premium paid by an owner under a split-dollar life insurance arrangement subject to the rules of paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section is included in the owner's investment in the contract under section 72(e)(6). No premium or amount described in paragraph (d) of this section is deductible by the owner (except as otherwise provided in § 1.83-6(a)(5)). Any amount paid by a non-owner, directly or indirectly, to the owner of the life insurance contract for current life insurance protection or for any other economic benefit under the life insurance contract is included in the owner's gross income and is included in the owner's investment in the life insurance contract for purposes of section 72(e)(6) (but only to the extent not otherwise so included by reason of having been paid by the owner as a premium or other consideration for the contract).
(3)
Treatment of death benefit proceeds
—(i)
Death benefit proceeds to beneficiary (other than the owner).
Any amount paid to a beneficiary (other than the owner) by reason of the death of the insured is excluded from gross
income by such beneficiary under section 101(a) as an amount received under a life insurance contract to the extent such amount is allocable to current life insurance protection provided to the non-owner pursuant to the split-dollar life insurance arrangement, the cost of which was paid by the non-owner, or the value of which the non-owner actually took into account pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(ii)
Death benefit proceeds to owner as beneficiary.
Any amount paid or payable to an owner in its capacity as a beneficiary by reason of the death of the insured is excluded from gross income of the owner under section 101(a) as an amount received under a life insurance contract to the extent such amount is not allocable to current life insurance protection provided to the non-owner pursuant to the split-dollar life insurance arrangement, the cost of which was paid by the non-owner, or the value of which the non-owner actually took into account pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(iii)
Transfers of death benefit proceeds.
Death benefit proceeds paid to a party to a split-dollar life insurance arrangement (or the estate or beneficiary of that party) that are not excludable from that party's income under section 101(a) to the extent provided in paragraph (f)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section, are treated as transferred to that party in a separate transaction. The death benefit proceeds treated as so transferred will be taxed in a manner similar to other transfers. For example, if death benefit proceeds paid to an employee, the employee's estate, or the employee's beneficiary are not excludable from the employee's gross income under section 101(a) to the extent provided in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, then such payment is treated as a payment of compensation by the employer to the employee.
(g)
Transfer of entire contract or undivided interest therein
—(1)
In general.
Upon a transfer within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3) of this section of a life insurance contract (or an undivided interest therein) to a non-owner (transferee), the transferee (and the owner (transferor) for gift tax and employment tax purposes) takes into account the excess of the fair market value of the life insurance contract (or the undivided interest therein) transferred to the transferee at that time over the sum of—
(i) The amount the transferee pays to the transferor to obtain the contract (or the undivided interest therein); and
(ii) The amount of all economic benefits described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section actually taken into account by the transferee (and the transferor for gift tax and employment tax purposes), plus any consideration described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section paid by the transferee for such economic benefits described in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section. The amount determined under the preceding sentence applies only to the extent that neither this paragraph (g)(1)(ii) nor paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section previously has applied to such economic benefits.
(2)
Determination of fair market value.
For purposes of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the fair market value of a life insurance contract is the policy cash value and the value of all other rights under such contract (including any supplemental agreements thereto and whether or not guaranteed), other than the value of current life insurance protection. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the fair market value of a life insurance contract for gift tax purposes is determined under § 25.2512-6(a) of this chapter.
(3)
Exception for certain transfers in connection with the performance of services.
To the extent the ownership of a life insurance contract (or undivided interest in such contract) is transferred in connection with the performance of services, paragraph (g)(1) of this section does not apply until such contract (or undivided interest in such contract) is taxable under section 83. For purposes of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, fair market value is determined disregarding any lapse restrictions and at the time the transfer of such contract (or undivided interest in such contract) is taxable under section 83.
(4)
Treatment of non-owner after transfer
—(i)
In general.
After a transfer of an entire life insurance contract (except when such transfer is in connection with the performance of services and
the transfer is not yet taxable under section 83), the person who previously had been the non-owner is treated as the owner of such contract for all purposes, including for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section and for purposes of § 1.61-2(d)(2)(ii)(A). After the transfer of an undivided interest in a life insurance contract (or, if later, at the time such transfer is taxable under section 83), the person who previously had been the non-owner is treated as the owner of a separate contract consisting of that interest for all purposes, including for purposes of paragraph (b) of this section and for purposes of § 1.61-2(d)(2)(ii)(A).
(ii)
Investment in the contract after transfer
—(A)
In general.
The amount treated as consideration paid to acquire the contract under section 72(g)(1), in order to determine the aggregate premiums paid by the transferee for purposes of section 72(e)(6)(A) after the transfer (or, if later, at the time such transfer is taxable under section 83), equals the greater of the fair market value of the contract or the sum of the amounts determined under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(B)
Transfers between a donor and a donee.
In the case of a transfer of a contract between a donor and a donee, the amount treated as consideration paid by the transferee to acquire the contract under section 72(g)(1), in order to determine the aggregate premiums paid by the transferee for purposes of section 72(e)(6)(A) after the transfer, equals the sum of the amounts determined under paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section except that—
(
1
) The amount determined under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section includes the aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid or deemed to have been paid by the transferor; and
(
2
) The amount of all economic benefits determined under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section actually taken into account by the transferee does not include such benefits to the extent such benefits were excludable from the transferee's gross income at the time of receipt.
(C)
Transfers of an undivided interest in a contract.
If a portion of a contract is transferred to the transferee, then the amount to be included as consideration paid to acquire the contract is determined by multiplying the amount determined under paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(A) of this section (as modified by paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, if the transfer is between a donor and a donee) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the fair market value of the portion transferred and the denominator of which is the fair market value of the entire contract.
(D)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules of this paragraph (g)(4)(ii):

# Example.
(i) In year 1, donor D and donee E enter into a split-dollar life insurance arrangement as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. D is the owner of the life insurance contract under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The life insurance contract is not a modified endowment contract as defined in section 7702A. In year 5, D gratuitously transfers the contract, within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, to E. At the time of the transfer, the fair market value of the contract is $200,000 and D had paid $50,000 in premiums under the arrangement. In addition, by the time of the transfer, E had current access to $80,000 of policy cash value which was excludable from E's gross income under section 102.
(ii) E's investment in the contract is $50,000, consisting of the $50,000 of premiums paid by D. The $80,000 of policy cash value to which E had current access is not included in E's investment in the contract because such amount was excludable from E's gross income when E had current access to that policy cash value.
(iii)
No investment in the contract for current life insurance protection.
Except as provided in paragraph (g)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, no amount allocable to current life insurance protection provided to the transferee (the cost of which was paid by the transferee or the value of which was provided to the transferee) is treated as consideration paid to acquire the contract under section 72(g)(1) to determine the aggregate premiums paid by the transferee for purposes of determining the transferee's investment in the contract under section 72(e) after the transfer.
(h)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section. Except as otherwise provided, each of the examples assumes that the employer
(R) is the owner (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) of a life insurance contract that is part of a split-dollar life insurance arrangement subject to the rules of paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section, that the employee (E) is not provided any economic benefits described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, that the life insurance contract is not a modified endowment contract under section 7702A, that the compensation paid to E is reasonable, and that E makes no premium payments. The examples are as follows:

# Example 1.
(i) In year 1, R purchases a life insurance contract on the life of E. R is named as the policy owner of the contract. R and E enter into an arrangement under which R will pay all the premiums on the life insurance contract until the termination of the arrangement or E's death. Upon termination of the arrangement or E's death, R is entitled to receive the greater of the aggregate premiums or the policy cash value of the contract. The balance of the death benefit will be paid to a beneficiary designated by E.
(ii) Because R is designated as the policy owner of the contract, R is the owner of the contract under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. In addition, R would be treated as the owner of the contract regardless of whether R were designated as the policy owner under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section because the split-dollar life insurance arrangement is described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section. E is a non-owner of the contract. Under the arrangement between R and E, a portion of the death benefit is payable to a beneficiary designated by E. The arrangement is a split-dollar life insurance arrangement under paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. Because R pays all the premiums on the life insurance contract, R provides to E the entire amount of the current life insurance protection E receives under the arrangement. Therefore, for each year that the split-dollar life insurance arrangement is in effect, E must include in gross income under paragraph (d)(1) of this section the value of current life insurance protection described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section provided to E in each year.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that, upon termination of the arrangement or E's death, R is entitled to receive the lesser of the aggregate premiums or the policy cash value of the contract. Under the terms of the arrangement and applicable state law, the policy cash value is fully accessible by R and R's creditors but E has the right to borrow or withdraw at any time the portion of the policy cash value exceeding the amount payable to R.
(ii) Because R is designated as the policy owner, R is the owner of the contract under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. E is a non-owner of the contract. For each year that the split-dollar life insurance arrangement is in effect, E has the right to borrow or withdraw at any time the portion of the policy cash value exceeding the amount payable to R. Thus, under paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, E has current access to such portion of the policy cash value for each year that the arrangement is in effect. In addition, because R pays all the premiums on the life insurance contract, R provides to E all the economic benefits that E receives under the arrangement. Therefore, for each year that the split-dollar life insurance arrangement is in effect, E must include in gross income under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the value of all economic benefits described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section provided to E in each year.

# Example 3.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that in year 5, R and E modify the split-dollar life insurance arrangement to provide that, upon termination of the arrangement or E's death, R is entitled to receive the greater of the aggregate premiums or one-half the policy cash value of the contract. Under the terms of the modified arrangement and applicable state law, the policy cash value is fully accessible by R and R's creditors but E has the right to borrow or withdraw at any time the portion of the policy cash value exceeding the amount payable to R.
(ii) For each year that the split-dollar life insurance arrangement is in effect, E must include in gross income under paragraph (d)(1) of this section the value of the economic benefits described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section provided to E under the arrangement during that year. In year 5 (and subsequent years), E has the right to borrow or withdraw at any time the portion of the policy cash value exceeding the amount payable to R. Thus, under paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, E has current access to such portion of the policy cash value. Thus, in year 5 (and each subsequent year), E must also include in gross income under paragraph (d)(1) of this section the value of the economic benefits described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section provided to E in each year.
(iii) The arrangement is not described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A)(
1
) of this section after it is modified in year 5. Because R is the designated owner of the life insurance contract, R continues to be treated as the owner of the contract under paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section after the arrangement is modified. In addition, because the modification made by R and E in year 5 does not involve
the transfer (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3) of this section) of an undivided interest in the life insurance contract from R to E, the modification is not a transfer for purposes of paragraph (g) of this section.

# Example 4.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 2
except that in year 7, R and E modify the split-dollar life insurance arrangement to provide that, upon termination of the arrangement or E's death, R will be paid the lesser of 80 percent of the aggregate premiums or the policy cash value of the contract. Under the terms of the modified arrangement and applicable state law, the policy cash value is fully accessible by R and R's creditors but E has the right to borrow or withdraw at any time the portion of the policy cash value exceeding the lesser of 80 percent of the aggregate premiums paid by R or the policy cash value of the contract.
(ii) Commencing in year 7 (and in each subsequent year), E must include in gross income the economic benefits described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section as provided in this
Example 4(ii)
rather than as provided in
Example 2(ii).
Thus, in year 7 (and in each subsequent year) E must include in gross income under paragraph (d) of this section, the excess of the policy cash value over the lesser of 80 percent of the aggregate premiums paid by R or the policy cash value of the contract (to the extent E did not actually include such amounts in gross income for a prior taxable year). In addition, in year 7 (and each subsequent year) E must also include in gross income the value of the economic benefits described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section provided to E under the arrangement in each such year.

# Example 5.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 3
except that in year 7, E is designated as the policy owner. At that time, E's rights to the contract are substantially vested as defined in § 1.83-3(b).
(ii) In year 7, R is treated as having made a transfer (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3) of this section) of the life insurance contract to E. E must include in gross income the amount determined under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(iii) After the transfer of the contract to E, E is the owner of the contract and any premium payments by R will be included in E's income under paragraph (b)(5) of this section and § 1.61-2(d)(2)(ii)(A) (unless R's payments are split-dollar loans as defined in § 1.7872-15(b)(1)).

# Example 6.
(i) In year 1, E and R enter into a split-dollar life insurance arrangement as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Under the arrangement, R is required to make annual premium payments of $10,000 and E is required to make annual premium payments of $500. In year 5, a $500 policy owner dividend payable to E is declared by the insurance company. E directs the insurance company to use the $500 as E's premium payment for year 5.
(ii) For each year the arrangement is in effect, E must include in gross income the value of the economic benefits provided during the year, as required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section, over the $500 premium payments paid by E. In year 5, E must also include in gross income as compensation the excess, if any, of the $500 distributed to E from the proceeds of the policy owner dividend over the amount determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.
(iii) R must include in income the premiums paid by E during the years the split-dollar life insurance arrangement is in effect, including the $500 of the premium E paid in year 5 with proceeds of the policy owner dividend. R's investment in the contract is increased in an amount equal to the premiums paid by E, including the $500 of the premium paid by E in year 5 from the proceeds of the policy owner dividend. In year 5, R is treated as receiving a $500 distribution under the contract, which is taxed pursuant to section 72.

# Example 7.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 2
except that in year 10, E withdraws $100,000 from the cash value of the contract.
(ii) In year 10, R is treated as receiving a $100,000 distribution from the insurance company. This amount is treated as an amount received by R under the contract and taxed pursuant to section 72. This amount reduces R's investment in the contract under section 72(e). R is treated as paying the $100,000 to E as cash compensation, and E must include that amount in gross income less any amounts determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.

# Example 8.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 7
except E receives the proceeds of a $100,000 specified policy loan directly from the insurance company.
(ii) The transfer of the proceeds of the specified policy loan to E is treated as a loan by the insurance company to R. Under the rules of section 72(e), the $100,000 loan is not included in R's income and does not reduce R's investment in the contract. R is treated as paying the $100,000 of loan proceeds to E as cash compensation. E must include that amount in gross income less any amounts determined under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.

§ 1.62-1
Adjusted gross income.
(a)-(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Deductions allowable in computing adjusted gross income.
The deductions specified in section 62(a) for purposes of computing adjusted gross income are—
(1) Deductions set forth in § 1.62-1T(c); and
(2) Deductions allowable under part VI, subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, (section 161 and following) that consist of expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection with the performance of services as an employee under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement (as defined in § 1.62-2) with his or her employer. For the rules pertaining to expenses paid or incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1989, see § 1.62-1T (c)(2) and (f) (as contained in 26 CFR part 1 (§§ 1.61 to 1.169) revised April 1, 1992).
(d)-(h) [Reserved]
(i)
Effective date.
Paragraph (c) of this section is effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1989.

§ 1.62-1T
Adjusted gross income (temporary).
(a)
Basis for determining the amount of certain deductions.
The term “adjusted gross income” means the gross income computed under section 61 minus such of the deductions allowed by chapter 1 of the Code as are specified in section 62(a). Adjusted gross income is used as the basis for determining the following:
(1) The limitation on the amount of miscellaneous itemized deductions (under section 67).
(2) The limitation on the amount of the deduction for casualty losses (under section 165(h)(2)),
(3) The limitation on the amount of the deduction for charitable contributions (under section 170(b)(1)),
(4) The limitation on the amount of the deduction for medical and dental expenses (under section 213),
(5) The limitation on the amount of the deduction for qualified retirement contributions for active participants in certain pension plans (under section 219(g)), and
(6) The phase-out of the exemption from the disallowance of passive activity losses and credits (under section 469(i)(3)).
(b)
Double deduction not permitted.
Section 62 (a) merely specifies which of the deductions provided in chapter 1 of the Code shall be allowed in computing adjusted gross income. It does not create any new deductions. The fact that a particular item may be described in more than one of the paragraphs under section 62(a) does not permit the item to be deducted twice in computing adjusted gross income or taxable income.
(c)
Deductions allowable in computing adjusted gross income.
The deductions specified in section 62(a) for purposes of computing adjusted gross income are:
(1) Deductions allowable under chapter 1 of the Code (other than by part VII (section 211 and following), subchapter B of such chapter) that are attributable to a trade or business carried on by the taxpayer not consisting of services performed as an employee;
(2) [Reserved]
(3) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, deductions allowable under section 162 that consist of expenses paid or incurred by a qualified performing artist (as defined in section 62(b)) in connection with the performance by him or her of services in the performing arts as an employee;
(4) Deductions allowable under part VI as losses from the sale or exchange of property;
(5) Deductions allowable under part VI, section 212, or section 611 that are attributable to property held for the production of rents or royalties;
(6) Deductions for depreciation or depletion allowable under sections 167 or 611 to a life tenant of property or to an income beneficiary of property held in trust or to an heir, legatee, or devisee of an estate;
(7) Deductions allowed by section 404 for contributions on behalf of a self-employed individual;
(8) Deductions allowed by section 219 for contributions to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a), or for an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b);
(9) Deductions allowed by section 402(e)(3) with respect to a lump-sum distribution;
(10) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1972, deductions allowed by section 165 for losses incurred in any transaction entered into for profit though not connected with a trade or business, to the extent that such losses include amounts forfeited to a bank, mutual savings bank, savings and loan association, building and loan association, cooperative bank or homestead association as a penalty for premature withdrawal of funds from a time savings account, certificate of deposit, or similar class of deposit;
(11) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976, deductions for alimony and separate maintenance payments allowed by section 215;
(12) Deductions allowed by section 194 for the amortization of reforestation expenditures; and
(13) Deductions allowed by section 165 for the repayment (made in a taxable year beginning after December 28, 1980)
to a trust described in paragraph (9) or (17) of section 501(c) of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits received from such trust if such repayment is required because of the receipt of trade readjustment allowances under section 231 or 232 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2291 and 2292).
(d)
Expenses directly related to a trade or business.
For the purpose of the deductions specified in section 62, the performance of personal services as an employee does not constitute the carrying on of a trade or business, except as otherwise expressly provided. The practice of a profession, not as an employee, is considered the conduct of a trade or business within the meaning of such section. To be deductible for the purposes of determining adjusted gross income, expenses must be those directly, and not those merely remotely, connected with the conduct of a trade or business. For example, taxes are deductible in arriving at adjusted gross income only if they constitute expenditures directly attributable to a trade or business or to property from which rents or royalties are derived. Thus, property taxes paid or incurred on real property used in a trade or business are deductible, but state taxes on net income are not deductible even though the taxpayer's income is derived from the conduct of a trade or business.
(e)
Reimbursed and unreimbursed employee expenses
—(1)
In general.
Expenses paid or incurred by an employee that are deductible from gross income under part VI in computing taxable income (determined without regard to section 67) and for which the employee is reimbursed by the employer, its agent, or third party (for whom the employee performs a benefit as an employee of the employer) under an express agreement for reimbursement or pursuant to an
express
expense allowance arrangement may be deducted from gross income in computing adjusted gross income. Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(4) of this section, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, if the amount of a reimbursement made by an employer, its agent, or third party to an employee is less than the total amount of the business expenses paid or incurred by the employee, the determination of to which of the employee's business expenses the reimbursement applies and the amount of each expense that is covered by the reimbursement is made on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
(2)
Facts and circumstances unclear on business expenses for meals and entertainment.
If—
(i) The facts and circumstances do not make clear—
(A) That a reimbursement does not apply to business expenses for meals or entertainment, or
(B) The amount of business expenses for meals or entertainment that is covered by the reimbursement, and
(ii) The employee pays or incurs business expenses for meals or entertainment,
the amount of the reimbursement that applies to such expenses (or portion thereof with respect to which the facts and circumstances are unclear) shall be determined by multiplying the amount of the employee's business expenses for meals and entertainment (or portion thereof with respect to which the facts and circumstances are unclear) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount of the reimbursement (or portion thereof with respect to which the facts and circumstances are unclear) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of all the business expenses of the employee (or portion thereof with respect to which the facts and circumstances are unclear).
(3)
Deductibility of unreimbursed expenses.
The amount of expenses that is determined not to be reimbursed pursuant to paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of this section is deductible from adjusted gross income in determining the employee's taxable income subject to the limitations applicable to such expenses (e.g., the 2-percent floor of section 67 and the 80-percent limitation on meal and entertainment expenses provided for in section 274(n)).
(4)
Unreimbursed expenses of State legislators.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, any portion of the amount allowed as a deduction to State legislators pursuant to section 162(h)1)(B) that is not reimbursed by the State or a third party shall be allocated between lodging and meals in the
same ratio as the amounts allowable for lodging and meals under the Federal per diem applicable to the legislator's State capital at the end of the legislator's taxable year (see Appendix 1-A of the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR), which as of March 28, 1988, are contained in GSA Bulletin FPMR A-40, Supplement 20). For purposes of this paragraph (e)(4), the amount allowable for meals under the Federal per diem shall be the amount of the Federal per diem allowable for meals and incidental expenses reduced by $2 per legislative day (or other amount allocated to incidental expenses in 1-7.5(a)(2) of the FTR). The unreimbursed portion of each type of expense is deductible from adjusted gross income in determining the State legislator's taxable income subject to the limitations applicable to such expenses. For example, the unreimbursed portion allocable to meals shall be reduced by 20 percent pursuant to section 274(n) before being subjected to the 2-percent floor of section 67 for purposes of computing the taxable income of a State legislator. See § 1.67-1T(a)(2).
(5)
Expenses paid directly by an employer, its agent, or third party.
In the case of an employer, its agent, or a third party who provides property or services to an employee or who pays an employee's expenses directly instead of reimbursing the employee, see section 132 and the regulations thereunder for the income tax treatment of such expenses.
(6)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
During 1987, A, an employee, while on business trips away from home pays $300 for travel fares, $200 for lodging and $100 for meals. In addition, A pays $50 for business meals in the area of his place of employment (“local meals”), $250 for continuing education courses, and $100 for business-related entertainment (other than meals). The total amount of the reimbursements received by A for his employee expenses from his employer is $750, and it is assumed that A's expenses meet the deductibility requirements of sections 162 and 274. A includes the amount of the reimbursement in his gross income. A's employer designates the reimbursement to cover in full A's expenses for travel fares, lodging, and meals while away from home, local meals, and entertainment, and no facts or circumstances indicate a contrary intention of the employer. Because the facts and circumstances make clear the amount of A's business expenses for meals and entertainment that is covered by the reimbursement, the reimbursement will be allocated to these expenses. In determining his adjusted gross income under section 62, A may deduct the full amount of the reimbursement for travel fares, lodging, and meals while away from home, local meals, and entertainment. In determining his taxable income under section 63, A may deduct his expenses for continuing education courses to the extent allowable by sections 67 and 162.

# Example 2.
Assume the facts are the same as in example (1) except that the facts and circumstances make clear that the reimbursement covers all types of deductible expenses but they do not make clear the amount of each type of expense that is covered by the reimbursement. The amount of the reimbursement that is allocated to A's business expenses for meals and entertainment is $187.50. This amount is determined by multiplying the total amount of A's business expenses for meals and entertainment ($250) by the ratio of A's total reimbursement to A's total business expenses ($750/$1,000). The remaining amount of the reimbursement, $562.50 ($750−$187.50), is allocated to A's business expenses other than meal and entertainment expenses. Therefore, in determining his adjusted gross income under section 62, A may deduct $750 for reimbursed business expenses (including meals and entertainment). In determining his taxable income under section 63, A may deduct (subject to the limitations and conditions of sections 67, 162, and 274) the unreimbursed portion of his expenses for meals and entertainment ($62.50 ($250−$187.50), and other employee business expenses ($187.50 ($750−$562.50)).

# Example 3.
Assume the facts are the same as in example (1) except that the amount of the reimbursement is $500. Assume further that the facts and circumstances make clear that the reimbursement covers $100 of expenses for meals and that the remaining $400 of the reimbursement covers all types of deductible expenses (including any expenses for meals in excess of the $100 already designated) other than expenses for entertainment. The amount of the reimbursement that is allocated to A's business expenses for meals and entertainment is $125. This amount is equal to the sum of the amount of the reimbursement that clearly applies to meals ($100) and the amount of the reimbursement with respect to which the facts are unclear that is allocated to meals ($25). The latter amount is determined by multiplying the total amount of A's business expenses for meals and entertainment with respect to which the facts are unclear ($50) by
the ratio of A's total reimbursement with respect to which the facts are unclear to A's total business expenses with respect to which the facts are unclear ($400/$800). The remaining amount of the reimbursement, $375 ($500−$125) is allocated to A's business expenses other than meals and entertainment. Therefore, in determining his adjusted gross income under section 62, A may deduct $500 for reimbursed business expenses (including meals). In determining his taxable income under section 63, A may deduct (subject to the limitations and conditions of sections 67, 162, and 274) the unreimbursed portion of his expenses for meals ($25 ($150−$125)), entertainment ($100), and other employee business expenses ($375 ($750−$375)).

# Example 4.
During 1987 B, a research scientist, is employed by Corporation X. B gives a speech before members of Association Y, a professional organization of scientists, describing her most recent research findings. Pursuant to a reimbursement arrangement, Y reimburses B for the full amount of her travel fares to the site of the speech and for the full amount of her expenses for lodging and meals while there. B includes the amount of the reimbursement in her gross income. B may deduct the full amount of her travel expenses pursuant to section 62(a)(2)(A) in computing her adjusted gross income.
(f) [Reserved]
(g)
Moving expenses.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, a taxpayer described in section 217(a) shall not take into account the deduction described in section 217 relating to moving expenses in computing adjusted gross income under section 62 even if the taxpayer is reimbursed for his or her moving expenses. Such a taxpayer shall include the amount of any reimbursement for moving expenses in income pursuant to section 82. The deduction described in section 217 shall be taken into account in computing the taxable income of the taxpayer under section 63. Pursuant to section 67(b)(6), the 2-percent floor described in section 67(a) does not apply to moving expenses.
(h)

Scope.
For purposes of determining “adjusted gross income,” section 62(a)(2)(A) allows an employee a deduction for expenses allowed by part VI (section 161 and following), subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code, paid by the employee, in connection with the performance of services as an employee of the employer, under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement with a payor (the employer, its agent, or a third party). Section 62(c) provides that an arrangement will not be treated as a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement for purposes of section 62(a)(2)(A) if—
(1) Such arrangement does not require the employee to substantiate the expenses covered by the arrangement to the payor, or
(2) Such arrangement provides the employee the right to retain any amount in excess of the substantiated expenses covered under the arrangement.
This section prescribes rules relating to the requirements of section 62(c).
(c)
Reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement
—(1)
Defined.
For purposes of §§ 1.62-1, 1.62-1T, and 1.62-2, the phrase “reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement” means an arrangement that meets the requirements of paragraphs (d) (business connection, (e) (substantiation), and (f) (returning amounts in excess of expenses) of this section. A payor may have more than one arrangement with respect to a particular employee, depending on the facts and circumstances. See paragraph (d)(2) of this section (payor treated as having two arrangements under certain circumstances).
(2)
Accountable plans
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, if an arrangement meets the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, all amounts paid under the arrangement are treated as paid under an “accountable plan.”
(ii)
Special rule for failure to return excess.
If an arrangement meets the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, but the employee fails to return, within a reasonable period of time, any amount in excess of the amount of the expenses substantiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, only the amounts paid under the arrangement that are not in excess of the substantiated expenses are treated as paid under an accountable plan.
(3)
Nonaccountable plans
—(i)
In general.
If an arrangement does not satisfy one or more of the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section, all amounts paid under the arrangement are treated as paid under a “nonaccountable plan.” If a payor provides a nonaccountable plan, an employee who receives payments under the plan cannot compel the payor to treat the payments as paid under an accountable plan by voluntarily substantiating the expenses and returning any excess to the payor.
(ii)
Special rule for failure to return excess.
If an arrangement meets the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, but the employee fails to return, within a reasonable period of time, any amount in excess of the amount of the expenses substantiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, the amounts paid under the arrangement that are in excess of the substantiated expenses are treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan.
(4)
Treatment of payments under accountable plans.
Amounts treated as paid under an accountable plan are excluded from the employee's gross income, are not reported as wages or other compensation on the employee's Form W-2, and are exempt from the withholding and payment of employment taxes (Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA), Railroad Unemployment Repayment Tax (RURT), and income tax.) See paragraph (l) of this section for cross references.
(5)
Treatment of payments under nonaccountable plans.
Amounts treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan are
included in the employee's gross income, must be reported as wages or other compensation on the employee's Form W-2, and are subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes (FICA, FUTA, RRTA, RURT, and income tax). See paragraph (h) of this section. Expenses attributable to amounts included in the employee's gross income may be deducted, provided the employee can substantiate the full amount of his or her expenses (
i.e.
, the amount of the expenses, if any, the reimbursement for which is treated as paid under an accountable plan as well as those for which the employee is claiming the deduction) in accordance with §§ 1.274-5T and 1.274(d)-1 or § 1.162-17, but only as a miscellaneous itemized deduction subject to the limitations applicable to such expenses (e.g., the 80-percent limitation on meal and entertainment expenses provided in section 274(n) and the 2-percent floor provided in section 67).
(d)
Business connection
—(1)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, an arrangement meets the requirements of this paragraph (d) if it provides advances, allowances (including per diem allowances, allowances only for meals and incidental expenses, and mileage allowances), or reimbursements only for business expenses that are allowable as deductions by part VI (section 161 and the following), subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code, and that are paid or incurred by the employee in connection with the performance of services as an employee of the employer. The payment may be actually received from the employer, its agent, or a third party for whom the employee performs a service as an employee of the employer, and may include amounts charged directly or indirectly to the payor through credit card systems or otherwise. In addition, if both wages and the reimbursement or other expense allowance are combined in a single payment, the reimbursement or other expense allowance must be identified either by making a separate payment or by specifically identifying the amount of the reimbursement or other expense allowance.
(2)
Other bona fide expenses.
If an arrangement provides advances, allowances, or reimbursements for business expenses described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section (
i.e.
, deductible employee business expenses) and for other bona fide expenses related to the employer's business (e.g., travel that is not away from home) that are not deductible under part VI (section 161 and the following), subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code, the payor is treated as maintaining two arrangements. The portion of the arrangement that provides payments for the deductible employee business expenses is treated as one arrangement that satisfies this paragraph (d). The portion of the arrangement that provides payments for the nondeductible employee expenses is treated as a second arrangement that does not satisfy this paragraph (d) and all amounts paid under this second arrangement will be treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan. See paragraphs (c)(5) and (h) of this section.
(3)
Reimbursement requirement
—(i)
In general.
If a payor arranges to pay an amount to an employee regardless of whether the employee incurs (or is reasonably expected to incur) business expenses of a type described in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, the arrangement does not satisfy this paragraph (d) and all amounts paid under the arrangement are treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan. See paragraphs (c)(5) and (h) of this section.
(ii)
Per diem allowances.
An arrangement providing a per diem allowance for travel expenses of a type described in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section that is computed on a basis similar to that used in computing the employee's wages or other compensation (e.g., the number of hours worked, miles traveled, or pieces produced) meets the requirements of this paragraph (d) only if, on December 12, 1989, the per diem allowance was identified by the payor either by making a separate payment or by specifically identifying the amount of the per diem allowance, or a per diem allowance computed on that basis was commonly used in the industry in which the employee is employed. See section 274(d) and § 1.274(d)-1. A per diem allowance described in this paragraph (d)(3)(ii) may
be adjusted in a manner that reasonably reflects actual increases in employee business expenses occurring after December 12, 1989.
(e)
Substantiation
—(1)
In general.
An arrangement meets the requirements of this paragraph (e) if it requires each business expense to be substantiated to the payor in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) or (e)(3) of this section, whichever is applicable, within a reasonable period of time. See § 1.274-5T or § 1.162-17.
(2)
Expenses governed by section 274(d).
An arrangement that reimburses travel, entertainment, use of a passenger automobile or other listed property, or other business expenses governed by section 274(d) meets the requirements of this paragraph (e)(2) if information sufficient to satisfy the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and the regulations thereunder is submitted to the payor. See § 1.274-5. Under section 274(d), information sufficient to substantiate the requisite elements of each expenditure or use must be submitted to the payor. For example, with respect to travel away from home, § 1.274-5(b)(2) requires that information sufficient to substantiate the amount, time, place, and business purpose of the expense must be submitted to the payor. Similarly, with respect to use of a passenger automobile or other listed property, § 1.274-5(b)(6) requires that information sufficient to substantiate the amount, time, use, and business purpose of the expense must be submitted to the payor.
See
§ 1.274-5(g) and (j), which grant the Commissioner the authority to establish optional methods of substantiating certain expenses. Substantiation of the amount of a business expense in accordance with rules prescribed pursuant to the authority granted by § 1.274-5(g) or (j) will be treated as substantiation of the amount of such expense for purposes of this section.
(3)
Expenses not governed by section 274(d).
An arrangement that reimburses business expenses not governed by section 274(d) meets the requirements of this paragraph (e)(3) if information is submitted to the payor sufficient to enable the payor to identify the specific nature of each expense and to conclude that the expense is attributable to the payor's business activities. Therefore, each of the elements of an expenditure or use must be substantiated to the payor. It is not sufficient if an employee merely aggregates expenses into broad categories (such as “travel”) or reports individual expenses through the use of vague, nondescriptive terms (such as “miscellaneous business expenses”). See § 1.162-17(b).
(f)
Returning amounts in excess of expenses—(
1
) In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, an arrangement meets the requirements of this paragraph (f) if it requires the employee to return to the payor within a reasonable period of time may amount paid under the arrangement in excess of the expenses substantiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. The determination of whether an arrangement requires an employee to return amounts in excess of substantiated expenses will depend on the facts and circumstances. An arrangement whereby money is advanced to an employee to defray expenses will be treated as satisfying the requirements of this paragraph (f) only if the amount of money advanced is reasonably calculated not to exceed the amount of anticipated expenditures, the advance of money is made on a day within a reasonable period of the day that the anticipated expenditures are paid or incurred, and any amounts in excess of the expenses substantiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section are required to be returned to the payor within a reasonable period of time after the advance is received.
(2)
Per diem or mileage allowances.
The Commissioner may, in his discretion, prescribe rules in pronouncements of general applicability under which a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement that provides per diem allowances providing for ordinary and necessary expenses of traveling away from home (exclusive of transportation costs to and from destination) or mileage allowances providing for ordinary and necessary expenses of local travel and tranportation while traveling away from home will be treated as satisfying the requirements of this paragraph (f), even though the arrangement does not require the employee to
return the portion of such an allowance that relates to the days or miles of travel substantiated and that exceeds the amount of the employee's expenses deemed substantiated pursuant to rules prescribed under section 274(d), provided the allowance is paid at a rate for each day or mile of travel that is reasonably calculated not to exceed the amount of the employee's expenses or anticipated expenses and the employee is required to return to the payor within a reasonable period of time any portion of such allowance which relates to days or miles of travel not substantiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
(g)
Reasonable period
—(1)
In general.
The determination of a reasonable period of time will depend on the facts and circumstances.
(2)
Safe harbors
—(i)
Fixed date method.
An advance made within 30 days of when an expense is paid or incurred, an expense substantiated to the payor within 60 days after it is paid or incurred, or an amount returned to the payor within 120 days after an expense is paid or incurred will be treated as having occurred within a reasonable period of time.
(ii)
Periodic statement method.
If a payor provides employees with periodic statements (no less frequently than quarterly) stating the amount, if any, paid under the arrangement in excess of the expenses the employee has substantiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, and requesting the employee to substantiate any additional business expenses that have not yet been substantiated (whether or not such expenses relate to the expenses with respect to which the original advance was paid) and/or to return any amounts remaining unsubstantiated within 120 days of the statement, an expense substantiated or an amount returned within that period will be treated as being substantiated or returned within a reasonable period of time.
(3)
Pattern of overreimbursements.
If, under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement, a payor has a plan or practice to provide amounts to employees in excess of expenses substantiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and to avoid reporting and withholding on such amounts, the payor may not use either of the safe harbors provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section for any years during which such plan or practice exists.
(h)
Withholding and payment of employment taxes
—(1)
When excluded from wages.
If an arrangement meets the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, the amounts paid under the arrangement that are not in excess of the expenses substantiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section (
i.e.
, the amounts treated as paid under an accountable plan) are not wages and are not subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes. If an arrangement provides advances, allowances, or reimbursements for meal and entertainment expenses and a portion of the payment is treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan under paragraph (d)(2) of this section due solely to section 274(n), then notwithstanding paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, these nondeductible amounts are neither treated as gross income nor subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes.
(2)
When included in wages
—(i)
Accountable plans
—(A)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(i)(B) of this section, if the expenses covered under an arrangement that meets the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section are not substantiated to the payor in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section within a reasonable period of time or if any amounts in excess of the substantiated expenses are not returned to the payor in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section within a reasonable period of time, the amount which is treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section is subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes no later than the first payroll period following the end of the reasonable period. A payor may treat any amount not substantiated or returned within the periods specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section as not substantiated or returned within a reasonable period of time.
(B)
Per diem or mileage allowances
—(
1
)
In general.
If a payor pays a per diem or
mileage allowance under an arrangement that meets the requirements of the paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, the portion, if any, of the allowance paid that relates to days or miles of travel substantiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and that exceeds the amount of the employee's expenses deemed substantiated for such travel pursuant to rules prescribed under section 274(d) and § 1.274(d)-1 or § 1.274-5T(j) is treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan. See paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. Because the employee is not required to return this excess portion, the reasonable period of time provisions of paragraph (g) of this section (relating to the return of excess amounts) do not apply to this excess portion.
(
2
)
Reimbursements.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(i)(B)(
4
) of this section, in the case of a per diem or mileage allowance paid as a reimbursement at a rate for each day or mile of travel that exceeds the amounts of the employee's expenses deemed substantiated for a day or mile of travel, the excess portion described in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section is subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes in the payroll period in which the payor reimburses the expenses for the days or miles of travel substantiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
(
3
)
Advances.
Except as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(i)(B)(
4
) of this section, in the case of a per diem or mileage allowance paid as an advance at a rate for each day or mile of travel that exceeds the amount of the employee's expenses deemed substantiated for a day or mile of travel, the excess portion described in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section is subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes no later than the first payroll period following the payroll period in which the expenses with respect to which the advance was paid (
i.e.
, the days or miles of travel) are substantiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. The expenses with respect to which the advance was paid must be substantiated within a reasonable period of time. See paragraph (g) of this section.
(
4
)
Special rules.
The Commissioner may, in his discretion, prescribe special rules in pronouncements of general applicability regarding the timing of withholding and payment of employment taxes on per diem and mileage allowances.
(ii)
Nonaccountable plans.
If an arrangement does not satisfy one or more of the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section, all amounts paid under the arrangement are wages and are subject to withholding and payment of employment taxes when paid.
(i)
Application.
The requirements of paragraphs (d) (business connection), (e) (substantiation), and (f) (returning amounts in excess of expenses) of this section will be applied on an employee-by-employee basis. Thus, for example, the failure by one employee to substantiate expenses under an arrangement in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section will not cause amounts paid to other employees to be treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan.
(j)
Examples.
The rules contained in this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1 Reimbursement requirement.
Employer S pays its engineers $200 a day. On those days that an engineer travels away from home on business for Employer S, Employer S designates $50 of the $200 as paid to reimburse the engineer's travel expenses. Because Employer S would pay an engineer $200 a day regardless of whether the engineer was traveling away from home, the arrangement does not satisfy the reimbursement requirement of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. Thus, no part of the $50 Employer S designated as a reimbursement is treated as paid under an accountable plan. Rather, all payments under the arrangement are treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan. Employer S must report the entire $200 as wages or other compensation on the employees' Forms W-2 and must withhold and pay employment taxes on the entire $200 when paid.

# Example 2 Reimbursement requirement, multiple arrangements.
Airline T pays all its employees a salary. Airline T also pays an allowance under an arrangement that otherwise meets the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section to its pilots and flight attendants who travel away from their home base airports, whether or not they are “away from home.” Because the allowance is paid only to those employees who incur (or are reasonably expected to incur) expenses of a type described in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, the arrangement satisfies the reimbursement requirement of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.
Under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, Airline T is treated as maintaining two arrangements. The portion of the arrangement providing the allowances for away from home travel is treated as an accountable plan. The portion of the arrangement providing the allowances for non-away from home travel is treated as a nonaccountable plan. Airline T must report the non-away from home allowances as wages or other compensation on the employees' Forms W-2 and must withhold and pay employment taxes on these payments when paid.

# Example 3. Reimbursement requirement.
Corporation R pays all its salespersons a salary. Corporation R also pays a travel allowance under an arrangement that otherwise meets the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section. This allowance is paid to all salespersons, including salespersons that Corporation R knows, or has reason to know, do not travel away from their offices on Corporation R business and would not be reasonably expected to incur travel expenses. Because the allowance is not paid only to those employees who incur (or are reasonably expected to incur) expenses of a type described in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, the arrangement does not satisfy the reimbursement requirement of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. Thus, no part of the allowance Corporation R designated as a reimbursement is treated as paid under an accountable plan. Rather, all payments under the arrangement are treated as paid under a nonaccountable plan. Corporation R must report all payments under the arrangement as wages or other compensation on the employees' Forms W-2 and must withhold and pay employment taxes on the payments when paid.

# Example 4 Separate arrangement, miscellaneous expenses.
Under an arrangement that meets the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, County U reimburses its employees for lodging and meal expenses incurred when they travel away from home on County U business. For its own convenience, County U also separately pays certain of its employees a $25 monthly allowance to cover the cost of small miscellaneous office expenses. County U does not require its employees to substantiate these miscellaneous expenses and does not require them to return the amounts by which the monthly allowance exceeds the miscellaneous expenses. The monthly allowance arrangement is a nonaccountable plan. County U must report the monthly allowances as wages or other compensation on the employees' Forms W-2 and must withhold and pay employment taxes on the monthly allowances when paid. The nonaccountable plan providing the monthly allowances is treated as separate from the accountable plan providing reimbursements for lodging and meal expenses incurred for travel away from home on County U business.

# Example 5 Excessive advances.
In anticipation of employee business expenses that Corporation V does not reasonably expect to exceed $400 in any quarter, Corporation V nonetheless advances $1,000 to Employee A for such expenses. Whenever Employee A substantiates an expense in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, Corporation V provides an additional advance in an amount equal to the amount substantiated, thereby providing a continuing advance of $1,000. Because the amounts advanced under this arrangement are not reasonably calculated so as not to exceed the amount of anticipated expenditures and because the advance of money is not made on a day within a reasonable period of the day that the anticipated expenditures are paid or incurred, the arrangement is a nonaccountable plan. The arrangement fails to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (d) (business connection) and (f) (reasonable calculation of advances) of this section. Thus, Corporation V must report the entire amount of each advance as wages or other compensation and must withhold and pay employment taxes on the entire amount of each advance when paid.

# Example 6 Excess mileage advance.
Under an arrangement that meets the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, Employer W pays its employees a mileage allowance at a rate of 30 cents per mile (when the amount deemed substantiated for each mile of travel substantiated is 26 cents per mile) to cover automobile business expenses. The allowance is paid at a rate for each mile of travel that is reasonably calculated not to exceed the amount of the employee's expenses or anticipated expenses. Employer W does not require the return of the portion of the mileage allowance (4 cents) that exceeds the amount deemed substantiated for each mile of travel substantiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. In June, Employer W advances Employee B $150 for 500 miles to be traveled by Employee B during the month. In July, Employee B substantiates 500 miles of business travel. The amount deemed substantiated by Employee B is $130. However, Employer W does not require Employee B to return the remaining $20 of the advance. No later than the first payroll period following the payroll period in which the business miles of travel are substantiated, Employer W must withhold and pay employment taxes on $20 (500 miles × 4 cents per mile).

# Example 7 Excess per diem reimbursement.
Under an arrangement that meets the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section, Employer X pays its employees a per diem allowance to cover lodging, meal, and incidental expenses incurred for travel away from home on Employer X business at a rate equal to 120 percent of the amount
deemed substantiated for each day of travel to the localities to which the employees travel. Employer X does not require the employees to return the 20 percent by which the reimbursement for those expenses exceeds the amount deemed substantiated for each day of travel substantiated in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. Employee C substantiates six days of business travel away from home: Two days in a locality for which the amount deemed substantiated is $100 a day and four days in a locality for which the amount deemed substantiated is $125 a day. Employer X reimburses Employee C $840 for the six days of travel away from home (2 × (120% × $100) + 4 × (120% × $125)), and does not require Employee C to return the excess portion ($140 excess portion = (2 days × $20 ($120−$100) + 4 days × $25 ($150-$125)). For the payroll period in which Employer X reimburses the expenses, Employer X must withhold and pay employment taxes on $140.

# Example 8. Return Requirement.
Employer Y provides expense allowances to certain of its employees to cover business expenses of a type described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section under an arrangement that requires the employees to substantiate their expenses within a reasonable period of time and to return any excess amounts within a reasonable period of time. Each time an employee returns an excess amount to Employer Y, however, Employer Y pays the employee a “bonus” equal to the amount returned by the employee. The arrangement fails to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (f) (returning amounts in excess of expenses) of this section. Thus, Employer Y must report the entire amount of the expense allowance payments as wages or other compensation and must withhold and pay employment taxes on the payments when paid. Compare example (6) (where the employee is not required to return the portion of the mileage allowance that exceeds the amount deemed substantiated for each mile of travel substantiated).

# Example 9 Timely substantiation.
Employer Z provides a $500 advance to Employee D for a trip away from home on Employer Z business. Employee D incurs $500 in business expenses on the trip. Employer Z uses the periodic statement method safe harbor. At the end of the quarter during which the trip occurred, Employer Z sends a quarterly statement to Employee D stating that $500 was advanced to Employee D during the quarter and that no expenses were substantiated and no excess amounts returned. The statement advises Employee D that Employee D must substantiate any additional business expenses within 120 days of the date of the statement, and must return any unsubstantiated excess within the 120-day period. Employee D fails to substantiate any expenses or to return the excess within the 120-day period. Employer Z treats the $500 as wages and withholds and pays employment taxes on the $500. After the 120-day period has expired, Employee D substantiates the $500 in travel expenses in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. Employer Z properly reported and withheld and paid employment taxes on the $500 and no adjustments may be made. Employee D must include the $500 in gross income and may deduct the $500 of expenses as a miscellaneous itemized deduction subject to the 2-percent floor provided in section 67.
(k)
Anti-abuse provision.
If a payor's reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement evidences a pattern of abuse of the rules of section 62(c) and this section, all payments made under the arrangement will be treated as made under a nonaccountable plan.
(l)
Cross references.

§ 1.63-1
Change of treatment with respect to the zero bracket amount and itemized deductions.
(a)
In general.
An individual who files a return on which the individual itemizes deductions in accordance with section 63(g) may later make a change of treatment by recomputing taxable income for the taxable year to which that return relates without itemizing deductions. Similarly, an individual who files a return on which the individual computes taxable income without itemizing deductions may later make a change of treatment by itemizing deductions in accordance with section 63(g) in recomputing taxable income for the taxable year to which that return relates.
(b)
No extension of time for claiming credit or refund.
A change of treatment described in paragraph (a) of this section does not extend the period of time prescribed in section 6511 within which the taxpayer may make a claim for credit or refund of tax.
(c)
Special requirements if spouse filed separate return
—(1)
Requirements.
If the spouse of the taxpayer filed a separate return for a taxable year corresponding to the taxable year of the taxpayer, the taxpayer may not make a change of treatment described in paragraph (a) of this section for that year unless—
(i) The spouse makes a change of treatment on the separate return consistent with the change of treatment sought by the taxpayer; and
(ii) The taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse file a consent in writing to the assessment of any deficiency of either spouse to the extent attributable to the change of treatment, even though the assessment of the deficiency would otherwise be prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law. The consent must be filed with the district director for the district in which the taxpayer applies for the change of treatment, and the period during which a deficiency may be assessed shall be established by agreement of the spouses and the district director.
(2)
Corresponding taxable year.
A taxable year of one spouse corresponds to a taxable year of the other spouse if both taxable years end in the same calendar year. If the taxable year of one spouse ends with death, however, the corresponding taxable year of the surviving spouse is that in which the death occurs.
(d)
Inapplicable if tax liability has been compromised.
The taxpayer may not make a change of treatment described in paragraph (a) of this section for any taxable year if—
(1) The tax liability of the taxpayer for the taxable year has been compromised under section 7122; or
(2) The tax liability of the taxpayer's spouse for a taxable year corresponding to the taxable year of the taxpayer has been compromised under section 7122. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section for the determination of a corresponding taxable year.
(e)
Effective date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning after 1976.

[T.D. 8002, 49 FR 50666, Dec. 31, 1984]
§ 1.66-1
Treatment of community income.
(a)
In general.
Married individuals domiciled in a community property state who do not elect to file a joint individual Federal income tax return under section 6013 generally must report half of the total community income earned by the spouses during the taxable year except at times when one of the following exceptions applies:
(1) The spouses live apart and meet the qualifications of § 1.66-2.
(2) The Secretary denies a spouse the Federal income tax benefits resulting from community property law under § 1.66-3, because that spouse acted as if solely entitled to the income and failed to notify his or her spouse of the nature and amount of the income prior to the due date for the filing of his or her spouse's return.
(3) A requesting spouse qualifies for traditional relief from the Federal income tax liability resulting from the operation of community property law under § 1.66-4(a).
(4) A requesting spouse qualifies for equitable relief from the Federal income tax liability resulting from the operation of community property law under § 1.66-4(b).
(b)
Applicability.
(1) The rules of this section apply only to community income, as defined by state law. The rules of this section do not apply to income that is not community income. Thus, the rules of this section do not apply to income from property that was formerly community property, but in accordance with state law, has ceased to be community property, becoming, e.g., separate property or property held by joint tenancy or tenancy in common.
(2) When taxpayers report income under paragraph (a) of this section,
all
community income for the calendar year is treated in accordance with the rules provided by section 879(a). Unlike the other provisions under section 66, section 66(a) does not permit inclusion on an item-by-item basis.
(c)
Transferee liability.
The provisions of section 66 do not negate liability that arises under the operation of other laws. Therefore, a spouse who is not subject to Federal income tax on community income may nevertheless remain liable for the unpaid tax (including additions to tax, penalties, and interest) to the extent provided by Federal or state transferee liability or property laws (other than community property laws). For the rules regarding the liability of transferees, see sections 6901 through 6904 and the regulations thereunder.
[T.D. 9074, 68 FR 41070, July 10, 2003]
§ 1.66-2
Treatment of community income where spouses live apart.
(a) Community income of spouses domiciled in a community property state will be treated in accordance with the rules provided by section 879(a) if all of the following requirements are satisfied—
(1) The spouses are married to each other at any time during the calendar year;
(2) The spouses live apart at all times during the calendar year;
(3) The spouses do not file a joint return with each other for a taxable year beginning or ending in the calendar year;
(4) One or both spouses have earned income that is community income for the calendar year; and
(5) No portion of such earned income is transferred (directly or indirectly) between such spouses before the close of the calendar year.
(b)
Living apart.
For purposes of this section, living apart requires that spouses maintain separate residences. Spouses who maintain separate residences due to temporary absences are not considered to be living apart. Spouses who are not members of the same household under § 1.6015-3(b) are considered to be living apart for purposes of this section.
(c)
Transferred income.
For purposes of this section, transferred income does not include a
de minimis
amount of earned income that is transferred between the spouses. In addition, any amount of earned income transferred for the benefit of the spouses' child will not be treated as an indirect transfer to one spouse. Additionally, income transferred between spouses is presumed to be a transfer of earned income. This presumption is rebuttable.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1 Living apart.
H and W are married, domiciled in State A, a community property state, and have lived apart the entire year of 2002. W, who is in the Army, was stationed in Korea for the entire calendar year. During their separation, W intended to return home to H, and H intended to live with W upon W's return. H and W do not file a joint return for taxable year 2002. H and W may not report their income under this section because a temporary absence due to
military service is not living apart as contemplated under this section.

# Example 2 Transfer of earned income—de minimis exception.
H and W are married, domiciled in State B, a community property state, and have lived apart the entire year of 2002. H and W are estranged and intend to live apart indefinitely. H and W do not file a joint return for taxable year 2002. H occasionally visits W and their two children, who live with W. When H visits, he often buys gifts for the children, takes the children out to dinner, and occasionally buys groceries or gives W money to buy the children new clothes for school. Both W and H have earned income in the year 2002 that is community income under the laws of State B. H and W may report their income on separate returns under this section.

# Example 3 Transfer of earned income—source of transfer.
H and W are married, domiciled in State C, a community property state, and have lived apart the entire year of 2002. H and W are estranged and intend to live apart indefinitely. H and W do not file a joint return for taxable year 2002. W provides H $1,000 a month from March 2002 through August 2002 while H is working part-time and seeking full-time employment. W is not legally obligated to make the $1,000 payments. W earns $75,000 in 2002 in wage income. W also receives $10,000 in capital gains income in December 2002. H wants to report his income in accordance with this section, alleging that the $6,000 that he received from W was not from W's earned income, but from the capital gains income W received in 2002. The facts and circumstances surrounding the periodic payments to H from W do not indicate that W made the payments out of her capital gains. H and W may not report their income in accordance with this section, as the $6,000 W transferred to H is presumed to be from W's earned income, and H has not presented any facts to rebut the presumption.

§ 1.66-3
Denial of the Federal income tax benefits resulting from the operation of community property law where spouse not notified.
(a)
In general.
The Secretary may deny the Federal income tax benefits of community property law to any spouse with respect to any item of community income if that spouse acted as if solely entitled to the income and failed to notify his or her spouse of the nature and amount of the income before the due date (including extensions) for the filing of the return of his or her spouse for the taxable year in which the item of income was derived. Whether a spouse has acted as if solely entitled to the item of income is a facts and circumstances determination. This determination focuses on whether the spouse used, or made available, the item of income for the benefit of the marital community.
(b)
Effect.
The item of community income will be included, in its entirety, in the gross income of the spouse to whom the Secretary denied the Federal income tax benefits resulting from community property law. The tax liability arising from the inclusion of the item of community income must be assessed in accordance with section 6212 against this spouse.
(c)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1 Acting as if solely entitled to income.
(i) H and W are married and are domiciled in State A, a community property state. W's Form W-2 for taxable year 2000 showed wage income of $35,000. W also received a Form 1099-INT, “Interest Income,” showing $1,000 W received in taxable year 2000. W's wage income was directly deposited into H and W's joint account, from which H and W paid bills and household expenses. W did not inform H of her interest income or the Form 1099-INT, but W gave H a copy of the W-2 when she received it in January 2001. W did not use her interest income for bills or household expenses. Instead W gave her interest income to her brother, who was unemployed. Neither the separate return filed by H nor the separate return filed by W included the interest income. In 2002, the IRS audits both H and W. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may raise section 66(b) as to W's interest income, denying W the Federal income tax benefit resulting from community property law as to this item of income.
(ii) H and W are married and are domiciled in State B, a community property state. For taxable year 2000, H receives $45,000 in wage income that H places in a separate account. H and W maintain separate residences. H's wage income is community income under the laws of State B. That same year, W loses her job, and H pays W's mortgage and household expenses for several months while W seeks employment. Neither H nor W files a return for 2000, the taxable year for which the IRS subsequently audits them. The IRS may not raise section 66(b) and deny H the Federal income tax benefits resulting from the operation of community property law as to H's wage income of $45,000, as H has not treated this income as if H were solely entitled to it.

# Example 2 Notification of nature and amount of the income.
H and W are married and domiciled in State C, a community property state. H and W do not file a joint return for
taxable year 2001. H's and W's earned income for 2001 is community income under the laws of State C. H receives $50,000 in wage income in 2001. In January 2002, H receives a Form W-2 that erroneously states that H earned $45,000 in taxable year 2001. H provides W a copy of H's Form W-2 in February 2002. W files for an extension prior to April 15, 2002. H receives a corrected Form W-2 reflecting wages of $50,000 in May 2002. H provides a copy of the corrected Form W-2 to W in May 2002. W files a separate return in June 2002, but reports one half of $45,000 ($22,500) of wage income that H earned. H files a separate return reporting half of $50,000 ($25,000) in wage income. The IRS audits both H and W. Even if H had acted as if solely entitled to the wage income, the IRS may not raise section 66(b) as to this income because H notified W of the nature and amount of the income prior to the due date of W's return (including extensions).

§ 1.66-4
Request for relief from the Federal income tax liability resulting from the operation of community property law.
(a)
Traditional relief
—(1)
In general.
A requesting spouse will receive relief from the Federal income tax liability resulting from the operation of community property law for an item of community income if—
(i) The requesting spouse did not file a joint Federal income tax return for the taxable year for which he or she seeks relief;
(ii) The requesting spouse did not include in gross income for the taxable year an item of community income properly includible therein, which, under the rules contained in section 879(a), would be treated as the income of the nonrequesting spouse;
(iii) The requesting spouse establishes that he or she did not know of, and had no reason to know of, the item of community income; and
(iv) Taking into account all of the facts and circumstances, it is inequitable to include the item of community income in the requesting spouse's individual gross income.
(2)
Knowledge or reason to know.
(i) A requesting spouse had knowledge or reason to know of an item of community income if he or she either actually knew of the item of community income, or if a reasonable person in similar circumstances would have known of the item of community income. All of the facts and circumstances are considered in determining whether a requesting spouse had reason to know of an item of community income. The relevant facts and circumstances include, but are not limited to, the nature of the item of community income, the amount of the item of community income relative to other income items, the couple's financial situation, the requesting spouse's educational background and business experience, and whether the item of community income was reflected on prior years' returns (e.g., investment income omitted that was regularly reported on prior years' returns).
(ii) If the requesting spouse is aware of the source of community income or the income-producing activity, but is unaware of the specific amount of the nonrequesting spouse's community income, the requesting spouse is considered to have knowledge or reason to know of the item of community income. The requesting spouse's lack of knowledge of the specific amount of community income does not provide a basis for relief under this section.
(3)
Inequitable.
All of the facts and circumstances are considered in determining whether it is inequitable to hold a requesting spouse liable for a deficiency attributable to an item of community income. One relevant factor for this purpose is whether the requesting spouse benefitted, directly or indirectly, from the omitted item of community income. A benefit includes normal support, but does not include
de minimis
amounts. Evidence of direct or indirect benefit may consist of transfers of property or rights to property, including transfers received several years after the filing of the return. Thus, for example, if a requesting spouse receives from the nonrequesting spouse property (including life insurance proceeds) that is traceable to items of community income attributable to the nonrequesting spouse, the requesting spouse will have benefitted from those items of community income. Other factors may include, if the situation warrants, desertion, divorce or separation. Factors relevant to whether it would be inequitable to hold a requesting spouse liable, more specifically described under the applicable
administrative procedure issued under section 66(c) (Revenue Procedure 2000-15 (2000-1 C.B. 447) (See § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter), or other applicable guidance published by the Secretary), are to be considered in making a determination under this paragraph.
(b)
Equitable relief.
Equitable relief may be available when the four requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section are not satisfied, but it would be inequitable to hold the requesting spouse liable for the unpaid tax or deficiency. Factors relevant to whether it would be inequitable to hold a requesting spouse liable, more specifically described under the applicable administrative procedure issued under section 66(c) (Revenue Procedure 2000-15 (2000-1 C.B. 447), or other applicable guidance published by the Secretary), are to be considered in making a determination under this paragraph.
(c)
Applicability.
Traditional relief under paragraph (a) of this section applies only to deficiencies arising out of items of omitted income. Equitable relief under paragraph (b) of this section applies to any deficiency or any unpaid tax (or any portion of either). Equitable relief is available only for the portion of liabilities that were unpaid as of July 22, 1998, and for liabilities that arise after July 22, 1998.
(d)
Effect of relief.
When the requesting spouse qualifies for relief under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the IRS must assess any deficiency of the nonrequesting spouse arising from the granting of relief to the requesting spouse in accordance with section 6212.
(e)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this section:

# Example 1 Item-by-item approach.
H and W are married, living together, and domiciled in State A (a community property state). H and W file separate returns for taxable year 2002 on April 15, 2003. H earns $56,000 in wages, and W earns $46,000 in wages, in 2002. H reports half of his wage income as shown on his Form W-2, in the amount of $28,000, and half of W's wage income as shown on her Form W-2, in the amount of $23,000. W reports half of her wage income as shown on her W-2, in the amount of $23,000, and half of H's wage income as shown on his Form W-2, in the amount of $28,000. Neither H nor W reports W's income from her sole proprietorship of $34,000 or W's investment income of $5,000 for taxable year 2002. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) proposes deficiencies with respect to H's and W's taxable year 2002 returns due to the omission of W's income from her sole proprietorship and investments. H timely requests relief under section 66(c). Because the IRS determines that H satisfies the four requirements of the traditional relief provision of section 66(c) with respect to W's omitted investment income, the IRS grants H's request for relief as to the omitted investment income. The IRS determines that H does not satisfy the four requirements of the traditional relief provision of section 66(c) as to W's sole proprietorship income. The IRS further determines that, under the equitable relief provision of section 66(c), it is not inequitable to hold H liable for the sole proprietorship income. Relief is applicable on an item-by-item basis. Thus, H is liable for the tax on half of his wage income in the amount of $28,000, half of W's wage income in the amount of $23,000, half of W's sole proprietorship income in the amount of $17,000, but none of W's investment income, for which H obtained relief under section 66(c). W is liable for the tax on half of H's wage income in the amount of $28,000, half of W's wage income in the amount of $23,000, half of W's sole proprietorship income in the amount of $17,000, and all of W's investment income in the amount of $5,000, because H obtained relief under section 66(c).

# Example 2 Benefit.
H and W are married, living together, and domiciled in State B (a community property state). Neither H nor W files a return for taxable year 2000. H earns $60,000 in 2000, which he deposits in a joint account. H and W pay the mortgage payment, household bills, and other family expenses out of the joint account. W earns $20,000 in 2000. W uses a portion of the $20,000 to make monthly loan payments on the family cars, but loses the remainder at the local racetrack. In 2002, the IRS audits H and W. H requests relief under section 66(c), stating that he did not know or have reason to know of W's additional income, as H travels extensively while W handles the family finances. Regardless of whether H had knowledge or reason to know of the source of W's income, H is not eligible for traditional relief under section 66(c) because H benefitted from W's income. H's benefit, the portion of W's income used to make monthly payments on the car loans, was more than a de minimis amount. While this benefit was not in excess of normal support, it is enough to preclude relief under the traditional relief provision of section 66(c). H may still qualify for equitable relief under section 66(c), depending on all of the facts and circumstances.
(f)
Fraudulent scheme.
If the Secretary establishes that a spouse transferred assets to his or her spouse as part of a fraudulent scheme, relief is not available under this section. For
purposes of this section, a fraudulent scheme includes a scheme to defraud the Secretary or another third party, such as a creditor, ex-spouse, or business partner.
(g)
Definitions
—(1)
Requesting spouse.
A requesting spouse is an individual who does not file a joint Federal income tax return with the nonrequesting spouse for the taxable year in question, and who requests relief from the Federal income tax liability resulting from the operation of community property law under this section for the portion of the liability arising from his or her share of community income for such taxable year.
(2)
Nonrequesting spouse.
A nonrequesting spouse is the individual to whom the requesting spouse was married and whose income or deduction gave rise to the tax liability from which the requesting spouse seeks relief in whole or in part.
(h)
Effect of prior closing agreement or offer in compromise.
A requesting spouse is not entitled to relief from the Federal income tax liability resulting from the operation of community property law under section 66 for any taxable year for which the requesting spouse has entered into a closing agreement (other than an agreement pursuant to section 6224(c) relating to partnership items) with the Secretary that disposes of the same liability that is the subject of the request for relief. In addition, a requesting spouse is not entitled to relief from the Federal income tax liability resulting from the operation of community property law under section 66 for any taxable year for which the requesting spouse has entered into an offer in compromise with the Secretary. For rules relating to the effect of closing agreements and offers in compromise, see sections 7121 and 7122, and the regulations thereunder.
(i) [Reserved]
(j)
Time and manner for requesting relief
—(1)
Requesting relief.
To request relief from the Federal income tax liability resulting from the operation of community property law under this section, a requesting spouse must file, within the time period prescribed in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, Form 8857, “Request for Innocent Spouse Relief” (or other specified form), or other written request, signed under penalties of perjury, stating why relief is appropriate. The requesting spouse must include the nonrequesting spouse's name and taxpayer identification number in the written request. The requesting spouse must also comply with the Secretary's reasonable requests for information that will assist the Secretary in identifying and locating the nonrequesting spouse.
(2)
Time period for filing a request for relief
—(i)
Traditional relief.
The earliest time for submitting a request for relief from the Federal income tax liability resulting from the operation of community property law under paragraph (a) of this section, for an amount underreported on, or omitted from, the requesting spouse's separate return, is the date the requesting spouse receives notification of an audit or a letter or notice from the IRS stating that there may be an outstanding liability with regard to that year (as described in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section). The latest time for requesting relief under paragraph (a) of this section is 6 months before the expiration of the period of limitations on assessment, including extensions, against the nonrequesting spouse for the taxable year that is the subject of the request for relief, unless the examination of the requesting spouse's return commences during that 6-month period. If the examination of the requesting spouse's return commences during that 6-month period, the latest time for requesting relief under paragraph (a) of this section is 30 days after the commencement of the examination.
(ii)
Equitable relief.
The earliest time for submitting a request for relief from the Federal income tax liability resulting from the operation of community property law under paragraph (b) of this section is the date the requesting spouse receives notification of an audit or a letter or notice from the IRS stating that there may be an outstanding liability with regard to that year (as described in paragraph (j)(2)(iii) of this section). A request for equitable relief from the Federal income tax liability resulting from the operation of community property law under paragraph (b) of this section for a liability that is
properly reported but unpaid is properly submitted with the requesting spouse's individual Federal income tax return, or after the requesting spouse's individual Federal income tax return is filed.
(iii)
Premature requests for relief.
The Secretary will not consider a premature request for relief under this section. The notices or letters referenced in this paragraph (j)(2) do not include notices issued pursuant to section 6223 relating to TEFRA partnership proceedings. These notices or letters include notices of computational adjustment to a partner or partner's spouse (Notice of Income Tax Examination Changes) that reflect a computation of the liability attributable to partnership items of the partner or the partner's spouse.
(k)
Nonrequesting spouse's notice and opportunity to participate in administrative proceedings
—(1)
In general.
When the Secretary receives a request for relief from the Federal income tax liability resulting from the operation of community property law under this section, the Secretary must send a notice to the nonrequesting spouse's last known address that informs the nonrequesting spouse of the requesting spouse's request for relief. The notice must provide the nonrequesting spouse with an opportunity to submit any information for consideration in determining whether to grant the requesting spouse relief from the Federal income tax liability resulting from the operation of community property law. The Secretary will share with each spouse the information submitted by the other spouse, unless the Secretary determines that the sharing of this information will impair tax administration.
(2)
Information submitted.
The Secretary will consider all of the information (as relevant to the particular relief provision) that the nonrequesting spouse submits in determining whether to grant relief from the Federal income tax liability resulting from the operation of community property law under this section.
[T.D. 9074, 68 FR 41070, July 10, 2003]
§ 1.66-5
Effective date.
Sections 1.66-1 through 1.66-4 are applicable on July 10, 2003. In addition, § 1.66-4 applies to any request for relief filed prior to July 10, 2003, for which the Internal Revenue Service has not issued a preliminary determination as of July 10, 2003.
[T.D. 9074, 68 FR 41070, July 10, 2003]
§ 1.67-1T
2-percent floor on miscellaneous itemized deductions (temporary).
(a)
Type of expenses subject to the floor
—(1)
In general.
With respect to individuals, section 67 disallows deductions for miscellaneous itemized deductions (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) in computing taxable income (
i.e.,
so-called “below-the-line” deductions) to the extent that such otherwise allowable deductions do not exceed 2 percent of the individual's adjusted gross income (as defined in section 62 and the regulations thereunder). Examples of expenses that, if otherwise deductible, are subject to the 2-percent floor include but are not limited to—
(i) Unreimbursed employee expenses, such as expenses for transportation, travel fares and lodging while away from home, business meals and entertainment, continuing education courses, subscriptions to professional journals, union or professional dues, professional uniforms, job hunting, and the business use of the employee's home.
(ii) Expenses for the production or collection of income for which a deduction is otherwise allowable under section 212 (1) and (2), such as investment advisory fees, subscriptions to investment advisory publications, certain attorneys' fees, and the cost of safe deposit boxes,
(iii) Expenses for the determination of any tax for which a deduction is otherwise allowable under section 212(3), such as tax counsel fees and appraisal fees, and
(iv) Expenses for an activity for which a deduction is otherwise allowable under section 183.
See section 62 with respect to deductions that are allowable in computing
adjusted gross income (
i.e.,
so-called “above-the-line” deductions).
(2)
Other limitations.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, to the extent that any limitation or restriction is placed on the amount of a miscellaneous itemized deduction, that limitation shall apply prior to the application of the 2-percent floor. For example, in the case of an expense for food or beverages, only 80 percent of which is allowable as a deduction because of the limitations provided in section 274(n), the otherwise deductible 80 percent of the expense is treated as a miscellaneous itemized deduction and is subject to the 2-percent limitation of section 67.
(b)
Definition of miscellaneous itemized deductions.
For purposes of this section, the term “miscellaneous itemized deductions” means the deductions allowable from adjusted gross income in determining taxable income, as defined in section 63, other than—
(1) The standard deduction as defined in section 63(c),
(2) Any deduction allowable for impairment-related work expenses as defined in section 67(d),
(3) The deduction under section 72(b)(3) (relating to deductions if annuity payments cease before the investment is recovered),
(4) The deductions allowable under section 151 for personal exemptions,
(5) The deduction under section 163 (relating to interest),
(6) The deduction under section 164 (relating to taxes),
(7) The deduction under section 165(a) for losses described in subsection (c)(3) or (d) of section 165,
(8) The deduction under section 170 (relating to charitable contributions and gifts),
(9) The deduction under section 171 (relating to deductions for amortizable bond premiums),
(10) The deduction under section 213 (relating to medical and dental expenses),
(11) The deduction under section 216 (relating to deductions in connection with cooperative housing corporations),
(12) The deduction under section 217 (relating to moving expenses),
(13) The deduction under section 691(c) (relating to the deduction for estate taxes in the case of income in respect of the decedent),
(14) The deduction under 1341 (relating to the computation of tax if a taxpayer restores a substantial amount held under claim of right), and
(15) Any deduction allowable in connection with personal property used in a short sale.
(c)
Allocation of expenses.
If a taxpayer incurs expenses that relate to both a trade or business activity (within the meaning of section 162) and a production of income or tax preparation activity (within the meaning of section 212), the taxpayer shall allocate such expenses between the activities on a reasonable basis.
(d)
Members of Congress
—(1)
In general.
With respect to the deduction for living expenses of Members of Congress referred to in section 162(a), the 2-percent floor described in section 67 and paragraph (a) of this section shall be applied to the deduction before the application of the $3,000 limitation on deductions for living expenses referred to in section 162(a). (For purposes of this paragraph (d), the term “Member(s) of Congress” includes any Delegate or Resident Commissioner.) The amount of miscellaneous itemized deductions of a Member of Congress that is disallowed pursuant to section 67 and paragraph (a) of this section shall be allocated between deductions for living expenses (within the meaning of section 162(a)) and other miscellaneous itemized deductions. The amount of deductions for living expenses of a Member of Congress that is disallowed pursuant to section 67 and paragraph (a) of this section is determined by multiplying the aggregate amount of such living expenses (determined without regard to the $3,000 limitation of section 162(a) but with regard to any other limitations) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate amount disallowed pursuant to section 67 and paragraph (a) of this section with respect to miscellaneous itemized deductions of the Member of Congress and the denominator of which is the
amount of miscellaneous itemized deductions (including deductions for living expenses) of the Member of Congress (determined without regard to the $3,000 limitation of section 162(a) but without regard to any other limitations). The amount of deductions for miscellaneous itemized deductions (other than deductions for living expenses) of a Member of Congress that are disallowed pursuant to section 67 and paragraph (a) of this section is determined by multiplying the amount of miscellaneous itemized deductions (other than deductions for living expenses) of the Member of Congress (determined with regard to any limitations) by the fraction described in the preceding sentence.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph (d) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
For 1987 A, a Member of Congress, has adjusted gross income of $100,000, and miscellaneous itemized deductions of $10,750 of which $3,750 is for meals, $3,000 is for other living expenses, and $4,000 is for other miscellaneous itemized deductions (none of which is subject to any percentage limitations other than the 2-percent floor of section 67). The amount of A's business meal expenses that are disallowed under section 274(n) is $750 ($3,750 × 20%). The amount of A's miscellaneous itemized deductions that are disallowed under section 67 is $2,000 ($100,000 × 2%). The portion of the amount disallowed under section 67 that is allocated to A's living expenses is $1,200. This portion is equal to the amount of A's deductions for living expenses allowable after the application of section 274(n) and before the application of section 67 ($6,000) multiplied by the ratio of A's total miscellaneous itemized deductions disallowed under section 67 to A's total miscellaneous itemized deductions, determined without regard to the $3,000 limitation of section 162(a) ($2,000/$10,000). Thus, after application of section 274(n) and section 67, A's deduction for living expenses is $4,800 ($6,750−$750−$1,200). However, pursuant to section 162(a), A may deduct only $3,000 of such expenses. The amount of A's other miscellaneous itemized deductions that are disallowed under section 67 is $800 ($4,000 × $2,000/$10,000). Thus, $3,200 ($4,000−$800) of A's miscellaneous itemized deductions (other than deductions for living expenses) are allowable after application of section 67. A's total allowable miscellaneous itemized deductions are $6,200 ($3,000 + $3,200).

See § 1.62-1T(e)(4) with respect to rules regarding state legislator's expenses.
[T.D. 8189, 53 FR 9875, Mar. 28, 1988]
§ 1.67-2T
Treatment of pass-through entities (temporary).
(a)
Application of section 67.
This section provides rules for the application of section 67 to partners, shareholders, beneficiaries, participants, and others with respect to their interests in pass-through entities (as defined in paragraph (g) of this section). In general, an affected investor (as defined in paragraph (h) of this section) in a pass-through entity shall separately take into account as an item of income and as an item of expense an amount equal to his or her allocable share of the affected expenses (as defined in paragraph (i) of this section) of the pass-through entity for purposes of determining his or her taxable income. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the expenses so taken into account shall be treated as paid or incurred by the affected investor in the same manner as paid or incurred by the pass-through entity. For rules regarding the application of section 67 to affected investors in—
(1) Partnerships, S corporations, and grantor trusts, see paragraph (b) of this section,
(2) Real estate mortgage investment conduits, see paragraph (c) of this section,
(3) Common trust funds, see paragraph (d) of this section,
(4) Nonpublicly offered regulated investment companies, see paragraph (e) of this section, and
(5) Publicly offered regulated investment companies, see paragraph (p) of this section.
(b)
Partnerships, S corporations, and grantor trusts
—(1)
In general.
Pursuant to section 702(a) and 1366(a) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, each partner of a partnership or shareholder of an S corporation shall take into account separately his or her distributive or pro rata share of any items of deduction of such partnership or corporation that are defined as miscellaneous itemized deductions pursuant to section 67(b). The 2-percent limitation described in section 67 does not apply to
the partnership or corporation with respect to such deductions, but such deductions shall be included in the deductions of the partner or shareholder to which that limitation applies. Similarly, the limitation applies to the grantor or other person treated as the owner of a grantor trust with respect to items that are paid or incurred by a grantor trust and are treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions of the grantor or other person pursuant to Subpart E, Part 1, Subchapter J, Chapter 1 of the Code, but not to the trust itself. The 2-percent limitation applies to amounts otherwise deductible in taxable years of partners, shareholders, or grantors beginning after December 31, 1986, regardless of the taxable year of the partnership, corporation, or trust.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph (b) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
P, a partnership, incurs $1,000 in expenses to which section 212 applies during its taxable year. A, an individual, is a partner in P. A's distributive share of the expenses to which section 212 applies is $20, determined without regard to the 2-percent limitation of section 67. Pursuant to section 702(a), A must take $20 of expenses to which section 212 applies into account in determining his income tax. Pursuant to section 67, in determining his taxable income A may deduct his miscellaneous itemized deductions (including his $20 distributive share of deductions from P) to the extent the total amount exceeds 2 percent of his adjusted gross income.

(d)
Common trust funds
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of determining the taxable income of an affected investor that is a participant in a common trust fund—
(i) The ordinary taxable income and ordinary net loss of the common trust fund shall be computed under section 584(d)(2) without taking into account any affected expenses, and
(ii) Each affected investor shall be treated as having paid or incurred an expense described in section 212 in an amount equal to the affected investor's proportionate share of the affected expenses.
The 2-percent limitation described in section 67 applies to amounts otherwise deductible in taxable years of participants beginning after December 31, 1986, regardless of the taxable year of the common trust fund.
(2)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph (d) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
During 1987, the gross income and deductions of common trust fund C, a calendar year taxpayer, consist of the following items: (i) $50,000 of short-term capital gains; (ii) $150,000 of long-term capital gains; (iii) $1,000,000 of dividend income; (iv) $10,000 of deductions that are not affected expenses; and (v) $60,000 of deductions that are affected expenses. The proportionate share of Trust T in the income and losses of C is one percent. In computing its taxable income for 1987, T, a calendar year taxpayer, shall take into account the following items: (A) $500 of short-term capital gains (one percent of $50,000, C's short-term capital gains); (B) $1,500 of long-term capital gains (one percent of $150,000, C's long-term capital gains); (C) $9,900 of ordinary taxable income (one percent of $990,000, the excess of $100,000, C's gross income after excluding capital gains and losses, over $10,000, C's deductions that are not affected expenses); (D) $600 of expenses described in section 212 (one percent of $60,000, C's affected expenses).
(e)
Nonpublicly offered regulated investment companies
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of determining the taxable income of an affected investor that is a shareholder of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section) during a calendar year—
(i) The current earnings and profits of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company shall be computed without taking into account any affected RIC expenses that are allocated among affected investors, and
(ii) The affected investor shall be treated—
(A) As having received or accrued a dividend in an amount equal to the affected investor's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company for the calendar year, and
(B) As having paid or incurred an expense described in section 212 (or section 162 in the case of an affected investor that is a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company) in an amount equal to the affected investor's
allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company for the calendar year
in the affected investor's taxable year with which (or within which) the calendar year with respect to which the expenses are allocated ends. An affected investor's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses is the amount allocated to that affected investor pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section.
(2)
Shareholders that are not affected investors.
A shareholder of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company that is not an affected investor shall not take into account in computing its taxable income any amount of income or expense with respect to its allocable share of affected RIC expenses.
(3)
Example.
The provisions of this paragraph (e) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
During calendar year 1987, nonpublicly offered regulated investment company M distributes to individual shareholder A, a calendar year taxpayer, capital gain dividends of $1,000 and other dividends of $5,000. A's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of M is $200. In computing A's taxable income for 1987, A shall take into account the following items: (i) $1,000 of long-term capital gains (the capital gain dividends received by A); (ii) $5,200 of dividend income (the sum of the other dividends received by A and A's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of M); and (iii) $200 of expenses described in section 212 (A's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of M). A is allowed a deduction for miscellaneous itemized deductions (including A's $200 allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of M, which is treated as an expense described in section 212) for 1987 only to the extent the aggregate of such deductions exceeds 2 percent of A's adjusted gross income for 1987.
(f)

Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (h) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X holds shares of nonpublicly offered regulated investment company R in its capacity as a nominee or custodian for individual A, the beneficial owner of the shares. Because the owner of the shares for Federal income tax purposes is an individual, the shares are owned by an affected investor.

# Example 2.
Individual retirement account I owns shares of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company. Because an individual retirement account is not a person described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the shares are not owned by an affected investor.

(2)
Safe harbor.
If a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company makes an election under this paragraph (j)(2), the affected RIC expenses for a calendar year shall be treated as equal to 40 percent of the amount determined under paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section for that calendar year. The nonpublicly offered regulated investment company shall make the election by attaching to its income tax return for the taxable year that includes the last day of the first calendar year for which the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company makes the
election a statement that it is making an election under paragraph (j)(2) of this section. An election made pursuant to this paragraph (j)(2) shall remain in effect for all subsequent calendar years unless revoked with the consent of the Commissioner.

(4)
Exception.
The affected RIC expenses of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company will be treated as zero if the amount of its gross income for the calendar year (determined without regard to capital gain net income) is not greater than 1 percent of the sum of (i) such gross income and (ii) the amount of its interest income for the calendar year that is not includible in gross income pursuant to section 103.
(k)
Allocation of expenses among nonpublicly offered regulated investment company shareholders
—(1)
General rule.
A nonpublicly offered regulated investment company shall allocate to each of its affected investors that is a shareholder at any time during the calendar year, the affected investor's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company for that calendar year. (See paragraph (m) of this section for rules regarding estimates with respect to the amount of an affected investor's share of affected RIC expenses upon which certain persons can rely for certain purposes.) A nonpublicly offered regulated investment company may use any reasonable method to make the allocation. A method of allocation shall not be reasonable if—
(i) The method can be expected to have the effect, if applied to all affected RIC expenses and all shareholders (whether or not affected investors), of allocating to the shareholders an amount of affected RIC expenses that is less than the affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company for the calendar year,
(ii) The method can be expected to have the effect of allocating a disproportionately high share of the affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company to shareholders that are not affected investors or affected investors, the amount of whose miscellaneous itemized deductions (including their allocable share of affected RIC expenses) exceeds the 2-percent floor described in section 67, or
(iii) A principal purpose of the method of allocation is to avoid allocating affected RIC expenses to persons described in paragraph (h)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section whose miscellaneous itemized deductions (inclusive of their allocable share of affected RIC expenses) may not exceed the 2-percent floor described in section 67.
(2)
Reasonable allocation method described
—(i)
In general.
The allocation method described in this paragraph (k)(2) shall be treated as a reasonable allocation method. Under the method described in this paragraph, an affected investor's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company is the amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of affected RIC expenses of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company for the calendar year as—
(A) The amount of dividends paid to the affected investor during the calendar year, bears to
(B) The sum of—
(
1
) The aggregate amount of dividends paid by the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company during the calendar year to all shareholders, and
(
2
) Any amount on which tax is imposed under section 852(b)(1) for any taxable year of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company ending within or with the calendar year.
(ii)
Exception.
Paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section does not apply if the amount of the deduction for dividends paid during the calendar year is zero.
(iii)
Dividends paid.
For purposes of this paragraph (k)(2)—
(A) Dividends that are treated as paid during a calendar year pursuant to section 852(b)(7) are treated as paid during that calendar year and not during the succeeding calendar year.
(B) The term “dividends paid” does not include capital gain dividends (as defined in section 852(b)(3)(C)), exempt-interest dividends (as defined in section 852(b)(5)(A)), or any amount to which section 302(a) applies.
(C) The dividends paid during a calendar year is determined without regard to section 855(a).
(3)
Reasonable allocation made by District Director.
If a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company does not make a reasonable allocation of affected RIC expenses to its affected investors as required by paragraph (k)(1) of this section, a reasonable allocation shall be made by the District Director of the internal revenue district in which the principal place of business or principal office or agency of the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company is located.
(4)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (k) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Nonpublicly offered regulated investment company M, in calculating its investment company taxable income, claims a dividends paid deduction for a portion of redemption distributions (to which section 302(a) applies) to shareholders, as well as for nonredemption distributions. M allocates affected expenses among shareholders who have received nonredemption distributions by multiplying the amount of nonredemption distributions distributed to each shareholder by a fraction, the numerator of which is the affected RIC expenses of M and the denominator of which is M's investment company taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis and without regard to deductions described in section 852(b)(2)(D). No affected RIC expenses are allocated with respect to the redemption distributions. This allocation method can be expected to have the effect of allocating among the shareholders an amount of expenses that is less than the total amount of affected RIC expenses of M. Accordingly, the allocation method is not reasonable.

# Example 2.
Nonpublicly offered regulated investment company N has two classes of stock, a “capital” class and an “income” class. Owners of the capital class receive the benefit of all capital appreciation on the stocks owned by N, and bear the burden of certain capital expenditures of N; owners of the income class receive the benefit of all other income of N, and bear the burden of all expenses of N that are deductible under section 162. M allocates all affected RIC expenses among shareholders of the income class shares under a method that would be reasonable if the income class were the only class of N stock. Corporations and other shareholders that are not affected investors own a higher proportion of income class shares than of capital class shares. The affected RIC expenses of N are properly allocated among the shareholders who bear the burden of those expenses. Accordingly, the allocation method does not have the effect of allocating a disproportionately high share of the affected RIC expenses of N to shareholders that are not affected investors merely because a disproportionate share of income class shares are owned by shareholders that are not affected investors. The allocation method is reasonable.

# Example 3.
Nonpublicly offered regulated investment company O has two classes of stock, Class A and Class B. Shares of Class A, which may be purchased without payment of a sales or brokerage commission, are charged with the expenses of a Rule 12b-1 distribution plan of O. Shares of Class B, which may be purchased only upon payment of a sales or brokerage commission, are not charged with the expenses of the Rule 12b-1 distribution plan of O. O allocates all affected RIC expenses among shareholders of Class A and Class B shares under a method that would be reasonable if Class A or Class B shares, respectively, were the only class of O stock. The affected RIC expenses attributable to the Rule 12b-1 plan are allocated to the shareholders of Class A shares. Shareholders that are not affected investors own a higher proportion of Class A shares than of Class B shares. The affected RIC expenses of O are properly allocated among the shareholders who bear the burden of those expenses. Accordingly, the allocation method does not have the effect of allocating a disproportionately high share of the affected RIC expenses of O to shareholders that are not affected investors merely because a disproportionately high share of Class A shares are owned by persons that are not affected investors. The allocation method is reasonable.

# Example 4.
Assume the facts are the same as in example (3) except that a portion of the affected RIC expenses attributable to the Rule 12b-1 plan are allocated to the shareholders of Class B shares, and shareholders that are not affected investors own a higher proportion of Class B shares than of Class A shares. Thus, the affected RIC expenses are not allocated among the class of shareholders that bear the burden of the expenses. Accordingly, the allocation method has the
effect of allocating a disproportionate share of the affected RIC expenses of O to the shareholders of Class B shares. Because shareholders that are not affected investors own a higher proportion of Class B shares than Class A shares, the method can be expected to allocate a disproportionately high share of the affected RIC expenses of O to shareholders that are not affected investors. Accordingly, the allocation method is not reasonable.
(l)
Affected RIC expenses not subject to backup withholding.
The amount of dividend income that an affected investor in a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company is treated as having received or accrued under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section is not subject to backup withholding under section 3406.
(m)
Reliance by nominees and pass-through investors on notices
—(1)
General rule.
Persons described in paragraph (m)(3) of this section may, for the purposes described in that paragraph (m)(3), treat an affected investor's allocable share of the affected RIC expenses of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company as being equal to an amount determined by the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company on the basis of a reasonable estimate (e.g., of allocable expenses as a percentage of dividend distributions or allocable expenses per share) that is (i) reported in writing by the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company to the person or (ii) reported in a newspaper or financial publication having a nationwide circulation (e.g., the
Wall Street Journal
or
Standard and Poor's Weekly Dividend Record
).
(2)
Estimates must be reasonable.
In general, for purposes of paragraph (m)(1) of this section, estimates of affected RIC expenses of a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company will be treated as reasonable only if the nonpublicly offered regulated investment company makes a reasonable effort to offset material understatements (or overstatements) of affected RIC expenses for a period by increasing (or decreasing) estimates of affected RIC expenses for a subsequent period. Understatements or overstatements of affected RIC expenses that are not material may be corrected by making offsetting adjustments in future periods, provided that understatements and overstatements are treated consistently.
(3)
Application.
Paragraph (m)(1) of this section shall apply to the following persons for the following purposes:
(i) A nominee who, pursuant to section 6042(a)(1)(B) and paragraph (n)(2) of this section, is required to report dividends paid by a nonpublicly offered regulated investment company to the Internal Revenue Service and to the person to whom the payment is made, for purposes of reporting to the Internal Revenue Service and the person to whom the payment is made the amount of affected RIC expenses allocated to such person.
(ii) An affected investor to whom a nominee (to which paragraph (m)(3)(i) of this section applies) reports, for purposes of calculating the affected investor's taxable income and the amount of its affected expenses.
(iii) A shareholder that is a pass-through entity, for purposes of calculating its taxable income and the amount of its affected expenses.

§ 1.67-3T
Allocation of expenses by real estate mortgage investment conduits (temporary).
(a)
Allocation of allocable investment expenses
—(1)
In general.
A real estate mortgage investment conduit or REMIC (as defined in section 860D) shall allocate to each of its pass-through interest holders that holds an interest at any time during the calendar quarter the holder's proportionate share (as determined under paragraph (c) of this section) of the aggregate amount of allocable investment expenses of the REMIC for the calendar quarter.
(2)
Pass-through interest holder
—(i)
In general
—(A)
Meaning of term.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the term “pass-through interest holder” means any holder of a REMIC residual interest (as definition in section 860G(a)(2)) that is—
(
1
) An individual (other than a nonresident alien whose income with respect to his or her interest in the REMIC is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States),
(
2
) A person, including a trust or estate, that computes its taxable income in the same manner as in the case of an individual, or
(
3
) A pass-through entity (as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section) if one or more of its partners, shareholders, beneficiaries, participants, or other interest holders is (
i
) a pass-through entity or (
ii
) a person described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) (
1
) or (
2
) of this section.
(B)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph (a)(2)(i) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation X holds a residual interest in REMIC R in its capacity as a nominee or custodian for individual A, the beneficial owner of the interest. Because the owner of the interest for Federal income tax purposes is an individual, the interest is owned by a pass-through interest holder.

# Example 2.
Individual retirement account I holds a residual interest in a REMIC. Because an individual retirement account is not a person described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the interest is not held by a pass-through interest holder.
(ii)
Single-class REMIC
—(A)
In general.
In the case of a single-class REMIC, the term “pass-through interest holder” means any holder of either—
(
1
) A REMIC regular interest (as defined in section 860G(a)(1)), or
(
2
) A REMIC residual interest, that is described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) (
1
), (
2
), or (
3
) of this section.
(B)
Single-class REMIC.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, a single-class REMIC IS either—
(
1
) A REMIC that would be classified as an investment trust under § 301.7701-4(c)(1) but for its qualification as a REMIC under section 860D and § 1.860D-1T, or
(
2
) A REMIC that—
(
i
) Is substantially similar to an investment trust under § 301.7701-4(c)(1), and
(
ii
) Is structured with the principal purpose of avoiding the requirement of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2)(ii)(A) of this section to allocate allocable investment expenses to pass-through interest holders that hold regular interests in the REMIC.
For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B), in determining whether a REMIC would be classified as an investment trust or is substantially similar to an investment trust, all interests in the REMIC shall be treated as ownership interests in the REMIC, without regard to whether or not they would be classified as debt for Federal income tax purposes in the absence of a REMIC election.
(C)
Examples.
The provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section must be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation M transfers mortgages to a bank under a trust agreement as described in Example (2) of § 301.7701-4(c)(2). There are two classes of certificates. Holders of class C certificates are entitled to receive 90 percent of the payment of principal and interest on the mortgages; holders of class D certificates are entitled to receive the remaining 10 percent. The two classes of certificates are identical except that, in the event of a default on the underlying mortgages, the payment rights of class D certificates holders are subordinated to the rights of class C certificate holders. M sells the class C certificates to investors and retains the class D certificates. The trust would be classified as an investment trust under § 301.7701-4(c)(1) but for its qualification a REMIC under section 860D the class C certificates represent regular interests in the REMIC and the class D certificates represent residual interest in the REMIC. The REMIC is a single-class REMIC within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section and, accordingly, holders of both the class C and class D certificates who are described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) (
1
), (
2
), or (
3
) of this section are treated as pass-through interest holders.

# Example 2.
Assume that the facts are the same as in Example (1) except that M structures the REMIC to include a second regular interest represented by class E certificates. The principal purpose of M in structuring the REMIC to include class E certificates is to avoid allocating allocable investment expenses to class C certificate holders. The class E certificate holders are entitled to receive the payments otherwise due the class D certificate holders until they have been paid a stated amount of principal plus interest. The fair market value of the class E certificate is ten percent of the fair market value of the class D certificate and, therefore, less than one percent of the fair market value of the REMIC. The REMIC would not be classified as an investment trust under § 301.7701-4(c)(1) because the existence of the class E certificates is not incidental to the trust's purpose of facilitating direct investment in the assets of the trust. Nevertheless, because the fair market value of the class E certificates is de minimis, the REMIC is substantially similar to an investment trust under § 301.7701-4(c)(1). In addition, avoidance of the requirement to allocate allocable investment expenses to regular interest holders is the principal purpose of M in structuring the REMIC to include class E certificates. Therefore, the REMIC is a single-class REMIC within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section, and, accordingly, holders of both residual and regular interests who are described in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) (
1
), (
2
), or (
3
) of this section are treated as pass-through interest holders.
(3)
Pass-through entity
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, for purposes of this section, a pass-through entity is—
(A) A trust (or any portion thereof) to which Subpart E, Part 1, Subchapter J, Chapter 1 of the Code applies,
(B) A partnership,
(C) An S corporation,
(D) A common trust fund described in section 584,
(E) A nonpublicly offered regulated investment company (as defined in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section),
(F) A REMIC, and
(G) Any other person—
(
1
) Which is not subject to income tax imposed by Subtitle A, Chapter 1, or which is allowed a deduction in computing such tax for distributions to owners or beneficiaries, and
(
2
) The character of the income of which may affect the character of the income recognized with respect to that person by its owners or beneficiaries.
Entities that do not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(G) (
1
) and (
2
), such as qualified pension plans, individual retirement accounts, and insurance companies holding assets in separate asset accounts to fund variable contracts defined in section 817(d), are not described in this paragraph (a)(3)(i).
(ii)
Exception.
For purposes of this section, a pass-through entity does not include—
(A) An estate,
(B) A trust (or any portion thereof) not described in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section,
(C) A cooperative described without regard to subparagraphs (A) and (C) thereof, or
(D) A real estate investment trust.
(4)
Allocable investment expenses.
The term “allocable investment expenses” means the aggregate amount of the expenses paid or accrued in the calendar quarter for which a deduction is allowable under section 212 in determining the taxable income of the REMIC for the calendar quarter.
(5)
Nonpublicly offered regulated investment company
—(i)
In general.
For purposes of this section, the term “nonpublicly offered regulated investment company” means a regulated investment company to which Part I of Subchapter M of the Code applies that is not a publicly offered regulated investment company.
(ii)
Publicly offered regulated investment company.
For purposes of this section, the term “publicly offered regulated investment company” means a regulated investment company to which Part I of subchapter M of the Code applies, the shares of which are—
(A) Continuously offered pursuant to a public offering (within the meaning of section 4 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (15 U.S.C. 77a to 77aa)),
(B) Regularly traded on an established securities market, or
(C) Held by or for no fewer than 500 persons at all times during the taxable year.
(b)
Treatment of allocable investment expenses
—(1)
By pass-through interest holders
—(i)
Taxable year ending with calendar quarter.
A pass-through interest holder whose taxable year is the calendar year or ends with a calendar quarter shall be treated as having—
(A) Received or accrued income, and
(B) Paid or incurred an expense described in section 212 (or section 162 in the case of a pass-through interest holder that is a regulated investment company), in an amount equal to the pass-through interest holder's proportionate share of the allocable investment expenses of the REMIC for those calendar quarters that fall within the holder's taxable year.
(ii)
Taxable year not ending with calendar quarter.
A pass-through interest holder whose taxable year does not end with a calendar quarter shall be treated as having—
(A) Received or accrued income, and
(B) Paid or incurred an expense described in section 212 (or section 162 in the case of a pass-through interest holder that is a regulated investment company), in an amount equal to the sum of—
(C) The pass-through interest holder's proportionate share of the allocable investment expenses of the REMIC for those calendar quarters that fall within the holder's taxable year, and
(D) For each calendar quarter that overlaps the beginning or end of the taxable year, the sum of the daily
amounts of the allocable investment expenses allocated to the holder pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section for the days in the quarter that fall within the holder's taxable year.
(2)
Proportionate share of allocable investment expenses.
For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a pass-through interest holder's proportionate share of the allocable investment expenses is the amount allocated to the pass-through interest holder pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(3)
Cross-reference.
See § 1.67-1T with respect to limitations on deductions for expenses described in section 212 (including amounts treated as such expenses under this section).
(4)
Interest income to holders of regular interests in certain REMICs.
Any amount allocated under this section to the holder of a regular interest in a single-class REMIC (as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) shall be treated as interest income.
(5)
No adjustment to basis.
The basis of any holder's interest in a REMIC shall not be increased or decreased by the amount of the holder's proportionate share of allocable investment expenses.
(6)
Interest holders other than pass-through interest holders.
An interest holder of a REMIC that is not a pass-through interest holder shall not take into account in computing its taxable income any amount of income or expense with respect to its proportionate share of allocable investment expenses.
(c)
Computation of proportionate share
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a REMIC shall compute a pass-through interest holder's proportionate share of the REMIC's allocable investment expenses by—
(i) Determining the daily amount of the allocable investment expenses for the calendar quarter by dividing the total amount of such expenses by the number of days in that calendar quarter.
(ii) Allocating the daily amount of the allocable investment expenses to the pass-through interest holder in proportion to its respective holdings on that day, and
(iii) Totaling the interest holder's daily amounts of allocable investment expenses for the calendar quarter.
(2)
Other holders taken into account.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, a pass-through interest holder's proportionate share of the daily amount of the allocable investment expenses is determined by taking into account all holders of residual interests in the REMIC, whether or not pass-through interest holders.
(3)
Single-class REMIC
—(i)
Daily allocation.
In lieu of the allocation specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, a single-class REMIC (as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) shall allocate the daily amount of the allocable investment expenses to each pass-through interest holder in proportion to the amount of income accruing to the holder with respect to its interest in the REMIC on that day.
(ii)
Other holders taken into account.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, the amount of the allocable investment expenses that is allocated on any day to each pass-through interest holder shall be determined by multiplying the daily amount of allocable investment expenses (determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section) by a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the amount of income that accrues (but not less than zero) to the pass-through interest holder on that day and the denominator of which is the total amount of income (as determined under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section) that accrues to all regular and residual interest holders, whether or not pass-through interest holders, on that day.
(iii)
Total income accruing.
The total amount of income that accrues to all regular and residual interest holders is the sum of—
(A) The amount includible under section 860B in the gross income (but not less than zero) of the regular interest holders, and
(B) The amount of REMIC taxable income (but not less than zero) taken into account under section 860C by the residual interest holders.
(4)
Dates of purchase and disposition.
For purposes of this section, a pass-through interest holder holds an interest on the date of its purchase but not on the date of its disposition.
(d)
Example.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(i) During the calendar quarter ending March 31, 1989, REMIC X, which is not a single-class REMIC, incurs $900 of allocable investment expenses. At the beginning of the calendar quarter, X has 4 residual interest holders, who hold equal proportionate shares, and 10 regular interest holders. The residual interest holders, all of whom have calendar-year taxable years, are as follows:
A, an individual,
C, a C corporation that is a nominee for individual I.
S, an S corporation, and
M, a C corporation that is not a nominee.
(ii) Except for A, all of the residual interest holders hold their interests in X for the entire calendar quarter. On January 31, 1989, A sells his interest to S. Thus, for the first month of the calendar quarter, each residual interest holder holds a 25 percent interest (100%/4 interest holders) in X. For the last two months, S's holding is increased to 50 percent and A's holding is decreased to zero. The daily amount of allocable investment expenses for the calendar quarter is $10 ($900/90 days).
(iii) The amount of allocable investment expenses apportioned to the residual interest holders is as follows:
(A) $75 ($10 × 25% × 30 days) is allocated to A for the 30 days that A holds an interest in X during the calendar quarter. A includes $75 in gross income in calendar year 1989. The amount of A's expenses described in section 212 is increased by $75 in calendar year 1989. A's deduction under section 212 (including the $75 amount of the allocation) is subject to the limitations contained in section 67.
(B) $225 ($10 × 25% × 90 days) is allocated to C. Because C is a nominee for I, C does not include $225 in gross income or increase its deductible expenses by $225. Instead, I includes $225 in gross income in calendar year 1989, her taxable year. The amount of I's expenses described in section 212 is increased by $225. I's deduction under section 212 (including the $225 amount of the allocation) is subject to the limitations contained in section 67.
(C) $375 (($10 × 25% × 30 days) + ($10 × 50% × 60 days)) is allocated to S. S includes in gross income $375 of allocable investment expenses in calendar year 1989. The amount of S's expenses described in section 212 for that taxable year is increased by $375. S allocates the $375 to its shareholders in accordance with the rules described in sections 1366 and 1377 in calendar year 1989. Thus, each shareholder of S includes its pro rata share of the $375 in gross income in its taxable year in which or with which calendar year 1989 ends. The amount of each shareholder's expenses described in section 212 is increased by the amount of the shareholder's allocation for the shareholder's taxable year in which or with which calendar year 1989 ends. The shareholder's deduction under section 212 (including the allocation under this section) is subject to the limitations contained in section 67.
(D) No amount is allocated to M. However, M's interest is taken into account for purposes of determining the proportionate share of those residual interest holders to whom an allocation is required to be made.
(iv) No allocation is made to the 10 regular interest holders pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. In addition, the interests held by these interest holders are not taken into account for purposes of determining the proportionate share of the residual interest holders to whom an allocation is required to be made.
(e)
Allocable investment expenses not subject to backup withholding.
The amount of allocable investment expenses required to be allocated to a pass-through interest holder pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not subject to backup withholding under section 3406.
(f)
Notice to pass-through interest holders
—(1)
Information required.
A REMIC must provide to each pass-through interest holder to which an allocation of allocable investment expense is required to be made under paragraph (a)(1) of this section notice of the following—
(i) If, pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section, notice is provided for a calendar quarter, the aggregate amount of expenses paid or accrued during the calendar quarter for which the REMIC is allowed a deduction under section 212;
(ii) If, pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, notice is provided to a regular interest holder for a calendar year, the aggregate amount of expenses paid or accrued during each calendar quarter that the regular interest holder held the regular interest in the calendar year and for which the REMIC is allowed a deduction under section 212; and
(iii) The proportionate share of these expenses allocated to that pass-through interest holder, as determined under paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Statement to be furnished
—(i)

a residual interest during the calendar quarter the notice required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section on Schedule Q (Form 1066), as required in § 1.860F-4(e).
(ii)
To regular interest holder
—(A)
In general.
For each calendar year, a single-class REMIC (as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) must provide to each pass-through interest holder who held a regular interest during the calendar year the notice required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Quarterly reporting is not required. The information required to be included in the notice may be separately stated on the statement described in § 1.6049-7(f) instead of on a separate statement provided in a separate mailing. See § 1.6049-7(f)(4). The separate statement provided in a separate mailing must be furnished to each pass-through interest holder no later than the last day of the month following the close of the calendar year.
(B)
Special rule for 1987.
The information required under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section for any calendar quarter of 1987 shall be mailed (or otherwise delivered) to each pass-through interest holder who holds a regular interest during that calendar quarter no later than March 28, 1988.
(3)
Returns to the Internal Revenue Service
—(i)
With respect to residual interest holders.
Any REMIC required under paragraphs (f)(1) and (2)(i) of this section to furnish information to any pass-through interest holder who holds a residual interest shall also furnish such information to the Internal Revenue Service as required in § 1.860F-4(e)(4).
(ii)
With respect to regular interest holders.
A single-class REMIC (as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) shall make an information return on Form 1099 for each calendar year beginning after December 31, 1987, with respect to each pass-through interest holder who holds a regular interest to which an allocation of allocable investment expenses is required to be made pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2)(ii) of this section. The preceding sentence applies with respect to a holder for a calendar year only if the REMIC is required to make an information return to the Internal Revenue Service with respect to that holder for that year pursuant to section 6049 and § 1.6049-7(b)(2)(i) (or would be required to make an information return but for the $10 threshold described in section 6049(a)(1) and § 1.6049-7(b)(2)(i)). The REMIC shall state on the information return—
(A) The sum of—
(
1
) The aggregate amounts includible in gross income as interest (as defined in § 1.6049-7(a)(1) (i) and (ii)), for the calendar year, and
(
2
) The sum of the amount of allocable investment expenses required to be allocated to the pass-through interest holder for each calendar quarter during the calendar year pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, and
(B) Any other information specified by the form or its instructions.
(4)
Interest held by nominees and other specified persons
—(i)
Pass-through interest holder's interest held by a nominee.
If a pass-through interest holder's interest in a REMIC is held in the name of a nominee, the REMIC may make the information return described in paragraphs (f)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section with respect to the nominee in lieu of the pass-through interest holder and may provide the written statement described in paragraphs (f)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section to that nominee in lieu of the pass-through interest holder.
(ii)
Regular interests in a single-class REMIC held by certain persons.

[T.D. 8186, 53 FR 7507, Mar. 9, 1988, as amended by T.D. 8366, 56 FR 49515, Sept. 30, 1991]
§ 1.67-4
Costs paid or incurred by estates or non-grantor trusts.
(a)
Deductions
—(1)
Section 67(e) deductions
—(i)
In general.
An estate or trust (including the S portion of an electing small business trust) not described in § 1.67-2T(g)(1)(i) (a non-grantor trust) must compute its adjusted gross income in the same manner as an individual, except that the following deductions (section 67(e) deductions) are allowed in arriving at adjusted gross income:
(A) Costs that are paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the estate or trust that would not have been incurred if the property were not held in such estate or trust; and
(B) Deductions allowable under section 642(b) (relating to the personal exemption) and sections 651 and 661 (relating to distributions).
(ii)
Not disallowed under section 67(g).
Section 67(e) deductions are not itemized deductions under section 63(d) and are not miscellaneous itemized deductions under section 67(b). Therefore, section 67(e) deductions are not disallowed under section 67(g).
(2)
Deductions subject to 2-percent floor.
A cost is not a section 67(e) deduction and thus is subject to both the 2-percent floor in section 67(a) and section 67(g) to the extent that it is included in the definition of miscellaneous itemized deductions under section 67(b), is incurred by an estate or non-grantor trust (including the S portion of an electing small business trust), and commonly or customarily would be incurred by a hypothetical individual holding the same property.
(b)
“Commonly” or “Customarily” Incurred
—(1)
In general.
In analyzing a cost to determine whether it commonly or customarily would be incurred by a hypothetical individual owning the same property, it is the type of product or service rendered to the estate or non-grantor trust in exchange for the cost, rather than the description of the cost of that product or
service, that is determinative. In addition to the types of costs described as commonly or customarily incurred by individuals in paragraphs (b)(2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section, costs that are incurred commonly or customarily by individuals also include, for example, costs incurred in defense of a claim against the estate, the decedent, or the non-grantor trust that are unrelated to the existence, validity, or administration of the estate or trust.
(2)
Ownership costs.
Ownership costs are costs that are chargeable to or incurred by an owner of property simply by reason of being the owner of the property. Thus, for purposes of section 67(e), ownership costs are commonly or customarily incurred by a hypothetical individual owner of such property. Such ownership costs include, but are not limited to, partnership costs deemed to be passed through to and reportable by a partner if these costs are defined as miscellaneous itemized deductions pursuant to section 67(b), condominium fees, insurance premiums, maintenance and lawn services, and automobile registration and insurance costs. Other expenses incurred merely by reason of the ownership of property may be fully deductible under other provisions of the Code, such as sections 62(a)(4), 162, or 164(a), which would not be miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to section 67(e).
(3)
Tax preparation fees.
Costs relating to all estate and generation-skipping transfer tax returns, fiduciary income tax returns, and the decedent's final individual income tax returns are not subject to the 2-percent floor. The costs of preparing all other tax returns (for example, gift tax returns) are costs commonly and customarily incurred by individuals and thus are subject to the 2-percent floor.
(4)
Investment advisory fees.
Fees for investment advice (including any related services that would be provided to any individual investor as part of an investment advisory fee) are incurred commonly or customarily by a hypothetical individual investor and therefore are subject to the 2-percent floor. However, certain incremental costs of investment advice beyond the amount that normally would be charged to an individual investor are not subject to the 2-percent floor. For this purpose, such an incremental cost is a special, additional charge that is added solely because the investment advice is rendered to a trust or estate rather than to an individual or attributable to an unusual investment objective or the need for a specialized balancing of the interests of various parties (beyond the usual balancing of the varying interests of current beneficiaries and remaindermen) such that a reasonable comparison with individual investors would be improper. The portion of the investment advisory fees not subject to the 2-percent floor by reason of the preceding sentence is limited to the amount of those fees, if any, that exceeds the fees normally charged to an individual investor.
(5)
Appraisal fees.
Appraisal fees incurred by an estate or a non-grantor trust to determine the fair market value of assets as of the decedent's date of death (or the alternate valuation date), to determine value for purposes of making distributions, or as otherwise required to properly prepare the estate's or trust's tax returns, or a generation-skipping transfer tax return, are not incurred commonly or customarily by an individual and thus are not subject to the 2-percent floor. The cost of appraisals for other purposes (for example, insurance) is commonly or customarily incurred by individuals and is subject to the 2-percent floor.
(6)
Certain fiduciary expenses.
Certain other fiduciary expenses are not commonly or customarily incurred by individuals, and thus are not subject to the 2-percent floor. Such expenses include without limitation the following: Probate court fees and costs; fiduciary bond premiums; legal publication costs of notices to creditors or heirs; the cost of certified copies of the decedent's death certificate; and costs related to fiduciary accounts.
(c)
Bundled fees
—(1)
In general.
If an estate or a non-grantor trust pays a single fee, commission, or other expense (such as a fiduciary's commission, attorney's fee, or accountant's fee) for both costs that are subject to the 2-percent floor and costs (in more than a de minimis amount) that are not, then, except to the extent provided otherwise by guidance published
in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, the single fee, commission, or other expense (bundled fee) must be allocated, for purposes of computing the adjusted gross income of the estate or non-grantor trust in compliance with section 67(e), between the costs that are subject to the 2-percent floor and those that are not.
(2)
Exception.
If a bundled fee is not computed on an hourly basis, only the portion of that fee that is attributable to investment advice is subject to the 2-percent floor; the remaining portion is not subject to that floor.
(3)
Expenses not subject to allocation.
Out-of-pocket expenses billed to the estate or non-grantor trust are treated as separate from the bundled fee. In addition, payments made from the bundled fee to third parties that would have been subject to the 2-percent floor if they had been paid directly by the estate or non-grantor trust are subject to the 2-percent floor, as are any fees or expenses separately assessed by the fiduciary or other payee of the bundled fee (in addition to the usual or basic bundled fee) for services rendered to the estate or non-grantor trust that are commonly or customarily incurred by an individual.
(4)
Reasonable method.
Any reasonable method may be used to allocate a bundled fee between those costs that are subject to the 2-percent floor and those costs that are not, including without limitation the allocation of a portion of a fiduciary commission that is a bundled fee to investment advice. Facts that may be considered in determining whether an allocation is reasonable include, but are not limited to, the percentage of the value of the corpus subject to investment advice, whether a third party advisor would have charged a comparable fee for similar advisory services, and the amount of the fiduciary's attention to the trust or estate that is devoted to investment advice as compared to dealings with beneficiaries and distribution decisions and other fiduciary functions. The reasonable method standard does not apply to determine the portion of the bundled fee attributable to payments made to third parties for expenses subject to the 2-percent floor or to any other separately assessed expense commonly or customarily incurred by an individual, because those payments and expenses are readily identifiable without any discretion on the part of the fiduciary or return preparer.
(d)
Applicability date.
This section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014. Paragraph (a) of this section applies to taxable years beginning after October 19, 2020. Taxpayers may choose to apply paragraph (a) of this section to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and on or before October 19, 2020.
[T.D. 9664, 79 FR 26619, May 9, 2014, as amended at 79 FR 41636, July 17, 2014; T.D. 9918, 85 FR 66224, Oct. 19, 2020]

# Items Specifically Included in Gross Income
§ 1.71-1
Alimony and separate maintenance payments; income to wife or former wife.
(a)
In general.
Section 71 provides rules for treatment in certain cases of payments in the nature of or in lieu of alimony or an allowance for support as between spouses who are divorced or separated. For convenience, the payee spouse will hereafter in this section be referred to as the “wife” and the spouse from whom she is divorced or separated as the “husband.” See section 7701(a)(17). For rules relative to the deduction by the husband of periodic payments not attributable to transferred property, see section 215 and the regulations thereunder. For rules relative to the taxable status of income of an estate or trust in case of divorce, etc., see section 682 and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Alimony or separate maintenance payments received from the husband
—(1)
Decree of divorce or separate maintenance.
(i) In the case of divorce or legal separation, paragraph (1) of section 71(a) requires the inclusion in the gross income of the wife of periodic payments (whether or not made at regular intervals) received by her after a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance. Such periodic payments must be made in discharge of a legal obligation imposed upon or incurred by the husband because of the marital or family
relationship under a court order or decree divorcing or legally separating the husband and wife or a written instrument incident to the divorce status or legal separation status.
(ii) For treatment of payments attributable to property transferred (in trust or otherwise), see paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Written separation agreement.
(i) Where the husband and wife are separated and living apart and do not file a joint income tax return for the taxable year, paragraph (2) of section 71(a) requires the inclusion in the gross income of the wife of periodic payments (whether or not made at regular intervals) received by her pursuant to a written separation agreement executed after August 16, 1954. The periodic payments must be made under the terms of the written separation agreement after its execution and because of the marital or family relationship. Such payments are includable in the wife's gross income whether or not the agreement is a legally enforceable instrument. Moreover, if the wife is divorced or legally separated subsequent to the written separation agreement, payments made under such agreement continue to fall within the provisions of section 71(a)(2).
(ii) For purposes of section 71(a)(2) any written separation agreement executed on or before August 16, 1954, which is altered or modified in writing by the parties in any material respect after that date will be treated as an agreement executed after August 16, 1954, with respect to payments made after the date of alteration or modification.
(iii) For treatment of payments attributable to property transferred (in trust or otherwise), see paragraph (c) of this section.
(3)
Decree for support.
(i) Where the husband and wife are separated and living apart and do not file a joint income tax return for the taxable year, paragraph (3) of section 71(a) requires the inclusion in the gross income of the wife of periodic payments (whether or not made at regular intervals) received by her after August 16, 1954, from her husband under any type of court order or decree (including an interlocutory decree of divorce or a decree of alimony pendente lite) entered after March 1, 1954, requiring the husband to make the payments for her support or maintenance. It is not necessary for the wife to be legally separated or divorced from her husband under a court order or decree; nor is it necessary for the order or decree for support to be for the purpose of enforcing a written separation agreement.
(ii) For purposes of section 71(a)(3), any decree which is altered or modified by a court order entered after March 1, 1954, will be treated as a decree entered after such date.
(4)
Scope of section 71(a).
Section 71(a) applies only to payments made because of the family or marital relationship in recognition of the general obligation to support which is made specific by the decree, instrument, or agreement. Thus, section 71(a) does not apply to that part of any periodic payment which is attributable to the repayment by the husband of, for example, a bona fide loan previously made to him by the wife, the satisfaction of which is specified in the decree, instrument, or agreement as a part of the general settlement between the husband and wife.
(5)
Year of inclusion.
Periodic payments are includible in the wife's income under section 71(a) only for the taxable year in which received by her. As to such amounts, the wife is to be treated as if she makes her income tax returns on the cash receipts and disbursements method, regardless of whether she normally makes such returns on the accrual method. However, if the periodic payments described in section 71(a) are to be made by an estate or trust, such periodic payments are to be included in the wife's taxable year in which they are includible according to the rules as to income of estates and trusts provided in sections 652, 662, and 682, whether or not such payments are made out of the income of such estates or trusts.
(6)
Examples.
The foregoing rules are illustrated by the following examples in which it is assumed that the husband and wife file separate income tax returns on the calendar year basis:

# Example 1.
W files suit for divorce from H in 1953. In consideration of W's promise to relinquish all marital rights and not to make
public H's financial affairs, H agrees in writing to pay $200 a month to W during her lifetime if a final decree of divorce is granted without any provision for alimony. Accordingly, W does not request alimony and no provision for alimony is made under a final decree of divorce entered December 31, 1953. During 1954, H pays W $200 a month, pursuant to the promise. The $2,400 thus received by W is includible in her gross income under the provisions of section 71(a)(1). Under section 215, H is entitled to a deduction of $2,400 from his gross income.

# Example 2.
During 1945, H and W enter into an antenuptial agreement, under which, in consideration of W's relinquishment of all marital rights (including dower) in H's property, and, in order to provide for W's support and household expenses, H promises to pay W $200 a month during her lifetime. Ten years after their marriage, W sues H for divorce but does not ask for or obtain alimony because of the provision already made for her support in the antenuptial agreement. Likewise, the divorce decree is silent as to such agreement and H's obligation to support W. Section 71(a) does not apply to such a case. If, however, the decree were modified so as to refer to the antenuptial agreement, or if reference had been made to the antenuptial agreement in the court's decree or in a written instrument incident to the divorce status, section 71(a)(1) would require the inclusion in W's gross income of the payments received by her after the decree. Similarly, if a written separation agreement were executed after August 16, 1954, and incorporated the payment provisions of the antenuptial agreement, section 71(a)(2) would require the inclusion in W's income of payments received by W after W begins living apart from H, whether or not the divorce decree was subsequently entered and whether or not W was living apart from H when the separation agreement was executed, provided that such payments were made after such agreement was executed and pursuant to its terms. As to including such payments in W's income, if made by a trust created under the antenuptial agreement, regardless of whether referred to in the decree or a later instrument, or created pursuant to the written separation agreement, see section 682 and the regulations thereunder.

# Example 3.
H and W are separated and living apart during 1954. W sues H for support and on February 1, 1954, the court enters a decree requiring H to pay $200 a month to W for her support and maintenance. No part of the $200 a month support payments is includible in W's income under section 71(a)(3) or deductible by H under section 215. If, however, the decree had been entered after March 1, 1954, or had been altered or modified by a court order entered after March 1, 1954, the payments received by W after August 16, 1954, under the decree as altered or modified would be includible in her income under section 71(a)(3) and deductible by H under section 215.

# Example 4.
W sues H for divorce in 1954. On January 15, 1954, the court awards W temporary alimony of $25 a week pending the final decree. On September 1, 1954, the court grants W a divorce and awards her $200 a month permanent alimony. No part of the $25 a week temporary alimony received prior to the decree is includible in W's income under section 71(a), but the $200 a month received during the remainder of 1954 by W is includible in her income for 1954. Under section 215, H is entitled to deduct such $200 payments from his income. If, however, the decree awarding W temporary alimony had been entered after March 1, 1954, or had been altered or modified by a court order entered after March 1, 1954, temporary alimony received by her after August 16, 1954, would be includible in her income under section 71(a)(3) and deductible by H under section 215.
(c)
Alimony and separate maintenance payments attributable to property.
(1)(i) In the case of divorce or legal separation, paragraph (1) of section 71(a) requires the inclusion in the gross income of the wife of periodic payments (whether or not made at regular intervals) attributable to property transferred, in trust or otherwise, and received by her after a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance. Such property must have been transferred in discharge of a legal obligation imposed upon or incurred by the husband because of the marital or family relationship under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance or under a written instrument incident to such divorce status or legal separation status.
(ii) Where the husband and wife are separated and living apart and do not file a joint income tax return for the taxable year, paragraph (2) of section 71(a) requires the inclusion in the gross income of the wife of periodic payments (whether or not made at regular intervals) received by her which are attributable to property transferred, in trust or otherwise, under a written separation agreement executed after August 16, 1954. The property must be transferred because of the marital or family relationship. The periodic payments attributable to the property must be received by the wife after the written separation agreement is executed.
(iii) The periodic payments received by the wife attributable to property transferred under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph and includible in her gross income are not to be included in the gross income of the husband.
(2) The full amount of periodic payments received under the circumstances described in section 71(a) (1), (2), and (3) is required to be included in the gross income of the wife regardless of the source of such payments. Thus, it matters not that such payments are attributable to property in trust, to life insurance, endowment, or annuity contracts, or to any other interest in property, or are paid directly or indirectly by the husband from his income or capital. For example, if in order to meet an alimony or separate maintenance obligation of $500 a month the husband purchases or assigns for the benefit of his wife a commercial annuity contract paying such amount, the full $500 a month received by the wife is includible in her income, and no part of such amount is includible in the husband's income or deductible by him. See section 72(k) and the regulations thereunder. Likewise, if property is transferred by the husband, subject to an annual charge of $5,000, payable to his wife in discharge of his alimony or separate maintenance obligation under the divorce or separation decree or written instrument incident to the divorce status or legal separation status or if such property is transferred pursuant to a written separation agreement and subject to a similar annual charge, the $5,000 received annually is, under section 71(a) (1) or (2), includible in the wife's income, regardless of whether such amount is paid out of income or principal of the property.
(3) The same rule applies to periodic payments attributable to property in trust. The full amount of periodic payments to which section 71(a) (1) and (2) applies is includible in the wife's income regardless of whether such payments are made out of trust income. Such periodic payments are to be included in the wife's income under section 71(a) (1) or (2) and are to be excluded from the husband's income even though the income of the trust would otherwise be includible in his income under Subpart E, Part I, Subchapter J, Chapter 1 of the Code, relating to trust income attributable to grantors and others as substantial owners. As to periodic payments received by a wife attributable to property in trust in cases to which section 71(a) (1) or (2) does not apply because the husband's obligation is not specified in the decree or an instrument incident to the divorce status or legal separation status or the property was not transferred under a written separation agreement, see section 682 and the regulations thereunder.
(4) Section 71(a) (1) or (2) does not apply to that part of any periodic payment attributable to that portion of any interest in property transferred in discharge of the husband's obligation under the decree or instrument incident to the divorce status or legal separation status, or transferred pursuant to the written separation agreement, which interest originally belonged to the wife. It will apply, however, if she received such interest from her husband in contemplation of or as an incident to the divorce or separation without adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth, other than the release of the husband or his property from marital obligations. An example of the first rule is a case where the husband and wife transfer securities, which were owned by them jointly, in trust to pay an annuity to the wife. In this case, the full amount of that part of the annuity received by the wife attributable to the husband's interest in the securities transferred in discharge of his obligation under the decree, or instrument incident to the divorce status or legal separation status, or transferred under the written separation agreement, is taxable to her under section 71(a) (1) or (2), while that portion of the annuity attributable to the wife's interest in the securities so transferred is taxable to her only to the extent it is out of trust income as provided in Part I (sections 641 and following), Subchapter J, Chapter 1 of the Code. If, however, the husband's transfer to his wife is made before such property is transferred in discharge of
his obligation under the decree or written instrument, or pursuant to the separation agreement in an attempt to avoid the application of section 71(a) (1) or (2) to part of such payments received by his wife, such transfers will be considered as a part of the same transfer by the husband of his property in discharge of his obligation or pursuant to such agreement. In such a case, section 71(a) (1) or (2) will be applied to the full amount received by the wife. As to periodic payments received under a joint purchase of a commercial annuity contract, see section 72 and the regulations thereunder.
(d)
Periodic and installment payments.
(1) In general, installment payments discharging a part of an obligation the principal sum of which is, in terms of money or property, specified in the decree, instrument, or agreement are not considered “periodic payments” and therefore are not to be included under section 71(a) in the wife's income.
(2) An exception to the general rule stated in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is provided, however, in cases where such principal sum, by the terms of the decree, instrument, or agreement, may be or is to be paid over a period ending more than 10 years from the date of such decree, instrument, or agreement. In such cases, the installment payment is considered a periodic payment for the purposes of section 71(a) but only to the extent that the installment payment, or sum of the installment payments, received during the wife's taxable year does not exceed 10 percent of the principal sum. This 10-percent limitation applies to installment payments made in advance but does not apply to delinquent installment payments for a prior taxable year of the wife made during her taxable year.
(3)(i) Where payments under a decree, instrument, or agreement are to be paid over a period ending 10 years or less from the date of such decree, instrument, or agreement, such payments are not installment payments discharging a part of an obligation the principal sum of which is, in terms of money or property, specified in the decree, instrument, or agreement (and are considered periodic payments for the purposes of section 71(a)) only if such payments meet the following two conditions:
(
a
) Such payments are subject to any one or more of the contingencies of death of either spouse, remarriage of the wife, or change in the economic status of either spouse, and
(
b
) Such payments are in the nature of alimony or an allowance for support.
(ii) Payments meeting the requirements of subdivision (i) are considered periodic payments for the purposes of section 71(a) regardless of whether—
(
a
) The contingencies described in subdivision (i)(
a
) of this subparagraph are set forth in the terms of the decree, instrument, or agreement, or are imposed by local law, or
(
b
) The aggregate amount of the payments to be made in the absence of the occurrence of the contingencies described in subdivision (i)(
a
) of this subparagraph is explicitly stated in the decree, instrument, or agreement or may be calculated from the face of the decree, instrument, or agreement, or
(
c
) The total amount which will be paid may be calculated actuarially.
(4) Where payments under a decree, instrument, or agreement are to be paid over a period ending more than ten years from the date of such decree, instrument, or agreement, but where such payments meet the conditions set forth in subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph, such payments are considered to be periodic payments for the purpose of section 71 without regard to the rule set forth in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. Accordingly, the rules set forth in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph are not applicable to such payments.
(5) The rules as to periodic and installment payments are illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Under the terms of a written instrument, H is required to make payments to W which are in the nature of alimony, in the amount of $100 a month for nine years. The instrument provides that if H or W dies the payments are to cease. The payments are periodic.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1) except that the written instrument explicitly provides that H is to pay W the sum of $10,800 in monthly payments of $100 over a period of nine years. The payments are periodic.

# Example 3.
Under the terms of a written instrument, H is to pay W $100 a month over a period of nine years. The monthly payments are not subject to any of the contingencies of death of H or W, remarriage of W, or change in the economic status of H or W under the terms of the written instrument or by reason of local law. The payments are not periodic.

# Example 4.
A divorce decree in 1954 provides that H is to pay W $20,000 each year for the next five years, beginning with the date of the decree, and then $5,000 each year for the next ten years. Assuming the wife makes her returns on the calendar year basis, each payment received in the years 1954 to 1958, inclusive, is treated as a periodic payment under section 71(a)(1), but only to the extent of 10 percent of the principal sum of $150,000. Thus, for such taxable years, only $15,000 of the $20,000 received is includible under section 71(a)(1) in the wife's income and is deductible by the husband under section 215. For the years 1959 to 1968, inclusive, the full $5,000 received each year by the wife is includible in her income and is deductible from the husband's income.
(e)
Payments for support of minor children.
Section 71(a) does not apply to that part of any periodic payment which, by the terms of the decree, instrument, or agreement under section 71(a), is specifically designated as a sum payable for the support of minor children of the husband. The statute prescribes the treatment in cases where an amount or portion is so fixed but the amount of any periodic payment is less than the amount of the periodic payment specified to be made. In such cases, to the extent of the amount which would be payable for the support of such children out of the originally specified periodic payment, such periodic payment is considered a payment for such support. For example, if the husband is by terms of the decree, instrument, or agreement required to pay $200 a month to his divorced wife, $100 of which is designated by the decree, instrument, or agreement to be for the support of their minor children, and the husband pays only $150 to his wife, $100 is nevertheless considered to be a payment by the husband for the support of the children. If, however, the periodic payments are received by the wife for the support and maintenance of herself and of minor children of the husband without such specific designation of the portion for the support of such children, then the whole of such amounts is includible in the income of the wife as provided in section 71(a). Except in cases of a designated amount or portion for the support of the husband's minor children, periodic payments described in section 71(a) received by the wife for herself and any other person or persons are includible in whole in the wife's income, whether or not the amount or portion for such other person or persons is designated.
§ 1.71-1T
Alimony and separate maintenance payments (temporary).
(a)
In general.
Q-1 What is the income tax treatment of alimony or separate maintenance payments?
A-1 Alimony or separate maintenance payments are, under section 71, included in the gross income of the payee spouse and, under section 215, allowed as a deduction from the gross income of the payor spouse.
Q-2 What is an alimony or separate maintenance payment?
A-2 An alimony or separate maintenance payment is any payment received by or on behalf of a spouse (which for this purpose includes a former spouse) of the payor under a divorce or separation instrument that meets all of the following requirements:
(a) The payment is in cash (see A-5).
(b) The payment is not designated as a payment which is excludible from the gross income of the payee and nondeductible by the payor (see A-8).
(c) In the case of spouses legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance, the spouses are not members of the same household at the time the payment is made (see A-9).
(d) The payor has no liability to continue to make any payment after the death of the payee (or to make any payment as a substitute for such payment) and the divorce or separation instrument states that there is no such liability (see A-10).
(e) The payment is not treated as child support (see A-15).
(f) To the extent that one or more annual payments exceed $10,000 during any of the 6-post-separation years, the payor is obligated to make annual payments in each of the 6-post-separation years (see A-19).
Q-3 In order to be treated as alimony or separate maintenance payments, must the payments be “periodic” as that term was defined prior to enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 or be made in discharge of a legal obligation of the payor to support the payee arising out of a marital or family relationship?
A-3 No. The Tax Reform Act of 1984 replaces the old requirements with the requirements described in A-2 above. Thus, the requirements that alimony or separate maintenance payments be “periodic” and be made in discharge of a legal obligation to support arising out of a marital or family relationship have been eliminated.
Q-4 Are the instruments described in section 71(a) of prior law the same as divorce or separation instruments described in section 71, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1984?
A-4 Yes.
(b)
Specific requirements.
Q-5 May alimony or separate maintenance payments be made in a form other than cash?
A-5 No. Only cash payments (including checks and money orders payable on demand) qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments. Transfers of services or property (including a debt instrument of a third party or an annuity contract), execution of a debt instrument by the payor, or the use of property of the payor do not qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments.
Q-6 May payments of cash to a third party on behalf of a spouse qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments if the payments are pursuant to the terms of a divorce or separation instrument?
A-6 Yes. Assuming all other requirements are satisfied, a payment of cash by the payor spouse to a third party under the terms of the divorce or separation instrument will qualify as a payment of cash which is received “on behalf of a spouse”. For example, cash payments of rent, mortgage, tax, or tuition liabilities of the payee spouse made under the terms of the divorce or separation instrument will qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments. Any payments to maintain property owned by the payor spouse and used by the payee spouse (including mortgage payments, real estate taxes and insurance premiums) are not payments on behalf of a spouse even if those payments are made pursuant to the terms of the divorce or separation instrument. Premiums paid by the payor spouse for term or whole life insurance on the payor's life made under the terms of the divorce or separation instrument will qualify as payments on behalf of the payee spouse to the extent that the payee spouse is the owner of the policy.
Q-7 May payments of cash to a third party on behalf of a spouse qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments if the payments are made to the third party at the written request of the payee spouse?
A-7 Yes. For example, instead of making an alimony or separate maintenance payment directly to the payee, the payor spouse may make a cash payment to a charitable organization if such payment is pursuant to the written request, consent or ratification of the payee spouse. Such request, consent or ratification must state that the parties intend the payment to be treated as an alimony or separate maintenance payment to the payee spouse subject to the rules of section 71, and must be received by the payor spouse prior to the date of filing of the payor's first return of tax for the taxable year in which the payment was made.
Q-8 How may spouses designate that payments otherwise qualifying as alimony or separate maintenance payments shall be excludible from the gross income of the payee and nondeductible by the payor?
A-8 The spouses may designate that payments otherwise qualifying as alimony or separate maintenance payments shall be nondeductible by the payor and excludible from gross income by the payee by so providing in a divorce or separation instrument (as defined in section 71(b)(2)). If the spouses have executed a written separation agreement (as described in section 71(b)(2)(B)), any writing signed by both spouses which designates otherwise qualifying alimony or separate maintenance payments as nondeductible and excludible and which refers to the written separation agreement will
be treated as a written separation agreement (and thus a divorce or separation instrument) for purposes of the preceding sentence. If the spouses are subject to temporary support orders (as described in section 71(b)(2)(C)), the designation of otherwise qualifying alimony or separate payments as nondeductible and excludible must be made in the original or a subsequent temporary support order. A copy of the instrument containing the designation of payments as not alimony or separate maintenance payments must be attached to the payee's first filed return of tax (Form 1040) for each year in which the designation applies.
Q-9 What are the consequences if, at the time a payment is made, the payor and payee spouses are members of the same household?
A-9 Generally, a payment made at the time when the payor and payee spouses are members of the same household cannot qualify as an alimony or separate maintenance payment if the spouses are legally separated under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a dwelling unit formerly shared by both spouses shall not be considered two separate households even if the spouses physically separate themselves within the dwelling unit. The spouses will not be treated as members of the same household if one spouse is preparing to depart from the household of the other spouse, and does depart not more than one month after the date the payment is made. If the spouses are not legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance, a payment under a written separation agreement or a decree described in section 71(b)(2)(C) may qualify as an alimony or separate maintenance payment notwithstanding that the payor and payee are members of the same household at the time the payment is made.
Q-10 Assuming all other requirements relating to the qualification of certain payments as alimony or separate maintenance payments are met, what are the consequences if the payor spouse is required to continue to make the payments after the death of the payee spouse?
A-10 None of the payments before (or after) the death of the payee spouse qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments.
Q-11 What are the consequences if the divorce or separation instrument fails to state that there is no liability for any period after the death of the payee spouse to continue to make any payments which would otherwise qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments?
A-11 If the instrument fails to include such a statement, none of the payments, whether made before or after the death of the payee spouse, will qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments.

# Example 1.
A is to pay B $10,000 in cash each year for a period of 10 years under a divorce or separation instrument which does not state that the payments will terminate upon the death of B. None of the payments will qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments.

# Example 2.
A is to pay B $10,000 in cash each year for a period of 10 years under a divorce or separation instrument which states that the payments will terminate upon the death of B. In addition, under the instrument, A is to pay B or B's estate $20,000 in cash each year for a period of 10 years. Because the $20,000 annual payments will not terminate upon the death of B, these payments will not qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments. However, the separate $10,000 annual payments will qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments.
Q-12 Will a divorce or separation instrument be treated as stating that there is no liability to make payments after the death of the payee spouse if the liability to make such payments terminates pursuant to applicable local law or oral agreement?
A-12 No. Termination of the liability to make payments must be stated in the terms of the divorce or separation instrument.
Q-13 What are the consequences if the payor spouse is required to make one or more payments (in cash or property) after the death of the payee spouse as a substitute for the continuation of pre-death payments which would otherwise qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments?
A-13 If the payor spouse is required to make any such substitute payments,
none of the otherwise qualifying payments will qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments. The divorce or separation instrument need not state, however, that there is no liability to make any such substitute payment.
Q-14 Under what circumstances will one or more payments (in cash or property) which are to occur after the death of the payee spouse be treated as a substitute for the continuation of payments which would otherwise qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments?
A-14 To the extent that one or more payments are to begin to be made, increase in amount, or become accelerated in time as a result of the death of the payee spouse, such payments may be treated as a substitute for the continuation of payments terminating on the death of the payee spouse which would otherwise qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments. The determination of whether or not such payments are a substitute for the continuation of payments which would otherwise qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments, and of the amount of the otherwise qualifying alimony or separate maintenance payments for which any such payments are a substitute, will depend on all of the facts and circumstances.

# Example 1.
Under the terms of a divorce decree, A is obligated to make annual alimony payments to B of $30,000, terminating on the earlier of the expiration of 6 years or the death of B. B maintains custody of the minor children of A and B. The decree provides that at the death of B, if there are minor children of A and B remaining, A will be obligated to make annual payments of $10,000 to a trust, the income and corpus of which are to be used for the benefit of the children until the youngest child attains the age of majority. These facts indicate that A's liability to make annual $10,000 payments in trust for the benefit of his minor children upon the death of B is a substitute for $10,000 of the $30,000 annual payments to B. Accordingly, $10,000 of each of the $30,000 annual payments to B will not qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments.

# Example 2.
Under the terms of a divorce decree, A is obligated to make annual alimony payments to B of $30,000, terminating on the earlier of the expiration of 15 years or the death of B. The divorce decree provides that if B dies before the expiration of the 15 year period, A will pay to B's estate the difference between the total amount that A would have paid had B survived, minus the amount actually paid. For example, if B dies at the end of the 10th year in which payments are made, A will pay to B's estate $150,000 ($450,000-$300,000). These facts indicate that A's liability to make a lump sum payment to B's estate upon the death of B is a substitute for the full amount of each of the annual $30,000 payments to B. Accordingly, none of the annual $30,000 payments to B will qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments. The result would be the same if the lump sum payable at B's death were discounted by an appropriate interest factor to account for the prepayment.
(c)
Child support payments.
Q-15 What are the consequences of a payment which the terms of the divorce or separation instrument fix as payable for the support of a child of the payor spouse?
A-15 A payment which under the terms of the divorce or separation instrument is fixed (or treated as fixed) as payable for the support of a child of the payor spouse does not qualify as an alimony or separate maintenance payment. Thus, such a payment is not deductible by the payor spouse or includible in the income of the payee spouse.
Q-16 When is a payment fixed (or treated as fixed) as payable for the support of a child of the payor spouse?
A-16 A payment is fixed as payable for the support of a child of the payor spouse if the divorce or separation instrument specifically designates some sum or portion (which sum or portion may fluctuate) as payable for the support of a child of the payor spouse. A payment will be treated as fixed as payable for the support of a child of the payor spouse if the payment is reduced (a) on the happening of a contingency relating to a child of the payor, or (b) at a time which can clearly be associated with such a contingency. A payment may be treated as fixed as payable for the support of a child of the payor spouse even if other separate payments specifically are designated as payable for the support of a child of the payor spouse.
Q-17 When does a contingency relate to a child of the payor?
A-17 For this purpose, a contingency relates to a child of the payor if it depends on any event relating to that child, regardless of whether such event is certain or likely to occur.
Events that relate to a child of the payor include the following: the child's attaining a specified age or income level, dying, marrying, leaving school, leaving the spouse's household, or gaining employment.
Q-18 When will a payment be treated as to be reduced at a time which can clearly be associated with the happening of a contingency relating to a child of the payor?
A-18 There are two situations, described below, in which payments which would otherwise qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments will be presumed to be reduced at a time clearly associated with the happening of a contingency relating to a child of the payor. In all other situations, reductions in payments will not be treated as clearly associated with the happening of a contingency relating to a child of the payor.
The first situation referred to above is where the payments are to be reduced not more than 6 months before or after the date the child is to attain the age of 18, 21, or local age of majority. The second situation is where the payments are to be reduced on two or more occasions which occur not more than one year before or after a different child of the payor spouse attains a certain age between the ages of 18 and 24, inclusive. The certain age referred to in the preceding sentence must be the same for each such child, but need not be a whole number of years.
The presumption in the two situations described above that payments are to be reduced at a time clearly associated with the happening of a contingency relating to a child of the payor may be rebutted (either by the Service or by taxpayers) by showing that the time at which the payments are to be reduced was determined independently of any contingencies relating to the children of the payor. The presumption in the first situation will be rebutted conclusively if the reduction is a complete cessation of alimony or separate maintenance payments during the sixth post-separation year (described in A-21) or upon the expiration of a 72-month period. The presumption may also be rebutted in other circumstances, for example, by showing that alimony payments are to be made for a period customarily provided in the local jurisdiction, such as a period equal to one-half the duration of the marriage.

# Example:
A and B are divorced on July 1, 1985, when their children, C (born July 15, 1970) and D (born September 23, 1972), are 14 and 12, respectively. Under the divorce decree, A is to make alimony payments to B of $2,000 per month. Such payments are to be reduced to $1,500 per month on January 1, 1991 and to $1,000 per month on January 1, 1995. On January 1, 1991, the date of the first reduction in payments, C will be 20 years 5 months and 17 days old. On January 1, 1995, the date of the second reduction in payments, D will be 22 years 3 months and 9 days old. Each of the reductions in payments is to occur not more than one year before or after a different child of A attains the age of 21 years and 4 months. (Actually, the reductions are to occur not more than one year before or after C and D attain
any
of the ages 21 years 3 months and 9 days through 21 years 5 months and 17 days.) Accordingly, the reductions will be presumed to clearly be associated with the happening of a contingency relating to C and D. Unless this presumption is rebutted, payments under the divorce decree equal to the sum of the reduction ($1,000 per month) will be treated as fixed for the support of the children of A and therefore will not qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments.
(d)
Excess front-loading rules.
Q-19 What are the excess front-loading rules?
A-19 The excess front-loading rules are two special rules which may apply to the extent that payments in any calendar year exceed $10,000. The first rule is a minimum term rule, which must be met in order for any annual payment, to the extent in excess of $10,000, to qualify as an alimony or separate maintenance payment (see A-2(f)). This rule requires that alimony or separate maintenance payments be called for, at a minimum, during the 6 “post-separation years”. The second rule is a recapture rule which characterizes payments retrospectively by requiring a recalculation and inclusion in income by the payor and deducation by the payee of previously paid alimony or separate maintenance payment to the extent that the amount of such payments during any of the 6 “post-separation years” falls short of the amount of payments during a prior year by more than $10,000.
Q-20 Do the excess front-loading rules apply to payments to the extent that annual payments never exceed $10,000?
A-20 No. For example, A is to make a single $10,000 payment to B. Provided that the other requirements of section 71 are met, the payment will qualify as an alimony or separate maintenance payment. If A were to make a single $15,000 payment to B, $10,000 of the payment would qualify as an alimony or separate maintenance payment and $5,000 of the payment would be disqualified under the minimum term rule because payments were not to be made for the minimum period.
Q-21 Do the excess front-loading rules apply to payments received under a decree described in section 71(b)(2)(C)?
A-21 No. Payments under decrees described in section 71(b)(2)(C) are to be disregarded entirely for purposes of applying the excess front-loading rules.
Q-22 Both the minimum term rule and the recapture rule refer to 6 “post-separation years”. What are the 6 “post separation years”?
A-22 The 6 “post-separation years” are the 6 consecutive calendar years beginning with the first calendar year in which the payor pays to the payee an alimony or separate maintenance payment (except a payment made under a decree described in section 71(b)(2)(C)). Each year within this period is referred to as a “post-separation year”. The 6-year period need not commence with the year in which the spouses separate or divorce, or with the year in which payments under the divorce or separation instrument are made, if no payments during such year qualify as alimony or separate maintenance payments. For example, a decree for the divorce of A and B is entered in October, 1985. The decree requires A to make monthly payments to B commencing November 1, 1985, but A and B are members of the same household until February 15, 1986 (and as a result, the payments prior to January 16, 1986, do not qualify as alimony payments). For purposes of applying the excess front-loading rules to payments from A to B, the 6 calendar years 1986 through 1991 are post-separation years. If a spouse has been making payments pursuant to a divorce or separation instrument described in section 71(b)(2) (A) or (B), a modification of the instrument or the substitution of a new instrument (for example, the substitution of a divorce decree for a written separation agreement) will not result in the creation of additional post-separation years. However, if a spouse has been making payments pursuant to a divorce or separation instrument described in section 71(b)(2)(C), the 6-year period does not begin until the first calendar year in which alimony or separate maintenance payments are made under a divorce or separation instrument described in section 71(b)(2) (A) or (B).
Q-23 How does the minimum term rule operate?
A-23 The minimum term rule operates in the following manner. To the extent payments are made in excess of $10,000, a payment will qualify as an alimony or separate maintenance payment only if alimony or separate maintenance payments are to be made in each of the 6 post-separation years. For example, pursuant to a divorce decree, A is to make alimony payments to B of $20,000 in each of the 5 calendar years 1985 through 1989. A is to make no payment in 1990. Under the minimum term rule, only $10,000 will qualify as an alimony payment in each of the calendar years 1985 through 1989. If the divorce decree also required A to make a $1 payment in 1990, the minimum term rule would be satisfied and $20,000 would be treated as an alimony payment in each of the calendar years 1985 through 1989. The recapture rule would, however, apply for 1990. For purposes of determining whether alimony or separate maintenance payments are to be made in any year, the possible termination of such payments upon the happening of a contingency (other than the passage of time) which has not yet occurred is ignored (unless such contingency may cause all or a portion of the payment to be treated as a child support payment).
Q-24 How does the recapture rule operate?
A-24 The recapture rule operates in the following manner. If the amount of alimony or separate maintenance payments paid in any post-separation year
(referred to as the “computation year”) falls short of the amount of alimony or separate maintenance payments paid in any prior post-separation year by more than $10,000, the payor must compute an “excess amount” for the computation year. The excess amount for any computation year is the sum of excess amounts determined with respect to each prior post-separation year. The excess amount determined with respect to a prior post-separation year is the excess of (1) the amount of alimony or separate maintenance payments paid by the payor spouse during such prior post-separation year, over (2) the amount of the alimony or separate maintenance payments paid by the payor spouse during the computation year plus $10,000. For purposes of this calculation, the amount of alimony or separate maintenance payments made by the payor spouse during any post-separation year preceding the computation year is reduced by any excess amount previously determined with respect to such year. The rules set forth above may be illustrated by the following example. A makes alimony payments to B of $25,000 in 1985 and $12,000 in 1986. The excess amount with respect to 1985 that is recaptured in 1986 is $3,000 ($25,000− ($12,000 + $10,000)). For purposes of subsequent computation years, the amount deemed paid in 1985 is $22,000. If A makes alimony payments to B of $1,000 in 1987, the excess amount that is recaptured in 1987 will be $12,000. This is the sum of an $11,000 excess amount with respect to 1985 ($22,000−$1,000 + $10,000)) and a $1,000 excess amount with respect to 1986 ($12,000−($1,000 + $10,000)). If, prior to the end of 1990, payments decline further, additional recapture will occur. The payor spouse must include the excess amount in gross income for his/her taxable year begining with or in the computation year. The payee spouse is allowed a deduction for the excess amount in computing adjusted gross income for his/her taxable year beginning with or in the computation year. However, the payee spouse must compute the excess amount by reference to the date when payments were made and not when payments were received.
Q-25 What are the exceptions to the recapture rule?
A-25 Apart from the $10,000 threshold for application of the recapture rule, there are three exceptions to the recapture rule. The first exception is for payments received under temporary support orders described in section 71(b)(2)(C) (see A-21). The second exception is for any payment made pursuant to a continuing liability over the period of the post-separation years to pay a fixed portion of the payor's income from a business or property or from compensation for employment or self-employment. The third exception is where the alimony or separate manitenance payments in any post-separation year cease by reason of the death of the payor or payee or the remarriage (as defined under applicable local law) of the payee before the close of the computation year. For example, pursuant to a divorce decree, A is to make cash payments to B of $30,000 in each of the calendar years 1985 through 1990. A makes cash payments of $30,000 in 1985 and $15,000 in 1986, in which year B remarries and A's alimony payments cease. The recapture rule does not apply for 1986 or any subsequent year. If alimony or separate maintenance payments made by A decline or cease during a post-separation year for any other reason (including a failure by the payor to make timely payments, a modification of the divorce or separation instrument, a reduction in the support needs of the payee, or a reduction in the ability of the payor to provide support) excess amounts with respect to prior post-separation years will be subject to recapture.
(e)
Effective dates.
Q-26 When does section 71, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1984, become effective?
A-26 Generally, section 71, as amended, is effective with respect to divorce or separation instruments (as defined in section 71(b)(2)) executed after December 31, 1984. If a decree of divorce or separate maintenance executed after December 31, 1984, incorporates or adopts without change the terms of the alimony or separate maintenance payments under a divorce or separation instrument executed before January 1, 1985, such decree will be
treated as executed before January 1, 1985. A change in the amount of alimony or separate maintenance payments or the time period over which such payments are to continue, or the addition or deletion of any contingencies or conditions relating to such payments is a change in the terms of the alimony or separate maintenance payments. For example, in November 1984, A and B executed a written separation agreement. In February 1985, a decree of divorce is entered in substitution for the written separation agreement. The decree of divorce does not change the terms of the alimony A pays to B. The decree of divorce will be treated as executed before January 1, 1985 and hence alimony payments under the decree will be subject to the rules of section 71 prior to amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1984. If the amount or time period of the alimony or separate maintenance payments are not specified in the pre-1985 separation agreement or if the decree of divorce changes the amount or term of such payments, the decree of divorce will not be treated as executed before January 1, 1985, and alimony payments under the decree will be subject to the rules of section 71, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1984.
Section 71, as amended, also applies to any divorce or separation instrument executed (or treated as executed) before January 1, 1985 that has been modified on or after January 1, 1985, if such modification expressly provides that section 71, as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1984, shall apply to the instrument as modified. In this case, section 71, as amended, is effective with respect to payments made after the date the instrument is modified.

§ 1.71-2
Effective date; taxable years ending after March 31, 1954, subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
Pursuant to section 7851(a)(1)(C), the regulations prescribed in § 1.71-1, to the extent that they relate to payments under a written separation agreement executed after August 16, 1954, and to the extent that they relate to payments under a decree for support received after August 16, 1954, under a decree entered after March 1, 1954, shall also apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1954, and ending after August 16, 1954, although such years are subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
§ 1.72-1
Introduction.
(a)
General principle.
Section 72 prescribes rules relating to the inclusion in gross income of amounts received under a life insurance, endowment, or annuity contract unless such amounts are specifically excluded from gross income under other provisions of Chapter 1 of the Code. In general, these rules provide that amounts subject to the provisions of section 72 are includible in the gross income of the recipient except to the extent that they are considered to represent a reduction or return of premiums or other consideration paid.
(b)
Amounts to be considered as a return of premiums.
For the purpose of determining the extent to which amounts received represent a reduction or return of premiums or other consideration paid, the provisions of section 72 distinguish between “amounts received as an annuity” and “amounts not received as an annuity”. In general, “amounts received as an annuity” are amounts which are payable at regular intervals over a period of more than one full year from the date on which they are deemed to begin, provided the total of the amounts so payable or the period for which they are to be paid can be determined as of that date. See paragraph (b) (2) and (3) of § 1.72-2. Any other amounts to which the provisions of section 72 apply are considered to be “amounts not received as an annuity”. See § 1.72-11.
(c)
“Amounts received as an annuity.”
(1) In the case of “amounts received as an annuity” (other than certain employees' annuities described in section 72(d) and in § 1.72-13), a proportionate part of each amount so received is considered to represent a return of premiums or other consideration paid. The
proportionate part of each annuity payment which is thus excludable from gross income is determined by the ratio which the investment in the contract as of the date on which the annuity is deemed to begin bears to the expected return under the contract as of that date. See § 1.72-4.
(2) In the case of employees' annuities of the type described in section 72(d), no amount received as an annuity in a taxable year to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applies is includible in the gross income of a recipient until the aggregate of all amounts received thereunder and excluded from gross income under the applicable income tax law exceeds the consideration contributed (or deemed contributed) by the employee under § 1.72-8. Thereafter, all amounts so received are includible in the gross income of the recipient. See § 1.72-13.
(d)
“Amounts not received as an annuity”.
In the case of “amounts not received as an annuity”, if such amounts are received after an annuity has begun and during its continuance, amounts so received are generally includible in the gross income of the recipient. Amounts not received as an annuity which are received at any other time are generally includible in the gross income of the recipient only to the extent that such amounts, when added to all amounts previously received under the contract which were excludable from the gross income of the recipient under the income tax law applicable at the time of receipt, exceed the premiums or other consideration paid (see § 1.72-11). However, if the aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid for the contract includes amounts for which a deduction was allowed under section 404 as contributions on behalf of an owner-employee, the amounts received under the circumstances of the preceding sentence shall be includible in gross income until the amount so included equals the amount for which the deduction was so allowed. See paragraph (b) of § 1.72-17.
(e)
Classification of recipients.
For the purpose of the regulations under section 72, a recipient shall be considered an “annuitant” if he receives amounts under an annuity contract during the period that the annuity payments are to continue, whether for a term certain or during the continuing life or lives of the person or persons whose lives measure the duration of such annuity. However, a recipient shall be considered a “beneficiary” rather than an “annuitant” if the amounts he receives under a contract are received after the term of the annuity for a life or lives has expired and such amounts are paid by reason of the fact that the contract guarantees that payments of some minimum amount or for some minimum period shall be made. For special rules with respect to beneficiaries, see paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (c) of § 1.72-11.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6676, 28 FR 10134, Sept. 17, 1963]
§ 1.72-2
Applicability of section.
(a)
Contracts.
(1) The contracts under which amounts paid will be subject to the provisions of section 72 include contracts which are considered to be life insurance, endowment, and annuity contracts in accordance with the customary practice of life insurance companies. For the purposes of section 72, however, it is immaterial whether such contracts are entered into with an insurance company. The term “endowment contract” also includes the “face-amount certificates” described in section 72(1).
(2) If two or more annuity obligations or elements to which section 72 applies are acquired for a single consideration, such as an obligation to pay an annuity to A for his life accompanied by an obligation to pay an annuity to B for his life, there being a single consideration paid for both obligations (whether paid by one or more persons in equal or different amounts, and whether paid in a single sum or otherwise), such annuity elements shall be considered to comprise a single contract for the purpose of the application of section 72 and the regulations thereunder. For rules relating to the allocation of investment in the contract in the case of annuity elements payable to two or more persons, see paragraph (b) of § 1.72-6.
(3)(i) Sections 402 and 403 provide that certain distributions by employees' trusts and certain payments under
employee plans are taxable under section 72. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, section 72(e)(3), as in effect before such date, does not apply to such distributions or payments. For purposes of applying section 72 to such distributions and payments (other than those described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph), each separate program of the employer consisting of interrelated contributions and benefits shall be considered a single contract. Therefore, all distributions or payments (other than those described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) which are attributable to a separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits are considered as received under a single contract. A separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits may be financed by the purchase from an insurance company of one or more group contracts or one or more individual contracts, or may be financed partly by the purchase of contracts from an insurance company and partly through an investment fund, or may be financed completely through an investment fund. A program may be considered separate for purposes of section 72 although it is only a part of a plan which qualifies under section 401. There may be several trusts under one separate program, or several separate programs may make use of a single trust. See, however, subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for rules relating to what constitutes a “contract” for purposes of applying section 72 to distributions commencing before October 20, 1960.
(ii) The following types of benefits, and the contributions used to provide them, are examples of separate programs of interrelated contributions and benefits:
(
a
) Definitely determinable retirement benefits.
(
b
) Definitely determinable benefits payable prior to retirement in case of disability.
(
c
) Life insurance.
(
d
) Accident and health insurance.
However, retirement benefits and life insurance will be considered part of a single separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits to the extent they are provided under retirement income, endowment, or other contracts providing life insurance protection. See examples (6), (7), and (8) contained in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph for illustrations of the principles of this subdivision. See, also, § 1.72-15 for rules relating to the taxation of amounts received under an employee plan which provides both retirement benefits and accident and health benefits.
(iii) If any amount which is taxable under section 72 by reason of section 402 or 403 is actually distributed or made available to any person under an employees' trust or plan (other than the Civil Service Retirement Act, 5 U.S.C. ch. 14) before October 20, 1960, section 72 shall, notwithstanding any other provisions in this subparagraph, be applied to all the distributions with respect to such person (or his beneficiaries) under such trust or plan (whether received before or after October 20, 1960) as though such distributions were provided under a single contract. For purposes of applying section 72 to distributions to which this subdivision applies, therefore, the term “contract” shall be considered to include the entire interest of an employee in each trust or plan described in sections 402 and 403 to the extent that distributions thereunder are subject to the provisions of section 72. Section 72 shall be applied to distributions received under the Civil Service Retirement Act in the manner prescribed in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph (see example (4) in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph).
(iv) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On January 1, 1961, X Corporation established a noncontributory profit-sharing plan for its employees providing that the amount standing to the account of each participant will be paid to him at the time of his retirement and also established a contributory pension plan for its employees providing for the payment to each participant of a lifetime pension after retirement. The profit-sharing plan is designed to enable the employees to participate in the profits of X Corporation; the amount of the contributions to it are determined by reference to the profits of X Corporation; and the amount of any distribution is determined by reference to the amount of contributions made on behalf of any participant and the earnings thereon. On the other hand, the pension plan
is designed to provide a lifetime pension for a retired employee; the amount of the pension is to be determined by a formula set forth in the plan; and the amount of contributions to the plan is the amount necessary to provide such pensions. In view of the fact that each of these plans constitutes a separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits, the distributions from each shall be treated as received under a separate contract. If these plans had been established before October 20, 1960, then, in the case of an employee who receives a distribution under the plans before October 20, 1960, the determination as to whether that distribution and all subsequent distributions to such employee are received under a single contract or under more than one contract shall be made by applying the rules in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. On the other hand, in the case of an employee who does not receive any distribution under these plans before October 20, 1960, the determination as to whether distributions to him are received under a single contract or under more than one contract shall be made in accordance with the rules illustrated by this example.

# Example 2.
On January 1, 1961, Z Corporation established a profit-sharing plan for its employees providing that any employee may make contributions, not in excess of 6 percent of his compensation, to a trust and that the employer would make matching contributions out of profits. Under the plan, a participant may receive a periodic distribution of the amount standing in his account during any period that he is absent from work due to a personal injury or sickness. On separation from service, the participant is entitled to receive a distribution of the balance standing in his account in accordance with one of several options. One option provides for the immediate distribution of one-half of the account and for the periodic distribution of the remaining one-half of the account. In addition, any participant may, after the completion of five years of participation, withdraw any part of his account, but in the case of such a withdrawal, the participant forfeits his rights to participate in the plan for a period of two years. Thus, a participant may receive distributions before separation from service; he may receive a distribution of a lump sum upon separation from service; he may also receive periodic distributions upon separation from service. However, since it is the total amount received under all the options that is interrelated with the contributions to the plan and not the amount received under any one option, this profit-sharing plan consists of only one separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits and all distributions under the plan (regardless of the option under which received) are treated as received under one contract. However, if, instead of providing that the amount standing in an employee's account would be paid to him during any period that he is absent from work due to a personal injury or sickness, the plan provided that a portion of the amount in the employee's account would be used to purchase incidental accident and health insurance, this plan would consist of two separate programs of interrelated contributions and benefits. The accident and health insurance, and the contributions used to purchase it, would be considered as one separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits and, therefore, a separate contract; whereas, the remaining contributions and benefits would be considered another separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits and, consequently, another separate contract.

# Example 3.
On January 1, 1961, N Corporation established a profit-sharing plan for its employees providing that the employees may make contributions, not in excess of 6 percent of their compensation, to a trust and that N Corporation would make matching contributions out of its profits. Under the plan, the employee may elect each year to have his and the employer's contributions for such year placed in either a savings arrangement or a retirement arrangement. Such an election is irrevocable. Under the savings arrangement, contributions to such arrangement for any one year and the earnings thereon will be distributed five years later. The retirement arrangement provides that all contributions thereto and the earnings thereon will be distributed when the employee is separated from the service of N Corporation. Since the distributions under the retirement arrangement are attributable solely to the contributions made to such arrangement and are not affected in any manner by contributions or distributions under the savings arrangement or any other plan, such distributions are treated as received under a separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits. Similarly, since distributions during any year under the savings arrangement are attributable only to contributions to such arrangement made during the fifth preceding year and are not affected in any manner by any other contributions to or distributions from such arrangement or any other plan, the savings arrangement constitutes a series of separate programs of interrelated contributions and benefits. The contributions to the savings arrangement for any year and the distribution in a subsequent year based thereon constitute a separate contract for purposes of section 72.

# Example 4.
The Civil Service Retirement Act (5 U.S.C. Ch. 14) which provides retirement benefits for participating employees,
consists of a compulsory program and a voluntary program. Under the compulsory program, all participating employees are required to make certain contributions and, upon retirement, are provided retirement benefits computed on the basis of compensation and length of service. Under the voluntary program, such participating employees are permitted to make contributions in addition to those required under the compulsory program and, upon retirement, are provided additional retirement benefits computed on the basis of their voluntary contributions. Distributions received under the Act constitute distributions from two separate contracts for purposes of section 72. Distributions received under the compulsory program are considered as received under a separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits since they are computed solely under the compulsory program and are not affected by any contributions or distributions under the voluntary program or under any other plan. For similar reasons, distributions which are attributable to the voluntary contributions are considered as received under a separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits.

# Example 5.
On January 1, 1961, M Corporation established a contributory pension plan for its employees and created a trust to which it makes contributions to fund such plan. The plan provides that each participant will receive after age 65 a pension of 1
1/2
percent of his compensation for each year of service performed subsequent to the establishment of such plan. In order to fund part of the benefits under the plan, the trustee purchased a group annuity contract. The remaining part of the benefits are to be paid out of a separate investment fund. This pension plan constitutes a single program of interrelated contributions and benefits and, therefore, all distributions received by an employee under the plan are considered as received under a single contract for purposes of section 72.

# Example 6.
On January 1, 1961, Y Corporation established a noncontributory pension plan (including incidental death benefits) for its employees and created a trust to which it makes contributions to fund such plan. The plan provides that each participant will receive after age 65 a pension of 1
1/2
percent of his compensation for each year of service performed subsequent to the establishment of such plan. In addition, such plan provides for the payment of a death benefit if the employee dies before age 65. The trustee funded the death benefits through the purchase of a group term insurance policy and funded the retirement benefits through the purchase of a group annuity contract. Because of a subsequent change in funding from the deferred annuity method to the deposit administration method, the trustee purchased a second group annuity contract to provide the retirement benefits under the plan accruing after the effective date of the change in method of funding. Thus, retirement benefits distributed to an employee whose service with Y Corporation commenced before the effective date of the change in method of funding will be attributable to both group annuity contracts. This pension plan includes two separate programs of interrelated contributions and benefits. The death benefits, and the contributions required to provide them, are considered as one separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits; whereas, the retirement benefits, and the contributions required to provide them, are considered as another separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits. Therefore, any retirement benefits received by an employee, whether attributable to one or both of the group annuity contracts, shall be considered as received under a single contract for purposes of section 72. In determining the tax treatment of any such retirement benefits under section 72, no amount of the premiums used to purchase the group term insurance policy shall be taken into account, since such premiums, and the death benefits which they purchased, constitute a separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits.

# Example 7.
Assume the same facts as in example (6) except that, in lieu of funding the benefits in the manner described in that example, the trustee purchased individual retirement income contracts from an insurance company. Additional individual retirement income contracts are purchased in order to fund any increase in benefits resulting from increases in salary. Therefore, distributions to a particular employee may be attributable to a single retirement income contract or to more than one such contract. All distributions received by an employee under the pension plan, whether attributable to one or more retirement income contracts and whether made directly from the insurance company to the employee or made through the trustee, are considered as received under a single contract for purposes of section 72. For rules relating to the tax treatment of contributions and distributions under retirement income, endowment, or other life insurance contracts purchased by a trust described in section 401(a) and exempt under section 501(a), see paragraph (a) (2), (3), and (4) of § 1.402(a)-1.

# Example 8.
Assume the same facts as in example (6) except that, in lieu of funding the benefits in the manner described in that example, the trustee funded the death benefits and part of the retirement benefits by purchasing individual retirement income contracts from an insurance company. The remaining part of the retirement benefits (such as any increase in benefits resulting from increases in salary) are to be paid out of a separate investment fund. This pension
plan includes, with respect to each participant, two separate contracts for purposes of section 72. The retirement income contract purchased by the trust for each participant is a separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits and all distributions attributable to such contract (whether made directly from the insurance company to the employee or made through the trustee) are considered as received under a single contract. For rules relating to the tax treatment of contributions and distributions under retirement income, endowment, or other life insurance contracts purchased by a trust described in section 401(a) and exempt under section 501(a), see paragraph (a) (2), (3), and (4) of § 1.402(a)-1. The remaining distributions under the plan are considered as received under another separate program of interrelated contributions and benefits.
(b)
Amounts.
(1)(i) In general, the amounts to which section 72 applies are any amounts received under the contracts described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, if such amounts are specifically excluded from gross income under other provisions of Chapter 1 of the Code, section 72 shall not apply for the purpose of including such amounts in gross income. For example, section 72 does not apply to amounts received under a life insurance contract if such amounts are paid by reason of the death of the insured and are excludable from gross income under section 101(a). See also sections 101(d), relating to proceeds of life insurance paid at a date later than death, and 104(a)(4), relating to compensation for injuries or sickness.
(ii) Section 72 does not exclude from gross income any amounts received under an agreement to hold an amount and pay interest thereon. See paragraph (a) of § 1.72-14. However, section 72 does apply to amounts received by a surviving annuitant under a joint and survivor annuity contract since such amounts are not considered to be paid by reason of the death of an insured. For a special deduction for the estate tax attributable to the inclusion of the value of the interest of a surviving annuitant under a joint and survivor annuity contract in the estate of the deceased primary annuitant, see section 691(d) and the regulations thereunder.
(2) Amounts subject to section 72 in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph are considered “amounts received as an annuity” only in the event that all of the following tests are met:
(i) They must be received on or after the “annuity starting date” as that term is defined in paragraph (b) of § 1.72-4;
(ii) They must be payable in periodic installments at regular intervals (whether annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, weekly, or otherwise) over a period of more than one full year from the annuity starting date; and
(iii) Except as indicated in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, the total of the amounts payable must be determinable at the annuity starting date either directly from the terms of the contract or indirectly by the use of either mortality tables or compound interest computations, or both, in conjunction with such terms and in accordance with sound actuarial theory.
For the purpose of determining whether amounts subject to section 72(d) and § 1.72-13 are “amounts received as an annuity”, however, the provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be disregarded. In addition, the term “amounts received as an annuity” does not include amounts received to which the provisions of paragraph (b) or (c) of § 1.72-11 apply, relating to dividends and certain amounts received by a beneficiary in the nature of a refund. If an amount is to be paid periodically until a fund plus interest at a fixed rate is exhausted, but further payments may be made thereafter because of earnings at a higher interest rate, the requirements of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph are met with respect to the payments determinable at the outset by means of computations involving the fixed interest rate, but any payments received after the expiration of the period determinable by such computations shall be taxable as dividends received after the annuity starting date in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.72-11.
(3)(i) Notwithstanding the requirement of subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph, if amounts are to be received for a definite or determinable time (whether for a period certain or for a life or lives) under a contract which provides:
(
a
) That the amount of the periodic payments may vary in accordance with investment experience (as in certain profit-sharing plans), cost of living indices, or similar fluctuating criteria, or
(
b
) For specified payments the value of which may vary for income tax purposes, such as in the case of any annuity payable in foreign currency,
each such payment received shall be considered as an amount received as an annuity only to the extent that it does not exceed the amount computed by dividing the investment in the contract, as adjusted for any refund feature, by the number of periodic payments anticipated during the time that the periodic payments are to be made. If payments are to be made more frequently than annually, the amount so computed shall be multiplied by the number of periodic payments to be made during the taxable year for the purpose of determining the total amount which may be considered received as an annuity during such year. To this extent, the payments received shall be considered to represent a return of premium or other consideration paid and shall be excludable from gross income in the taxable year in which received. See paragraph (d) (2) and (3) of § 1.72-4. To the extent that the payments received under the contract during the taxable year exceed the total amount thus considered to be received as an annuity during such year, they shall be considered to be amounts not received as an annuity and shall be included in the gross income of the recipient. See section 72(e) and paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.72-11.
(ii) For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the number of periodic payments anticipated during the time payments are to be made shall be determined by multiplying the number of payments to be made each year (
a
) by the number of years payments are to be made, or (
b
) if payments are to be made for a life or lives, by the multiple found by the use of the appropriate tables contained in § 1.72-9, as adjusted in accordance with the table in paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.72-5.
(iii) For an example of the computation to be made in accordance with this subparagraph and a special election which may be made in a taxable year subsequent to a taxable year in which the total payments received under a contract described in this subparagraph are less than the total of the amounts excludable from gross income in such year under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, see paragraph (d)(3) of § 1.72-4.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6497, 25 FR 10019, Oct. 20, 1960; T.D. 6885, 31 FR 7798, June 2, 1966]
§ 1.72-3
Excludable amounts not income.
In general, amounts received under contracts described in paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.72-2 are not to be included in the income of the recipient to the extent that such amounts are excludable from gross income as the result of the application of section 72 and the regulations thereunder.
§ 1.72-4
Exclusion ratio.
(a)
General rule.
(1)(i) To determine the proportionate part of the total amount received each year as an annuity which is excludable from the gross income of a recipient in the taxable year of receipt (other than amounts received under (
a
) certain employee annuities described in section 72(d) and § 1.72-13, or (
b
) certain annuities described in section 72(o) and § 1.122-1), an exclusion ratio is to be determined for each contract. In general, this ratio is determined by dividing the investment in the contract as found under § 1.72-6 by the expected return under such contract as found under § 1.72-5. Where a single consideration is given for a particular contract which provides for two or more annuity elements, an exclusion ratio shall be determined for the contract as a whole by dividing the investment in such contract by the aggregate of the expected returns under all the annuity elements provided thereunder. However, where the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2 apply to payments received under such a contract, see paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-6. In the case of a contract to which § 1.72-6(d) (relating to contracts in which amounts were invested both before July 1, 1986, and after June 30, 1986) applies, the exclusion ratio for purposes of this paragraph (a) is determined in
accordance with § 1.72-6(d) and, in particular, § 1.72-6(d)(5)(i).
(ii) The exclusion ratio for the particular contract is then applied to the total amount received as an annuity during the taxable year by each recipient. See, however, paragraph (e)(3) of § 1.72-5. Any excess of the total amount received as an annuity during the taxable year over the amount determined by the application of the exclusion ratio to such total amount shall be included in the gross income of the recipient for the taxable year of receipt.
(2) The principles of subparagraph (1) may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Taxpayer A purchased an annuity contract providing for payments of $100 per month for a consideration of $12,650. Assuming that the expected return under this contract is $16,000 the exclusion ratio to be used by A is $12,650 ÷ 16,000; or 79.1 percent (79.06 rounded to the nearest tenth). If 12 such monthly payments are received by A during his taxable year, the total amount he may exclude from his gross income in such year is $949.20 ($1,200 × 79.1 percent).The balance of $250.80 ($1,200 less $949.20) is the amount to be included in gross income. If A instead received only five such payments during the year, he should exclude $395.50 (500 × 79.1 percent) of the total amounts received.
For examples of the computation of the exclusion ratio in cases where two annuity elements are acquired for a single consideration, see paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.72-6.
(3) The exclusion ratio shall be applied only to amounts received as an annuity within the meaning of that term under paragraph (b) (2) and (3) of § 1.72-2. Where the periodic payments increase in amount after the annuity starting date in a manner not provided by the terms of the contract at such date, the portion of such payments representing the increase is not an amount received as an annuity. For the treatment of amounts not received as an annuity, see section 72(e) and § 1.72-11. For special rules where paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2 applies to amounts received, see paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(4) After an exclusion ratio has been determined for a particular contract, it shall be applied to any amounts received as an annuity thereunder unless or until one of the following occurs:
(i) The contract is assigned or transferred for a valuable consideration (see section 72(g) and paragraph (a) of § 1.72-10);
(ii) The contract matures or is surrendered, redeemed, or discharged in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) or (d) of § 1.72-11;
(iii) The contract is exchanged (or is considered to have been exchanged) in a manner described in paragraph (e) of § 1.72-11.
(b)
Annuity starting date.
(1) Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, the annuity starting date is the first day of the first period for which an amount is received as an annuity, except that if such date was before January 1, 1954, then the annuity starting date is January 1, 1954. The first day of the first period for which an amount is received as an annuity shall be whichever of the following is the later:
(i) The date upon which the obligations under the contract became fixed, or
(ii) The first day of the period (year, half-year, quarter, month, or otherwise, depending on whether payments are to be made annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, or otherwise) which ends on the date of the first annuity payment.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the annuity starting date shall be determined in accordance with whichever of the following provisions is appropriate:
(i) In the case of a joint and survivor annuity contract described in section 72(i) and paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-5, the annuity starting date is January 1, 1954, or the first day of the first period for which an amount is received as an annuity by the surviving annuitant, whichever is the later;
(ii) In the case of the transfer of an annuity contract for a valuable consideration, as described in section 72(g) and paragraph (a) of § 1.72-10, the annuity starting date shall be January 1, 1954, or the first day of the first period for which the transferee received an amount as an annuity, whichever is the later;
(iii) If the provisions of paragraph (e) of § 1.72-11 apply to an exchange of one
contract for another, or to a transaction deemed to be such an exchange, the annuity starting date of the contract received (or deemed received) in exchange shall be January 1, 1954, or the first day of the first period for which an amount is received as an annuity under such contract, whichever is the later; and
(iv) In the case of an employee who has retired from work because of personal injuries or sickness, and who is receiving amounts under a plan that is a wage continuation plan under section 105(d) and § 1.105-4, the annuity starting date shall be the date the employee reaches mandatory retirement age, as defined in § 1.105-4(a)(3)(i)(B). (See also §§ 1.72-15 and 1.105-6 for transitional and other special rules.)
(c)
Fiscal year taxpayers.
Fiscal year taxpayers receiving amounts as annuities in a taxable year to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applies shall determine the annuity starting date in accordance with section 72(c)(4) and this section. The annuity starting date for fiscal year taxpayers receiving amounts as an annuity in a taxable year to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies shall be January 1, 1954, except where the first day of the first period for which an amount is received by such a taxpayer as an annuity is subsequent thereto and before the end of a fiscal year to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applied. In such case, the latter date shall be the annuity starting date. In all cases where a fiscal year taxpayer received an amount as an annuity in a taxable year to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applied and subsequent to the annuity starting date determined in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, such amount shall be disregarded for the purposes of section 72 and the regulations thereunder.
(d)
Exceptions to the general rule.
(1) Where the provisions of section 72 would otherwise require an exclusion ratio to be determined, but the investment in the contract (determined under § 1.72-6) is an amount of zero or less, no exclusion ratio shall be determined and all amounts received under such a contract shall be includible in the gross income of the recipient for the purposes of section 72.
(2) Where the investment in the contract is equal to or greater than the total expected return under such contract found under § 1.72-5, the exclusion ratio shall be considered to be 100 percent and all amounts received as an annuity under such contract shall be excludable from the recipient's gross income. See, for example, paragraph (f)(1) of § 1.72-5. In the case of a contract to which § 1.72-6(d) (relating to contracts in which amounts were invested both before July 1, 1986, and after June 30, 1986) applies, this paragraph (d)(2) is applied in the manner prescribed in § 1.72-6(d) and, in particular, § 1.72-6(d)(5)(ii).
(3)(i) If a contract provides for payments to be made to a taxpayer in the manner described in paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2, the investment in the contract shall be considered to be equal to the expected return under such contract and the resulting exclusion ratio (100%) shall be applied to all amounts received as an annuity under such contract. For any taxable year, payments received under such a contract shall be considered to be amounts received as an annuity only to the extent that they do not exceed the portion of the investment in the contract which is properly allocable to that year and hence excludable from gross income as a return of premiums or other consideration paid for the contract. The portion of the investment in the contract which is properly allocable to any taxable year shall be determined by dividing the investment in the contract (adjusted for any refund feature in the manner described in paragraph (d) of § 1.72-7) by the applicable multiple (whether for a term certain, life, or lives) which would otherwise be used in determining the expected return for such a contract under § 1.72-5. The multiple shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the table in paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.72-5, if any adjustment is necessary, before making the above computation. If payments are to be made more frequently than annually and the number of payments to be made in the taxable year in which the annuity begins are less than the number of payments to be made each
year thereafter, the amounts considered received as an annuity (as otherwise determined under this subdivision) shall not exceed, for such taxable year (including a short taxable year), an amount which bears the same ratio to the portion of the investment in the contract considered allocable to each taxable year as the number of payments to be made in the first year bears to the number of payments to be made in each succeeding year. Thus, if payments are to be made monthly, only seven payments will be made in the first taxable year, and the portion of the investment in the contract allocable to a full year of payments is $600, the amounts considered received as an annuity in the first taxable year cannot exceed $350 ($600 ×
7/12
). See subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for an example illustrating the determination of the portion of the investment in the contract allocable to one taxable year of the taxpayer.
(ii) If subdivision (i) of this subparagraph applies to amounts received by a taxpayer and the total amount of payments he receives in a taxable year is less than the total amount excludable for such year under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the taxpayer may elect, in a succeeding taxable year in which he receives another payment, to redetermine the amounts to be received as an annuity during the current and succeeding taxable years. This shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph except that:
(
a
) The difference between the portion of the investment in the contract allocable to a taxable year, as found in accordance with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, and the total payments actually received in the taxable year prior to the election shall be divided by the applicable life expectancy of the annuitant (or annuitants), found in accordance with the appropriate table in § 1.72-9 (and adjusted in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.72-5), or by the remaining term of a term certain annuity, computed as of the first day of the first period for which an amount is received as an annuity in the taxable year of the election; and
(
b
) The amount determined under (
a
) of this subdivision shall be added to the portion of the investment in the contract allocable to each taxable year (as otherwise found). To the extent that the total periodic payments received under the contract in the taxable year of the election or any succeeding taxable year does not equal this total sum, such payments shall be excludable from the gross income of the recipient. To the extent such payments exceed the sum so found, they shall be fully includible in the recipient's gross income. See subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for an example illustrating the redetermination of amounts to be received as an annuity and subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph for the method of making the election provided by this subdivision.
(iii) The application of the principles of paragraph (d)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Taxpayer A, a 64 year old male, files his return on a calendar year basis and has a life expectancy of 15.6 years on June 30, 1954, the annuity starting date of a contract to which § 1.72-2(b)(3) applies and which he purchased for $20,000. The contract provides for variable annual payments for his life. He receives a payment of $1,000 on June 30, 1955, but receives no other payment until June 30, 1957. He excludes the $1,000 payment from his gross income for the year 1955 since this amount is less than $1,324.50, the amount determined by dividing his investment in the contract ($20,000) by his life expectancy adjusted for annual payments, 15.1 (15.6−0.5), as of the original annuity starting date. Taxpayer A may elect, in his return for the taxable year 1957, to redetermine amounts to be received as an annuity under his contract as of June 30, 1956. For the purpose of determining the extent to which amounts received in 1957 or thereafter shall be considered amounts received as an annuity (to which a 100 percent exclusion ratio shall apply) he shall add $118.63 to the $1,324.50 originally determined to be receivable as an annuity under the contract, making a total of $1,443.13. This is determined by dividing the difference between what was excludable in 1955 and 1956, $2,649 (2 × $1,324.50) and what he actually received in those years ($1,000) by his life expectancy adjusted for annual payments, 13.9 (14.4−0.5), as of his age at his nearest birthday (66) on the first day of the first period for which he received an amount as an annuity in the taxable year of election (June 30, 1956). The result, $1,443.13, is excludable in that year and each year thereafter as an amount received as an annuity to which the 100% exclusion ratio applies. It will be
noted that in this example the taxpayer received amounts less than the excludable amounts in two successive years and deferred making his election until the third year, and thus was able to accumulate the portion of the investment in the contract allocable to each taxable year to the extent he failed to receive such portion in both years. Assuming that he received $1,500 in the taxable year of his election, he would include $56.87 in his gross income and exclude $1,443.13 therefrom for that year.
(iv) If the taxpayer chooses to make the election described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, he shall file with his return a statement that he elects to make a redetermination of the amounts excludable from gross income under his annuity contract in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of § 1.72-4. This statement shall also contain the following information:
(
a
) The original annuity starting date and his age on that date,
(
b
) The date of the first day of the first period for which he received an amount in the current taxable year,
(
c
) The investment in the contract originally determined (as adjusted for any refund feature), and
(
d
) The aggregate of all amounts received under the contract between the date indicated in (
a
) of this subdivision and the day after the date indicated in (
b
) of this subdivision to the extent such amounts were excludable from gross income.
He shall include in gross income any amounts received during the taxable year for which the return is made in accordance with the redetermination made under this subparagraph.
(v) In the case of a contract to which § 1.72-6(d) (relating to contracts in which amounts were invested both before July 1, 1986, and after June 30, 1986) applies, this paragraph (d)(3) is applied in the manner prescribed in § 1.72-6(d) and, in particular, § 1.72-6(d)(5)(iii). This application may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
B, a male calendar year taxpayer, purchases a contract which provides for variable annual payments for life and to which § 1.72-2(b)(3) applies. The annuity starting date of the contract is June 30, 1990, when B is 64 years old. B receives a payment of $1,000 on June 30, 1991, but receives no other payment until June 30, 1993. B's total investment in the contract is $25,000. B's pre-July 1986 investment in the contract is $12,000. If B makes the election described in § 1.72-6(d)(6), separate computations are required to determine the amounts received as an annuity and excludable from gross income with respect to the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and the post-June 1986 investment in the contract. In the separate computations, B first determines the applicable portions of the total payment received which are allocable to the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and the post-June 1986 investment in the contract. The portion of the payment received allocable to the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract is $480 ($12,000/$25,000 × $1,000). The portion of the payment received allocable to the post-June 1986 investment in the contract is $520 ($13,000/$25,000 × $1,000).
Second, B determines the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and the post-June 1986 investment in the contract allocable to the taxable year by dividing the pre-July 1986 and post-June 1986 investments in the contract by the applicable life expectancy multiple. The life expectancy multiple applicable to pre-July 1986 investment in the contract is B's life expectancy as of the original annuity starting date adjusted for annual payments and is determined under Table I of § 1.72-9 [15.1 (15.6−0.5)]. The life expectancy multiple applicable to post-June 1986 investment in the contract is determined under Table V of § 1.72-9 (20.3 (20.8-0.5)). Thus, the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract allocable to each taxable year is $794.70 ($12,000 ÷ 15.1), and the post-June 1986 investment in the contract so allocable is $640.39 ($13,000 ÷ 20.3). Because the applicable portions of the total payment received in 1991 under the contract ($480 allocable to the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and $520 allocable to the post-June 1986 investment in the contract) are treated as amounts received as an annuity and are excludable from gross income to the extent they do not exceed the portion of the corresponding investment in the contract allocable to 1991 ($794.70 pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and $640.39 post-June 1986 investment in the contract), the entire amount of each applicable portion of the total payment is excludable from gross income. B may elect, in the return filed for taxable year 1993, to redetermine amounts to be received as an annuity under the contract as of June 30, 1992. The extent to which the amounts received in 1993 or thereafter shall be considered amounts received as an annuity is determined as follows:
Pre-July 1986 investment in the contract allocable to taxable years 1991 and 1992 ($794.70 × 2)
$1,589.40
Less: Portion of total payments allocable to pre-July 1986 investment in the contract actually received as an annuity in taxable years 1991 and 1992
480.00
1,109.40
Divided by: Life expectancy multiple applicable to pre-July 1986 investment in the contract for B, age 66 (14.4—0.5)
13.9
79.81
Plus: Amount originally determined with respect to pre-July 1986 investment in the contract
794.70
Pre-July 1986 amount
874.51
Post-June 1986 investment in the contract allocable to taxable years 1991 and 1992 ($640.39 × 2)
$1,280.78
Less: Portion of total payments allocable to post-June 1986 investment in the contract actually received as an annuity in taxable years 1991 and 1992
520.00
760.78
Divided by: Life expectancy multiple applicable to post-June 1986 investment in the contract for B, age 66 (19.2−0.5)
18.7
40.68
Plus: Amount originally determined with respect to post-June 1986 investment in the contract
640.39
Post-June 1986 amount
681.07
(vi) The method of making an election to perform the separate computations illustrated in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section is described in § 1.72-6(d)(6).
(e)
Exclusion ratio in the case of two or more annuity elements acquired for a single consideration.
(1)(i) Where two or more annuity elements are provided under a contract described in paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.72-2, an exclusion ratio shall be determined for the contract as a whole and applied to all amounts received as an annuity under any of the annuity elements. To obtain this ratio, the investment in the contract determined in accordance with § 1.72-6 shall be divided by the aggregate of the expected returns found with respect to each of the annuity elements in accordance with § 1.72-5. For this purpose, it is immaterial that payments under one or more of the annuity elements involved have not commenced at the time when an amount is first received as an annuity under one or more of the other annuity elements.
(ii) The exclusion ratio found under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph does not apply to:
(
a
) An annuity element payable to a surviving annuitant under a joint and survivor annuity contract to which section 72(i) and paragraphs (b)(3) and (e)(3) of § 1.72-5 apply, or to
(
b
) A contract under which one or more of the constituent annuity elements provides for payments described in paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2.
For rules with respect to a contract providing for annuity elements described in (
b
) of this subdivision, see subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(2) If one or more of the annuity elements under a contract described in paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.72-2 provides for payments to which paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2 applies:
(i) With respect to the annuity elements to which paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2 does not apply, an exclusion ratio shall be determined by dividing the portion of the investment in the entire contract which is properly allocable to all such elements (in the manner provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of § 1.72-6) by the aggregate of the expected returns thereunder and such ratio shall be applied in the manner described in subdivision (i) of subparagraph (1); and
(ii) With respect to the annuity elements to which paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2 does apply, the investment in the entire contract shall be reduced by the portion thereof found in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph and the resulting amount shall be used to determine the extent to which the aggregate of the payments received during the taxable year under all such elements is excludable from gross income. The amount so excludable shall be allocated to each recipient under such elements in the same ratio that the total of payments he receives each year bears to the total of the payments received by all such recipients during the year. The exclusion ratio with respect to the amounts so allocated shall be 100 percent. See paragraph (f)(2) of § 1.72-5 and paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-6.
(iii) In the case of a contract to which § 1.72-6(d) (relating to contracts in which amounts were invested both before July 1, 1986, and after June 30,
1986) applies, this paragraph (e) is applied in the manner prescribed in § 1.72-6(d) and, in particular, § 1.72-6(d)(5)(iv).
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7352, 40 FR 16663, Apr. 14, 1975; T.D. 8115, 51 FR 45691, Dec. 19, 1986; 52 FR 10223, Mar. 31, 1987]
§ 1.72-5
Expected return.
(a)
Expected return for but one life.
(1) If a contract to which section 72 applies provides that one annuitant is to receive a fixed monthly income for life, the expected return is determined by multiplying the total of the annuity payments to be received annually by the multiple shown in Table I or V (whichever is applicable) of § 1.72-9 under the age (as of the annuity starting date) and, if applicable, sex of the measuring life (usually the annuitant's). Thus, where a male purchases a contract before July 1, 1986, providing for an immediate annuity of $100 per month for his life and, as of the annuity starting date (in this case the date of purchase), the annuitant's age at his nearest birthday is 66, the expected return is computed as follows:
Monthly payment of $100 × 12 months equals annual payment of
$1,200
Multiple shown in Table I, male, age 66
14.4
Expected return (1,200 × 14.4)
17,280
If, however, the taxpayer had purchased the contract after June 30, 1986, the expected return would be $23,040, determined by multiplying 19.2 (multiple shown in Table V, age 66) by $1,200.
(2)(i) If payments are to be made quarterly, semiannually, or annually, an adjustment of the applicable multiple shown in Table I or V (whichever is applicable) may be required. A further adjustment may be required where the interval between the annuity starting date and the date of the first payment is less than the interval between future payments. Neither adjustment shall be made, however, if the payments are to be made more frequently than quarterly. The amount of the adjustment, if any, is to be found in accordance with the following table:
If the number of whole months from the annuity starting date to the first payment date is—
0-1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
And the payments under the contract are to be made:
Annually
+ 0.5
+ 0.4
+ 0.3
+ 0.2
+ 0.1
0
0
−0.1
−0.2
−0.3
−0.4
−0.5
Semiannually
+ .2
+ .1
0
0
−.1
−.2
Quarterly
+ .1
0
−.1
Thus, for a male, age 66, the multiple found in Table I, adjusted for quarterly payments the first of which is to be made one full month after the annuity starting date, is 14.5 (14.4 + 0.1); for semiannual payments the first of which is to be made six full months from the annuity starting date, the adjusted multiple is 14.2 (14.4−0.2); for annual payments the first of which is to be made one full month from the annuity starting date, the adjusted multiple is 14.9 (14.4 + 0.5). If the annuitant in the example shown in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph were to receive an annual payment of $1,200 commencing 12 full months after his annuity starting date, the amount of the expected return would be $16,680 ($1,200 × 13.9 [14.4−0.5]). Similarly, for an annuitant, age 50, the multiple found in Table V, adjusted for quarterly payments the first of which is to be made one full month after the annuity starting date, is 33.2 (33.1 + 0.1); for semiannual payments the first of which is to be made six full months from the annuity starting date, the adjusted multiple is 32.9 (33.1−0.2); for annual payments the first of which is to be made one full month from the annuity starting date, the adjusted multiple is 33.6 (33.1 + 0.5).
(ii) Notwithstanding the table in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, adjustments of multiples for early or
other than monthly payments determined prior to February 19, 1956, under the table prescribed in paragraph 1(b)(4) of T.D. 6118 (19 FR 9897, C.B. 1955-1, 699), approved December 30, 1954, need not be redetermined.
(3) If the contract provides for fixed payments to be made to an annuitant until death or until the expiration of a specified limited period, whichever occurs earlier, the expected return of such temporary life annuity is determined by multiplying the total of the annuity payments to be received annually by the multiple shown in Table IV or VIII (whichever is applicable) of § 1.72-9 for the age (as of the annuity starting date) and, if applicable, sex of the annuitant and the nearest whole number of years in the specified period. For example, if a male annuitant, age 60 (at his nearest birthday), is to receive $60 per month for five years or until he dies, whichever is earlier, and there is no post-June 1986, investment in the contract, the expected return under such a contract is $3,456, computed as follows:
Monthly payments of $60 × 12 months equals annual payment of
$720
Multiple shown in Table IV for male, age 60, for term of 5 years
4.8
Expected return for 5 year temporary life annuity of $720 per year ($720 × 4.8)
$3,456
If the annuitant purchased the same contract after June 30, 1986, the expected return under the contract would be $3,528, computed as follows:
Monthly payments of $60 × 12 months equals annual payment of
$720.00
Multiple shown in Table VIII for annuitant, age 60, for term of 5 years
4.9
Expected return for 5-year temporary life annuity of $720 per year ($720 × 4.9)
$3,528.00
The adjustment provided by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall not be made with respect to the multiple found in Table IV or VIII (whichever is applicable).
(4) If the contract provides for payments to be made to an annuitant for the annuitant's lifetime, but the amount of the annual payments is to be decreased after the expiration of a specified limited period, the expected return is computed by considering the contract as a combination of a whole life annuity for the smaller amount plus a temporary life annuity for an amount equal to the difference between the larger and the smaller amount. For example, if a male annuitant, age 60, is to receive $150 per month for five years or until his earlier death, and is to receive $90 per month for the remainder of his lifetime after such five years, the expected return is computed as if the annuitant's contract consisted of a whole life annuity for $90 per month plus a five year temporary life annuity of $60 per month. In such circumstances, the expected return if there is no post-June 1986 investment in the contract is computed as follows:
Monthly payments of $90 × 12 months equals annual payment of
$1,080
Multiple shown in Table I for male, age 60
18.2
Expected return for whole life annuity of $1,080 per year
$19,656
Expected return for 5-year temporary life annuity of $720 per year (as found in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (a))
$3,456
Total expected return
$23,112
If the annuitant purchased the same contract after June 30, 1986, the expected return would be $29,664, computed as follows:
Monthly payments of $90 × 12 months equals annual payment of
$1,080
Multiple shown in Table V for annuitant, age 60
24.2
Expected return for whole life annuity of $1,080 per year
$26,136
Plus: Expected return for 5-year temporary life annuity of $720 per year (as found in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (a))
$3,528
Total expected return
$29,664
If payments are to be made quarterly, semiannually, or annually, an appropriate adjustment of the multiple found in Table I or V (whichever is applicable) for the whole life annuity should be made in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(5) If the contract described in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph provided that the amount of the annual payments to the annuitant were to be increased (instead of decreased) after the expiration of a specified limited period, the expected return would be computed as if the annuitant's contract consisted of a whole life annuity for the larger amount minus a temporary life annuity for an amount equal to the difference between the larger and smaller amount. Thus, if the annuitant described in subparagraph
(4) of this paragraph were to receive $90 per month for five years or until his earlier death, and to receive $150 per month for the remainder of his lifetime after such five years, the expected return would be computed by subtracting the expected return under a five year temporary life annuity of $60 per month from the expected return under a whole life annuity of $150 per month. In such circumstances, the expected return if there is no post-June 1986 investment in the contract is computed as follows:
Monthly payments of $150 × 12 months equals annual payment of
$1,800
Multiple shown in Table 1 (male, age 60)
18.2
Expected return for annuity for whole life of $1,800 per year
$32,760
Less expected return for 5-year temporary life annuity of $720 per year (as found in subparagraph (3))
$3,456
Net expected return
$29,304
If the annuitant purchased the same contract after June 30, 1986, the expected return would be $40,032, computed as follows:
Monthly payments of $150 × 12 months equals annual payments of
$1,800
Multiple shown in Table V (age 60)
24.2
Expected return for annuity for whole life of $1,800 per year
$43,560
Less expected return for 5-year temporary life annuity of $720 per year (as found in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph (a))
$3,528
Net expected return
$40,032
If payments are to be made quarterly, semiannually, or annually, an appropriate adjustment of the multiple found in Table I or V (whichever is applicable) for the whole life annuity should be made in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(b)
Expected return under joint and survivor and joint annuities.
(1) In the case of a joint and survivor annuity contract involving two annuitants which provides the first annuitant with a fixed monthly income for life and, after the death of the first annuitant, provides an identical monthly income for life to a second annuitant, the expected return shall be determined by multiplying the total amount of the payments to be received annually by the multiple obtained from Table II or VI (whichever is applicable) of § 1.72-9 under the ages (as of the annuity starting date) and, if applicable, sexes of the living annuitants. For example, a husband purchases a joint and survivor annuity contract providing for payments of $100 per month for life and, after his death, for the same amount to his wife for the remainder of her life. As of the annuity starting date his age at his nearest birthday is 70 and that of his wife at her nearest birthday is 67. If there is no post-June 1986 investment in the contract, the expected return is computed as follows:
Monthly payments of $100 × 12 months equals annual payment of
$1,200
Multiple shown in Table II (male, age 70, female, age 67)
19.7
Expected return ($1,200 × 19.7)
$23,640
If the annuitants purchased the same contract after June 30, 1986, the expected return would be $26,400, computed as follows:
Monthly payments of $100 × 12 months equals annual payment of
$1,200
Multiple shown in Table VI (ages 70, 67)
22.0
Expected return ($1,200 × 22.0)
$26,400
If payments are to be made quarterly, semiannually, or annually, an appropriate adjustment of the multiple found in Table II or VI (whichever is applicable) should be made in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2) If a contract of the type described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph provides that a different (rather than an identical) monthly income is payable to the second annuitant, the expected return is computed in the following manner. The applicable multiple in Table II or VI (whichever is applicable) is first found as in the example in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. The multiple applicable to the first annuitant is then found in Table I or V (whichever is applicable) as though the contract were for a single life annuity. The multiple from Table I or V is then subtracted from the multiple obtained from Table II or VI and the resulting multiple is applied to the total payments to be received annually under the contract by the second annuitant. The result is the expected return with respect to the second annuitant. The portion of the expected return with respect to payments to be made during the first annuitant's life is then computed by applying the multiple
found in Table I or V to the total annual payments to be received by such annuitant under the contract. The expected returns with respect to each of the annuitants separately are then aggregated to obtain the expected return under the entire contract.

# Example 1.
A husband purchases a joint and survivor annuity providing for payments of $100 per month for his life and, after his death, payments to his wife of $50 per month for her life. As of the annuity starting date his age at his nearest birthday is 70 and that of his wife at her nearest birthday is 67. There is no post-June 1986 investment in the contract.

Portion of expected return, first annuitant ($1,200 × 12.1)
$14,520
Expected return under the contract
$19,080
The expected return thus found, $19,080, is to be used in computing the amount to be excluded from gross income. Thus, if the investment in the contract in this example is $14,310, the exclusion ratio is $14,310 ÷ $19,080; or 75 percent. The amount excludable from each monthly payment made to the husband is 75 percent of $100, or $75, and the remaining $25 of each payment received by him shall be included in his gross income. After the husband's death, the amount excludable by the second annuitant (the surviving wife) would be 75 percent of each monthly payment of $50, or $37.50, and the remaining $12.50 of each payment shall be included in her gross income.

# Example 2.
If the same contract were purchased after June 30, 1986, the expected return would be $22,800, computed as follows:
Multiple from Table VI (ages 70, 67)
22.0
Multiple from Table V (age 70)
16.0
Difference (multiple applicable to second annuitant)
6.0
Portion of expected return, second annuitant ($600 × 6.0)
$3,600
Plus: Portion of expected return, first annuitant ($1,200 × 16.0)
$19,200
Expected return under the contract
$22,800
If the investment in the contract is $14,310, the exclusion ratio is $14,310 ÷ $22,800, or 62.8 percent. Thus, the husband would exclude $62.80 of each $100 payment received by him. After his death, his wife would exclude 62.8 percent, or $31.40, of each $50 monthly payment.

# Example 3.
If amounts were invested in the same contract both before July 1, 1986, and after June 30, 1986, and the election described in § 1.72-6(d)(6) were made, two exclusion ratios would be determined pursuant to § 1.72-6(d). Assume that the husband's total investment in the contract is $14,310 and that $7,310 is the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract. The pre-July 1986 exclusion ratio would be $7,310 ÷ $19,080, or 38.3 percent. The post-June 1986 exclusion ratio would be $7,000 ÷ $22,800, or 30.7 percent. The husband would exclude $69.00 ($38.30 + $30.70) of the $100 monthly payment received by him. The remaining $31.00 would be included in his gross income. After the husband's death, the amount excludable by his wife would be $34.50 (38.3 percent of $50 plus 30.7 percent of $50). The remaining $15.50 would be included in gross income.
The same method is used if the payments are to be increased after the death of the first annuitant. Thus, if the payments to be made until the husband's death were $50 per month and his widow were to receive $100 per month thereafter until her death, the 7.6 multiple in example (1) above would be applied to the $100 payments, yielding an expected return with respect to this portion of the annuity contract of $9,120 ($1,200 × 7.6). An expected return of $7,260 ($600 × 12.1) would be obtained with respect to the payments to be made to the husband, yielding a total expected return under the contract of $16,380 ($9,120 plus $7,260). If payments are to be made quarterly, semiannually, or annually, an appropriate adjustment of the multiples found in Tables I and II or Tables V and VI (whichever are applicable) should be made in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(3) In the case of a joint and survivor annuity contract in respect of which the first annuitant died in 1951, 1952, or 1953, and the basis of the surviving annuitant's interest in the contract was determinable under section 113(a)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, such basis shall be considered the “aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid” by the surviving annuitant for the contract. (For rules governing this determination, see 26 CFR (1939) 39.22(b)(2)-2 and 39.113(a)(5)-1 (Regulations 118).) In determining such an annuitant's investment in the contract, such aggregate shall be reduced by any amounts received under the contract
by the surviving annuitant before the annuity starting date, to the extent such amounts were excludable from his gross income at the time of receipt. The expected return of the surviving annuitant in such cases shall be determined in the manner prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, as though the surviving annuitant alone were involved. For this purpose, the appropriate multiple for the survivor shall be obtained from Table I as of the annuity starting date determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of § 1.72-4.
(4) If a contract involving two annuitants provides for fixed monthly payments to be made as a joint life annuity until the death of the first annuitant to die (in other words, only as long as both remain alive), the expected return under such contract shall be determined by multiplying the total of the annuity payments to be received annually under the contract by the multiple obtained from Table IIA or VIA (whichever is applicable) of § 1.72-9 under the ages (as of the annuity starting date) and, if applicable, sexes of the annuitants. If, however, payments are to be made under the contract quarterly, semiannually, or annually, an appropriate adjustment of the multiple found in Table IIA or VIA shall be made in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(5) If a joint and survivor annuity contract involving two annuitants provides that a specified amount shall be paid during their joint lives and a different specified amount shall be paid to the survivor upon the death of whichever of the annuitants is the first to die, the following preliminary computation shall be made in all cases preparatory to determining the expected return under the contract:
(i) From Table II or VI (whichever is applicable), obtain the multiple under both of the annuitants' ages (as of the annuity starting date) and, if applicable, their appropriate sexes;
(ii) From Table IIA or VIA (whichever is applicable), obtain the multiple applicable to both annuitants' ages (as of the annuity starting date) and, if applicable, their appropriate sexes;
(iii) Apply the multiple found in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph to the total of the amounts to be received annually after the death of the first to die; and
(iv) Apply the multiple found in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph to the difference between the total of the amounts to be received annually before and the total of the amounts to be received annually after the death of the first to die.
If the original annual payment is in excess of the annual payment to be made after the death of the first to die, the expected return is the sum of the amounts determined under subdivisions (iii) and (iv) of this subparagraph. This may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A husband purchases a joint and survivor annuity providing for payments of $100 a month for as long as both he and his wife live, and, after the death of the first to die, payments to the survivor of $75 a month for life. As of the annuity starting date, his age at his nearest birthday is 70 and that of his wife at her nearest birthday is 67. If there is no post-June 1986 investment in the contract, the expected return under the contract is computed as follows:
Multiple from Table II (male age 70, female age 67)
19.7
Multiple from Table IIA (male age 70, female age 67)
9.3
Portion of expected return ($900 × 19.7—sum per year after first death)
$17,730
Plus: Portion of expected return ($300 × 9.3—amount of change in sum at first death)
$2,790
Expected return under the contract
$20,520
The total expected return in this example, $20,520, is to be used in computing the amount to be excluded from gross income. Thus, if the investment in the contract is $17,887, the exclusion ratio is $17,887 ÷ $20,520, or 87.2 percent. The amount excludable from each monthly payment made while both are alive is 87.2 percent of $100, or $87.20, and the remaining $12.80 of each payment shall be included in gross income. After the death of the first to die, the amount excludable by the survivor shall be 87.2 percent of each monthly payment of $75, or $65.40, and the remaining $9.60 of each payment shall be included in gross income.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that the contract is purchased after June 30, 1986.
The expected return under the contract is computed as follows:
Multiple from Table VI (ages 70, 67)
22.0
Multiple from Table VIA (ages 70, 67)
12.4
Portion of expected return ($900 × 22.0—sum per year after first death)
$19,800
Plus: Portion of expected return ($300 × 12.4—amount of change in sum at first death)
$3,720
Expected return under the contract
$23,520
Thus, if the investment in the contract is $17,887, the exclusion ratio is $17,887 ÷ $23,520, or 76.1 percent. The amount excludable from each monthly payment made while both are alive would be 76.1 percent of $100, or $76.10, and the remaining $23.90 of each payment would be included in gross income. After the death of the first to die, the amount excludable by the survivor would be 76.1 percent of each monthly payment of $75, or $57.08, and the remaining $17.92 of each payment would be included in gross income.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in examples (1) and (2), except that the total investment in the contract is $17,887, and that the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract is $8,000. Assume also that one of the annuitants makes the election described in § 1.72-6(d)(6). Separate computations shall be performed pursuant to § 1.72-6(d) to determine the amount excludable from gross income. The pre-July 1986 exclusion ratio would be $8,000 ÷ $20,520, or 39 percent. The post-June 1986 exclusion ratio would be $9,887 ÷ $23,520, or 42 percent. The amount excludable from each monthly payment made while both are alive would be $81 ((.39 × 100) + (.42 × 100)), and the remaining $19 would be included in gross income. After the death of the first to die, the amount excludable by the survivor would be $60.75 ((.39 × 75) + (.42 × 75)), and the remaining $14.25 would be included in gross income.
If the original annual payment is less than the annual payment to be made after the death of the first to die, the expected return is the difference between the amounts determined under subdivisions (iii) and (iv) of this subparagraph. If, however, payments are to be made quarterly, semiannually, or annually under the contract, the multiples obtained from both Tables II and IIA or Tables VI and VIA (whichever are applicable) shall first be adjusted in a manner prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(6) If a contract provides for the payment of life annuities to two persons during their respective lives and, after the death of one (without regard to which one dies first), provides that the survivor shall receive for life both his own annuity payments and the payments made formerly to the deceased person, the expected return shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
(7) If paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2 applies to payments provided under a contract and this paragraph applies to such payments, the principles of this paragraph shall be used in making the computations described in paragraph (d)(3) of § 1.72-4. This may be illustrated by the following examples, examples (1) through (3) of which assume that there is no post-June 1986 investment in the contract:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A, a male age 63, pays $24,000 for a contract which provides that the proceeds (both income and return of capital) from eight units of an investment fund shall be paid monthly to him for his life and that after his death the proceeds from six such units shall be paid monthly to B, a female age 55, for her life. The portion of the investment in the contract allocable to each taxable year of A is $955.20 and that allocable to each taxable year of B is $716.40. This is determined in the following manner:
Multiple from Table II (male, age 63, and female, age 55)
28.1
Number of units to be paid, in effect, as a joint and survivor annuity
× 6
Number of total annual unit payments anticipatable with respect to the joint and survivor annuity element
168.6
Multiple from Table I (male, age 63)
16.2
Number of units to be paid, in effect, as a single life annuity
× 2
Number of total annual unit payments anticipatable with respect to A alone
32.4
Total number of unit payments anticipatable
201
Portion of investment in the contract allocable to unit payments ($24,000 ÷ 201) on an annual basis
$119.40
Number of units payable to A while he continues to live
× 8
Portion of the investment in the contract allocable to each taxable year of A
$955.20
Portion of investment in the contract allocable to unit payments ($24,000 ÷ 201) on an annual basis
$119.40
Number of units payable to B for her life after A's death
× 6
Portion of the investment in the contract allocable to each taxable year of B
$716.40
For the purpose of the above computation it is immaterial whether or not A lives to or beyond the life expectancy shown for him in Table I.

# Example 2.
Assume that Taxpayer A in example (1) receives payments for five years which are at least as large as the portion of
the investment in the contract allocable to such years, but in the sixth year he receives a total of only $626.40 rather than the $955.20 allocable to such year. A is 69 and B is 61 at the beginning of the first monthly period for which an amount is payable in the seventh taxable year. A makes the election in that year provided under paragraph (d)(3) of § 1.72-4. The difference between the portion of the investment in the contract allocable to the sixth year and the amount actually received in that year is $328.80 ($955.20 less $626.40). In this case, 139.2 unit payments are anticipatable (on an annual basis), since the appropriate multiple from Table II of § 1.72-9, 23.2, multiplied by the number of units payable, in effect, as a joint and survivor annuity yields this result (6 × 23.2). A's appropriate multiple from Table I of § 1.72-9 for the two units which will cease to be paid at his death is 12.6, and the total number of unit payments anticipatable (on an annual basis) is, therefore, 164.4 (2 × 12.6 plus 139.2). Dividing the difference previously found ($328.80) by the total number of unit payments thus determined (164.4) indicates that A will have an additional allocation of the investment in the contract of $16 to the seventh and every succeeding full taxable year (8 units × $2), and B will have an additional allocation of the investment in the contract of $12 (6 units × $2) to each taxable year in which she receives 12 monthly payments subsequent to the death of A. The total allocable to each taxable year of A is, therefore, $971.20, and that allocable to each taxable year of B will be $728.40.

# Example 3.
If, in example (2), A had died at the end of the fifth year, in the sixth year B would have received a payment of $469.80 (that portion of the $626.40 that A would have received which is in the same ratio that 6 units bear to 8 units) and would thus have received $246.60 less than the portion of the investment in the contract originally determined to be allocable to each of her taxable years. In these circumstances, B would be entitled to elect to redetermine the portion of the investment in the contract allocable to the taxable year of election and all subsequent years. The new amount allocable thereto would be found by dividing the $246.60 difference by her life expectancy as of the first day of the first period for which she received an amount as an annuity in the seventh year of the annuity contract, and adding the result to her originally determined allocation of $716.40.

# Example 4.
On July 1, 1986, Taxpayer C, age 60, pays $28,000 for a contract which provides that the proceeds (both income and return of capital) from 10 units of an investment fund shall be paid monthly to C for C's life and that after C's death the proceeds from 4 such units shall be paid monthly to D, age 57, for D's life. The portion of the investment in the contract allocable to each taxable year of C is $1,037.00 and that allocable to each taxable year of D is $414.80. This is determined as follows:
Multiple from Table VI (ages 60, 57)
31.2
Number of units to be paid, in effect, as a joint and survivor annuity
× 4
Number of total annual unit payments anticipatable with respect to the joint and survivor annuity element
124.8
Multiple from Table V (age 60)
24.2
Number of units to be paid, in effect, as a single life annuity
× 6
Number of total annual unit payments anticipatable with respect to C alone
145.2
Total number of unit payments anticipatable
270
Portion of investment in the contract allocable to unit payments ($28,000 ÷ 270) on an annual basis

× 10
Portion of the investment in the contract allocable to each taxable year of C
$1,037.00
Portion of investment in the contract allocable to unit payments ($28,000 ÷ 270) on an annual basis
$103.70
Number of units payable to D for D's life after C's death
× 4
Portion of the investment in the contract allocable to each taxable year of D
$414.80
For purposes of the above computation it is immaterial whether or not C lives to or beyond the life expectancy shown in Table V.

# Example 5.
Assume the same facts as in example (4), except that C's total investment in the contract is $28,000, and C's pre-July 1986 investment in the contract is $16,000. If C makes the election described in § 1.72-6(d)(6), separate computations are required to determine the amount excludable from gross income with respect to the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and the post-June 1986 investment in the contract. The annuitant shall apply the appropriate pre-July 1986 and post-June 1986 life expectancy multiples to the applicable portions of the units to be paid as a joint and survivor annuity, and as a single life annuity.
Pre-July 1986 Computation (all references to unit payments are to the pre-July 1986 applicable portion of such payments):

$469.22

# Example 6.
Assume that taxpayer C in example (4) receives payments for four years which are at least as large as the portion of the investment in the contract allocable to such years, but in the fifth year receives a total of only $600 rather than the $1,037 allocable to such year. C is 65 and D is 62 at the beginning of the first monthly period for which an amount is payable in the sixth taxable year. C makes the election in that year provided under paragraph (d)(3) of § 1.72-4. The difference between the portion of the investment in the contract allocable to the fifth year and the amount actually received in that year is $437 ($1,037−$600). In this case, 106 unit payments are anticipatable with respect to the joint and survivor annuity element, since the appropriate multiple from Table VI of § 1.72-9, 26.5, multiplied by the number of units payable, in effect, as a joint and survivor annuity yields this result (4 × 26.0). C's appropriate multiple from Table V of § 1.72-9 for the six units which will cease to be paid at C's death is 20.0, and the number of unit payments anticipatable with respect to C alone is 120 (6 × 20). The total number of unit payments anticipatable is, therefore, 226 (120 plus 106). Dividing the difference previously found ($437) by the total number of unit payments thus determined (226) indicates that C will have an additional allocation of the investment in the contract of $19.30 to the sixth and every succeeding full taxable year (10 units × $1.93), and D will have an additional allocation of the investment in the contract of $7.72 (4 units × $1.93) to each taxable year in which D receives 12 monthly payments subsequent to the death of C. The total allocable to each taxable year of C is, therefore, $1,056.30, and that allocable to each taxable year of D will be $422.52.

# Example 7.
If, in example (6), C had died at the end of the fourth year, in the fifth year D would have received a payment of $240 (that portion of the $600 that C would have received which is in the same ratio that 4 units bear to 10 units) and would thus have received $174.80 less than the portion of the investment in the contract allocable to each of D's taxable years. In these circumstances, D would be entitled to elect to redetermine the portion of the investment in the contract allocable to the taxable year of election and all subsequent years. The new amount allocable thereto would be found by dividing the $174.80 difference by D's life expectancy as of the first day of the first period for which D received an amount as an annuity in the sixth year of the annuity contract, and adding the result to D's originally determined allocation of $414.80.
(c)
Expected return for term certain.
In the case of a contract providing for specific periodic payments which are to be paid for a term certain such as a
fixed number of months or years, without regard to life expectancy, the expected return is determined by multiplying the fixed number of years or months for which payments are to be made on or after the annuity starting date by the amount of the payment provided in the contract for each such period.
(d)
Expected return with respect to amount certain.
In the case of contracts involving no life or lives as a measurement of their duration, but under which a determinable total amount is to be paid in installments of lesser amounts paid at periodic intervals, the expected return shall be the total amount guaranteed. If an amount is to be paid periodically until a fund plus interest at a fixed rate is exhausted, but further payments may be made thereafter because of earnings at a higher interest rate, this paragraph shall apply to the total amount anticipatable as a result of the amount of the fund plus the fixed interest thereon. Any amount which may be paid as the result of earnings at a greater interest rate shall be disregarded in determining the expected return. If such an amount is later received, it shall be considered an amount not received as an annuity after the annuity starting date. See paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.72-11.
(e)
Expected return where two or more annuity elements providing for fixed payments are acquired for a single consideration.
(1) In the case of a contract described in paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.72-2, which provides for specified payments to be made under two or more annuity elements, the expected return shall be found for the contract as a whole by aggregating the expected returns found with respect to each annuity element. If individual life annuity elements are involved (including joint and survivor annuities where the primary annuitant died before January 1, 1954) the expected return for each of them shall be determined in the manner prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section. If joint and survivor annuity elements are involved, the expected return for such elements shall be determined under the appropriate subparagraph of paragraph (b) of this section. If terms certain or amounts certain are involved, the expected returns for such elements shall be determined under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, respectively.
(2) The aggregate expected return found in accordance with the rules set forth in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall constitute the expected return for the contract as a whole. The investment in the contract shall be divided by the amount thus determined to obtain the exclusion ratio for the contract as a whole, This exclusion ratio shall be applied to all amounts received as an annuity under the contract by any recipient (in accordance with the provisions of § 1.72-4), except in the case of amounts received by a surviving annuitant under a joint and survivor annuity element to which the provisions of section 72(i) and paragraph (b)(3) of this section would apply if it were a separate contract. See subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(3) In the case of a contract providing two or more annuity elements, one of which is a joint and survivor annuity element of the type described in section 72(i) and paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the general exclusion ratio for the contract as a whole, for the purpose of computations with respect to all the other annuity elements shall be determined in accordance with the principles of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph. A special exclusion ratio shall thereafter be determined for the surviving annuitant receiving payments under the annuity element described in section 72(i) and paragraph (b)(3) of this section by using the investment in the contract and the expected return determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(4) In the case of a contract providing for payments to be made to two persons in the manner described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, the expected return is to be computed as though there were two joint and survivor annuities under the same contract, in the following manner. First, the multiple appropriate to the ages (as of the annuity starting date) and, if applicable, sexes of the annuitants involved shall be found in Table II or VI (whichever is applicable) of § 1.72-9 and adjusted, if necessary, in the manner described in paragraph (a)(2) of this
section. Second, the multiple so found shall be applied to the sum of the payments to be made each year to both annuitants. The result is the expected return for the contract as a whole.
(5) For rules relating to expected return where two or more annuity elements are acquired for a single consideration and one or more of such elements does not specify a fixed payment for each period, see paragraph (f) of this section.
(f)
Expected return with respect to obligations providing for payments described in paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2.
(1) If a contract to which section 72 applies provides only for payments to be made in a manner described in paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2, the expected return for such contract as a whole shall be an amount equal to the investment in the contract found in accordance with section 72(c)(1) and § 1.72-6, as adjusted for any refund feature in accordance with § 1.72-7.
(2) If a contract to which section 72 applies provides for annuity elements, one or more of which (but not all) provide for payments to be made in a manner described in paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2:
(i) With respect to the portion of the contract providing for annuity elements to which paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2 does not apply, the expected return shall be the aggregate of the expected returns found for each of such elements in accordance with the appropriate paragraph of this section; and
(ii) With respect to all annuity elements to which paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2 does apply, the expected return for all such elements shall be an amount equal to the portion of the investment in the contract allocable to such elements in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of § 1.72-4 and paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(
b
) of § 1.72-6.
(g)
Expected return with respect to contracts subject to § 1.72-6(d).
In the case of a contract to which § 1.72-6(d) (relating to contracts in which amounts were invested both before July 1, 1986, and after June 30, 1986) applies, an expected return is computed using the multiples in Tables I through IV of § 1.72-9 with respect to the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and a second expected return is computed using the multiples in Tables V through VIII of § 1.72-9 with respect to the post-June 1986 investment in the contract.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 21, 1960, as amended by T.D. 8115, 51 FR 45694, Dec. 19, 1986]
§ 1.72-6
Investment in the contract.
(a)
General rule.
(1) For the purpose of computing the “investment in the contract”, it is first necessary to determine the “aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid” for such contract. See section 72(c)(1). This determination is made as of the later of the annuity starting date of the contract or the date on which an amount is first received thereunder as an annuity. The amount so found is then reduced by the sum of the following amounts in order to find the investment in the contract:
(i) The total amount of any return of premiums or dividends received (including unrepaid loans or dividends applied against the principal or interest on such loans) on or before the date on which the foregoing determination is made, and
(ii) The total of any other amounts received with respect to the contract on or before such date which were excludable from the gross income of the recipient under the income tax law applicable at the time of receipt.
Amounts to which subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph applies shall include, for example, amounts considered to be return of premiums or other consideration paid under section 22(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and amounts considered to be an employer-provided death benefit under section 22(b)(1)(B) of such Code. For rules relating to the extent to which an employee or his beneficiary may include employer contributions in the aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid, see § 1.72-8. If the aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid for the contract includes amounts for which deductions were allowed under section 404 as contributions on behalf of a self-employed individual, such amounts shall not be included in the investment in the contract.
(2) For the purpose of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, amounts received subsequent to the receipt of an amount as an annuity or subsequent to the annuity starting date, whichever is the later, shall be disregarded. See, however, § 1.72-11.
(3) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 1950, B purchased an annuity contract for $10,000 which was to provide him with an annuity of $1,000 per year for life. He received $1,000 in each of the years 1950, 1951, 1952, and 1953, prior to the annuity starting date (January 1, 1954). Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, $300 of each of these payments (3 percent of $10,000) was includible in his gross income, and the remaining $700 was excludable therefrom during each of the taxable years mentioned. In computing B's investment in the contract as of January 1, 1954, the total amount excludable from his gross income during the years 1950 through 1953 ($2,800) must be subtracted from the consideration paid ($10,000). Accordingly, B's investment in the contract as of January 1, 1954, is $7,200 ($10,000 less $2,800).

# Example 2.
In 1945, C contracted for an annuity to be paid to him beginning December 31, 1960. In 1945 and in each successive year until 1960, he paid a premium of $5,000. Assuming he receives no payments of any kind under the contract until the date on which he receives the first annual payment as an annuity (December 31, 1960), his investment in the contract as of the annuity starting date (December 31, 1959) will be $75,000 ($5,000 paid each year for the 15 years from 1945 to 1959, inclusive).

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (2), except that prior to the annuity starting date C has already received from the insurer dividends of $1,000 each in 1949, 1954, and 1959, such dividends not being includible in his gross income in any of those years. C's investment in the contract, as of the annuity starting date, will then be $72,000 ($75,000-$3,000).
(b)
Allocation of the investment in the contract where two or more annuity elements are acquired for a single consideration.
(1) In the case of a contract described in § 1.72-2(a)(2) which provides for two or more annuity elements, the investment in the contract determined under paragraph (a) shall be allocated to each of the annuity elements in the ratio that the expected return under each annuity element bears to the aggregate of the expected returns under all the annuity elements. The exclusion ratio for the contract as a whole shall be determined by dividing the investment in the contract (after adjustment for the present value of any or all refund features) by the aggregate of the expected returns under all the annuity elements. This may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
If a contract provides for annuity payments of $1,000 per year for life (with no refund feature) to both A and B, a male and female, respectively, each 70 years of age as of the annuity starting date, such contract is acquired for consideration of $19,575 (without regard to whether paid by A, B, or both), and there is no post-June 1986 investment in the contract, the investment in the contract shall be allocated by determining the exclusion ratio for the contract as a whole in the following manner:
Expectancy of A under Table I and § 1.72-5(a)(2), 11.6 (12.1-0.5), multiplied by $1,000
$11,600
Plus: Expectancy of B computed in a similar manner ($1,000 × 14.5 [15.0−0.5])
14,500
Total expected return
26,100
The exclusion ratio for both A and B is then $19,575 ÷ $26,100, or 75 percent. A and B shall each exclude from gross income three-fourths ($750) of each $1,000 annual payment received and shall include the remaining one-fourth ($250) of each $1,000 annual payment received in gross income.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that of the total investment in the contract of $19,575, the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract is $10,000. If the election described in § 1.72-6(d)(6) is made with respect to the contract, the investment in the contract shall be allocated by determining an exclusion ratio for the contract as a whole based on separately computed exclusion ratios with respect to the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and the post-June 1986 investment in the contract in the following manner:
Expectancy of A under Table I and § 1.72-5(a)(2), 11.6 (12.1-0.5), multiplied by $1,000
$11,600
Plus: Expectancy of B under Table I and § 1.72-5(a)(2), 14.5 (15.0-0.5), multiplied by $1,000
$14,500
Pre-July 1986 expected return
$26,100
Expectancy of A under Table V and § 1.72-5(a)(2), 15.5 (16.0-0.5), multiplied by $1,000
$15,500
Plus: Expectancy of B under Table V and § 1.72-5(a)(2), 15.5 (16.0-0.5), multiplied by $1,000
$15,500
Post-June 1986 expected return
$31,000
Pre-July 1986 exclusion ratio ($10,000 ÷ $26,100)
38.3
Post-June 1986 exclusion ratio ($9,575 ÷ 31,000)
30.9
A and B shall each exclude from gross income $692 (38.3 percent of $1,000 + 30.9 percent of $1,000) of each $1,000 payment and include the remaining $308 in gross income
(2) In the case of a contract providing for specified annual annuity payments
to be made to two persons during their joint lives and the payment of the aggregate of the two individual payments to the survivor for his life, the investment in the contract shall be allocated in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. For this purpose, the investment in the contract (without regard to the fact that differing amounts may have been contributed by the two annuitants) shall be divided by the expected return determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(4) of § 1.72-5. The resulting exclusion ratio shall then be applied to any amounts received as an annuity by either annuitant.
(3) In the case of a contract providing two or more annuity elements, one or more of which provides for payments to be made in a manner described in paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2, the investment in the contract shall be allocated to the various annuity elements in the following manner.
(i) If all the annuity elements provide for payments to be made in the manner described in paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2, the investment in the contract shall be allocated on the basis of the amounts received by each recipient by apportioning the amount determined to be excludable under that section to each recipient in the same ratio as the total of the amounts received by him in the taxable year bears to the total of the amounts received by all recipients during the same period; and
(ii) If one or more, but not all, of the annuity elements provide for payments to be made in a manner described in paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2:
(
a
) With respect to all annuity elements to which that section does not apply, the investment in the contract for all such elements shall be the portion of the investment in the contract as a whole (found in accordance with the provisions of this section) which is properly allocable to all such elements; and
(
b
) With respect to all annuity elements to which paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2 does apply, the investment in the contract for all such elements shall be the investment in the contract as a whole (found in accordance with the provisions of this section) as reduced by the portion thereof determined under (
a
) of this subdivision.
For the purpose of determining, pursuant to (
a
) of this subdivision, the portion of the investment in the contract as a whole properly allocable to a particular annuity element, reference shall be made to the present value of such annuity element determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iii) (
b
) of § 1.101-2.
(iii) In the case of a contract to which paragraph (d) of this section applies, this paragraph (b) is applied in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d) and, in particular, paragraph (d)(5)(v) of this section.
(c)
Special rules.
(1) For the special rule for determining the investment in the contract for a surviving annuitant in cases where the prior annuitant of a joint and survivor annuity contract died in 1951, 1952, or 1953, see paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-5.
(2) For special rules relating to the determination of the investment in the contract where employer contributions are involved, see § 1.72-8. See also paragraph (b) of § 1.72-16 for a special rule relating to the determination of the premiums or other consideration paid for a contract where an employee is taxable on the premiums paid for life insurance protection that is purchased by and considered to be a distribution from an exempt employees' trust.
(3) For the determination of an adjustment in investment in the contract in cases where a contract contains a refund feature, see § 1.72-7.
(4) In the case of “face-amount certificates” described in section 72(1), the amount of consideration paid for purposes of computing the investment in the contract shall include any amount added to the holder's basis by reason of section 1232(a)(3)(E) (relating to basis adjustment for amount of original issue discount ratably included in gross income as interest under section 1232(a)(3)).
(d)
Pre-July 1986 and post-June 1986 investment in the contract.
(1) This paragraph (d) applies to an annuity contract if:
(i) The investment in the contract includes a pre-July 1986 investment in
the contract and a post-June 1986 investment in the contract (both as defined in § 1.72-6(d)(3));
(ii) The use of a multiple found in Tables I through VIII of § 1.72-9 is required to determine the expected return under the contract; and
(iii) The election described in paragraph (d)(6) of this section is made with respect to the contract.
(2) In the case of annuity contract to which this paragraph (d) applies—
(i) All computations required to determine the amount excludable from gross income shall be performed separately with respect to the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and the post-June 1986 investment in the contract as if each such amount were the entire investment in the contract;
(ii) The multiples in Tables I through IV shall be used for computations involving the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and the multiples in Tables V through VIII shall be used for computations involving the post-June 1986 investment in the contract; and
(iii) The amount excludable from gross income shall be the sum of the amounts determined under the separate computations required by paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.
(3) For purposes of the regulations under section 72, the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and post-June 1986 investment in the contract are determined in accordance with the following rules:
(i)(A) Except as provided in § 1.72-9, if the annuity starting date of the contract occurs before July 1, 1986, the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract is the total investment in the contract as of the annuity starting date;
(B) Except as provided in § 1.72-9, if the annuity starting date of the contract occurs after June 30, 1986, and the contract does not provide for a disqualifying form of payment or settlement, the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract is the investment in the contract computed as of June 30, 1986, as if June 30, 1986, had been the later of the annuity starting date of the contract or the date on which an amount is first received thereunder as an annuity;
(C) If the annuity starting date of the contract occurs after June 30, 1986, and the contract provides, at the option of the annuitant or of any other person (including, in the case of an employee's annuity, an option exercisable only by, or with the consent of, the employer), for a disqualifying form of payment or settlement, the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract is zero (
i.e.
, the total investment in the contract is post-June 1986 investment in the contract).
(ii) The post-June 1986 investment in the contract is the amount by which the total investment in the contract as of the annuity starting date exceeds the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract.
(iii) For purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, a disqualifying form of payment or settlement is any form of payment or settlement (whether or not selected) that permits the receipt of amounts under the contract in a form other than a life annuity. For example, each of the following options provides for a disqualifying form of payment or settlement:
(A) An option to receive a lump sum in full discharge of the obligation under the contract.
(B) An option to receive an amount under the contract after June 30, 1986, and before the annuity starting date.
(C) An option to receive an annuity for a period certain.
(D) An option to receive payments under a refund feature (within the meaning of paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 1.72-7) that is substantially equivalent to an annuity for a period certain.
(E) An option to receive a temporary life annuity (within the meaning of § 1.72-5 (a)(3)) that is substantially equivalent to an annuity for a period certain.
An option to receive alternative forms of life annuity is not a disqualifying option for purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. Thus, if the sole options provided under a contract are a single life annuity and a joint and survivor life annuity, paragraph (d)(3)(i) (C) of this section does not apply to such contract.
(iv) For purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, a refund feature is substantially equivalent to an
annuity for a period certain if its value determined under Table VII of § 1.72-9 exceeds 50 percent. Similarly, a temporary life annuity is substantially equivalent to an annuity for a period certain if the multiple determined under Table VIII of § 1.72-9 exceeds 50 percent of the maximum duration of the annuity.
(4) In any separate computation under this paragraph (d), only the applicable portion of other amounts (such as the total expected return under the contract, or the total amount guaranteed under the contract as of the annuity starting date) shall be taken into account if the use of the entire amount in such computation is inconsistent with the use in the computation of only a portion of the investment in the contract. For example, such use is generally inconsistent if the computation requires a comparison of the investment in the contract and such other amount for the purpose of using the greater (or lesser) amount or the difference between the two. For purposes of the first sentence of this paragraph (d)(4), the applicable portion is the amount that bears the same ratio to the entire amount as the pre-July 1986, investment in the contract or the post-June 1986 investment in the contract, whichever is applicable, bears to the total investment in the contract as of the annuity starting date.
(5)
Application to particular computations.
(i) In the case of a contract to which this paragraph (d) applies, the exclusion ratio for purposes of § 1.72-4 (a) is the sum of the exclusion ratios separately computed in accordance with this paragraph (d). The exclusion ratio with respect to the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract is determined by dividing the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract by the expected return as found under § 1.72-5 by applying the appropriate multiples of Tables I through IV of § 1.72-9. Similarly, the exclusion ratio with respect to the post-June 1986 investment in the contract is determined by dividing the post-June 1986 investment in the contract by the expected return as found under § 1.72-5 by applying the appropriate multiples in Tables V through VIII of § 1.72-9.
(ii) The applicability of § 1.72-4(d)(2) to a contract to which this paragraph (d) applies shall be determined separately with respect to the post-June 1986 investment in the contract and the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and in each such determination only the applicable portion of the total expected return under the contract shall be taken into account. If § 1.72-4(d)(2) applies with respect to either such investment in the contract, the separately computed exclusion ratio shall be considered to be the applicable portion of 100 percent.
(iii) If § 1.72-4(d)(3) applies to a contract to which this paragraph (d) applies—
(A) The applicable portions (as defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section) of payments received under the contract for a taxable year shall be separately computed;
(B) The pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and the post-June 1986 investment in the contract shall be separately allocated to the taxable year; and
(C) The separate applicable portions of the payments received under the contract for the taxable year shall be considered to be amounts received as an annuity (for which the exclusion ratio is 100 percent) only to the extent they do not exceed the portions of the corresponding investments in the contract which are properly allocable to that year.
See the example in § 1.72-4(d)(3)(v).
(iv) If § 1.72-4(e) applies to a contract to which this paragraph (d) applies, the exclusion ratio shall be separately computed with respect to the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and the post-June 1986 investment in the contract. For purposes of the separate computations under § 1.72-4(e)(2)(ii), only the applicable portion of payments received shall be taken into account and the exclusion ratio (100%) shall be applied to the separately computed portion allocated to each participant.
(v) If paragraph (b)(3) of this section applies to a contract to which this paragraph (d) applies, separate allocations are required with respect to the
pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and the post-June 1986 investment in the contract.
For purposes of the separate computations required to determine the portion of the investment in the contract properly allocable to a particular annuity element, only the applicable portion of the present value of the annuity element determined in accordance with § 1.101-2(e)(1)(iii)(b) is taken into account.
(vi) If § 1.72-7 applies to a contract to which this paragraph (d) applies, separate computations are required to determine the adjustment to the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and the post-June 1986 investment in the contract. For purposes of such separate computations, only the applicable portions of the amounts described in § 1.72-7 (b)(3)(ii), (c)(1)(ii)(B), (c)(2)(vii)(B), and (d)(1)(ii) are taken into account. Similarly, in the case of computations with respect to the guarantee of a specified amount under § 1.72-7(d)(1), only the applicable portion of such amount is taken into account.
(6) This paragraph (d) applies to a contract only if the first taxpayer to receive an amount as an annuity under the contract elects to perform separate computations with respect to the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and the post-June 1986 investment in the contract as if each such amount were the entire investment in contract. If two or more annuitants receive an amount as an annuity under the contract at the same time (such as under a joint-and-last-survivorship annuity contract), an election by one of the annuitants is treated as an election by each of the annuitants. The election is made by attaching a statement to the first return filed by the taxpayer for the first taxable year in which an amount is received as an annuity under the contract. The statement must indicate that the taxpayer is electing to apply the provisions of paragraph (d) of § 1.72-6, and must also contain the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each annuitant under the contract, and the amount of the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract.
(7) If the investment in the contract includes a post-June 1986 investment in the contract and the election described in paragraph (d)(6) of this section is not made—
(i) The amount excludable from gross income shall be determined without regard to the separate computations described in this paragraph (d); and
(ii) Only the multiples found in Tables V through VIII shall be used in determining the amount excludable from gross income.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6676, 28 FR 10134, Sept. 17, 1963; T.D. 7311, 39 FR 11880, Apr. 1, 1974; T.D. 8115, 51 FR 45700, Dec. 19, 1986; 52 FR 10223, Mar. 31, 1987]
§ 1.72-7
Adjustment in investment where a contract contains a refund feature.
(a)
Definition of a contract containing a refund feature.
A contract to which section 72 applies, contains a refund feature if:
(1) The total amount receivable as an annuity under such contract depends, in whole or in part, on the continuing life of one or more persons,
(2) The contract provides for payments to be made to a beneficiary or the estate of an annuitant on or after the death of the annuitant if a specified amount or a stated number of payments has not been paid to the annuitant or annuitants prior to death, and
(3) Such payments are in the nature of a refund of the consideration paid. See paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.72-11.
(b)
Adjustment of investment for the refund feature in the case of a single life annuity.
Where a single life annuity contract to which section 72 applies contains a refund feature and the special rule of paragraph (d) of this section does not apply, the investment in the contract shall be adjusted in the following manner:
(1) Determine the number of years necessary for the guaranteed amount to be fully paid by dividing the maximum amount guaranteed as of the annuity starting date by the amount to be received annually under the contract to the extent such amount reduces the guaranteed amount. The number of years should be stated in terms of the nearest whole year, considering for this purpose a fraction of
one-half or more as an additional whole year.
(2) Consult Table III or VII (whichever is applicable) of § 1.72-9 for the appropriate percentage under the whole number of years found in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and the age (as of the annuity starting date) and, if applicable, sex of the annuitant.
(3) Multiply the percentage found in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph by whichever of the following is the smaller: (i) The investment in the contract found in accordance with § 1.72-6 or (ii) the total amount guaranteed as of the annuity starting date.
(4) Subtract the amount found in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph from the investment in the contract found in accordance with § 1.72-6.
The resulting amount is the investment in the contract adjusted for the present value of the refund feature without discount for interest and is to be used in determining the exclusion ratio to be applied to the payments received as an annuity. The percentage found in Tables III or VII shall not be adjusted in a manner described in paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.72-5. These principles may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On January 1, 1954, a husband, age 65, purchased for $21,053, an immediate installment refund annuity payable $100 per month for life. The contract provided that in the event the husband did not live long enough to recover the full purchase price, payments were to be made to his wife until the total payments under the contract equaled the purchase price. The investment in the contract adjusted for the purpose of determining the exclusion ratio is computed in the following manner:
Cost of the annuity contract (investment in the contract, unadjusted)
$21,053
Amount to be received annually
$1,200
Number of years for which payment guaranteed ($21,053 divided by $1,200)
17.5
Rounded to nearest whole number of years
18
Percentage located in Table III for age 65 (age of the annuitant as of the annuity starting date) and 18 (the number of whole years) (percent)
30
Subtract value of the refund feature to the nearest dollar (30 percent of $21,053)
$6,316
Investment in the contract adjusted for the present value of the refund feature without discount for interest
$14,737

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that the total investment in the contract was made after June 30, 1986. The investment in the contract adjusted for the purpose of determining the exclusion ratio is computed as follows:
Cost of the annuity contract (investment in the contract, unadjusted)
$21,053
Amount to be received annually
$1,200
Number of years for which payment guaranteed ($21,053 ÷ $1,200)
17.5
Rounded to nearest whole number of years
18
Percentage in Table VII for age 65 and 18 years (percent)
15
Subtract value of the refund feature to the nearest dollar (15 percent of $21,053)
$3,158
Investment in the contract adjusted for the present value of the refund feature without discount for interest
$17,895

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract is $10,000 and the post-June 1986 investment in the contract is $11,053. If the annuitant makes the election described in § 1.72-6(d)(6), separate computations must be performed pursuant to § 1.72-6(d) to determine the adjusted investment in the contract. The pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and the post-June 1986 investment in the contract adjusted for the purpose of determining the exclusion ratios are, respectively, $7,000 and $9,395, determined as follows:
Pre-July 1986 investment in the contract (unadjusted)
$10,000
Pre-July 1986 portion of the amount to be received annually ($10,000/$21,053 × $1,200)
$570.00
Number of years for which payment guaranteed ($10,000 ÷ $570)
17.50
Rounded to nearest whole number of years
18
Percentage in Table III for age 65 and 18 years (percent)
30
Subtract value of the refund feature to the nearest dollar (30 percent of $10,000)
$3,000
Pre-July 1986 investment in the contract adjusted for the present value of the refund feature without discount for interest
$7,000
Post-June 1986 investment in the contract (unadjusted)
$11,053
Post-June 1986 portion of the amount to be received annually ($11,053/$21,053 × $1,200)
$630
Number of years for which payment guaranteed ($11,053 ÷ $630)
17.54
Rounded to nearest whole number of years
18
Percentage in Table VII for age 65 and 18 years (percent)
15
Subtract value of the refund feature to the nearest dollar (15 percent of $11,053)
$1,658
Post-June 1986 investment in the contract adjusted for the present value of the refund feature without discount for interest
$9,395
If, in the above examples, the guaranteed amount had exceeded the investment in the contract (or applicable portion thereof), the percentage found in Table III or VII (whichever is applicable) should have been applied to the
lesser of these amounts since any excess of the guaranteed amount over the investment in the contract (as found under § 1.72-6) would not have constituted a refund of premiums or other consideration paid. In such a case, however, a different multiple might have been obtained from Table III or VII (whichever is applicable) since the number of years for which payments were guaranteed would have been greater.
(c)
Adjustment of investment for the refund feature in the case of a joint and survivor annuity.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if a joint and survivor annuity contract described in paragraph (b) (1), (2) or (6) of § 1.72-5 contains a refund feature and the special rule of paragraph (d) of this section does not apply, the investment in the contract shall be adjusted in the following manner:
(i) Find the percentage determined under the following formula:
EC05OC91.042
In which:
V = The percentage, rounded to the nearest whole percent,
x = The age at the nearest birthday of the primary annuitant,
y = The age at the nearest birthday of the survivor annuitant,
N = The guaranteed amount divided by the annual annuity payable to the primary annuitant, rounded to the nearest integer,
P = The annual annuity continued to the survivor annuitant divided by the annual annuity payable to the primary annuitant,
EC05OC91.043
(ii) Multiply the percentage found in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section by the lesser of (A) the investment in the contract found in accordance with § 1.72-6, or (B) the total amount guaranteed as of the annuity starting date.
(iii) Subtract the amount found in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section from the investment in the contract found in accordance with § 1.72-6.
In the case of a contract providing for payments to be made to two persons in the manner described in paragraph (b)(6) of § 1.72-5, this paragraph (c)(1) is applied as though the older person were the primary annuitant and the younger person were the survivor annuitant. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), the number of survivors at age

(2) If the multiples in Tables I through IV of § 1.72-9 are used to determine any portion of the expected return under a contract described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, only the post-June 1986 investment in the contract (if any) shall be adjusted in the manner described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the pre-July 1986 investment in the contract shall, in the case of a contract described in paragraph (b) (1) or (6) of § 1.72-5, be adjusted in the following manner:
(i) Determine the number of years necessary for the guaranteed amount to be fully paid by dividing the maximum amount guaranteed as of the annuity starting date by the amount to be received annually under the contract. The number of years should be stated in terms of the nearest whole year, considering for this purpose a fraction of one-half or more as an additional whole year.
(ii) Consult Table III of § 1.72-9 for the appropriate percentages under the whole number of years found in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph and
the age (as of the annuity starting date) and sex of each annuitant. If the annuitants are not of the same sex, substitute for the female annuitant a male annuitant 5 years younger, or for the male annuitant a female annuitant 5 years older, so that Table III will be entered in both cases with the ages of annuitants of the same sex.
(iii) Find the sum of the two percentages found in accordance with subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.
(iv) To the age of the elder of the two annuitants (as determined under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph), add the number of years (indicated in the table below) opposite the number of years by which such annuitants' ages differ:

(v) Consult Table III for the appropriate percentage under the whole number of years found in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph and the age and sex of the elder annuitant as adjusted under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph.
(vi) Subtract the percentage obtained in subdivision (v) of this subparagraph from the sum of the percentages found under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. If the result is less than one, subdivisions (vii) and (viii) of this subparagraph shall be disregarded and no adjustment made to the investment in the contract.
(vii) Multiply the percentage found in subdivision (vi) of this subparagraph by whichever of the following is the smaller: (A) the investment in the contract found in accordance with § 1.72-6 or (B) the total amount guaranteed as of the annuity starting date.
(viii) Subtract the amount found in subdivision (vii) of this subparagraph from the investment in the contract found in accordance with § 1.72-6.
(3) The principles of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Prior to July 1, 1986, Taxpayer A, a 70-year-old male, purchases a joint and last survivor annuity for $33,050. The contract provides for payments of $100 a month to be paid first to himself for life and then to B, his 40-year-old daughter, if she survives him. The contract further provides that in the event both die before ten years' payments have been made, payments will be continued to C, a beneficiary, or to C's estate, until ten years' payments have been made. If there is no post-June 1986 investment in the contract, the investment in the contract adjusted for the purpose of determining the exclusion ratio is computed in the following manner:
Cost of the annuity contract (investment in the contract unadjusted)
$33,050
Guaranteed amount ($1,200 × 10)
$12,000
Percentage in Table III for male, age 70 (or female, age 75) for duration of the guarantee (10)
21
Percentage in Table III for female, age 40 (or male, age 35) for duration of the guarantee (10)
2
Sum of percentages obtained
23
Difference in years of age between two males, aged 70 and 35 (or 2 females, aged 75 and 40)
35
Addition, in years, to older age

Percentage in Table III for male one year older than A
22
Difference between percentages obtained (23 percent less 22 percent)
1
Value of the refund feature to the nearest dollar (1 percent of $12,000)
$120
Investment in the contract adjusted for present value of the refund feature
$32,930

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1), except that the total investment in the contract was made after June 30, 1986, A is 73 years of age, and B is A's 70 year old spouse. The percentage determined under the formula in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is two percent. Thus, the amount determined under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section is $240 (2 percent of $12,000), and the investment in the contract adjusted for the present value of the refund feature is $32,810 ($33,050—$240).
(4) If an annuity described in paragraph (b) of § 1.72-5 contains a refund feature and the manner of determining the adjustment to the investment in the contract (or to any part of such investment) is not prescribed or requires use of the formula in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the Commissioner will determine the amount of the adjustment upon request. The request must
contain the date of birth of each annuitant, the guaranteed amount, the annual annuity payable to each annuitant, and the annuity starting date. Send the request to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: OP:E:EP:GA, Washington, D.C. 20224.
(d)
Adjustment of investment in the contract where paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2 applies to payments.
(1) If paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-2 applies to payments to be made under a contract and this section also applies because of the provision for a refund feature, an adjustment shall be made to the investment in the contract in accordance with this paragraph before making the computations required by paragraph (d)(3) of § 1.72-4 and paragraph (d)(7) of § 1.72-5. In the case of the guarantee of a specified amount, the adjustment shall be made by applying the appropriate multiple from Table III or VII (whichever is applicable), as otherwise determined under this section, to the investment in the contract or the guranteed amount, whichever is the lesser. The guarantee period shall be found by dividing the amount guaranteed by the amount determined by placing the payments received during the first taxable year (to guaranteed amount) on an annual basis. Thus, if monthly payments are first received by a taxpayer on a calendar year basis in August, his total payments (to the extent that they reduce the guaranteed amount) for the taxable year would be divided by 5 and multiplied by 12. The guaranteed amount would then be divided by the result of this computation to obtain the guarantee period. If the contract merely guarantees that proceeds from a unit or units of a fund shall be paid for a fixed number of years or the life (or lives) of an annuitant (or annuitants), whichever is the longer, the fixed number of years is the guarantee period. The appropriate percentage in Table III or VII shall be applied to whichever of the following is the smaller: (i) the investment in the contract; or (ii) the product of the payments received in the first taxable year, placed on an annual basis, multiplied by the number of years for which payment of the proceeds of a unit or units is guaranteed.
(2) The principles of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A, a 50-year-old male purchases for $25,000 a contract which provides for variable monthly payments to be paid to him for his life. The contract also provides that if he should die before receiving payments for fifteen years, payments shall continue according to the original formula to his estate or beneficiary until payments have been made for that period. Beginning with the month of September, A receives payments which total $450 for the first taxable year of receipt. This amount, placed on an annual basis, is $1,350 ($450 divided by 4, or $112.50; $112.50 multiplied by 12, or $1,350). If there is no post-June 1986 investment in the contract, the guaranteed amount is considered to be $20,250 ($1,350 × 15), and the multiple from Table III (found in the same manner as in paragraph (b) of this section), 9 percent, applied to $20,250 (since this amount is less than the investment in the contract), results in a refund adjustment of $1,822,50. The latter amount, subtracted from the investment in the contract of $25,000, results in an adjusted investment in the contract of $23,177.50. If A dies before receiving payments for 15 years and the remaining payments are made to B, his beneficiary, B shall exclude the entire amount of such payments from his gross income until the amounts so received by B, together with the amount received by A and excludable from A's gross income, equal or exceed $25,000. Any excess and any payments thereafter received by B shall be fully includible in gross income.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1), except that the total investment in the contract was made after June 30, 1986. The applicable multiple found in Table VII is 3 percent. When this is applied to the guaranteed amount of $20,250, it results in a refund adjustment of $607.50. The adjusted investment in the contract in $24,392.50 ($25,000—$607.50).
(e)
Adjustment of the investment in the contract where more than one annuity element is provided for a single consideration.
In the case of contracts to which paragraph (b) of § 1.72-6 applies for the purpose of allocating the investment in the contract to two or more annuity elements which are provided for a single consideration, if one or more of such elements involves a refund feature, the portion of the investment in the contract properly allocable to each such element shall be adjusted for the refund feature before aggregating all the investments in order to obtain the
exclusion ratio which is to apply to the contract as a whole.

# Example 1.
If taxpayer A, an insured 70 years of age, upon maturity of an endowment policy which cost him a net amount of $86,000, elected a dual settlement consisting of (1) monthly payments for his life aggregating $4,146 per year with 10 years' payments certain, and (2) monthly payments for his 60-year-old brother, B, aggregating $2,820 per year with 20 years' payments certain, the exclusion ratio to be used by both A and B if there is no post-June 1986 investment in the contract would be determined in the following manner:
A's expected return (A's payments per year of $4,146 multiplied by his life expectancy from Table 1 of 12.1)
$50,166.60
B's expected return (B's payments per year of $2,820 multiplied by his life expectancy from Table 1 of 18.2)
$51,324.00
Sum of expected returns to be used in determining exclusion ratio
$101,490.60
Percentage of total expected return attributable to A's expectancy of life ($50,166.60 ÷ $101,490.60)
49.4
Percentage of total expected return attributable to B's expectancy of life ($51,324 ÷ $101,490.60)
50.6
Portion of investment in the contract allocable to A's annuity (49.4 percent of $86,000)
$42,484.00
Portion of investment in the contract allocable to B's annuity (50.6 percent of $86,000)
$43,516.00
Value of the refund feature with respect to A's annuity (percentage from Table III for male, age 70, and duration 10, or 21 percent, multiplied by lesser of guaranteed amount and allocable portion of investment in the contract, $41,460)
$8,707.00
A's allocable portion of the investment in the contract adjusted for refund feature ($42,484 less $8,707.00)
$33,777.00
Value of the refund feature with respect to B's annuity (percentage from Table III for male, age 60, and duration 20, or 25 percent, multiplied by lesser of guaranteed amount and allocable portion of investment in the contract, $43,516)
$10,879.00
B's allocable portion of the investment in the contract adjusted for refund feature ($43,516 less $10,879.00)
$32,637.00
Sum of A's and B's allocable portions of the investment in the contract after adjustment for the refund feature
$66,414.00
Exclusion ratio for the contract as a whole (total adjusted investment in the contract, $66,414, divided by the total expected return from above, $101,490.60) (percent)

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that the total investment in the contract was made after June 30, 1986. The exclusion ratio to be used by both A and B would be 56.9 percent, determined as follows:
A's expected return (A's payments per year of $4,146 multiplied by his life expectancy from Table V of 16.0)
$66,336.00
B's expected return (B's payments per year of $2,820 multiplied by his life expectancy from Table V of 24.2)
$68,244.00
Sum of expected returns to be used in determining exclusion ratio

$43,602.00
Value of the refund feature with respect to A's annuity (percentage from Table VII for age 70 and duration 10, or 11 percent, multiplied by lesser of the guaranteed amount and allocable portion of investment in the contract, $41,460)

(f)
Adjustment of investment in the contract with respect to contracts subject to § 1.72-6(d).
In the case of a contract to which § 1.72-6(d) (relating to contracts in which amounts were invested both before July 1, 1986, and after June 30, 1986) applies, this section is applied in the manner prescribed in § 1.72-6(d) and, in particular, § 1.72-6(d)(5)(vi).
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 21, 1960, as amended by T.D. 8115, 51 FR 45702, Dec. 19, 1986]
§ 1.72-8
Effect of certain employer contributions with respect to premiums or other consideration paid or contributed by an employee.
(a)
Contributions in the nature of compensation
—(1)
Amounts includible in gross income of employee under subtitle A of the Code or prior income tax laws.
Section 72(f) provides that for the purposes of section 72 (c), (d), and (e), amounts contributed by an employer for the benefit of an employee or his beneficiaries shall constitute consideration paid or contributed by the employee to the extent that such amounts were includible in the gross income of the employee under subtitle A of the Code or prior income tax laws. Amounts to which this paragraph applies include, for example, contributions made by an employer to or under a trust or plan which fails to qualify under the provisions of section 401(a), provided that the employee's rights to such contributions are nonforfeitable at the time the contributions are made. See sections 402(b) and 403(c) and the regulations thereunder. This subparagraph also applies to premiums paid by an employer (other than premiums paid on behalf of an owner-employee) for life insurance protection for an employee if such premiums are includible in the gross income of the employee when paid. See § 1.72-16. However, such premiums shall only be considered as premiums and other consideration paid by the employee with respect to any benefits attributable to the contract providing the life insurance protection. See § 1.72-16.
(2)
Amounts not includible in gross income of employee at time contributed if paid directly to employee at that time.
Except as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, section 72(f) provides that for the purposes of section 72 (c), (d), and (e), amounts contributed by an employer for the benefit of an employee or his beneficiaries shall constitute consideration paid or contributed by the employee to the extent that such amounts would not have been includible in the gross income of the employee at the time contributed had they been paid directly to the employee at that time. Amounts to which this subparagraph applies include, for example, contributions made by an employer after December 31, 1950, and before January 1, 1963, if made on account of foreign services rendered by an employee during a period in which the employee qualified as a bona fide resident of a foreign country under section 911(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, or under section 116(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. In such a case, it would be immaterial whether such contributions were made under a qualified plan or otherwise. See subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for rules governing the determination of the amount of employer foreign service contributions to which this subparagraph applies. On the other hand, if contributions are made by an employer to a qualified plan at a time when compensation paid directly to the employee concerned with respect to the same services rendered would have been includible in the gross income of the employee, such as in the case of an employee of a State government where contributions are made in 1955 with respect to services rendered by the employee prior to the year 1939, this subparagraph does not apply to such contributions.
(3)
Limitation
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the provisions of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall not apply to amounts which were contributed by the employer after December 31, 1962, and which would not have been includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of the application of section 911, if such amounts had been paid directly to the employee at the time of contribution. Employer contributions attributable to foreign services performed by the employee after December 31, 1962, do not constitute, for purposes of section 72 (c), (d), and (e), consideration paid or contributed by the employee.
(ii)
Exception.
The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall not apply to amounts which were contributed by the employer to provide pension or annuity credits (determined in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) to the extent such credits are—
(
a
) Attributable to foreign services performed before January 1, 1963, with
respect to which the employee qualified for the benefits of section 911(a) (or corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws), and
(
b
) Provided pursuant to pension or annuity plan provisions in existence on March 12, 1962, and on that date applicable to such services.
Amounts described in this subdivision constitute, for purposes of section 72 (c), (d), and (e), consideration paid or contributed by the employee even though such amounts are contributed by the employer after December 31, 1962.
(4)
Determination of employer foreign service contributions which constitute consideration paid or contributed by employee.
For purposes of subparagraphs (2) and (3)(ii) of this paragraph, employer foreign service contributions which constitute, for purposes of section 72 (c), (d), and (e), consideration paid or contributed by the employee shall be determined as follows:
(i)
Treatment of identifiable contributions.
If, under the terms of the pension or annuity plan under which employer contributions were made, such contributions may be identified as—
(
a
) Attributable to foreign services performed before January 1, 1963, with respect to which the employee qualified for the benefits of section 911(a) (or corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws), and
(
b
) Made under pension or annuity plan provisions in existence on March 12, 1962, which were applicable to the services referred to in (
a
) of this subdivision on that date,
the amount of employer contributions so identified shall be considered paid or contributed by the employee.
(ii)
Alternative rule for unidentifiable contributions.
If employer contributions may not be identified in the manner described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the amount of employer contributions attributable to foreign services performed before January 1, 1963, and considered paid or contributed by the employee shall be determined on the basis of an estimated allocation which is reasonable and consistent with the circumstances and the provisions of the pension or annuity plan under which such contributions are made. For example, if an employee's benefits under a pension or annuity plan, which is unchanged after March 12, 1962, are determined with respect to his basic compensation during his entire period of credited service, the amount of employer contributions considered paid or contributed by the employee shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to total employer contributions for such employee under the pension or annuity plan as his basic compensation attributable to foreign services performed before January 1, 1963, with respect to which he qualified for the benefits of section 911(a) (or corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws) bears to his total basic compensation. On the other hand, if an employee's benefits under a pension or annuity plan, which is unchanged after March 12, 1962, are determined with respect to his basic compensation during his final five years of credited service, the amount of employer contributions considered paid or contributed by the employee shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to total employer contributions for such employee as his number of years of credited service before January 1, 1963, with respect to which he qualified for the benefits of section 911(a) (or corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws) bears to his total number of years of credited service.
(5)
Amounts not includible in gross income of employee under subtitle A of the Code or prior income tax laws.
Amounts contributed by an employer which were not includible in the gross income of the employee under Subtitle A of the Code or prior income tax laws, but which would have been includible therein had they been paid directly to the employee, do not constitute consideration paid or contributed by the employee for the purposes of section 72. For example, contributions made by an employer under a qualified employees' trust or plan, which contributions would have been includible in the gross income of the employee had such contributions been paid to him directly as compensation, do not constitute consideration paid or contributed by the employee. Accordingly, the aggregate
amount of premiums or other consideration paid or contributed by an employee, insofar as compensatory employer contributions are concerned, consists solely of the (i) sum of all amounts actually contributed by the employee, plus (ii) contributions in the nature of compensation which are deemed to be paid or contributed by the employee under this paragraph.
(b)
Contributions in the nature of death benefits.
In the case of an employee's beneficiary, the aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid or deemed to be paid or contributed by the employee shall also include:
(1) Amounts (other than amounts paid as an annuity) to the extent such amounts are excludable from the beneficiary's gross income as a death benefit under section 101(b), and
(2) Any amount or amounts of death benefits which are treated as additional consideration contributed by the employee under section 101(b)(2)(D) and the regulations thereunder, or which were excludable from the beneficiary's gross income as a death benefit under section 22(b)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and the regulations thereunder.
Accordingly, in the case of an employee's beneficiary, any such amount shall be added to any amount or amounts deemed paid or contributed by the employee under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and to any amounts actually contributed by the employee for the purpose of finding the aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid or contributed by the employee.
(c)
Amounts “made available” to an employee or his beneficiary.
Any amount which, although not actually paid, is made available to and includable in the gross income of an employee or his beneficiary under the rules of sections 402 and 403 and the regulations thereunder, shall be considered an amount contributed by the employee and shall be aggregated with amounts, if any, to which paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply for the purpose of determining the aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid by the employee.
(d)
Amounts includable in gross income of employee when his rights under annuity contract change to nonforfeitable rights.
Any amount which, by reason of section 403(d) and after the application of paragraph (b) of § 1.403 (b)-1, is required to be included in an employee's gross income for the year when his rights under an annuity contract change from forfeitable to nonforfeitable rights shall be considered an amount contributed by the employee and shall be aggregated with amounts, if any, to which paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section apply for the purpose of determining the aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid or contributed by the employee for such annuity contract. In other words, if, under section 403(d), an employee of an organization exempt from tax under section 501(a) or 521(a) is required to include an amount in gross income by reason of his rights under an annuity contract changing from forfeitable to nonforfeitable rights, such amount, to the extent it is not excludable from gross income under paragraph (b) of § 1.403 (b)-1, shall be considered an amount contributed by such employee for the annuity contract.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6665, 28 FR 7245, July 16, 1963; T.D. 6783, 29 FR 18356, Dec. 24, 1964]
§ 1.72-9
Tables.
The following tables are to be used in connection with computations under section 72 and the regulations thereunder. Tables I, II, IIA, III, and IV are to be used if the investment in the contract does not include a post-June 1986 investment in the contract (as defined in § 1.72-6(d)(3)). Tables V, VI, VIA, VII, and VIII are to be used if the investment in the contract includes a post-June 1986 investment in the contract (as defined in § 1.72-6(d)(3)).
In the case of a contract under which amounts are received as an annuity after June 30, 1986, a taxpayer receiving such amounts may elect to treat the entire investment in the contract as post-June 1986 investment in the contract and thus apply Tables V through VIII. A taxpayer may make the election for any taxable year in which such amounts are received by attaching to the taxpayer's return for such taxable year a statement that the taxpayer is
electing under § 1.72-9 to treat the entire investment in the contract as post-June 1986 investment in the contract. The statement must contain the taxpayer's name, address, and taxpayer identification number. The election is irrevocable and applies with respect to all amounts that the taxpayer receives as an annuity under the contract in the taxable year for which the election is made or in any subsequent taxable year. (Note that for purposes of the examples in §§ 1.72-4 through 1.72-11 the election described in this section is disregarded (
i.e.
, it assumed that the taxpayer does not make an election under this section).) See also § 1.72-6(d)(3) for rules treating the entire investment in a contract as post-June 1986 investment in a contract if the annuity starting date of the contract is after June 30, 1986, and the contract provides for a disqualifying form of payment or settlement, such as an option to receive a lump sum in full discharge of the obligation under the contract. In addition, see § 1.72-6(d) for special rules concerning the tables to be used and the separate computations required if the investment in the contract includes both a pre-July 1986 investment in the contract and a post-June 1986 investment in the contract and the election described in § 1.72-6(d)(6) is made with respect to the contract.

The multiples in this table are not applicable to annuities for a term certain; for such cases see paragraph (c) of § 1.72-5.
If (a) the terms of the contract involve a life or lives, and are such that the above tables cannot be correctly applied, and (b) the amounts received under the contract are at least partly “amounts received as an annuity” under a contract to which section 72 applies, the taxpayer may submit with his return an actuarial computation based upon the applicable annuity table (described below) with ages set back one year, showing the appropriate factors applied in his case, subject to the approval of the Commissioner upon examination of such return. The applicable annuity table is the 1937 Standard Annuity Table (if the investment in the contract does not include a post-June 1986 investment in the contract) or the gender-neutral version of the 1983 Basic Table (if the investment in the contract includes a post-June 1986 investment in the contract). In the case of a contract to which § 1.72-6(d) (relating to contracts in which amounts were invested both before July 1, 1986, and after June 30, 1986) applies, the actuarial computation shall be based on both tables in accordance with the principles of § 1.72-6(d). Computations involving factors to compensate for the effects of contingencies other than mortality, such as marriage or remarriage, re-employment, recovery from disability, or the like, will not be approved.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 21, 1960, as amended by T.D. 8115, 51 FR 45706, Dec. 19, 1986; 60 FR 16381, Mar. 30, 1995]
§ 1.72-10
Effect of transfer of contracts on investment in the contract.
(a) If a contract to which section 72 applies, or any interest therein, is transferred for a valuable consideration, by assignment or otherwise, only the actual value of the consideration given for such transfer and the amount of premiums or other consideration subsequently paid by the transferee shall be included in the transferee's aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid. In accordance with the provisions of section 72(g)(3) and paragraph (b) of § 1.72-4, an annuity
starting date shall be determined for the transferee without regard to the annuity starting date, if any, of the transferor. In determining the transferee's investment in the contract, the aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid shall be reduced by all amounts received by the transferee before the receipt of an amount as an annuity or before the annuity starting date, whichever is the later, to the extent that such amounts were excludable from his gross income under the applicable income tax law at the time of receipt. For the treatment of amounts received by the transferee subsequent to both the annuity starting date and the date of receipt of a payment as an annuity, but not received as annuity payments, see § 1.72-11. For a limitation on adjustments to the basis of annuity contracts sold, see section 1021.
(b) In the case of a transfer of such a contract without valuable consideration, the annuity starting date and the expected return under the contract shall be determined as though no such transfer had taken place. See paragraph (b) of § 1.72-4. The transferee shall include the aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid or deemed to have been paid by his transferor in the aggregate of premiums or other consideration as though paid by him. In determining the transferee's investment in the contract, the transferee's aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid (as so found) shall be reduced by all amounts either received or deemed to have been received by himself or his transferor before the annuity starting date, or before the date on which an amount is first received as an annuity, whichever is the later, to the extent that such amounts were excludable from the gross income of the actual recipient under the applicable income tax law at the time of receipt. For treatment of amounts received subsequent to both the above dates by such transferee, but not received as annuity payments, see § 1.72-11.
§ 1.72-11
Amounts not received as annuity payments.
(a)
Introductory.
(1) This section applies to amounts received under a contract to which section 72 applies if either:
(i) Paragraph (b) of § 1.72-2 is inapplicable to such amounts.
(ii) Paragraph (b) of § 1.72-2 is applicable but the annuity payments received differ either in amount, duration, or both, from those originally provided under the contract, or
(iii) Paragraph (b) of § 1.72 is applicable, but such annuity payments are received by a beneficiary after the death of an annuitant (or annuitants) in full discharge of the obligation under the contract and solely because of a guarantee.
The payments referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph include all amounts other than “amounts received as an annuity” as that term is defined in paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of § 1.72-2. If such amounts are received as dividends or payments in the nature of dividends, or as a return of premiums, see paragraph (b) of this section. If such amounts are paid in full discharge of the obligation under the contract and are in the nature of a refund of the consideration, see paragraph (c) of this section. If such amounts are paid upon the surrender, redemption, or maturity of the contract, see paragraph (d) of this section. The payments referred to in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph include all annuity payments which are paid as the result of a modification or an exchange of the annuity obligations originally provided under a contract for different annuity obligations (whether or not such modification or exchange is accompanied by the payment of an amount to which subdivision (i) of this subparagraph applies). If the duration of the new annuity obligations differs from the duration of the old annuity obligations, paragraph (e) of this section applies to the new annuity obligations and paragraph (d) of this section applies to any lump sum payment received. If, however, the duration of the new annuity obligations is the same as the duration of the old obligations, paragraph (f) of this section applies to the new obligations and to any lump sum received in connection therewith. The annuity payments referred to in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph are annuity payments which are made to a beneficiary after
the death of annuitant (or annuitants) in full discharge of the obligations under a contract because of a provision in the contract requiring the payment of a guaranteed amount or minimum number of payments for a fixed period; see paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) The principles of this section apply, to the extent appropriate thereto, to amounts paid which are taxable under section 72 (except, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, section 72(e)(3)) in accordance with sections 402 and 403 and the regulations thereunder. However, if contributions used to purchase the contract include amounts for which a deduction was allowed under section 404 as contributions on behalf of an owner-employee, the rules of this section are modified by the rules of paragraph (b) of § 1.72-17. Further, in applying the provisions of this section, the aggregate premiums or other consideration paid shall not include contributions on behalf of self-employed individuals to the extent that deductions were allowed under section 404 for such contributions. Nor, shall the aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid include amounts used to purchase life, accident, health, or other insurance protection for an owner-employee. See paragraph (b)(4) of § 1.72-16 and paragraph (c) of § 1.72-17. The principles of this section also apply to payments made in the manner described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of § 1.72-2.
(b)
Amounts received in the nature of dividends or similar distributions.
(1) If dividends (or payments in the nature of dividends or a return of premiums or other consideration) are received under a contract to which section 72 applies and such payments are received before the annuity starting date or before the date on which an amount is first received as an annuity, whichever is the later, such payments are includible in the gross income of the recipient only to the extent that they, taken together with all previous payments received under the contract which were excludable from the gross income of the recipient under the applicable income tax law, exceed the aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid or deemed to have been paid by the recipient. Such payments shall also be subtracted from the consideration paid (or deemed paid) both for the purpose of determining an exclusion ratio to be applied to subsequent amounts paid as an annuity and for the purpose of determining the applicability of section 72(d) and § 1.72-13, relating to employee contributions recoverable in three years.
(2) If dividends or payments in the nature of dividends are paid under a contract to which section 72 applies and such payments are received on or after the annuity starting date or the date on which an amount is first received as an annuity, whichever is later, such payments shall be fully includible in the gross income of the recipient. The receipt of such payments shall not affect the aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid nor the amounts contributed or deemed to have been contributed by an employee as otherwise calculated for purposes of section 72. Since the investment in the contract and the expected return are not affected by a payment which is fully includible in the gross income of the recipient under this rule, the exclusion ratio will not be affected by such payment and will continue to be applied to amounts received as annuity payments in the future as though such payment had not been made. This subparagraph shall apply to amounts received under a contract described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of § 1.72-2 to the extent that the amounts received exceed the portion of the investment in the contract allocable to each taxable year in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of § 1.72-4. Hence, such excess is fully includible in the gross income of the recipient.
(c)
Amounts received in the nature of a refund of the consideration under a contract and in full discharge of the obligation thereof.
(1) Any amount received under a contract to which section 72 applies, if it is at least in part a refund of the consideration paid, including amounts payable to a beneficiary after the death of an annuitant by reason of a provision in the contract for a life annuity with minimum period of payments certain or with a minimum amount which must be paid in any event, shall be considered an amount received in the nature of a refund of
the consideration paid for such contract. If such an amount is in full discharge of an obligation to pay a fixed amount (whether in a lump sum or otherwise) or to pay amounts for a fixed number of years (including amounts described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of § 1.72-2), it shall be included in the gross income of the recipient only to the extent that it, when added to amounts previously received under the contract which were excludable from gross income under the law applicable at the time of receipt, exceeds the aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid. See section 73(e)(2)(A). This paragraph shall not apply if the total of the amounts to be paid in discharge of the obligation can in any event exceed the total of the annuity payments which would otherwise fully discharge the obligation. For rules to be applied in such a case, see paragraph (e) of this section.
(2) The principles of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a male employee, retired on December 31, 1954, at the age of 60. A life annuity of $75 per month was payable to him beginning January 31, 1955. The annuity contract guaranteed that if A did not live for at least ten years after his retirement his beneficiary, B, would receive the monthly payments for any balance of such ten-year period which remained at the date of A's death. Under section 72, A was deemed to have paid $3,600 toward the cost of the annuity. A lived for five years after his retirement receiving a total of $4,500 in annuity payments. After A's death, B began receiving the monthly payments of $75 beginning with the January 31, 1960 payment. B will exclude such payments from his gross income throughout 1960, 1961, and 1962, and will exclude only $18 of the first payment in 1963 from his gross income for that year. Thereafter, B will include the entire amount of all such payments in his gross income for the taxable year of receipt. This result is determined as follows:
A's investment in the contract (unadjusted)
$3,600
Multiple from Table III of § 1.72-9 for male, age 60, where duration of guaranteed amount is 10 years (percent)
11
Subtract value of the refund feature to the nearest dollar (11 percent of $3,600)
396
Investment in the contract adjusted for the present value of the refund feature without discount for interest
3,204
Aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid
3,600
A's exclusion ratio ($3,204 ÷ $16,380 [$900 × 18.2]) (percent)
19.6
Subtract amount excludable during five years A received payments (19.6 percent of $4,500 [$900 × 5])
882
Remainder of aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid excludable from gross income of B under section 72(e)
2,718
As a result of the above computation, the number of payments to B which will exhaust the remainder of consideration paid which is excludable from gross income of the recipient is 36
6/25
($2,718 ÷ $75) and B will exclude the payments from his gross income for three years, then exclude only $18 of the first payment for the fourth year from his gross income, and thereafter include the entire amount of all payments he receives in his gross income.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1), except that B, the beneficiary, elects to receive $50 per month for his life in lieu of the payments guaranteed under the original contractual obligation. Since such amounts will be received as an annuity and may, because of the length of time B may live, exceed the amount guaranteed, they are not amounts to which this paragraph applies. See paragraph (e) of this section.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example (1), except that B, the beneficiary, elects to receive the remaining guaranteed amount in installments which are larger or smaller than the $75 per month provided until, under the terms of the contract, the guaranteed amount is exhausted. The rule of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and the computation illustrated in example (1) apply to such installments since the total of such installments will not exceed the original amount guaranteed to be paid at A's death in any event.

# Example 4.
C pays $12,000 for a contract providing that he is to be paid an annuity of $1,000 per year for 15 years. His exclusion ratio is therefore 80 percent ($12,000 ÷ $15,000). He directs that the annuity is to be paid to D, his beneficiary, if he should die before the full 15-year period has expired. C dies after 5 years and D is paid $1,000 in 1960. D will include $200 ($1,000−$800 [80 percent of $1,000]) in his gross income for the taxable year in which he receives the $1,000 since section 72(e) and this section do not apply to the annuity payments made in accordance with the provisions and during the term of the contract. D will continue with the same exclusion ratio used by C (80 percent).

# Example 5.
In 1954, E paid $50,000 into a fund and was promised an annual income for life the amount of which would depend in part upon the earnings realized from the investment of the fund in accordance with an agreed formula. The contract also specified that if E should die before ten years had elapsed, his beneficiary, F, would be paid the
amounts determined annually under the formula until ten payments had been received by E and F together. E died in 1960, having received five payments totaling $30,000. Assuming that $22,000 of this amount was properly excludable from E's gross income prior to his death, F will exclude from his gross income the payments he receives until the taxable year in which his total receipts from the fund exceed $28,000 ($50,000−$22,000). F will include any excess over the $28,000 in his gross income for that taxable year. Thereafter, F will include in his gross income the entire amount of any payments made to him from the fund.

# Example 6.
Assume the facts are the same as in example (1), except that the total investment in the contract is made after June 30, 1986, that A is to receive payments under the life annuity contract beginning on January 31, 1987, and that B will begin to receive the monthly payments on January 31, 1992. B will exclude the $75 monthly payments from gross income throughout 1992, 1993, and 1994. B will exclude only the first two monthly payments and $21 of the third monthly payment in 1995. This is determined as follows:
A's investment in the contract (unadjusted)
$3,600
Multiple from Table VII, age 60, 10 years (percent)
4
Subtract value of the refund feature (4 percent of $3,600
$144
Investment in the contract adjusted for the present value of the refund feature without discount for interest
$3,456
Aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid
$3,600.00
A's exclusion ratio ($3,456 ÷ $21,780 [$900 × 24.2]) (percent)
15.9
Subtract amount excludable during five years A received payments (15.9 percent of $4,500 [$900 × 5])
$715.50
Remainder of aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid excludable from gross income of B under section 72(e)
$2,884.50
As a result of the above computation, the number of payments to B which will exhaust the remainder of consideration paid which is excludable from gross income of the recipient is 38
23/50
($2,884.50 ÷ 75) and B will exclude the payments from gross income for three years, then exclude only the first two monthly payments and $34.50 of the third. Thereafter B shall include the entire amount of all payments received in gross income.
(3) For the purpose of applying the rule contained in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, it is immaterial whether the recipient of the amount received in full discharge of the obligation is the same person as the recipient of amounts previously received under the contract which were excludable from gross income, except in the case of a contract transferred for a valuable consideration, with respect to which see paragraph (a) of § 1.72-10. For the limit on the tax, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, attributable to the receipt of a lump sum to which this paragraph applies, see paragraph (g) of this section.
(d)
Amounts received upon the surrender, redemption, or maturity of a contract.
(1) Any amount received upon the surrender, redemption, or maturity of a contract to which section 72 applies, which is not received as an annuity under the regulations of paragraph (b) of § 1.72-2, shall be included in the gross income of the recipient to the extent that it, when added to amounts previously received under the contract and which were excludable from the gross income of the recipient under the law applicable at the time of receipt, exceeds the aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid. See section 72(e)(2)(B). If amounts are to be received as an annuity, whether in lieu of or in addition to amounts described in the preceding sentence, such amounts shall be included in the gross income of the recipient in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e) or (f) of this section, whichever is applicable. The rule stated in the first sentence of this paragraph shall not apply to payments received as an annuity or otherwise after the date of the first receipt of an amount as an annuity subsequent to the maturity, redemption, or surrender of the original contract. If amounts are so received and are other than amounts received as an annuity, they are includible in the gross income of the recipient. See section 72(e)(1)(A) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(2) For the purpose of applying the rule contained in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, it is immaterial whether the recipient of the amount received upon the surrender, redemption, or maturity of the contract is the same as the recipient of amounts previously received under the contract which were excludable from gross income, except in the case of a contract transferred for a valuable consideration, with respect to which see paragraph (a) of § 1.72-10. For the limit on the amount of tax, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, attributable to the receipt of
certain lump sums to which this paragraph applies, see paragraph (g) of this section.
(e)
Periodic payments received for a different term.
If, after the date on which an amount is first received as an annuity under a contract to which section 72 applies, the terms of the contract are modified or the annuity obligations are exchanged so that periodic payments are to be received for a different term than originally provided under the contract (whether or not accompanied by the receipt of a lump sum to which paragraph (d) of this section applies), the rules of this paragraph shall apply to such payments. Hence, the provisions of section 72(e) and paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (f) of this section are inapplicable for the purpose of determining the includibility of such payments in gross income and the general principles of section 72 with respect to the use of an exclusion ratio shall be applied to such payments as if they were provided under a new contract received in exchange for the contract providing the original annuity payments. If such payments are received as the result of the surrender, redemption, or discharge of a contract to which section 72 applies, they shall be considered to be received as an annuity under a contract exchanged for the contract whose redemption, surrender, or discharge was involved. For the purpose of determining the extent to which the payments so received are to be included in the gross income of the recipient, an exclusion ratio shall be determined for such contract as of the later of January 1, 1954, or the first day of the first period for which an amount is received as an annuity thereunder, whichever is the later. See paragraph (b) of § 1.72-4. In determining the investment in the contract for this purpose, any lump sum amount received at the time of the exchange shall not be considered an amount to which paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.72-6 applies. However, such lump sum shall be subtracted from the aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid to the extent it is excludable as an amount not received as an annuity under this section as if it were an amount received before the annuity starting date of the contract obtained in exchange.
(f)
Periodic payments received for the same term after a lump sum withdrawal.
(1) If, after the date of the first receipt of a payment as an annuity, the annuitant receives a lump sum and is thereafter to receive annuity payments in a reduced amount under the contract for the same term, life, or lives as originally specified in the contract, a portion of the contract shall be considered to have been surrendered or redeemed in consideration of the payment of such lump sum and the exclusion ratio originally determined for the contract shall continue to apply to the amounts received as an annuity without regard to the fact that such amounts are less than the original amounts which were to be paid periodically. The lump sum shall be includible in the gross income of the recipient in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. However, except in the case of amounts to which sections 402 and 403 apply, the tax, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, attributable to the inclusion of all or part of the lump sum in gross income shall not exceed the amount determined under section 72(e)(3) and paragraph (g) of this section. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, such amounts may be taken into account in computations under sections 1301 through 1305 (relating to income averaging).
(2) There shall be excluded from gross income that portion of the lump sum which bears the same ratio to the aggregate premiums or other consideration paid for the contract, as reduced by all amounts previously received under the contract and excludable from the gross income of the recipient under the applicable income tax law, as:
(i) In the case of payments to be made in the manner described in paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.72-2, the amount of the reduction in the annuity payments to be made thereafter bears to the annuity payments originally provided under the contract, or
(ii) In the case of a contract providing for payments to be made in the manner described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of § 1.72-2, the amount of the reduction in the number of units per period to be
paid thereafter bears to the number of units per period payable under the contract immediately before the lump sum withdrawal.
(3) This paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A pays $20,000 for an annuity contract providing for payments to him of $100 per month for his life. At the annuity starting date he has a life expectancy of 20 years. His expected return is therefore $24,000 and the exclusion ratio is five-sixths. He continues to receive the original annuity payments for 5 years, receiving a total of $6,000, and properly excludes a total of $5,000 from his gross income in his income tax returns for those years. At the beginning of the next year, A agrees with the insurer to take a reduced annuity of $75 per month and a lump sum payment of $4,000 in cash. Of the lump sum he receives, he will include $250 and exclude $3,750 from his gross income for his taxable year of receipt, determined as follows:
Aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid
$20,000
Less amounts received as an annuity to the extent they were excludable from A's income
$5,000
Remainder of the consideration
$15,000
Ratio of the reduction in the amount of the annuity payments to the original annuity payments
25/$100 or
1/4
Lump sum received
$4,000
Less one-fourth of the remainder of the consideration (
1/4
of $15,000)
$3,750
Portion of the lump sum includible in gross income
$250
For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, the limit on tax of section 72(e)(3), as in effect before such date, applies to the portion of the lump sum includible in gross income. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, such portion may be taken into account in computations under sections 1301 through 1305 (relating to income averaging). If, in this example, the annuity were a pension payable to A as a retired employee, but the facts were otherwise the same (assuming that, for instance, the $20,000 aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid were A's contributions as determined under section 72(f) and § 1.72-8) the result would be the same except that the tax attributable to the inclusion of the $250 in A's gross income, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, would not be limited by section 72(e)(3), as in effect before such date. If such a lump sum is received in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, the portion of such sum includible in gross income may be taken into account in computations under sections 1301 through 1305 (relating to income averaging).

# Example 2.
Taxpayer B pays $30,000 for a contract providing for monthly payments to be made to him for 15 years with respect to the principal and earnings of 10 units of an investment fund. B receives $12,000 during the first 5 years of participation and of this amount he has properly excluded a total of $10,000 from his gross income in his income returns for the taxable years, since $2,000 of $2,400 he received in each such year represented his investment divided by the term of the annuity ($30,000 ÷ 15). At the beginning of the 6th year, B agrees to take $11,000 in a lump sum and thereafter to accept the payments arising with respect to five units for the remaining 10 years of payments in full discharge of the original obligations of the contract. B shall include $1,000 in his gross income for the 6th year as the result of the lump sum he receives and allocates $1,000 of his original investment in the contract to each of the remaining 10 years with respect to the payments which will continue, determined as follows:
Aggregate of premiums or other consideration paid
$30,000
Total amount received and excludable from gross income
$10,000
Remainder of the consideration
$20,000
Ratio of units discontinued to the total units originally provided
5/10
or
1/2
Lump sum received at the time of reduction in the number of units to be paid
$11,000
Less one-half of the remainder of the consideration (
1/2
of $20,000)
$10,000
Portion of the lump sum received and includible in gross income
$1,000
Remainder of the consideration less the portion of such remainder attributable to the excludable portion of the lump sum ($20,000−$10,000)
$10,000
Remainder of the consideration properly allocable to each taxable year for the remaining 10 years ($10,000 ÷ 10)
$1,000
For the taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, the limit on tax of section 72(e)(3), as in effect before such date, applies to the portion of the lump sum received and includible in gross income. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, such portion may be taken into account in computations under sections 1301 through 1305 (relating to income averaging).
(g)
Limit on tax attributable to the receipt of a lump sum.
(1) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, if the entire amount of the proceeds received upon the redemption, maturity, surrender, or discharge of a contract to which section 72 applies is received in a lump sum and paragraph (c), (d), or (f) of this section is applicable in determining the portion of such amount which is includible in gross income, the
tax attributable to such portion shall not exceed the tax which would have been attributable thereto had such portion been received ratably in the taxable year in which received and the 2 preceding taxable years. The amount of tax attributable to the includible portion of the lump sum received shall be the lesser of:
(i) The difference between the amount of tax for the taxable year of receipt computed by including such portion in gross income and the amount of tax for such taxable year computed by excluding such portion from gross income; or
(ii) The difference between the total amount of tax for the taxable year of receipt and the 2 preceding taxable years computed by including one-third of such portion in gross income for each of the 3 taxable years, and the total amount of the tax for the taxable year of receipt and the 2 preceding taxable years computed by entirely excluding such portion from the gross income of all 3 taxable years.
For the definition of “taxable year”, see section 441(b). This subparagraph shall not apply, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, to payments excepted from the application of section 72(e)(3), as in effect before such date, under the provisions of section 402 or 403. See paragraph (a) of § 1.72-2 and paragraph (d) of § 1.72-14.
(2) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, any amount includible in gross income to which this section relates may be taken into account in computations under sections 1301 through 1305 (relating to income averaging).
(h)
Amounts deemed to be paid or received by a transferee.
Amounts deemed to have been paid or received by a transferee for the purposes of § 1.72-10 shall also be deemed to have been so paid or received by such transferee for the purposes of this section. Thus, if a donee is deemed to have paid the premiums or other consideration actually paid by his transferor for the purposes of section 72(g) and paragraph (b) of § 1.72-10, such consideration shall be deemed premiums or other consideration paid by the donee for the purposes of this section.

§ 1.72-12
Effect of taking an annuity in lieu of a lump sum upon the maturity of a contract.
If a contract to which section 72 applies provides for the payment of a lump sum in full discharge of the obligation thereunder and the obligee entitled thereto, prior to receiving any portion of such lump sum and within 60 days after the date on which such lump sum first becomes payable, exercises an option or irrevocably agrees with the obligor to take, in lieu thereof, payments which will constitute “amounts received as an annuity”, as that term is defined in paragraph (b) of § 1.72-2, no part of such lump sum shall be deemed to have been received by the obligee at the time he was first entitled thereto merely because he would have been entitled to such amount had he not exercised the option or made such an agreement with the obligor.
§ 1.72-13
Special rule for employee contributions recoverable in three years.
(a)
Amounts received as an annuity.
(1) Section 72(d) provides a special rule for the treatment of amounts received as an annuity by an employee (or by the beneficiary or beneficiaries of an employee) under a contract to which section 72 applies. This special rule is applicable only in the event that:
(i) At least part of the consideration paid for the contract is contributed by the employer, and
(ii) The aggregate amount receivable as an annuity under such contract by the employee (or by his beneficiary or beneficiaries if the employee died before any amount was received as an annuity under the contract) within the 3-year period beginning on the date (whether or not before January 1, 1954) on which an amount is first received as an annuity equals or exceeds the total consideration contributed (or deemed contributed under section 72(f) and § 1.72-8) by the employee as of such date as reduced by all amounts previously received and excludable from the gross
income of the recipient under the applicable income tax law.
In such an event, section 72(d) provides that all amounts received as an annuity under the contract during a taxable year to which the Code applies shall be excluded from gross income until the total of the amounts excluded under that section plus all amounts excluded under prior income tax laws equals or exceeds the consideration contributed (or deemed contributed) by the employee. The excess, if any, and all amounts received by any recipient thereafter (whether or not received as an annuity), shall be fully included in gross income. See paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) If the aggregate amount receivable as an annuity under the contract within three years from the date on which an amount is first received as an annuity thereunder will not equal or exceed the consideration contributed (or deemed contributed) by the employee in accordance with the provisions of § 1.72-8, computed as of such date, the special rule of section 72(d) shall not apply to amounts received as an annuity under the contract and the general rules of section 72 shall apply thereto.
(3) The aggregate of the amounts receivable as an annuity within the prescribed 3-year period shall be the total of all annuity payments anticipatable by an employee (or a beneficiary or beneficiaries of an employee, if the employee died before any amount was received as an annuity) under the contract as a whole as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.72-2. See paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.72-2 for rules for determining what constitutes “the contract” in the case of distributions from an employees' trust or plan.
(4) If subparagraphs (1) and (3) of this paragraph apply to amounts received as an annuity under a contract, the rule prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply to all amounts so received thereunder regardless of the fact that they may be payable (i) to more than one beneficiary, (ii) for the same or different intervals, (iii) in different sums, or (iv) for a different period certain, life, or lives.
(5) For purposes of section 72(d), contributions which are made with respect to a self-employed individual and which are allowed as a deduction under section 404(a) are not considered contributions by the employee, but such contributions are considered contributions by the employer. A contribution which is deemed paid in a prior taxable year under the provisions of section 404(a)(6) shall be considered made with respect to a self-employed individual if the individual on whose behalf the contribution is made was self-employed for the taxable year in which the contribution is deemed paid, whether or not such individual is self-employed at the time the contribution is actually paid. Contributions with respect to a self-employed individual who is an owner-employee used to purchase life, accident, health, or other insurance protection for such owner-employee shall not be treated as consideration for the contract contributed by the employee in computing the employee contributions for purposes of section 72(d).
(b)
Amounts not received as an annuity.
If the rule of paragraph (a) of this section applies to a contract and, after the date on which an annuity payment is first received, amounts are received other than as an annuity under such contract in a taxable year to which the Code applies, they shall be included in the gross income of the recipient in accordance with the provisions of § 1.72-11. Thus, if such amounts are received as a dividend or a similar distribution after the date on which an amount is first received as an annuity under the contract, they shall be included in the gross income of the recipient (in accordance with section 72(e)(1)(A) and paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.72-11. All other amounts not received as an annuity shall be included in the gross income of the recipient in accordance with the provisions of section 72(e)(1)(B) and paragraph (c), (d), or (f), whichever is applicable, of § 1.72-11. See section 72(e)(2).
(c)
Amounts received after the exhaustion of employee contributions.
(1) Amounts received under a contract to which the rule of paragraph (a) of this section applies (whether or not such amounts are received as an annuity) shall be included in the gross income of
the recipient if such amounts are received after the date on which the aggregate of all amounts excluded from gross income by the recipients under section 72(d) and prior income tax laws equalled or exceeded the consideration contributed (or deemed contributed) by the employee.
(2) If the rule of paragraph (a) of this section applies to amounts received by an employee (or his beneficiary or beneficiaries) under a joint and survivor annuity contract, payments made to a prior annuitant may entirely exhaust the amounts excludable from gross income. In such case, amounts paid to the surviving annuitant (or annuitants) shall be included in gross income by such recipients.
(d)
Application of section 72(d) to a contract, trust, or plan providing for payments in a manner described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of § 1.72-2.
For the purpose of applying section 72(d) and this section, any amount received in the nature of a periodic payment under a contract, trust, or plan which provides for the payment of amounts in a manner described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of § 1.72-2 shall be considered an amount received as an annuity notwithstanding the provisions of any other section of the regulations under section 72. The special exclusion rule of section 72(d) and paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to all amounts so received if the first amount received, when multiplied by the number of periodic payments to be made within the three years beginning on the date of its receipt, results in an amount in excess of the aggregate premiums or other consideration contributed (or deemed contributed) by the employee as of that date. If more than one series of periodic payments is to be paid under the same contract, trust, or plan, all payments anticipatable, whether because fixed in amount or determinable in the manner described in the preceding sentence, shall be aggravated for the purpose of determining the applicability of section 72 (d) to the contract, trust, or plan as a whole.
(e)
Inapplicability of section 72(d) and this section.
Section 72(d) and this section do not apply to:
(1) Amounts received as proceeds of a life insurance contract to which section 101(a) applies, nor to
(2) Amounts paid to a surviving annuitant under a joint and survivor annuity contract to which paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.72-5 applies, nor to
(3) Amounts paid to an annuitant under Chapter 73 of title 10 of the United States Code with respect to which section 72(o) and § 1.122-1 apply.
See also paragraph (d) of § 1.72-14.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6497, 25 FR 10021, Oct. 20, 1960; T.D. 6676, 28 FR 10135, Sept. 17, 1963; T.D. 7043, 35 FR 8477, June 2, 1970]
§ 1.72-14
Exceptions from application of principles of section 72.
(a)
Payments of interest.
If any amount is received under an agreement to pay interest on a sum or sums held by the obligor, such amount shall not be excludable from the gross income of the recipient under the provisions of section 72 to the extent that it is an actual interest payment. See section 72(j). An amount shall be considered to be held under an agreement to pay interest thereon if the amount payable after the term of the annuity (whether for a term certain or for a life or lives) is substantially equal to or larger than the aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid therefor. For this purpose, however, the aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid shall include all contributions made by an employer and not merely those to which section 72(f) applies.
(b)
Alimony payments.
To the extent that payments made to a wife are includable in her gross income by reason of either or both section 71 and 682, they shall not be excluded from the wife's gross income under the principles of section 72 although made under a contract to which that section applies. However, section 72 shall apply in the case of amounts received under such a contract if a husband and wife are entitled to make and do make a single return jointly.
(c)
Certain “face-amount certificates.”
The principles of section 72 do not apply to “face-amount certificates” described in section 72(1) which were issued before January 1, 1955.
(d)
Employer plans.
The provisions of §§ 1.72-1 to 1.72-13, inclusive, shall be disregarded to the extent that they are
inconsistent with the treatment of amounts received provided in section 402 (relating to the taxability of a beneficiary of an employees' trust), section 403 (relating to the taxation of employee annuities), or the regulations under either of such sections.
§ 1.72-15
Applicability of section 72 to accident or health plans.
(a)
Applicability of section.
This section provides the rules for determining the taxation of amounts received from an employer-established plan which provides for distributions that are taxable under section 72 (or for distributions that are taxable under section 402 (a)(2) or (e), or section 403(a)(2), in the case of lump sum distributions) and which also provides for distributions that may be excludable from gross income under section 104 or 105 as accident or health benefits. For example, this section will apply to a pension plan described in section 401 and exempt under section 501 which provides for the payment of pensions at retirement and the payment of an earlier pension in the event of permanent disability. This section will also apply to a profit-sharing plan described in section 401 and exempt under section 501 which provides for periodic distribution of the amount standing to the account of a participant during any period that the participant is absent from work due to a personal injury or sickness and for the distribution of any balance standing to the account of the participant upon his separation from service. For purposes of this section, the term “contributions of the employee” includes contributions by the employer which were includible in the employee's gross income. Paragraphs (d), (h), and (i) of this section apply for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
(b)
General rule.
Section 72 does not apply to any amount received as an accident or health benefit, and the tax treatment of any such amount shall be determined under sections 104 and 105. See paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, paragraph (d) of § 1.104-1, and §§ 1.105-1 through 1.105-5. Section 72 (or, in the case of certain total distributions, section 402(a)(2) or section 403(a)(2)) does apply to any amount which is received under a plan to which this section applies and which is not an accident or health benefit. See paragraph (e) of this section.
(c)
Accident or health benefits attributable to employee contributions.
(1) If a plan to which this section applies provides that any portion of the accident or health benefits is attributable to the contributions of the employee to such plan, then such portion of such benefits is excludable from gross income under section 104(a)(3) and paragraph (d) of § 1.104-1. Neither section 72 nor section 105 applies to any accident or health benefits (whether paid before or after retirement) attributable to contributions of the employee. Since such portion is excludable under section 104(a)(3), such portion is not subject to the dollar limitation of section 105(d) and if such portion is payable after the retirement of the employee, it is excludable without regard to the provisions of § 1.105-4 and section 72.
(2) In determining the taxation of any amounts received as accident or health benefits from a plan to which this section applies, the first step is to determine the portion, if any, of the contributions of the employee which is used to provide the accident or health benefits and the portion of the accident or health benefits attributable to such portion of the employee's contributions. If such a plan expressly provides that the accident or health benefits are provided in whole or in part by employee contributions and the portion of employee contributions to be used for such purpose, the contributions so used will be treated as used to provide accident or health benefits. However, if the plan does not expressly provide that the accident or health benefits are to be provided with employee contributions and the portion of employee contributions to be used for such purpose, it will be presumed that none of the employee contributions is used to provide such benefits. Thus, in the case of a contributory pension plan, it will be presumed that the disability pension is provided by employer contributions, unless the plan expressly provides otherwise, or in the case of a contributory profit-sharing plan providing that a portion of the amount standing to the account of each participant will be
used to purchase accident or health insurance, it will be presumed that such insurance is purchased with employer contributions, unless the plan expressly provides otherwise. Similarly, unless the plan expressly provides otherwise, it will be presumed that if a contributory profit-sharing plan provides for periodic distributions from the account of a participant during any absence from work because of a personal injury or sickness, all such distributions which do not exceed the contributions of the employer plus earnings thereon are provided by employer contributions.
(3) Any employee contributions that are treated under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph as used to provide accident or health benefits shall not be included for any purpose under section 72 as employee contributions or as aggregate premiums or other consideration paid. Thus, in the case of a pension plan, or in the case of a profit-sharing plan providing that a portion of the amount standing to the account of each participant will be used to purchase accident or health insurance, any employee whose contributions are so used must make the adjustment provided by this subparagraph irrespective of whether such employee receives any accident or health benefits under such plan. However, in the case of a profit-sharing plan providing for periodic distributions from the account of a participant during any absence from work because of a personal injury or sickness, an adjustment under this subparagraph is required only when an employee receives distributions in excess of the employer contributions and earnings thereon or receives distributions consisting in whole or in part of his own contributions.
(4) If any of the employee contributions are treated under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph as used to provide any of the accident or health benefits, the portion of the benefits attributable to employee contributions shall be determined in accordance with § 1.105-1. Any accident or health benefits that are excludable under section 104(a)(3) shall not be included in the expected return for purposes of section 72.
(d)
Accident or health benefits attributable to employer contributions.
Any amounts received as accident or health benefits and not attributable to contributions of the employee are includible in gross income except to the extent that the amounts are excludable from gross income under section 105(b) or (c) and the regulations under those sections. See § 1.402(a)-1(e) for rules relating to the use of a qualified plan under section 401(a) to pay premiums for accident or health insurance.
(e)
Other benefits under the plan.
The taxability of amounts that are received under a plan to which this section applies and that are not accident or health benefits is determined under section 72 (or, in the case of certain total distributions, under section 402(a)(2) or section 403(a)(2)) without regard to any exclusion or inclusion of accident or health benefits under sections 104 and 105. For example, the investment in the contract or aggregate premiums paid is determined without regard to the exclusion of any amount under section 104 or 105, and the annuity starting date is determined without regard to the receipt of any accident or health benefits. However, if any employee contributions are used to provide any accident or health benefits, the investment in the contract or aggregate premiums paid must be adjusted as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(f) [Reserved]
(g)
Payments to or on behalf of a self-employed individual.
A self-employed individual is not considered an employee for purposes of section 105, relating to amounts received by employees under accident and health plans, nor for purposes of excluding under section 104(a)(3) amounts received by him under an accident and health plan as referred to in section 105(e). See section 105(g) and paragraph (a) of § 1.105-1. Therefore, the other paragraphs of this section are not applicable to amounts received by or on behalf of a self-employed individual. Except where accident or health benefits are provided through an insurance contract or an arrangement having the effect of insurance, all amounts received by or on behalf of a self-employed individual from a plan described in section 401(a) and exempt under section 501(a) or a plan described in section 403(a) shall be
taxed as otherwise provided in section 72, 402, or 403. If the accident or health benefits are paid under an insurance contract or under an arrangement having the effect of insurance, section 104(a)(3) shall apply. Section 72 shall not apply to any amounts received under such circumstances.
(h)
Medical benefits for retired employees, etc.
See § 1.402(a)-1(e)(2) for rules relating to the payment of medical benefits described in section 401(h) under a qualified pension or annuity plan.
(i)
Special rules
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of section 72(b) and (d) and this section, the taxpayer must maintain such records as are necessary to substantiate the amount treated as an investment in the taxpayer's annuity contract.
(2)
Delegation to Commissioner.
The Commissioner may prescribe a form and instructions with respect to the taxpayer's past and current treatment of amounts received under section 72 or 105, and the taxpayer's computation, or recomputation, of the taxpayer's investment in his or her annuity contract. This form may be required to be filed with the taxpayer's returns for years in which the amounts are excluded under section 72 or 105.

§ 1.72-16
Life insurance contracts purchased under qualified employee plans.
(a)
Applicability of section.
This section provides rules for the tax treatment of premiums paid under qualified pension, annuity, or profit-sharing plans for the purchase of life insurance contracts and rules for the tax treatment of the proceeds of such a life insurance contract and of annuity contracts purchased under such plans. For purposes of this section, the term “life insurance contract” means a retirement income, an endowment, or other contract providing life insurance protection. The rules of this section apply to plans covering only common-law employees as well as to plans covering self-employed individuals.
(b)
Treatment of cost of life insurance protection.
(1) The rules of this paragraph are applicable to any life insurance contract—
(i) Purchased as a part of a plan described in section 403(a), or
(ii) Purchased by a trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a) if the proceeds of such contract are payable directly or indirectly to a participant in such trust or to a beneficiary of such participant.
The proceeds of a contract described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph will be considered payable indirectly to a participant or beneficiary of such participant where they are payable to the trustee but under the terms of the plan the trustee is required to pay over all of such proceeds to the beneficiary.
(2) If under a plan or trust described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, amounts which were allowed as a deduction under section 404, or earnings of the trust, are applied toward the purchase of a life insurance contract described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the cost of the life insurance protection under such contract shall be included in the gross income of the participant for the taxable year or years in which such contributions or earnings are so applied.
(3) If the amount payable upon death at any time during the year exceeds the cash value of the insurance policy at the end of the year, the entire amount of such excess is considered current life insurance protection. The cost of such insurance will be considered to be a reasonable net premium cost, as determined by the Commissioner, for such amount of insurance for the appropriate period.
(4) The amount includible in the gross income of the employee under this paragraph shall be considered as premiums or other consideration paid or contributed by the employee only with respect to any benefits attributable to the contract (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(3) of § 1.72-2) providing the life insurance protection. However, if under the rules of this paragraph an owner-employee is required to include any amounts in his gross income, such amounts shall not
in any case be treated as part of his investment in the contract.
(5) The determination of the cost of life insurance protection may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
An annual premium policy purchased by a qualified trust for a common-law employee provides an annuity of $100 per month upon retirement at age 65, with a minimum death benefit of $10,000. The insurance payable if death occurred in the first year would be $10,000. The cash value at the end of the first year is 0. The net insurance is therefore $10,000 minus 0, or $10,000. Assuming that the Commissioner has determined that a reasonable net premium cost for the employee's age is $5.85 per $1,000, the premium for $10,000 of life insurance is therefore $58.50, and this is the amount to be reported as income by the employee for his taxable year in which the premium is paid. The balance of the premium is the amount contributed for the annuity, which is not taxable to the employee under a plan meeting the requirements of section 401(a), except as provided under section 402(a). Assuming that the cash value at the end of the second year is $500, the net insurance would then be $9,500 for the second year. With a net 1-year term rate of $6.30 for the employee's age in the second year, the amount to be reported as income to the employee would be $59.85.
(6) This paragraph shall not apply if the trust has a right under any circumstances to retain any part of the proceeds of the life insurance contract. But see paragraph (c)(4) of this section relating to the taxability of the distribution of such proceeds to a beneficiary.
(c)
Treatment of proceeds of life insurance and annuity contracts.
(1) If under a qualified pension, annuity, or profit-sharing plan, there is purchased either—
(i) A life insurance contract described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and the employee either paid the cost of the insurance or was taxable on the cost of the insurance under paragraph (b) of this section, or
(ii) An annuity contract,
the amounts payable under any such contract by reason of the death of the employee are taxable under the rules of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, except in the case of a joint and survivor annuity.
(2)(i) In the case of an annuity contract, the death benefit is the accumulation of the premiums (plus earnings thereon) which is intended to fund pension or other deferred benefits under a pension, annuity, or profit-sharing plan. Such death benefits are not in the nature of life insurance and are not excludable from gross income under section 101(a).
(ii) In the case of a life insurance contract under which there is a reserve accumulation which is intended to fund pension or other deferred benefits under a pension, annuity, or profit-sharing plan, such reserve accumulation constitutes the source of the cash value of the contract and approximates the amount of such cash value. The portion of the proceeds paid upon the death of the insured employee which is equal to the cash value immediately before death is not excludable from gross income under section 101(a). The remaining portion, if any, of the proceeds paid to the beneficiary by reason of the death of the insured employee—that is, the amount in excess of the cash value—constitutes current insurance protection and is excludable under section 101(a).
(iii) The death benefit under an annuity contract, or the portion of the death proceeds under a life insurance contract which is equal to the cash value of the contract immediately before death, constitutes a distribution under the plan consisting in whole or in part of deferred compensation and is taxable to the beneficiary in accordance with section 72(m)(3) and the provisions of this paragraph, except to the extent that the limited exclusion from income provided in section 101(b) is applicable.
(iv) In the case of a life insurance contract under which the benefits are paid at a date or dates later than the death of the employee, section 101(d) is applicable only to the portion of the benefits which is attributable to the amount excludable under section 101(a). The portion of such benefits which is attributable to the cash value of the contract immediately before death is taxable under section 72, and in such case, any amount excludable under section 101(b) is treated as additional consideration paid by the employee in accordance with section 101(b)(2)(D).
(3) The application of the rules under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph with respect to the taxability of proceeds of a life insurance contract paid by reason of the death of an insured common-law employee who has paid no contributions under the plan is illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Total face amount of the contract payable in a lump sum at time of death
$25,000
Cash value of the contract immediately before death
11,000
Excess over cash value, excludable under section 101(a)
14,000
Cash value subject to limited exclusion under section 101(b)
11,000
Excludable under section 101(b) (assuming that there is no other death benefit paid by or on behalf of any employer with respect to the employee)
5,000
Balance taxable in accordance with section 402(a)(2) or 403(a)(2) (assuming a total distribution in one taxable year of the distributee)
6,000
Portion of premiums taxed to employee under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section and considered as contributions of the employee
940
Balance taxable as long-term capital gain
5,060

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example (1), except that the contract provides that the beneficiary may elect within 60 days after the death of the employee either to take the $25,000 or to receive 10 annual installments of $3,000 each, and the beneficiary elects to receive the 10 installments. In addition, the employee's rights to the cash value immediately before his death were forfeitable at least to the extent of $5,000. Section 101(d) is applicable to the amount excludable under section 101(a), that is, $14,000. The portion of each annual installment of $3,000 which is attributable to this $14,000 is determined by allocating each installment in accordance with the ratio which this $14,000 bears to the total amount which was payable at death ($25,000). Accordingly, the portion of each annual installment which is subject to section 101(d) is $1,680 (
14/25
of $3,000), of which $1,400 (
1/10
of $14,000) is excludable under section 101(a), and the remaining $280 is includible in the gross income of the beneficiary. However, if the beneficiary is a surviving spouse as defined in section 101(d)(3), the exclusion provided by section 101(d)(1)(B) is applicable to such $280. The remaining portion of each annual $3,000 installment, $1,320, is attributable to the cash value of the contract and is treated under section 72, as follows:
Amount actually contributed by the employee
0
Amount considered contributed by employee by reason of section 101(b)
$5,000
Portion of premiums taxed to employee under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section and considered as contributions of the employee
$940
Investment in the contract
$5,940
Expected return, 10 × $1,320
$13,200
Exclusion ratio, $5,940 ÷ $13,200
0.45
Annual exclusion, 0.45 × $1,320
$594
Accordingly, $594 of the $1,320 portion of each annual installment is excludable each year under section 72, and the remaining $726 is includible. Thus, if the beneficiary is not a surviving spouse, a total of $1,006 ($280 plus $726) of each annual $3,000 installment is includible in income each year. If the beneficiary is a surviving spouse, and can exclude all of the $280 under section 101(d)(1)(B), the amount includible in gross income each year is $726 of each annual $3,000 installment.
(4) If an employee neither paid the total cost of the life insurance protection provided under a life insurance contract, nor was taxable under paragraph (b) of this section with respect thereto, no part of the proceeds of such a contract which are paid to the beneficiaries of the employee as a death benefit is excludable under section 101(a). The entire distribution is taxable to the beneficiaries under section 402(a) or 403(a) except to the extent that a limited exclusion may be allowable under section 101(b).
[T.D. 6676, 28 FR 10135, Sept. 17, 1963]
§ 1.72-17
Special rules applicable to owner-employees.
(a)
In general.
Under section 401(c) and section 403(a), certain self-employed individuals may participate in qualified pension, annuity, and profit-sharing plans, and the amounts received by such individuals from such plans are taxable under section 72. Section 72(m) and this section contain special rules for the taxation of amounts received from qualified pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plans covering an owner-employee. For purposes of section 72 and the regulations thereunder, the term “employee” shall include the self-employed individual who is treated as an employee by section 401(c)(1) (see paragraph (b) of § 1.401-10), and the term “owner-employee” has the meaning assigned to it in section 401(c)(3) (see paragraph (d) of § 1.401-10). See also paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.401-10 for the rule for determining when a plan covers an owner-employee. For purposes of this section, a self-employed individual
may not treat as consideration for the contract contributed by the employee any contributions under the plan for which deductions were allowed under section 404 and which, consequently, are considered employer contributions.
(b)
Certain amounts received before annuity starting date.
(1) The rules of this paragraph are applicable to amounts received from a qualified pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan by an employee (or his beneficiary) who is or was an owner-employee with respect to such plan when such amounts—
(i) Are received before the annuity starting date; and
(ii) Are not received as an annuity.
For the definition of annuity starting date, see paragraph (b) of § 1.72-4 and subparagraph (4) of this paragraph. As to what constitutes amounts not received as an annuity, see paragraphs (c) and (d) of § 1.72-11.
(2) Amounts to which this paragraph applies shall be included in the recipient's gross income for the taxable year in which received. However, the sum of the amounts so included under this subparagraph in all taxable years shall not exceed the aggregate deductions allowed under section 404 for premiums or other consideration paid under the plan on behalf of the employee while he was an owner-employee, including any such deductions taken in the taxable year of receipt.
(3) Any amounts to which this paragraph applies and which are not includible in gross income under the rules of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall be subject to the provisions of section 72(e) and § 1.72-11. However, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, section 72(e)(3), as in effect before such date, shall not apply to such amounts. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, such amounts (other than amounts subject to a penalty under section 72(m)(5) and paragraph (e) of this section) may be taken into account in computations under sections 1301 through 1305 (relating to income averaging).
(4) Under section 401(d)(4), a qualified pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan may not provide for distributions to an owner-employee before he reaches age 59
1/2
years, except in the case of his earlier disability. Therefore, in the case of a distribution from a qualified plan to an individual for whom contributions have been made to the plan as an owner-employee, the annuity starting date cannot be prior to the time such individual attains the age 59
1/2
years unless he is entitled to benefits before reaching such age because of his disability. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, see section 72(m)(7) and paragraph (f) of this section for the meaning of disabled. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, see section 213(g)(3) for the meaning of disabled.
(5) The rules of this paragraph are not applicable to amounts credited to an individual in his capacity as a policy-holder of an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract which are in the nature of a dividend or refund of premium, and which are applied in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of § 1.404(a)-8 towards the purchase of benefits under the policy.
(6) The rules of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
B, a self-employed individual, received $8,000 as a distribution under a qualified pension plan before the annuity starting date. At the time of such distribution, $10,000 had been contributed (the whole amount being allowed as a deduction) under the plan on behalf of such individual while he was a common-law employee and $5,000 had been contributed under the plan on his behalf while he was an owner-employee, of which $2,500 was allowed as a deduction. In addition, B had contributed $1,000 on his own behalf as an employee under the plan. Of the $8,000, $2,500 (the amount allowed as a deduction with respect to contributions on behalf of the individual while he was an owner-employee) is includable in gross income under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. With respect to the remaining $5,500, B has a basis of $3,500, consisting of the $2,500 contributed on his behalf while he was an owner-employee which was not allowed as a deduction and the $1,000 which B contributed as an employee. The difference between the $5,500 and B's basis of $3,500, or $2,000, is includable in gross income under section 72(e).
(c)
Amounts paid for life, accident, health, or other insurance.
Amounts used to purchase life, accident, health, or other insurance protection for an owner-employee shall not be taken into account in computing the following:
(1) The aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid for the contract for purposes of determining the investment in the contract under section 72(c)(1)(A) and § 1.72-6;
(2) The consideration for the contract contributed by the employee for purposes of section 72(d)(1) and § 1.72-13, which provide the method of taxing employees' annuities where the employee's contributions will be recoverable within 3 years; and
(3) The aggregate premiums or other consideration paid for purposes of section 72(e)(1)(B) and § 1.72-11, which provide the rules for taxing amounts not received as annuities prior to the annuity starting date.
The cost of such insurance protection will be considered to be a reasonable net premium cost, as determined by the Commissioner, for the appropriate period.
(d)
Amounts constructively received.
(1) If during any taxable year an owner-employee assigns or pledges (or agrees to assign or pledge) any portion of his interest in a trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a), or any portion of the value of a contract purchased as part of a plan described in section 403(a), such portion shall be treated as having been received by such owner-employee as a distribution from the trust or as an amount received under the contract during such taxable year.
(2) If during any taxable year an owner-employee receives, either directly or indirectly, any amount from any insurance company as a loan under a contract purchased by a trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a) or purchased as part of a plan described in section 403(a), and issued by such insurance company, such amount shall be treated as an amount received under the contract during such taxable year. An owner-employee will be considered to have received an amount under a contract if a premium, which is otherwise in default, is paid by the insurance company in the form of a loan against the cash surrender value of the contract. Further, an owner-employee will be considered to have received an amount to which this subparagraph applies if an amount is received from the issuer of a face-amount certificate as a loan under such a certificate purchased as part of a qualified trust or plan.
(e)
Penalties applicable to certain amounts received by owner-employees.
(1)(i) The rules of this paragraph are applicable to amounts, to the extent includable in gross income, received from a trust described in section 401(a) or under a plan described in section 403(a) by or on behalf of an individual who is or has been an owner-employee with respect to such plan or trust—
(
a
) Which are received before the owner-employee reaches the age 59
1/2
years and which are attributable to contributions paid on behalf of such owner-employee (whether or not paid by him) while he was an owner-employee (see subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph),
(
b
) Which are in excess of the benefits provided for such owner-employee under the plan formula (see subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph), or
(
c
) Which are received by reason of a distribution of the owner-employee's entire interest under the provisions of section 401(e)(2)(E), relating to excess contributions on behalf of an owner-employee which are willfully made.
(ii) The amounts referred to in subdivision (i)(
a
) of this subparagraph do not include—
(
a
) Amounts received by reason of the owner-employee becoming disabled, or
(
b
) Amounts received by the owner-employee in his capacity as a policy-holder of an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract which are in the nature of a dividend or similar distribution.
Amounts attributable to contributions paid on behalf of an owner-employee and which are paid to a person other than the owner-employee before the owner-employee dies or reaches the age 59
1/2
shall be considered received by the owner-employee for purposes of this paragraph. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, see section 72(m)(7) and paragraph (f) of this section for the meaning of disabled. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, see section 213(g)(3) for the meaning of disabled. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1968, if an amount is not included in the amounts
referred to in subdivision (i)(
a
) of this subparagraph solely by reason of the owner-employee becoming disabled and if a penalty would otherwise be applicable with respect to all or a portion of such amount, then for the taxable year in which such amount is received, there must be submitted with the owner-employee's income tax return a doctor's statement as to the impairment, and a statement by the owner-employee with respect to the effect of such impairment upon his substantial gainful activity and the date such impairment occurred. For taxable years which are subsequent to the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1968, with respect to which the statements referred to in the preceding sentence are submitted, the owner-employee may, in lieu of such statements, submit a statement declaring the continued existence (without substantial diminution) of the impairment and its continued effect upon his substantial gainful activity.
(iii) This paragraph applies to amounts described in subdivision (i)(
b
) of this subparagraph (relating to excess benefits) even though a portion of such amounts may be attributable to contributions made on behalf of an individual while he was not an owner-employee and even though the amounts are received by his successor. However, these amounts do not include the portion of a distribution to which section 402(a)(2) or 403(a)(2) (relating to certain total distributions in one taxable year) applies.
(iv)(
a
) For purposes of subdivision (i)(
a
) of this subparagraph, the portion of any distribution or payment attributable to contributions on behalf of an employee-participant while he was an owner-employee includes the contributions made on his behalf while he was an owner-employee and the increments in value attributable to such contributions.
(
b
) The increments in value of an individual's account may be allocated to contributions on his behalf while he was an owner-employee either by maintaining a separate account, or an accounting, which reflects the actual increment attributable to such contributions, or by the method described in (
c
) of this subdivision.
(
c
) Where an individual is covered under the same plan both as an owner-employee and as a nonowner-employee, the portion of the increment in value of his interest attributable to contributions made on his behalf while he was an owner-employee may be determined by multiplying the total increment in value in his account by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the total contributions made on behalf of the individual as an owner-employee, weighted for the number of years that each contribution was in the plan. The denominator is the total contributions made on behalf of the individual, whether or not an owner-employee, weighted for the number of years each contribution was in the plan. The contributions are weighted for the number of years in the plan by multiplying each contribution by the number of years it was in the plan. For purposes of this computation, any forfeiture allocated to the account of the individual is treated as a contribution to the account made at the time so allocated.
(
d
) The method described in (
c
) of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
B was a member of the XYZ Partnership and a participant in the partnership's profit-sharing plan which was created in 1963. Until the end of 1967, B's interest in the partnership was less than 10 percent. On January 1, 1968, B obtained an interest in excess of 10 percent in the partnership and continued to participate in the profit-sharing plan until 1972. During 1972, prior to the time he attained the age of 59
1/2
years and during a time when he was not disabled, B withdrew his entire interest in the profit-sharing plan. At that time his interest was $15,000, $9,600 contributions and $5,400 increment attributable to the contributions. The portion of the increment attributable to contributions while B was an owner-employee is $667.80, determined as follows:

$5,400 × (5,800 ÷ 46,900) = $667.80
(2)(i) If the aggregate of the amounts to which this paragraph applies received by any person in his taxable year equals or exceeds $2,500 the tax with respect to such amount shall be the greater of—
(
a
) The increase in tax attributable to the inclusion of the amounts so received in his gross income for the taxable year in which received, or
(
b
) 110 percent of the aggregate increase in taxes, for such taxable year and the four immediately preceding taxable years, which would have resulted if such amounts had been included in such person's gross income ratably over such taxable years. However, if deductions were allowed under section 404 for contributions to the plan on behalf of the individual as an owner-employee for less than four prior taxable years (whether or not consecutive), the number of immediately preceding taxable years taken into account shall be the number of prior taxable years in which such deductions were allowed.
(ii) If the aggregate of the amounts to which this paragraph applies received by any person in his taxable year is less than $2,500, the tax with respect to such amounts shall be 110 percent of the increase in tax which results from including such amounts in the person's gross income for the taxable year in which received.
(3)(i) For purposes of making the ratable inclusion computations of subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph, the taxable income of the recipient for each taxable year involved (notwithstanding section 63, relating to definition of taxable income) shall be treated as being not less than the amount required to be treated as includible in the taxable year pursuant to the ratable inclusion.
(ii) For purposes of subparagraph (2)(i)(
a
) and (ii) of this paragraph, the recipient's taxable income (notwithstanding section 63, relating to definition of taxable income) shall be treated as being not less than the aggregate of the amounts to which this paragraph applies reduced by the deductions allowed the recipient for such taxable year under section 151 (relating to deductions for personal exemptions).
(iii) In any case in which the application of subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph results in an increase in taxable income for any taxable year, the resulting increase in taxes imposed by section 1 or 3 for such taxable year shall be reduced by the credits against tax provided by section 31 (tax withheld on wages) and section 39 (certain uses of gasoline and lubricating oil), but shall not be reduced by any other credits against tax.
(4) The application of the rules of subparagraph (2)(i) and (3) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
B, a sole proprietor and a calendar-year basis taxpayer, established a qualified pension trust to which he made annual contributions for 10 years of 10 percent of his earned income. B withdrew his entire interest in the trust during 1973 when he was 55 years old and not disabled and for which, without regard to the distribution, he had a net operating loss and for which he is allowed under section 151 a deduction for one personal exemption. The portion of the distribution includible in B's gross income is $25,750. In addition, B had a net operating loss for 1972. The other 3 taxable years involved in the computation under subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph were years of substantial income. For purposes of determining B's increase in tax attributable to the receipt of the $25,750 (before the application of the provisions of subparagraph (2)(i)(
b
) of this paragraph), B's taxable income for the year he received the $25,750 is treated, under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph, as being $25,000 ($25,750 minus $750, the amount of the deduction allowed for each personal exemption under section 151 for 1973). For purposes of determining whether 110 percent of the aggregate increase in taxes which would have resulted if 20 percent
of the amount of the withdrawal had been included in B's gross income for the year of receipt and for each of the 4 preceding taxable years is greater (and thus is the amount of his increase in tax attributable to the receipt of the $25,750), B's taxable income for the taxable year of receipt, and for the immediately preceding taxable year, is treated, under subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph, as being $5,150 ($25,750 divided by 5).
(f)
Meaning of disabled.
(1) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, section 72(m)(7) provides that an individual shall be considered to be disabled if he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration. In determining whether an individual's impairment makes him unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity, primary consideration shall be given to the nature and severity of his impairment. Consideration shall also be given to other factors such as the individual's education, training, and work experience. The substantial gainful activity to which section 72(m)(7) refers is the activity, or a comparable activity, in which the individual customarily engaged prior to the arising of the disability (or prior to retirement if the individual was retired at the time the disability arose).
(2) Whether or not the impairment in a particular case constitutes a disability is to be determined with reference to all the facts in the case. The following are examples of impairments which would ordinarily be considered as preventing substantial gainful activity:
(i) Loss of use of two limbs;
(ii) Certain progressive diseases which have resulted in the physical loss or atrophy of a limb, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or Buerger's disease;
(iii) Diseases of the heart, lungs, or blood vessels which have resulted in major loss of heart or lung reserve as evidenced by X-ray, electrocardiogram, or other objective findings, so that despite medical treatment breathlessness, pain, or fatigue is produced on slight exertion, such as walking several blocks, using public transportation, or doing small chores;
(iv) Cancer which is inoperable and progressive;
(v) Damage to the brain or brain abnormality which has resulted in severe loss of judgment, intellect, orientation, or memory;
(vi) Mental diseases (e.g. psychosis or severe psychoneurosis) requiring continued institutionalization or constant supervision of the individual;
(vii) Loss or diminution of vision to the extent that the affected individual has a central visual acuity of no better than 20/200 in the better eye after best correction, or has a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual fields subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees;
(viii) Permanent and total loss of speech;
(ix) Total deafness uncorrectible by a hearing aid.
The existence of one or more of the impairments described in this subparagraph (or of an impairment of greater severity) will not, however, in and of itself always permit a finding that an individual is disabled as defined in section 72(m)(7). Any impairment, whether of lesser or greater severity, must be evaluated in terms of whether it does in fact prevent the individual from engaging in his customary or any comparable substantial gainful activity.
(3) In order to meet the requirements of section 72(m)(7), an impairment must be expected either to continue for a long and indefinite period or to result in death. Ordinarily, a terminal illness because of disease or injury would result in disability. Indefinite is used in the sense that it cannot reasonably be anticipated that the impairment will, in the foreseeable future, be so diminished as no longer to prevent substantial gainful activity. For example, an individual who suffers a bone fracture which prevents him from working for an extended period of time will not be considered disabled, if his recovery can be expected in the foreseeable future; if the fracture persistently fails to knit, the individual would ordinarily be considered disabled.
(4) An impairment which is remediable does not constitute a disability within the meaning of section 72(m)(7). An individual will not be deemed disabled if, with reasonable effort and
safety to himself, the impairment can be diminished to the extent that the individual will not be prevented by the impairment from engaging in his customary or any comparable substantial gainful activity.
(g)
Years to which this section applies.
This section applies to taxable years ending before September 3, 1974. For taxable years ending after September 2, 1974, see § 1.72-17A.
[T.D. 6676, 28 FR 10136, Sept. 17, 1963, as amended by T.D. 6885, 31 FR 7800, June 2, 1966; T.D. 6985, 33 FR 19811, Dec. 27, 1968; T.D. 7114, 36 FR 9018, May 18, 1971; T.D. 7636, 44 FR 47049, Aug. 10, 1979]
§ 1.72-17A
Special rules applicable to employee annuities and distributions under deferred compensation plans to self-employed individuals and owner-employees.
(a)
In general.
Section 72(m) and this section contain special rules for the taxation of amounts received from qualified pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plans covering an owner-employee. This section applies to such amounts for taxable years of the recipient ending after September 2, 1974, unless another date is specified. For purposes of this section, the term “employee” shall include the self-employed individual who is treated as an employee by section 401(c)(1), and the term “owner-employee” has the meaning assigned to it in section 401(c)(3). Paragraph (b) of this section provides rules dealing with the computation of consideration paid by self-employed individuals and paragraph (c) of this section provides rules dealing with such computation when insurance is purchased for owner-employees. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for constructive receipt and, for purposes of these rules, treats as an owner-employee an individual for whose benefit an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408 (a) or (b) is maintained after December 31, 1974. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for penalties provided by section 72(m)(5) with respect to certain distributions received by owner-employees or their successors. Paragraph (f) of this section provides rules for determining whether a person is disabled within the meaning of section 72(m)(7). See § 1.72-16, relating to life insurance contracts purchased under qualified employee plans, for rules under section 72(m)(3).
(b)
Computation of consideration paid by self-employed individuals.
Under section 72(m)(2), consideration paid or contributed for the contract by any self-employed individual shall for purposes of section 72 be deemed not to include any contributions paid or contributed under a plan described in paragraph (a), or any other plan of deferred compensation described in section 404(a) (whether or not qualified), if the contributions are—
(1) Paid under such plan with respect to a time during which the employee was an employee only by reason of sections 401(c)(1) and 404(a)(8), and
(2) Deductible under section 404 by the employer, including an employer within the meaning of sections 401(c)(4) and 404(a)(8), of such self-employed individual at the time of such payment, or subsequent to such time of payment.
For purposes of this paragraph the term “consideration paid or contributed for the contract” has the same meaning as under subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Amounts paid for life, accident, health, or other insurance.
Under section 72(m)(2), amounts used to purchase life, accident, health, or other insurance protection for an owner-employee shall not be taken into account in computing the following:
(1) The aggregate amount of premiums or other consideration paid for the contract for purposes of determining the investment in the contract under section 72(c)(1)(A) and § 1.72-6;
(2) The consideration for the contract contributed by the employee for purposes of section 72(d)(1) and § 1.72-13, which provide the method of taxing employee's annuities where the employee's contributions will be recoverable within 3 years; and
(3) The aggregate premiums or other consideration paid for purposes of section 72(e)(1)(B) and § 1.72-11, which provide the rules for taxing amounts not received as annuities prior to the annuity starting date.
The cost of such insurance protection will be considered to be a reasonable net premium cost, as determined by
the Commissioner, for the appropriate period.
(d)
Amounts constructively received.
(1) The references in this paragraph (d) to section 72(m)(4) are to that section as in effect on August 13, 1982. Section 236(b)(1) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (96 Stat. 324) repealed section 72(m)(4), generally effective for assignments, pledges and loans made after August 13, 1982, and added section 72(p). See section 72(p) and § 1.72(p)-1 for rules governing the income tax treatment of certain assignments, pledges and loans from qualified employer plans made after August 13, 1982.
(2) Under section 72(m)(4)(A), if during any taxable year an owner-employee assigns or pledges (or agrees to assign or pledge) any portion of his interest in a trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a), or any portion of the value of a contract purchased as part of a plan described in section 403(a), such portion shall be treated as having been received by such owner-employee as a distribution from the trust or as an amount received under the contract during such taxable year.
(3)(i) Under paragraphs (4)(A) and (6) of section 72(m), if after December 31, 1974, during any taxable year an individual for whose benefit an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408 (a) or (b) is maintained assigns or pledges (or agrees to assign or pledge) any portion of his interest in such account or annuity, such portion shall be treated as having been received by such individual as a distribution from such account or trust during such taxable year. See subsections (d) and (f) of section 408 and the regulations thereunder for the tax treatment of an amount treated as a distribution under this subparagraph.
(ii) Notwithstanding subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, if an individual retirement account or annuity, or portion thereof, is subject to the additional tax imposed by section 408(f), that amount shall be deemed not to be a distribution under section 72(m)(4)(A) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(4) Under section 72(m)(4)(B), if during any taxable year an owner-employee receives, either directly or indirectly, any amount from any insurance company as a loan under a contract purchased by a trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a) or purchased as part of a plan described in section 403(a), and issued by such insurance company, such amount shall be treated as an amount received under the contract during such taxable year. An owner-employee will be considered to have received an amount under a contract if a premium, which is otherwise in default, is paid by the insurance company in the form of a loan against the cash surrender value of the contract. Further, an owner-employee will be considered to have received an amount to which this subparagraph applies if an amount is received from the issuer of a face-amount certificate as a loan under such a certificate purchased as part of a qualified trust or plan.
(e)
Penalties applicable to certain amounts received with respect to owner-employees under section 72(m)(5).
(1)(i) For taxable years of the recipient beginning after December 31, 1975, if any person receives an amount to which subparagraph (2) of this paragraph applies, his tax under Chapter 1 for the taxable year in which such amount is received shall be increased by an amount equal to 10 percent of the portion of the amount so received which is includible in his gross income for such taxable year.
(ii) For taxable years of the recipient beginning before January 1, 1976, see subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(2)(i) This subparagraph is applicable to amounts, to the extent includible in gross income, received from a qualified trust described in section 401(a) or under a plan described in section 403(a) by or on behalf of an individual who is or has been an owner-employee with respect to such trust or plan—
(A) Which are received before the owner-employee reaches the age of 59
1/2
years, and which are attributable to contributions paid on behalf of such owner-employee by his employer (that is employer contributions within the meaning of section 401(c)(5)(A) and the increments in value attributable to such employer contributions) and the increments in value attributable to
contributions made by him as an owner-employee while he was an owner-employee (that is, the increments attributable to owner-employee contributions within the meaning of section 401(c)(5)(B), but not such contributions; see subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph).
(B) Which are in excess of the benefits provided for such owner-employee under the plan formula (see subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph), or
(C) Which are subject to the transitional rules with respect to willful excess contributions made on behalf of an owner-employee in his employer's taxable years which begin before January 1, 1976 (see subdivision (v) of this subparagraph).
(ii) The amounts referred to in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph do not include—
(A) Amounts received by reason of the owner-employee becoming disabled (see paragraph (f) of this section).
(B) Amounts received by the owner-employee in his capacity as a policyholder of an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract which are in the nature of a dividend or similar distribution, or
(C) Amounts attributable to contributions (and increments in value thereon) made for years for which the recipient was not an owner-employee.
If an amount is not included in the amounts referred to in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph solely by reason of the owner-employee's becoming disabled and if a penalty would otherwise be applicable with respect to all or a portion of such amount, then for the owner-employee's taxable year in which such amount is received, there must be submitted with his income tax return a doctor's statement as to the impairment, and a statement by the owner-employee with respect to the effect of such impairment upon his substantial gainful activity and the date such impairment occurred. For taxable years which are subsequent to the first taxable year with respect to which the statements referred to in the preceding sentence are submitted, the owner-employee may, in lieu of such statements, submit a statement declaring the continued existence (without substantial diminution) of the impairment and its continued effect upon his substantial gainful activity.
(iii) This subparagraph applies to amounts described in subdivision (i)(B) of this subparagraph (relating to benefits in excess of the plan formula) even though a portion of such amounts may be attributable to contributions made on behalf of an individual while he was not an owner-employee and even if he is deceased and the amounts are received by his successor.
(iv)(A) The rules described in subdivisions (i)(A) and (iii) of this subparagraph, relating to the treatment under section 72(m)(5)(A)(i) of certain premature distributions, may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
(1) A was a member of the X partnership, consisting of partners A through I, and a participant in the partnership's qualified profit-sharing plan which was established on January 1, 1972. A's taxable years, the X partnership's taxable years, the plan years, and other relevant years are all calendar years at all relevant times. For the three calendar years, 1972 through 1974, A was an owner-employee in the X partnership. On January 1, 1975, new partners J and K became partners in the X partnership, and as of that date, each of partners A through K held a
1/11
interest in the capital and profits of the X partnership. On that date, A became a partner who was not an owner-employee. A continued in this status for the 2 calendar years 1975 and 1976. On January 1, 1977, when A was 50 years old and not disabled, he liquidated his interest in the X partnership and became an employee of an unrelated employer. On that date, A received a distribution representing his entire interest in the X partnership's plan of $54,000 cash in violation of the plan provision required by section 401(d)(4)(B). As of that date, the distribution was attributable to the following sources and times, computed by the plan in a manner consistent with the subparagraph:
Calendar years

(
3
) Subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph does not apply to the contributions made by X on behalf of A for 1976 and 1975 ($7,500 each year, totaling $15,000) nor to the increments in value attributable to those contributions ($900 for 1976 and $4,000 for 1975, totaling $4,900), because A was not an owner-employee with respect to these two years, 1976 and 1975, on account of which these employer contributions were made. For the same reason, subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph does not apply to the increments in value attributable to A's contributions for 1976 and 1975 ($300 and $1,300, respectively, totaling $1,600).
See section 4972(c) for the amount of employee contributions which is permitted to be contributed by an owner-employee (as an employee) without subjecting an owner-employee to the tax on excess contributions.
(
4
) Subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph does not apply to the contributions made by A, as an employee during the years when he was an owner-employee ($2,500 during each of the years 1972, 1973, and 1974, totaling $7,500), because the distribution was received in a taxable year of A ending after September 2, 1974; see subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. Furthermore, because the distribution of the amount of A's contributions ($12,500) constitutes consideration for the contract paid by A for purposes of section 72, the $7,500 amount described in the preceding sentence is not includible in his gross income, and that amount is not subject to the rules of this subparagraph; see subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(B) The increments in value of an individual's account may be allocated to contributions on his behalf, by his employer or by such individual as an owner-employee, while he was an owner-employee either by maintaining a separate account, or an accounting, which reflects the actual increment attributable to such contributions, or by the method described in (C) of this subdivision.
(C) Where an individual is covered under the same plan both as an owner-employee and as a non-owner-employee, the portion of the increment in value of his interest attributable to contributions made on his behalf while he was an owner-employee may be determined by multiplying the total increment in value in his account by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the total contributions made on behalf of the individual as an owner-employee, weighted for the number of years that each contribution was in the plan. The denominator is the total contributions made on behalf of the individual, whether or not as an owner-employee, weighted for the number of years each contribution was in the plan. The contributions are weighted
for the number of years in the plan by multiplying each contribution by the number of years it was in the plan. For purposes of this computation, any forfeiture allocated to the account of the individual is treated as a contribution to the account made at the time so allocated. For purposes of this computation, where the individual has received a prior distribution from such account, an appropriate adjustment must be made to reflect such prior distribution.
(D) The method described in (C) of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
B was a member of the XYZ Partnership and a participant in the partnership's profit-sharing plan which was created in 1973. Until the end of 1977, B's interest in the partnership was less than 10 percent. On January 1, 1978, B obtained an interest in excess of 10 percent in the partnership and continued to participate in the profit-sharing plan until 1982. During 1982, prior to the time he attained the age of 59
1/2
years and during a time when he was not disabled, B, who had not received any prior plan distributions, withdrew his entire interest in the profit-sharing plan. At the time his interest was $15,000, $9,600 contributions and $5,400 increment attributable to the contributions. The portion of the increment attributable to contributions while B was an owner-employee is $667.80, determined as follows:

(E)(
1
) The rules set forth in subdivision (iv)(E)(
2
) of this subparagraph shall be used to determine the amounts to which subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph applies in the case of a distribution of less than the entire balance of the employee's account from a plan in which he has been covered at different times as owner-employee or as an employee other than an owner-employee.
(
2
) Distributions or payments from a plan for any employee taxable year shall be deemed to be attributable to contributions to the plan, and increments thereon, in the following order—
(
i
) Excess contributions, within the meaning of section 4972 (b), designated as such by the trustee;
(
ii
) Employee contributions;
(
iii
) Employer contributions, other than those described in (
i
), and the increments in value attributable to the employee's own contributions and his employer's contributions on the basis of the taxable years of his employer in succeeding order of time whether or not the employee was an owner-employee for any such year.
For purposes of (
iii
) of this subdivision, the time of contributions made on the basis of any employer taxable year shall take into account the rule specified in section 404(a)(6), relating to time when contributions deemed made.
(v) The amounts referred to in subdivision (i)(C) of this subparagraph are amounts which are received by reason of a distribution of the owner-employee's entire interest under the provisions of section 401(e)(2)(E), as in effect on September 1, 1974, relating to excess contributions on behalf of an owner-employee which are willfully made. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an owner-employee's entire interest in all plans with respect to which he is an owner-employee (within the meaning of subsections (d)(8)(C) and (e)(2)(E)(ii) of section 401, as in effect on September 1, 1974) does not include any distribution or payment attributable to his employer's contributions or his own contributions made with respect to his employer's taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975. However, his entire interest in all plans does include all of the distribution or payment attributable to his employer's contributions and his own contributions made with respect to all of his employer's taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, if any portion thereof is attributable in whole or
in part to such a willful excess contribution and such entire interest is received because of a willful excess contribution pursuant to section 401(e)(2)(E)(ii). A distribution or payment is described in the preceding sentence even though it is received in an owner-employee's taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975. For purposes of computing the increments in value attributable to employer taxable years which begin before January 1, 1976, and such increments attributable to such years beginning after December 31, 1975, the rules specified in subdivision (iv)(B), (C), (D), and (E) of this subparagraph shall be applied to the extent applicable.
(3)(i) For taxable years of the recipient beginning before January 1, 1976, the tax with respect to amounts to which subparagraph (2) of this paragraph applies shall be computed under subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E) of section 72(m)(5) as such subparagraphs were in effect prior to the amendments made by subsections (g)(1) and (2)(A) of section 2001 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 957) except as provided in subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph (see paragraph (e) of § 1.72-17). For purposes of the preceding sentence, amounts to which subparagraph (2) of this paragraph applies in the case of an amount described in section 72(m)(5)(A)(i) shall be determined under subdivisions (i)(
a
) and (ii) of § 1.72-17(e)(1), except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. For purposes of the first sentence of this subdivision, amounts to which subparagraph (2) of this paragraph applies in the case of an amount described in section 72(m)(5)(A)(ii) shall be determined under subdivisions (i)(
b
) and (iii) of § 1.72-17(e)(1), except as provided in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph.
(ii) For purposes of applying section 72(m)(5)(A)(i), after the amendment made by section 2001(h)(3) of such Act, and subdivisions (i)(
a
) and (ii) of § 1.72-17(e)(1), to a distribution or payment received in recipient taxable years ending after September 2, 1974, and beginning before January 1, 1976, with respect to contributions made on behalf of an owner-employee which were made by him as an owner-employee (that is, employee contributions within the meaning of section 401(c)(5)(B)) the portion of any distribution or payment attributable to such contributions shall not include such contributions but shall include the increments in value attributable to such contributions.
(iii) For purposes of applying section 72(m)(5)(D) and subdivisions (i)(
b
) and (iii) of § 1.72-17(e)(1) to recipient taxable years beginning after December 31, 1973, and beginning before January 1, 1976, in the case of distributions or payments made after December 31, 1973, the amounts to which section 402 (a)(2) or 403(a)(2) applies after the amendments made by section 2005(b) (1) and (2) of such Act (88 Stat. 990 and 991) (which are amounts to which subdivision (i)(
b
) of § 1.72-17(e)(1) does not apply) shall be deemed to be the amount which is treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than 6 months under either of such sections.
(f)
Meaning of disabled.
(1) Section 72(m)(7) provides that an individual shall be considered to be disabled if he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration. In determining whether an individual's impairment makes him unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity, primary consideration shall be given to the nature and severity of his impairment. Consideration shall also be given to other factors such as the individual's education, training, and work experience. The substantial gainful activity to which section 72(m)(7) refers is the activity, or a comparable activity, in which the individual customarily engaged prior to the arising of the disability or prior to retirement if the individual was retired at the time the disability arose.
(2) Whether or not the impairment in a particular case constitutes a disability is to be determined with reference to all the facts in the case. The following are examples of impairments which would ordinarily be considered as preventing substantial gainful activity:
(i) Loss of use of two limbs;
(ii) Certain progressive diseases which have resulted in the physical loss or atrophy of a limb, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or Buerger's disease;
(iii) Diseases of the heart, lungs, or blood vessels which have resulted in major loss of heart or lung reserve as evidenced by X-ray, electrocardiogram, or other objective findings, so that despite medical treatment breathlessness, pain, or fatigue is produced on slight exertion, such as walking several blocks, using public transportation, or doing small chores;
(iv) Cancer which is inoperable and progressive;
(v) Damage to the brain or brain abnormality which has resulted in severe loss of judgment, intellect, orientation, or memory;
(vi) Mental diseases (e.g. psychosis or severe psychoneurosis) requiring continued institutionalization or constant supervision of the individual;
(vii) Loss or diminution of vision to the extent that the affected individual has a central visual acuity of no better than 20/200 in the better eye after best correction, or has a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual fields subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees;
(viii) Permanent and total loss of speech;
(ix) Total deafness uncorrectible by a hearing aid.
The existence of one or more of the impairments described in this subparagraph (or of an impairment of greater severity) will not, however, in and of itself always permit a finding that an individual is disabled as defined in section 72(m)(7). Any impairment, whether of lesser or greater severity, must be evaluated in terms of whether it does in fact prevent the individual from engaging in his customary or any comparable substantial gainful activity.
(3) In order to meet the requirements of section 72(m)(7), an impairment must be expected either to continue for a long and indefinite period or to result in death. Ordinarily, a terminal illness because of disease or injury would result in disability. The term “indefinite” is used in the sense that it cannot reasonably be anticipated that the impairment will, in the foreseeable future, be so diminished as no longer to prevent substantial gainful activity. For example, an individual who suffers a bone fracture which prevents him from working for an extended period of time will not be considered disabled, if his recovery can be expected in the foreseeable future; if the fracture persistently fails to knit, the individual would ordinarily be considered disabled.
(4) An impairment which is remediable does not constitute a disability within the meaning of section 72(m)(7). An individual will not be deemed disabled if, with reasonable effort and safety to himself, the impairment can be diminished to the extent that the individual will not be prevented by the impairment from engaging in his customary or any comparable substantial gainful activity.

§ 1.72-18
Treatment of certain total distributions with respect to self-employed individuals.
(a)
In general.
The Self-Employed Individuals Tax Retirement Act of 1962 permits self-employed individuals to be treated as employees for purposes of participation in pension, profit-sharing, and annuity plans described in sections 401(a) and 403(a). In general, amounts received by a distributee or payee which are attributable to contributions made on behalf of a participant while he was self-employed are taxed in the same manner as amounts which are attributable to contributions made on behalf of a common-law employee. However, such amounts which are paid in one taxable year representing the total distributions payable to a distributee or payee with respect to an employee are not eligible for the capital gains treatment of section 402(a)(2) or 403(a)(2). This section sets forth the treatment of such distributions, except where such a distribution is subject to the penalties of section 72(m)(5) and paragraph (e) of § 1.72-17.
(b)
Distributions to which this section applies.
(1)(i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, this section applies to amounts
distributed to a distributee in one taxable year of the distributee in the case of an employees' trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt under section 501(a), or to amounts paid to a payee in one taxable year of the payee in the case of an annuity plan described in section 403(a), which constitute the total distributions payable, or the total amounts payable, to the distributee or payee with respect to an employee.
(ii) For the total distributions or amounts payable to a distributee or payee to be considered paid within one taxable year of the distributee or payee for purposes of this section, all amounts to the credit of the employee-participant through the end of such taxable year which are payable to the distributee or payee must be distributed or paid within such taxable year. Thus, the provisions of this section are not applicable to a distribution or payment to a distributee or payee if the trust or plan retains any amounts after the close of such taxable year which are payable to the same distributee or payee even though the amounts retained may be attributable to contributions on behalf of the employee-participant while he was a common-law employee in the business with respect to which the plan was established.
(iii) For purposes of this section, the total amounts payable to a distributee or the amounts to the credit of the employee do not include United States Retirement Plan Bonds held by a trust to the credit of the employee. Thus, a distribution to a distributee by a qualified trust may constitute a distribution to which this section applies even though the trust retains retirement plan bonds registered in the name of the employee on whose behalf the distribution is made which are to be distributed to the same distributee. Moreover, the proceeds of a retirement bond received as part of a distribution which constitutes the total distributions payable to the distributee are not entitled to the special tax treatment of this section.
(iv) If the amounts payable to a distributee from a qualified trust with respect to an employee-participant includes an annuity contract, such contract must be distributed along with all other amounts payable to the distributee in order to have a distribution to which this section applies. However, the proceeds of an annuity contract received in a total distribution will not be entitled to the tax treatment of this section unless the contract is surrendered in the taxable year of the distributee in which the total distribution was received.
(v) In the case of a qualified annuity plan, the term “total amounts” means all annuities payable to a payee. If more than one annuity contract is received under the plan by a distributee, this section shall not apply to an amount received on surrender of any such contracts unless all contracts under the plan payable to the payee are surrendered within one taxable year of the payee.
(vi)(
a
) The provisions of this section are applicable where the total amounts payable to a distributee or payee are paid within one taxable year of the distributee or payee whether or not a portion of the employee-participant's interest which is payable to another distributee or payee is paid within the same taxable year. However, a distributee or payee who, in prior taxable years received amounts (except amounts described in (
b
) of this subdivision) after the employee-participant ceases to be eligible for additional contributions to be made on his behalf, does not receive a distribution or payment to which this section applies, even though the total amount remaining to be paid to such distributee or payee with respect to such employee is paid within one taxable year. On the other hand, a distribution to a distributee or payee prior to the time that the employee-participant ceases to be eligible for additional contributions on his behalf does not preclude the application of this section to a later distribution to the same distributee or payee.
(
b
) The receipt of an amount which constitutes—
(
1
) A payment in the nature of a dividend or similar distribution to an individual in his capacity as a policyholder of an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract, or
(
2
) A return of excess contributions which were not willfully made,
does not prevent the application of this section to a total distribution even though the amount is received after the employee-participant ceases to be eligible for additional contributions and in a taxable year other than the taxable year in which the total amount is received.
(vii) For purposes of this section, the total amounts payable to a distributee or payee, or the amounts to the credit of the employee, do not include any amounts which have been placed in a separate account for the funding of medical benefits described in section 401(h) as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.401-14. Thus, a distribution by a qualified trust or annuity plan may constitute a distribution to which this section applies even though amounts attributable to the funding of section 401(h) medical benefits as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.401-14 are not so distributed.
(2) This section shall apply—
(i) Only if the distribution or payment is made—
(
a
) On account of the employee's death at any time,
(
b
) After the employee has attained the age 59
1/2
years, or
(
c
) After the employee has become disabled; and
(ii) Only to so much of the distribution or payment as is attributable to contributions made on behalf of an employee while he was a self-employed individual in the business with respect to which the plan was established. Any distribution or payment, or any portion thereof, which is not so attributable shall be subject to the rules of taxation which apply to any distribution or payment that is attributable to contributions on behalf of common-law employees.
For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, see section 72(m)(7) and paragraph (f) of § 1.72-17 for the meaning of disabled. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, see section 213(g)(3) for the meaning of disabled. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1968, if this section is applicable by reason of the distribution or payment being made after the employee has become disabled, then for the taxable year in which the amounts to which this section applies are distributed or paid, there shall be submitted with the recipient's income tax return a doctor's statement as to the nature and effect of the employee's impairment.
(3) This section shall not apply to—
(i) Distributions or payments to which the penalty provisions of section 72(m)(5) and paragraph (e) of § 1.72-17 apply,
(ii) Distributions or payments from a trust or plan made to or on behalf of an individual prior to the time such individual ceases to be eligible for additional contributions (except the contribution attributable to the last year of service) to be made to the trust or plan on his behalf as a self-employed individual, and
(iii) Distributions or payments made to the employee from a plan or trust unless contributions which were allowed as a deduction under section 404 have been made on behalf of such employee as a self-employed individual under such trust or plan for 5 or more taxable years (whether or not consecutive) prior to the taxable year in which such distributions or payments are made. Distributions or payments to which this section does not apply by reason of this subdivision are taxed as otherwise provided in section 72. However, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, section 72(e)(3), as in effect before such date, is not applicable. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, such distributions or payments may be taken into account in computations under sections 1301 through 1305 (relating to income averaging).
(4) The portion of any distribution or payment attributable to contributions on behalf of an employee-participant while he was self-employed includes the contributions made on his behalf while he was self-employed and the increments in value attributable to such contributions. Where the amounts to the credit of an employee-participant include amounts attributable to contributions on his behalf while he was a self-employed individual and amounts attributable to contributions on his behalf while he was a common-law employee, the increment in value attributable to the employee-participant's
interest shall be allocated to the contributions on his behalf while he was self-employed either by maintaining a separate account, or an accounting, which reflects the actual increment attributable to such contributions, or by the method described in paragraph (e)(1)(iv)(
c
) of § 1.72-17. However, if the latter method is used, the numerator of the fraction is the total contributions made on behalf of the individual as a self-employed individual, weighted for the number of years that each contribution was in the plan.
(c)
Amounts includible in gross income.
(1) Where a total distribution or payment to which this section applies is made to one distributee or payee and includes the total amount remaining to the credit of the employee-participant on whose behalf the distribution or payment was made, the distributee or payee shall include in gross income an amount equal to the portion of the distribution or payment which exceeds the employee-participant's investment in the contract. For purposes of this paragraph, the investment in the contract shall be reduced by any amounts previously received from the plan or trust by or on behalf of the employee-participant which were excludable from gross income as a return of the investment in the contract.
(2) In the case of a distribution to which this section applies and which is made to more than one distributee or payee, each element of the amounts to the credit of an employee-participant shall be allocated among the several distributees or payees on the basis of the ratio of the value of the distributee's or payee's distribution or payment to the total amount to the credit of the employee-participant. The elements to be so allocated include the investment in the contract, the increments in value, and the portion of the amounts to the credit of the employee-participant which is attributable to the contributions on behalf of the employee-participant while he was a self-employed individual.
(d)
Computation of tax.
(1) The tax attributable to the amounts to which this section applies for the taxable year in which such amounts are received is the greater of—
(i) 5 times the increase in tax which would result from the inclusion in gross income of the recipient of 20 percent of so much of the amount so received as is includible in gross income, or
(ii) 5 times the increase which would result if the taxable income of the recipient for such taxable year equaled 20 percent of the excess of the aggregate of the amounts so received and includible in gross income over the amount of the deductions allowed the recipient for such taxable year under section 151 (relating to deduction for personal exemptions).
In any case in which the application of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph results in an increase in taxable income for any taxable year, the resulting increase in taxes imposed by section 1 or 3 for such taxable year shall be reduced by the credit against tax provided by section 31 (tax withheld on wages), but shall not be reduced by any other credits against tax.
(2) The application of the rules of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
B, a sole proprietor and a calendar-year basis taxpayer, established a qualified pension trust to which he made annual contributions for 10 years of 10 percent of his earned income. B withdrew his entire interest in the trust during 1973, for which year, without regard to the distribution, he had a net operating loss and is allowed under section 151 a deduction for one personal exemption. At the time of the withdrawal, B was 64 years old. The amount of the distribution that is includible in his gross income is $25,750. Because of B's net operating loss, the tax attributable to the distribution is determined under the rule of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph. For purposes of determining the tax attributable to the $25,750, B's taxable income for 1973 is treated, under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, as being 20 percent of $25,000 ($25,750 minus $750, the amount of the deduction allowed for each personal exemption under section 151 for 1973). Thus, under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the tax attributable to the $25,750 would be 5 times the increase which would result if the taxable income of B for the taxable year he received such amount equaled $5,000. B has had no amounts withheld from wages and thus is not entitled to reduce the increase in taxes by the credit against tax provided in section 31 and may not reduce
the increase in taxes by any other credits against tax.

§ 1.72(e)-1T
Treatment of distributions where substantially all contributions are employee contributions (temporary).
Q-1: How did the Tax Reform Act (TRA) of 1984 change the law with regard to the treatment of non-annuity distributions (
i.e.
, amounts distributed prior to the annuity starting date and not received as annuities) from a qualified plan that is treated as a single contract under section 72 and under which substantially all of the contributions are employee contributions?
A-1: (a) Prior to the amendment of section 72(e) by the TRA of 1984, non-annuity distributions from such a qualified plan generally were allocable, first, to nondeductible employee contributions and thus were not includible in gross income. After distributions equaled the balance of nondeductible employee contributions, further non-annuity distributions generally were includible in gross income.
(b) Pursuant to section 72(e)(7), as added by the TRA of 1984, non-annuity distributions from such a qualified plan that are allocable to investment in the plan after August 13, 1982 (as determined in accordance with section 72(e)(5)(B)), generally will be treated, first, as allocable to income and, second, as allocable to nondeductible employee contributions. Distributions allocable to income are includible in gross income. Distributions allocable to nondeductible employee contributions are not includible in gross income.
Q-2: To which qualified plans and contracts does section 72(e)(7) apply?
A-2: Section 72(e)(7) applies to any plan or contract under which substantially all of the contributions are employee contributions if—
(a) Such plan is described in section 401(a) and the related trust or trusts are exempt from tax under section 501(a); or
(b) Such contract is—
(1) Purchased by a trust described in (a) above,
(2) Purchased as part of a plan described in section 403(a), or
(3) Described in section 403(b).
Q-3: What is the definition of a qualified plan or contract under which substantially all of the contributions are employee contributions?
A-3: (a) A qualified plan or contract under which substantially all of the contributions are employee contributions is a plan or contract with respect to which 85 percent or more of the total contributions during the “representative period” are employee contributions. The “representative period” means the five-plan-year period preceding the plan year during which a distribution occurs. However, if less than 85 percent of the total contributions for all plan years during which the plan or contract is in existence prior to the plan year of distribution are employee contributions, then the plan or contract is not one with respect to which substantially all of the contributions are employee contributions.
(b) For purposes of the 85 percent test, contributions made to a predecessor plan or contract are aggregated with contributions made to the plan or contract to which the 85 percent test is being applied (the successor plan or contract). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a predecessor plan or contract is a plan or contract the terms of which are substantially the same as the successor plan or contract.
Q-4: What is the definition of employee contributions for purposes of section 72(e)(7)?
A-4: For purposes of section 72(e)(7), employee contributions are those amounts contributed by the employee and those amounts considered contributed by the employee under section 72(f). For example, amounts contributed to a section 401(k) qualified cash or deferred arrangement, pursuant to an employee's election to defer such amounts, are employer contributions to the extent that such amounts are not currently includible in gross income. In addition, deductible employee contributions under section 72(o) are disregarded in their entirety (
i.e.
, treated as neither employee contributions nor employer contributions) in
determining whether substantially all the contributions are employee contributions.
Q-5: How is the 85 percent test of section 72(e)(7) applied to a qualified plan or contract?
A-5: (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), the 85 percent test is applied separately with respect to each contract under section 72.
(b) If a single qualified plan described in section 401(a) or section 403(a) comprises more than one contract under section 72, regardless of whether such plan includes multiple trusts or combinations of profit-sharing and pension features, these contracts are aggregated for purposes of applying the 85 percent test. Thus, if substantially all of the contributions under a qualified plan comprising two contracts under section 72 are employee contributions, section 72(e)(5)(D) shall not apply to non-annuity distributions under either of the contracts.
(c) With respect to the plans maintained by the Federal Government or by instrumentalities of the Federal Government, the 85 percent test shall be applied by aggregating all such plans. This aggregation rule applies only to those plans that are actively administered by the Federal Government or an instrumentality thereof. Thus, if a plan of the Federal Government is administered by a commercial financial institution, it would not be aggregated with other plans of the Federal Government and its instrumentalities for purposes of applying the 85 percent test.
(d) In the case of a contract described in section 403(b), the 85 percent test is applied separately to each such contract.
Q-6: Is a loan from a qualified plan or contract described in section 72(e)(7) treated as a distribution under section 72(e)(4)(A)?
A-6: Yes. Pursuant to section 72(e)(4)(A), if an employee receives, either directly or indirectly, any amount as a loan from a qualified plan or contract described in section 72(e)(7), such amount shall be treated as a distribution from the plan or contract of an amount not received as an annuity. Similarly, if an employee assigns or pledges, or agrees to assign or pledge, any portion of the value of any qualified plan or contract, such portion shall be treated as a distribution from the plan or contract of an amount not received as an annuity.
Q-7: Does the five percent penalty for premature distributions from annuity contracts, as described in section 72(q), apply to distributions from a qualified plan or contract described in section 72(e)(7)?
A-7: No.
Q-8: When is section 72(e)(7) effective?
A-8: Section 72(e)(7) is effective for amounts received or loans made on or after October 17, 1984. For purposes of this effective date provision, loan amounts outstanding on October 16, 1984, which are renegotiated, extended, renewed, or revised after that date generally are treated as loans made on the date of the renegotiation, etc.

§ 1.72(p)-1
Loans treated as distributions.
The questions and answers in this section provide guidance under section 72(p) pertaining to loans from qualified employer plans (including government plans and tax-sheltered annuities and employer plans that were formerly qualified). The examples included in the questions and answers in this section are based on the assumption that a bona fide loan is made to a participant from a qualified defined contribution plan pursuant to an enforceable agreement (in accordance with paragraph (b) of Q
A-3 of this section), with adequate security and with an interest rate and repayment terms that are commercially reasonable. (The particular interest rate used, which is solely for illustration, is 8.75 percent compounded annually.) In addition, unless the contrary is specified, it is assumed in the examples that the amount of the loan does not exceed 50 percent of the participant's nonforfeitable account balance, the participant has no other outstanding loan (and had no prior loan) from the plan or any other plan maintained by the participant's employer or any other person required to be aggregated with the employer under section 414(b), (c) or (m),
and the loan is not excluded from section 72(p) as a loan made in the ordinary course of an investment program as described in Q
A-18 of this section. The regulations and examples in this section do not provide guidance on whether a loan from a plan would result in a prohibited transaction under section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or on whether a loan from a plan covered by title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 829) (ERISA) would be consistent with the fiduciary standards of ERISA or would result in a prohibited transaction under section 406 of ERISA. The questions and answers are as follows:
Q-1: In general, what does section 72(p) provide with respect to loans from a qualified employer plan?
A-1: (a)
Loans.
Under section 72(p), an amount received by a participant or beneficiary as a loan from a qualified employer plan is treated as having been received as a distribution from the plan (a deemed distribution), unless the loan satisfies the requirements of Q
A-3 of this section. For purposes of section 72(p) and this section, a loan made from a contract that has been purchased under a qualified employer plan (including a contract that has been distributed to the participant or beneficiary) is considered a loan made under a qualified employer plan.
(b)
Pledges and assignments.
Under section 72(p), if a participant or beneficiary assigns or pledges (or agrees to assign or pledge) any portion of his or her interest in a qualified employer plan as security for a loan, the portion of the individual's interest assigned or pledged (or subject to an agreement to assign or pledge) is treated as a loan from the plan to the individual, with the result that such portion is subject to the deemed distribution rule described in paragraph (a) of this Q
A-1. For purposes of section 72(p) and this section, any assignment or pledge of (or agreement to assign or to pledge) any portion of a participant's or beneficiary's interest in a contract that has been purchased under a qualified employer plan (including a contract that has been distributed to the participant or beneficiary) is considered an assignment or pledge of (or agreement to assign or pledge) an interest in a qualified employer plan. However, if all or a portion of a participant's or beneficiary's interest in a qualified employer plan is pledged or assigned as security for a loan from the plan to the participant or the beneficiary, only the amount of the loan received by the participant or the beneficiary, not the amount pledged or assigned, is treated as a loan.
Q-2: What is a qualified employer plan for purposes of section 72(p)?
A-2: For purposes of section 72(p) and this section, a qualified employer plan means—
(a) A plan described in section 401(a) which includes a trust exempt from tax under section 501(a);
(b) An annuity plan described in section 403(a);
(c) A plan under which amounts are contributed by an individual's employer for an annuity contract described in section 403(b);
(d) Any plan, whether or not qualified, established and maintained for its employees by the United States, by a State or political subdivision thereof, or by an agency or instrumentality of the United States, a State or a political subdivision of a State; or
(e) Any plan which was (or was determined to be) described in paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this Q
A-2.
Q-3: What requirements must be satisfied in order for a loan to a participant or beneficiary from a qualified employer plan not to be a deemed distribution?
A-3: (a)
In general.
A loan to a participant or beneficiary from a qualified employer plan will not be a deemed distribution to the participant or beneficiary if the loan satisfies the repayment term requirement of section 72(p)(2)(B), the level amortization requirement of section 72(p)(2)(C), and the enforceable agreement requirement of paragraph (b) of this Q
A-3, but only to the extent the loan satisfies the amount limitations of section 72(p)(2)(A).
(b)
Enforceable agreement requirement.
A loan does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph unless the loan is evidenced by a legally enforceable agreement (which may include more than one document) and the terms of
the agreement demonstrate compliance with the requirements of section 72(p)(2) and this section. Thus, the agreement must specify the amount and date of the loan and the repayment schedule. The agreement does not have to be signed if the agreement is enforceable under applicable law without being signed. The agreement must be set forth either—
(1) In a written paper document; or
(2) In a document that is delivered through an electronic medium under an electronic system that satisfies the requirements of § 1.401(a)-21 of this chapter.
Q-4: If a loan from a qualified employer plan to a participant or beneficiary fails to satisfy the requirements of Q
A-3 of this section, when does a deemed distribution occur?
A-4: (a)
Deemed distribution.
For purposes of section 72, a deemed distribution occurs at the first time that the requirements of Q
A-3 of this section are not satisfied, in form or in operation. This may occur at the time the loan is made or at a later date. If the terms of the loan do not require repayments that satisfy the repayment term requirement of section 72(p)(2)(B) or the level amortization requirement of section 72(p)(2)(C), or the loan is not evidenced by an enforceable agreement satisfying the requirements of paragraph (b) of Q
A-3 of this section, the entire amount of the loan is a deemed distribution under section 72(p) at the time the loan is made. If the loan satisfies the requirements of Q
A-3 of this section except that the amount loaned exceeds the limitations of section 72(p)(2)(A), the amount of the loan in excess of the applicable limitation is a deemed distribution under section 72(p) at the time the loan is made. If the loan initially satisfies the requirements of section 72(p)(2)(A), (B) and (C) and the enforceable agreement requirement of paragraph (b) of Q
A-3 of this section, but payments are not made in accordance with the terms applicable to the loan, a deemed distribution occurs as a result of the failure to make such payments. See Q
A-10 of this section regarding when such a deemed distribution occurs and the amount thereof and Q
A-11 of this section regarding the tax treatment of a deemed distribution.
(b)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules in paragraph (a) of this Q
A-4 and are based upon the assumptions described in the introductory text of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) A participant has a nonforfeitable account balance of $200,000 and receives $70,000 as a loan repayable in level quarterly installments over five years.
(ii) Under section 72(p), the participant has a deemed distribution of $20,000 (the excess of $70,000 over $50,000) at the time of the loan, because the loan exceeds the $50,000 limit in section 72(p)(2)(A)(i). The remaining $50,000 is not a deemed distribution.

# Example 2.
(i) A participant with a nonforfeitable account balance of $30,000 borrows $20,000 as a loan repayable in level monthly installments over five years.
(ii) Because the amount of the loan is $5,000 more than 50% of the participant's nonforfeitable account balance, the participant has a deemed distribution of $5,000 at the time of the loan. The remaining $15,000 is not a deemed distribution. (Note also that, if the loan is secured solely by the participant's account balance, the loan may be a prohibited transaction under section 4975 because the loan may not satisfy 29 CFR 2550.408b-1(f)(2).)

# Example 3.
(i) The nonforfeitable account balance of a participant is $100,000 and a $50,000 loan is made to the participant repayable in level quarterly installments over seven years. The loan is not eligible for the section 72(p)(2)(B)(ii) exception for loans used to acquire certain dwelling units.
(ii) Because the repayment period exceeds the maximum five-year period in section 72(p)(2)(B)(i), the participant has a deemed distribution of $50,000 at the time the loan is made.

# Example 4.
(i) On August 1, 2002, a participant has a nonforfeitable account balance of $45,000 and borrows $20,000 from a plan to be repaid over five years in level monthly installments due at the end of each month. After making monthly payments through July 2003, the participant fails to make any of the payments due thereafter.
(ii) As a result of the failure to satisfy the requirement that the loan be repaid in level monthly installments, the participant has a deemed distribution. See paragraph (c) of Q
A-10 of this section regarding when such a deemed distribution occurs and the amount thereof.
Q-5: What is a principal residence for purposes of the exception in section 72(p)(2)(B)(ii) from the requirement that a loan be repaid in five years?
A-5: Section 72(p)(2)(B)(ii) provides that the requirement in section 72(p)(2)(B)(i) that a plan loan be repaid within five years does not apply to a loan used to acquire a dwelling unit which will within a reasonable time be used as the principal residence of the participant (a principal residence plan loan). For this purpose, a principal residence has the same meaning as a principal residence under section 121.
Q-6: In order to satisfy the requirements for a principal residence plan loan, is a loan required to be secured by the dwelling unit that will within a reasonable time be used as the principal residence of the participant?
A-6: A loan is not required to be secured by the dwelling unit that will within a reasonable time be used as the participant's principal residence in order to satisfy the requirements for a principal residence plan loan.
Q-7: What tracing rules apply in determining whether a loan qualifies as a principal residence plan loan?
A-7: The tracing rules established under section 163(h)(3)(B) apply in determining whether a loan is treated as for the acquisition of a principal residence in order to qualify as a principal residence plan loan.
Q-8: Can a refinancing qualify as a principal residence plan loan?
A-8: (a)
Refinancings.
In general, no, a refinancing cannot qualify as a principal residence plan loan. However, a loan from a qualified employer plan used to repay a loan from a third party will qualify as a principal residence plan loan if the plan loan qualifies as a principal residence plan loan without regard to the loan from the third party.
(b)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules in paragraph (a) of this Q
A-8 and is based upon the assumptions described in the introductory text of this section:

# Example.
(i) On July 1, 2003, a participant requests a $50,000 plan loan to be repaid in level monthly installments over 15 years. On August 1, 2003, the participant acquires a principal residence and pays a portion of the purchase price with a $50,000 bank loan. On September 1, 2003, the plan loans $50,000 to the participant, which the participant uses to pay the bank loan.
(ii) Because the plan loan satisfies the requirements to qualify as a principal residence plan loan (taking into account the tracing rules of section 163(h)(3)(B)), the plan loan qualifies for the exception in section 72(p)(2)(B)(ii).
Q-9: Does the level amortization requirement of section 72(p)(2)(C) apply when a participant is on a leave of absence without pay?
A-9: (a)
Leave of absence.
The level amortization requirement of section 72(p)(2)(C) does not apply for a period, not longer than one year (or such longer period as may apply under section 414(u) and paragraph (b) of this Q
A-9), that a participant is on a
bona fide
leave of absence, either without pay from the employer or at a rate of pay (after applicable employment tax withholdings) that is less than the amount of the installment payments required under the terms of the loan. However, the loan (including interest that accrues during the leave of absence) must be repaid by the latest permissible term of the loan and the amount of the installments due after the leave ends must not be less than the amount required under the terms of the original loan.
(b)
Military service.
In accordance with section 414(u)(4), if a plan suspends the obligation to repay a loan made to an employee from the plan for any part of a period during which the employee is performing service in the uniformed services (as defined in 38 U.S.C. chapter 43), whether or not qualified military service, such suspension shall not be taken into account for purposes of section 72(p) or this section. Thus, if a plan suspends loan repayments for any part of a period during which the employee is performing military service described in the preceding sentence, such suspension shall not cause the loan to be deemed distributed even if the suspension exceeds one year and even if the term of the loan is extended. However, the loan will not satisfy the repayment term requirement of section 72(p)(2)(B) and the level amortization requirement of section 72(p)(2)(C) unless loan repayments resume upon the completion of such period of military service and the loan is repaid thereafter by amortization in substantially level installments over a period that ends not later than the latest permissible term of the loan.
(c)
Latest permissible term of a loan.
For purposes of this Q
A-9, the latest permissible term of a loan is the latest date permitted under section 72(p)(2)(B) (
i.e.,
five years from the date of the loan, assuming that the replacement loan does not qualify for the exception at section 72(p)(2)(B)(ii) for principal residence plan loans) plus any additional period of suspension permitted under paragraph (b) of this Q
A-9.
(d)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this Q
A-9 and are based upon the assumptions described in the introductory text of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) On July 1, 2003, a participant with a nonforfeitable account balance of $80,000 borrows $40,000 to be repaid in level monthly installments of $825 each over 5 years. The loan is not a principal residence plan loan. The participant makes 9 monthly payments and commences an unpaid leave of absence that lasts for 12 months. The participant was not performing military service during this period. Thereafter, the participant resumes active employment and resumes making repayments on the loan until the loan is repaid. The amount of each monthly installment is increased to $1,130 in order to repay the loan by June 30, 2008.
(ii) Because the loan satisfies the requirements of section 72(p)(2), the participant does not have a deemed distribution. Alternatively, section 72(p)(2) would be satisfied if the participant continued the monthly installments of $825 after resuming active employment and on June 30, 2008 repaid the full balance remaining due.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1,
except the participant was on leave of absence performing service in the uniformed services (as defined in chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code) for two years and the rate of interest charged during this period of military service is reduced to 6 percent compounded annually under 50 App. section 526 (relating to the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act Amendments of 1942). After the military service ends on April 2, 2006, the participant resumes active employment on April 19, 2006, continues the monthly installments of $825 thereafter, and on June 30, 2010, repays the full balance remaining due ($6,487).
(ii) Because the loan satisfies the requirements of section 72(p)(2) and paragraph (b) of this Q
A-9, the participant does not have a deemed distribution. Alternatively, section 72(p)(2) would also be satisfied if the amount of each monthly installment after April 19, 2006, is increased to $930 in order to repay the loan by June 30, 2010 (without any balance remaining due then).
Q-10: If a participant fails to make the installment payments required under the terms of a loan that satisfied the requirements of Q
A-3 of this section when made, when does a deemed distribution occur and what is the amount of the deemed distribution?
A-10: (a)
Timing of deemed distribution.
Failure to make any installment payment when due in accordance with the terms of the loan violates section 72(p)(2)(C) and, accordingly, results in a deemed distribution at the time of such failure. However, the plan administrator may allow a cure period and section 72(p)(2)(C) will not be considered to have been violated if the installment payment is made not later than the end of the cure period, which period cannot continue beyond the last day of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the required installment payment was due.
(b)
Amount of deemed distribution.
If a loan satisfies Q
A-3 of this section when made, but there is a failure to pay the installment payments required under the terms of the loan (taking into account any cure period allowed under paragraph (a) of this Q
A-10), then the amount of the deemed distribution equals the entire outstanding balance of the loan (including accrued interest) at the time of such failure.
(c)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Q
A-10 and is based upon the assumptions described in the introductory text of this section:

# Example.
(i) On August 1, 2002, a participant has a nonforfeitable account balance of $45,000 and borrows $20,000 from a plan to be repaid over 5 years in level monthly installments due at the end of each month. After making all monthly payments due through July 31, 2003, the participant fails to make the payment due on August 31, 2003 or any other monthly payments due thereafter. The plan administrator allows a three-month cure period.
(ii) As a result of the failure to satisfy the requirement that the loan be repaid in level installments pursuant to section 72(p)(2)(C), the participant has a deemed distribution on November 30, 2003, which is the last day of the three-month cure period for the August 31, 2003 installment. The amount of the deemed distribution is $17,157, which is the outstanding balance on the loan at November 30, 2003. Alternatively, if the plan administrator had allowed a cure period through
the end of the next calendar quarter, there would be a deemed distribution on December 31, 2003 equal to $17,282, which is the outstanding balance of the loan at December 31, 2003.
Q-11: Does section 72 apply to a deemed distribution as if it were an actual distribution?
A-11: (a)
Tax basis.
If the employee's account includes after-tax contributions or other investment in the contract under section 72(e), section 72 applies to a deemed distribution as if it were an actual distribution, with the result that all or a portion of the deemed distribution may not be taxable.
(b)
Section 72(t) and (m).
Section 72(t) (which imposes a 10 percent tax on certain early distributions) and section 72(m)(5) (which imposes a separate 10 percent tax on certain amounts received by a 5-percent owner) apply to a deemed distribution under section 72(p) in the same manner as if the deemed distribution were an actual distribution.
Q-12: Is a deemed distribution under section 72(p) treated as an actual distribution for purposes of the qualification requirements of section 401, the distribution provisions of section 402, the distribution restrictions of section 401(k)(2)(B) or 403(b)(11), or the vesting requirements of § 1.411(a)-7(d)(5) (which affects the application of a graded vesting schedule in cases involving a prior distribution)?
A-12: No; thus, for example, if a participant in a money purchase plan who is an active employee has a deemed distribution under section 72(p), the plan will not be considered to have made an in-service distribution to the participant in violation of the qualification requirements applicable to money purchase plans. Similarly, the deemed distribution is not eligible to be rolled over to an eligible retirement plan and is not considered an impermissible distribution of an amount attributable to elective contributions in a section 401(k) plan. See also § 1.402(c)-2(c)(3)and § 1.401(k)-1(d)(5)(iii).
Q-13: How does a reduction (offset) of an account balance in order to repay a plan loan differ from a deemed distribution?
A-13: (a)
Difference between deemed distribution and plan loan offset amount.
(1) Loans to a participant from a qualified employer plan can give rise to two types of taxable distributions—
(i) A deemed distribution pursuant to section 72(p); and
(ii) A distribution of an offset amount.
(2) As described in Q
A-4 of this section, a deemed distribution occurs when the requirements of Q
A-3 of this section are not satisfied, either when the loan is made or at a later time. A deemed distribution is treated as a distribution to the participant or beneficiary only for certain tax purposes and is not a distribution of the accrued benefit. A distribution of a plan loan offset amount (as defined in § 1.402(c)-2(g)(3)(i)) occurs when, under the terms governing a plan loan, the accrued benefit of the participant or beneficiary is reduced (offset) in order to repay the loan (including the enforcement of the plan's security interest in the accrued benefit). A distribution of a plan loan offset amount could occur in a variety of circumstances, such as where the terms governing the plan loan require that, in the event of the participant's request for a distribution, a loan be repaid immediately or treated as in default.
(b)
Plan loan offset.
In the event of a plan loan offset, the amount of the account balance that is offset against the loan is an actual distribution for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, not a deemed distribution under section 72(p). Accordingly, a plan may be prohibited from making such an offset under the provisions of section 401(a), 401(k)(2)(B) or 403(b)(11) prohibiting or limiting distributions to an active employee. See Example 6 in § 1.402(c)-2(g)(5)(vi). See also Q
A-19 of this section for rules regarding the treatment of a loan after a deemed distribution.
Q-14: How is the amount includible in income as a result of a deemed distribution under section 72(p) required to be reported?
A-14: The amount includible in income as a result of a deemed distribution under section 72(p) is required to be reported on Form 1099-R (or any other form prescribed by the Commissioner).
Q-15: What withholding rules apply to plan loans?
A-15: To the extent that a loan, when made, is a deemed distribution or an account balance is reduced (offset) to repay a loan, the amount includible in income is subject to withholding. If a deemed distribution of a loan or a loan repayment by benefit offset results in income at a date after the date the loan is made, withholding is required only if a transfer of cash or property (excluding employer securities) is made to the participant or beneficiary from the plan at the same time. See §§ 35.3405-1, f-4, and 31.3405(c)-1, Q
A-9 and Q
A-11, of this chapter for further guidance on withholding rules.
Q-16: If a loan fails to satisfy the requirements of Q
A-3 of this section and is a prohibited transaction under section 4975, is the deemed distribution of the loan under section 72(p) a correction of the prohibited transaction?
A-16: No, a deemed distribution is not a correction of a prohibited transaction under section 4975. See §§ 141.4975-13 and 53.4941(e)-1(c)(1) of this chapter for guidance concerning correction of a prohibited transaction.
Q-17: What are the income tax consequences if an amount is transferred from a qualified employer plan to a participant or beneficiary as a loan, but there is an express or tacit understanding that the loan will not be repaid?
A-17: If there is an express or tacit understanding that the loan will not be repaid or, for any reason, the transaction does not create a debtor-creditor relationship or is otherwise not a bona fide loan, then the amount transferred is treated as an actual distribution from the plan for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, and is not treated as a loan or as a deemed distribution under section 72(p).
Q-18: If a qualified employer plan maintains a program to invest in residential mortgages, are loans made pursuant to the investment program subject to section 72(p)?
A-18: (a) Residential mortgage loans made by a plan in the ordinary course of an investment program are not subject to section 72(p) if the property acquired with the loans is the primary security for such loans and the amount loaned does not exceed the fair market value of the property. An investment program exists only if the plan has established, in advance of a specific investment under the program, that a certain percentage or amount of plan assets will be invested in residential mortgages available to persons purchasing the property who satisfy commercially customary financial criteria. A loan will not be considered as made under an investment program if—
(1) Any of the loans made under the program matures upon a participant's termination from employment;
(2) Any of the loans made under the program is an earmarked asset of a participant's or beneficiary's individual account in the plan; or
(3) The loans made under the program are made available only to participants or beneficiaries in the plan.
(b) Paragraph (a)(3) of this Q
A-18 shall not apply to a plan which, on December 20, 1995, and at all times thereafter, has had in effect a loan program under which, but for paragraph (a)(3) of this Q
A-18, the loans comply with the conditions of paragraph (a) of this Q
A-18 to constitute residential mortgage loans in the ordinary course of an investment program.
(c) No loan that benefits an officer, director, or owner of the employer maintaining the plan, or their beneficiaries, will be treated as made under an investment program.
(d) This section does not provide guidance on whether a residential mortgage loan made under a plan's investment program would result in a prohibited transaction under section 4975, or on whether such a loan made by a plan covered by title I of ERISA would be consistent with the fiduciary standards of ERISA or would result in a prohibited transaction under section 406 of ERISA. See 29 CFR 2550.408b-1.
Q-19: If there is a deemed distribution under section 72(p), is the interest that accrues thereafter on the amount of the deemed distribution an indirect loan for income tax purposes and what effect does the deemed distribution have on subsequent loans?
A-19: (a)
General rule.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this Q
A-19, a deemed distribution of a loan is treated as a distribution for purposes of section
72. Therefore, a loan that is deemed to be distributed under section 72(p) ceases to be an outstanding loan for purposes of section 72, and the interest that accrues thereafter under the plan on the amount deemed distributed is disregarded for purposes of applying section 72 to the participant or the beneficiary. Even though interest continues to accrue on the outstanding loan (and is taken into account for purposes of determining the tax treatment of any subsequent loan in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Q
A-19), this additional interest is not treated as an additional loan (and thus, does not result in an additional deemed distribution) for purposes of section 72(p). However, a loan that is deemed distributed under section 72(p) is not considered distributed for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.
See
Q
A-11 through Q
A-16 of this section.
(b)
Effect on subsequent loans
—(1)
Application of section 72(p)(2)(A).
A loan that is deemed distributed under section 72(p) (including interest accruing thereafter) and that has not been repaid (such as by a plan loan offset) is considered outstanding for purposes of applying section 72(p)(2)(A) to determine the maximum amount of any subsequent loan to the participant or beneficiary.
(2)
Additional security for subsequent loans.
If a loan is deemed distributed to a participant or beneficiary under section 72(p) and has not been repaid (such as by a plan loan offset), then no payment made thereafter to the participant or beneficiary is treated as a loan for purposes of section 72(p)(2) unless the loan otherwise satisfies section 72(p)(2) and this section and either of the following conditions is satisfied:
(i) There is an arrangement among the plan, the participant or beneficiary, and the employer, enforceable under applicable law, under which repayments will be made by payroll withholding. For this purpose, an arrangement will not fail to be enforceable merely because a party has the right to revoke the arrangement prospectively.
(ii) The plan receives adequate security from the participant or beneficiary that is in addition to the participant's or beneficiary's accrued benefit under the plan.
(3)
Condition no longer satisfied.
If, following a deemed distribution that has not been repaid, a payment is made to a participant or beneficiary that satisfies the conditions in paragraph (b)(2) of this Q
A-19 for treatment as a plan loan and, subsequently, before repayment of the second loan, the conditions in paragraph (b)(2) of this Q
A-19 are no longer satisfied with respect to the second loan (for example, if the loan recipient revokes consent to payroll withholding), the amount then outstanding on the second loan is treated as a deemed distribution under section 72(p).
Q-20: May a participant refinance an outstanding loan or have more than one loan outstanding from a plan?
A-20: (a)
Refinancings and multiple loans
—(1)
General rule.
A participant who has an outstanding loan that satisfies section 72(p)(2) and this section may refinance that loan or borrow additional amounts if, under the facts and circumstances, the loans collectively satisfy the amount limitations of section 72(p)(2)(A) and the prior loan and the additional loan each satisfy the requirements of section 72(p)(2)(B) and (C) and this section. For this purpose, a refinancing includes any situation in which one loan replaces another loan.
(2)
Loans that repay a prior loan and have a later repayment date.
For purposes of section 72(p)(2) and this section (including the amount limitations of section 72(p)(2)(A)), if a loan that satisfies section 72(p)(2) is replaced by a loan (a replacement loan) and the term of the replacement loan ends after the latest permissible term of the loan it replaces (the replaced loan), then the replacement loan and the replaced loan are both treated as outstanding on the date of the transaction. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the latest permissible term of the replaced loan is the latest date permitted under section 72(p)(2)(C) (
i.e.,
five years from the original date of the replaced loan, assuming that the replaced loan does not qualify for the exception at section 72(p)(2)(B)(ii) for principal residence plan loans and that no additional period of suspension applied to the replaced loan under Q
A-9 (b) of this section). Thus, for example,
if the term of the replacement loan ends after the latest permissible term of the replaced loan and the sum of the amount of the replacement loan plus the outstanding balance of all other loans on the date of the transaction, including the replaced loan, fails to satisfy the amount limitations of section 72(p)(2)(A), then the replacement loan results in a deemed distribution. This paragraph (a)(2) does not apply to a replacement loan if the terms of the replacement loan would satisfy section 72(p)(2) and this section determined as if the replacement loan consisted of two separate loans, the replaced loan (amortized in substantially level payments over a period ending not later than the last day of the latest permissible term of the replaced loan) and, to the extent the amount of the replacement loan exceeds the amount of the replaced loan, a new loan that is also amortized in substantially level payments over a period ending not later than the last day of the latest permissible term of the replacement loan.
(b)
Examples.
The following examples illustrate the rules of this Q
A-20 and are based on the assumptions described in the introductory text of this section:

# Example 1.
(i) A participant with a vested account balance that exceeds $100,000 borrows $40,000 from a plan on January 1, 2005, to be repaid in 20 quarterly installments of $2,491 each. Thus, the term of the loan ends on December 31, 2009. On January 1, 2006, when the outstanding balance on the loan is $33,322, the loan is refinanced and is replaced by a new $40,000 loan from the plan to be repaid in 20 quarterly installments. Under the terms of the refinanced loan, the loan is to be repaid in level quarterly installments (of $2,491 each) over the next 20 quarters. Thus, the term of the new loan ends on December 31, 2010.
(ii) Under section 72(p)(2)(A), the amount of the new loan, when added to the outstanding balance of all other loans from the plan, must not exceed $50,000 reduced by the excess of the highest outstanding balance of loans from the plan during the 1-year period ending on December 31, 2005, over the outstanding balance of loans from the plan on January 1, 2006, with such outstanding balance to be determined immediately prior to the new $40,000 loan. Because the term of the new loan ends later than the term of the loan it replaces, under paragraph (a)(2) of this Q
A-20, both the new loan and the loan it replaces must be taken into account for purposes of applying section 72(p)(2), including the amount limitations in section 72(p)(2)(A). The amount of the new loan is $40,000, the outstanding balance on January 1, 2006, of the loan it replaces is $33,322, and the highest outstanding balance of loans from the plan during 2005 was $40,000. Accordingly, under section 72(p)(2)(A), the sum of the new loan and the outstanding balance on January 1, 2006, of the loan it replaces must not exceed $50,000 reduced by $6,678 (the excess of the $40,000 maximum outstanding loan balance during 2005 over the $33,322 outstanding balance on January 1, 2006, determined immediately prior to the new loan) and, thus, must not exceed $43,322. The sum of the new loan ($40,000) and the outstanding balance on January 1, 2006, of the loan it replaces ($33,322) is $73,322. Since $73,322 exceeds the $43,322 limit under section 72(p)(2)(A) by $30,000, there is a deemed distribution of $30,000 on January 1, 2006.
(iii) However, no deemed distribution would occur if, under the terms of the refinanced loan, the amount of the first 16 installments on the refinanced loan were equal to $2,907, which is the sum of the $2,491 originally scheduled quarterly installment payment amount under the first loan, plus $416 (which is the amount required to repay, in level quarterly installments over 5 years beginning on January 1, 2006, the excess of the refinanced loan over the January 1, 2006, balance of the first loan ($40,000 minus $33,322 equals $6,678)), and the amount of the 4 remaining installments was equal to $416. The refinancing would not be subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this Q
A-20 because the terms of the new loan would satisfy section 72(p)(2) and this section (including the substantially level amortization requirements of section 72(p)(2)(B) and (C)) determined as if the new loan consisted of 2 loans, one of which is in the amount of the first loan ($33,322) and is amortized in substantially level payments over a period ending December 31, 2009 (the last day of the term of the first loan) and the other of which is in the additional amount ($6,678) borrowed under the new loan. Similarly, the transaction also would not result in a deemed distribution (and would not be subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this Q
A-20) if the terms of the refinanced loan provided for repayments to be made in level quarterly installments (of $2,990 each) over the next 16 quarters.

# Example 2.
(i) The facts are the same as in
Example 1
(i), except that the applicable interest rate used by the plan when the loan is refinanced is significantly lower due to a reduction in market rates of interest and, under the terms of the refinanced loan, the amount of the first 16 installments on the refinanced loan is equal to $2,848 and the amount of the next 4 installments on the refinanced loan is equal to $406. The $2,848 amount is the sum of $2,442 to repay the first loan by December 31, 2009 (the term of the
first loan), plus $406 (which is the amount to repay, in level quarterly installments over 5 years beginning on January 1, 2006, the $6,678 excess of the refinanced loan over the January 1, 2006, balance of the first loan).
(ii) The transaction does not result in a deemed distribution (and is not subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this Q
A-20) because the terms of the new loan would satisfy section 72(p)(2) and this section (including the substantially level amortization requirements of section 72(p)(2)(B) and (C)) determined as if the new loan consisted of 2 loans, one of which is in the amount of the first loan ($33,322) and is amortized in substantially level payments over a period ending December 31, 2009 (the last day of the term of the first loan), and the other of which is in the additional amount ($6,678) borrowed under the new loan. The transaction would also not result in a deemed distribution (and not be subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this Q
A-20) if the terms of the new loan provided for repayments to be made in level quarterly installments (of $2,931 each) over the next 16 quarters.
Q-21: Is a participant's tax basis under the plan increased if the participant repays the loan after a deemed distribution?
A-21: (a)
Repayments after deemed distribution.
Yes, if the participant or beneficiary repays the loan after a deemed distribution of the loan under section 72(p), then, for purposes of section 72(e), the participant's or beneficiary's investment in the contract (tax basis) under the plan increases by the amount of the cash repayments that the participant or beneficiary makes on the loan after the deemed distribution. However, loan repayments are not treated as after-tax contributions for other purposes, including sections 401(m) and 415(c)(2)(B).
(b)
Example.
The following example illustrates the rules in paragraph (a) of this Q
A-21 and is based on the assumptions described in the introductory text of this section:

# Example.
(i) A participant receives a $20,000 loan on January 1, 2003, to be repaid in 20 quarterly installments of $1,245 each. On December 31, 2003, the outstanding loan balance ($19,179) is deemed distributed as a result of a failure to make quarterly installment payments that were due on September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2003. On June 30, 2004, the participant repays $5,147 (which is the sum of the three installment payments that were due on September 30, 2003, December 31, 2003, and March 31, 2004, with interest thereon to June 30, 2004, plus the installment payment due on June 30, 2004). Thereafter, the participant resumes making the installment payments of $1,245 from September 30, 2004 through December 31, 2007. The loan repayments made after December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2007 total $22,577.
(ii) Because the participant repaid $22,577 after the deemed distribution that occurred on December 31, 2003, the participant has investment in the contract (tax basis) equal to $22,577 (14 payments of $1,245 each plus a single payment of $5,147) as of December 31, 2007.
Q-22: When is the effective date of section 72(p) and the regulations in this section?
A-22: (a)
Statutory effective date.
Section 72(p) generally applies to assignments, pledges, and loans made after August 13, 1982.
(b)
Regulatory effective date.
This section applies to assignments, pledges, and loans made on or after January 1, 2002.
(c)
Loans made before the regulatory effective date
—(1)
General rule.
A plan is permitted to apply Q
A-19 and Q
A-21 of this section to a loan made before the regulatory effective date in paragraph (b) of this Q
A-22 (and after the statutory effective date in paragraph (a) of this Q
A-22) if there has not been any deemed distribution of the loan before the transition date or if the conditions of paragraph (c)(2) of this Q
A-22 are satisfied with respect to the loan.
(2)
Consistency transition rule for certain loans deemed distributed before the regulatory effective date.
(i) The rules in this paragraph (c)(2) of this Q
A-22 apply to a loan made before the regulatory effective date in paragraph (b) of this Q
A-22 (and after the statutory effective date in paragraph (a) of this Q
A-22) if there has been any deemed distribution of the loan before the transition date.
(ii) The plan is permitted to apply Q
A-19 and Q
A-21 of this section to the loan beginning on any January 1, but only if the plan reported, in Box 1 of Form 1099-R, for a taxable year no later than the latest taxable year that would be permitted under this section (if this section had been in effect for all loans made after the statutory effective date in paragraph (a) of this Q
A-22), a gross distribution of an amount at least equal to the initial default
amount. For purposes of this section, the initial default amount is the amount that would be reported as a gross distribution under Q
A-4 and Q
A-10 of this section and the transition date is the January 1 on which a plan begins applying Q
A-19 and Q
A-21 of this section to a loan.
(iii) If a plan applies Q
A-19 and Q
