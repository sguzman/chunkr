# Appendix D to Part 345—Ratings
a.
Ratings, in general.
In assigning a rating, the FDIC evaluates a bank's performance under the applicable performance criteria in this part, pursuant to §§ 345.21 and 345.28. The agency calculates an overall performance score for each State and multistate MSA, as applicable pursuant to § 345.28(c), and for the institution. The FDIC assigns a rating of “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve,” or “Substantial Noncompliance” for the bank's performance in each State and multistate MSA, as applicable pursuant to § 345.28(c), and for the institution that is nearest to the overall performance score, as follows:
Performance score
Rating
8.5 or more
Outstanding.
4.5 or more but less than 8.5
Satisfactory.
1.5 or more but less than 4.5
Needs to Improve.
Less than 1.5
Substantial Noncompliance.
The FDIC also considers any evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices pursuant to § 345.28(d) and the bank's past performance pursuant to § 345.28(e).
b.
Large bank ratings at the State, multistate MSA, and institution levels.
Subject to paragraph g of this appendix, the FDIC combines a large bank's performance scores for its State, multistate MSA, or institution-level performance under the Retail Lending Test in § 345.22, Retail Services and Products Test in § 345.23, Community Development Financing Test in § 345.24, and Community Development Services Test in § 345.25 to determine the bank's rating in each State or multistate MSA, as applicable pursuant to § 345.28(c), and for the institution.
1. The FDIC weights the performance scores as follows: Retail Lending Test (40 percent); Retail Services and Products Test (10 percent); Community Development Financing Test (40 percent); and Community Development Services Test (10 percent). The FDIC multiplies each of these weights by the bank's performance score on the respective performance test, and then adds the resulting values together to develop a State, multistate MSA, or institution-level performance score.
2. The FDIC assigns a rating corresponding with the rating category that is nearest to the State, multistate MSA, or institution performance score using the table in paragraph a of this appendix.
Example D-1:
A large bank received the following performance scores and conclusions in a State:
• On the Retail Lending Test, the bank received a 7.3 performance score and a corresponding conclusion of “High Satisfactory;”
• On the Retail Services and Products Test, the bank received a 6.0 performance score and a corresponding conclusion of “Low Satisfactory;”
• On the Community Development Financing Test, the bank received a 5.7 performance score and a corresponding conclusion of “Low Satisfactory;” and
• On the Community Development Services Test, the bank received a 3.0 performance score and a corresponding conclusion of “Needs to Improve.”
Calculating weights:
• For the Retail Lending Test, the weight is 40 percent (or 0.4);
• For the Retail Services and Products Test, the weight is 10 percent (or 0.1);
• For the Community Development Financing Test, the weight is 40 percent (or 0.4); and
• For the Community Development Services Test, the weight is 10 percent (or 0.1).
State Performance Score:
Based on the illustration in this example D-1, the bank's State performance score is 6.1.
(0.4 weight × 7.3 performance score on the Retail Lending Test = 2.92) + (0.1 weight × 6.0 performance score on the Retail Services and Products Test = 0.6) + (0.4 weight × 5.7 performance score on the Community Development Financing Test = 2.28) + (0.1 weight × 3.0 performance score on the Community Development Services Test = 0.3).
State Rating:
A State performance score of 6.1 is greater than 4.5 but less than 8.5, resulting in a rating of “Satisfactory.”
c.
Intermediate bank ratings.
1.
Intermediate banks evaluated pursuant to the Retail Lending Test and the Community Development Financing Test.

i. The FDIC weights the performance scores as follows: Retail Lending Test (50 percent) and Community Development Financing Test (50 percent). The FDIC multiplies each of these weights by the bank's corresponding performance score on the respective performance test, and then adds the resulting values together to develop a State, multistate MSA, or institution performance score.
ii. The FDIC assigns a rating corresponding with the rating category that is nearest to the State, multistate MSA, or institution performance score, using the table in paragraph a of this appendix.
iii. The FDIC may adjust an intermediate bank's institution rating where the bank has requested and received sufficient additional consideration pursuant to § 345.30(b)(2) and (3).
2.
Intermediate banks evaluated pursuant to the Retail Lending Test and the Intermediate Bank Community Development Test in § 345.30(a)(2).

i. The FDIC weights the performance scores as follows: Retail Lending Test (50 percent) and Intermediate Bank Community Development Test (50 percent). The FDIC multiplies each of these weights by the bank's corresponding performance score on the respective performance test, and then adds the resulting values together to develop a State, multistate MSA, or institution performance score. For purposes of this paragraph c.2.i, the performance score for the Intermediate Bank Community Development Test corresponds to the conclusion assigned, as follows:

In enacting the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), the Congress required each appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency to assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which the institution is chartered, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution, and to take this record into account in the agency's evaluation of an application for a deposit facility by the institution. This part is intended to carry out the purposes of the CRA by:
(1) Establishing the framework and criteria by which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) assesses a bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank; and
(2) Providing that the FDIC takes that record into account in considering certain applications.

Insured State branches.
Insured State branches are branches of a foreign bank established and operating under the laws of any State, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

Subpart B—Standards for Assessing Performance
§ 345.21 Performance tests, standards, and ratings, in general.
(a)
Performance tests and standards.
The FDIC assesses the CRA performance of a bank in an examination as follows:
(1)
Lending, investment, and service tests.
The FDIC applies the lending, investment, and service tests, as provided in §§ 345.22 through 345.24, in evaluating the performance of a bank, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this section.
(2)
Community development test for wholesale or limited purpose banks.
The FDIC applies the community development test for a wholesale or limited purpose bank, as provided in § 345.25, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(3)
Small bank performance standards.
The FDIC applies the small bank performance standards as provided in § 345.26 in evaluating the performance of a small bank or a bank that was a small bank during the prior calendar year, unless the bank elects to be assessed as provided in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(4) of this section. The bank may elect to be assessed as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if it collects and reports the data required for other banks under § 345.42.
(4)
Strategic plan.
The FDIC evaluates the performance of a bank under a strategic plan if the bank submits, and the FDIC approves, a strategic plan as provided in § 345.27.
(b)
Performance context.
The FDIC applies the tests and standards in paragraph (a) of this section and also considers whether to approve a proposed strategic plan in the context of:
(1) Demographic data on median income levels, distribution of household income, nature of housing stock, housing costs, and other relevant data pertaining to a bank's assessment area(s);
(2) Any information about lending, investment, and service opportunities in the bank's assessment area(s) maintained by the bank or obtained from community organizations, state, local, and tribal governments, economic development agencies, or other sources;
(3) The bank's product offerings and business strategy as determined from data provided by the bank;
(4) Institutional capacity and constraints, including the size and financial condition of the bank, the economic climate (national, regional, and local), safety and soundness limitations, and any other factors that significantly affect the bank's ability to provide lending, investments, or services in its assessment area(s);
(5) The bank's past performance and the performance of similarly situated lenders;
(6) The bank's public file, as described in § 345.43, and any written comments about the bank's CRA performance submitted to the bank or the FDIC; and
(7) Any other information deemed relevant by the FDIC.
(c)
Assigned ratings.
The FDIC assigns to a bank one of the following four ratings pursuant to § 345.28 and Appendix A of this part: “outstanding”; “satisfactory”; “needs to improve”; or “substantial noncompliance” as provided in 12 U.S.C. 2906(b)(2). The rating assigned by the FDIC reflects the bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank.
(d)
Safe and sound operations.
This part and the CRA do not require a bank to make loans or investments or to provide services that are inconsistent with safe and sound operations. To the contrary, the FDIC anticipates banks can meet the standards of this part with safe and sound loans, investments, and services on which the banks expect to make a profit. Banks are permitted and encouraged to develop and apply flexible underwriting standards for loans that benefit low- or moderate-income geographies or individuals, only if consistent with safe and sound operations.
(e)
Low-cost education loans provided to low-income borrowers.
In assessing and taking into account the record of a bank under this part, the FDIC considers, as a factor, low-cost education loans originated by the bank to borrowers, particularly in its assessment area(s), who have an individual income that is less than 50 percent of the area median income. For purposes of this paragraph, “low-cost education loans” means any education
loan, as defined in section 140(a)(7) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1650(a)(7)) (including a loan under a state or local education loan program), originated by the bank for a student at an “institution of higher education,” as that term is generally defined in sections 101 and 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 and 1002) and the implementing regulations published by the U.S. Department of Education, with interest rates and fees no greater than those of comparable education loans offered directly by the U.S. Department of Education. Such rates and fees are specified in section 455 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087e).
(f)
Activities in cooperation with minority- or women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions.
In assessing and taking into account the record of a nonminority-owned and nonwomen-owned bank under this part, the FDIC considers as a factor capital investment, loan participation, and other ventures undertaken by the bank in cooperation with minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions. Such activities must help meet the credit needs of local communities in which the minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions are chartered. To be considered, such activities need not also benefit the bank's assessment area(s) or the broader statewide or regional area that includes the bank's assessment area(s).
§ 345.22 Lending test.

A bank may submit additional information to the FDIC on a confidential basis, but the goals stated in the plan must be sufficiently specific to enable the public and the FDIC to judge the merits of the plan.
(3)
Satisfactory and outstanding goals.
A bank shall specify in its plan measurable goals that constitute “satisfactory” performance. A plan may specify measurable goals that constitute “outstanding” performance. If a bank submits, and the FDIC approves, both “satisfactory” and “outstanding” performance goals, the FDIC will consider the bank eligible for an “outstanding” performance rating.
(4)
Election if satisfactory goals not substantially met.
A bank may elect in its plan that, if the bank fails to meet substantially its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the FDIC will evaluate the bank's performance under the lending, investment, and service tests, the community development test, or the small bank performance standards, as appropriate.
(g)
Plan approval
—(1)
Timing.
The FDIC will act upon a plan within 60 calendar days after the FDIC receives the complete plan and other material required under paragraph (e) of this section. If the FDIC fails to act within this time period, the plan shall be deemed approved unless the FDIC extends the review period for good cause.
(2)
Public participation.
In evaluating the plan's goals, the FDIC considers the public's involvement in formulating the plan, written public comment on the plan, and any response by the bank to public comment on the plan.
(3)
Criteria for evaluating plan.
The FDIC evaluates a plan's measurable goals using the following criteria, as appropriate:
(i) The extent and breadth of lending or lending-related activities, including, as appropriate, the distribution of loans among different geographies, businesses and farms of different sizes, and individuals of different income levels, the extent of community development lending, and the use of innovative or flexible lending practices to address credit needs;
(ii) The amount and innovativeness, complexity, and responsiveness of the bank's qualified investments; and
(iii) The availability and effectiveness of the bank's systems for delivering retail
banking services and the extent and innovativeness of the bank's community development services.
(h)
Plan amendment.
During the term of a plan, a bank may request the FDIC to approve an amendment to the plan on grounds that there has been a material change in circumstances. The bank shall develop an amendment to a previously approved plan in accordance with the public participation requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.
(i)
Plan assessment.
The FDIC approves the goals and assesses performance under a plan as provided for in Appendix A of this part.
§ 345.28 Assigned ratings.
(a)
Ratings in general.
Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the FDIC assigns to a bank a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial noncompliance” based on the bank's performance under the lending, investment and service tests, the community development test, the small bank performance standards, or an approved strategic plan, as applicable.
(b
) Lending, investment, and service tests.
The FDIC assigns a rating for a bank assessed under the lending, investment, and service tests in accordance with the following principles:
(1) A bank that receives an “outstanding” rating on the lending test receives an assigned rating of at least “satisfactory”;
(2) A bank that receives an “outstanding” rating on both the service test and the investment test and a rating of at least “high satisfactory” on the lending test receives an assigned rating of “outstanding”; and
(3) No bank may receive an assigned rating of “satisfactory” or higher unless it receives a rating of at least “low satisfactory” on the lending test.
(c)
Effect of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices.
(1) The FDIC's evaluation of a bank's CRA performance is adversely affected by evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices in any geography by the bank or in any assessment area by any affiliate whose loans have been considered as part of the bank's lending performance. In connection with any type of lending activity described in § 345.22(a), evidence of discriminatory or other credit practices that violate an applicable law, rule, or regulation includes, but is not limited to:
(i) Discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis in violation, for example, of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fair Housing Act;
(ii) Violations of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act;
(iii) Violations of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act;
(iv) Violations of section 8 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act; and
(v) Violations of the Truth in Lending Act provisions regarding a consumer's right of rescission.
(2) In determining the effect of evidence of practices described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section on the bank's assigned rating, the FDIC considers the nature, extent, and strength of the evidence of the practices; the policies and procedures that the bank (or affiliate, as applicable) has in place to prevent the practices; any corrective action that the bank (or affiliate, as applicable) has taken or has committed to take, including voluntary corrective action resulting from self-assessment; and any other relevant information.
§ 345.29 Effect of CRA performance on applications.
(a)
CRA performance.
Among other factors, the FDIC takes into account the record of performance under the CRA of each applicant bank in considering an application for approval of:
(1) The establishment of a domestic branch or other facility with the ability to accept deposits;
(2) The relocation of the bank's main office or a branch;
(3) The merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, or assumption of liabilities; and
(4) Deposit insurance for a newly chartered financial institution.
(b) New financial institutions. A newly chartered financial institution shall submit with its application for deposit insurance a description of how it will meet its CRA objectives. The FDIC takes the description into account in considering the application and may deny or condition approval on that basis.
(c)
Interested parties.
The FDIC takes into account any views expressed by interested parties that are submitted in accordance with the FDIC's procedures set forth in part 303 of this chapter in considering CRA performance in an application listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(d)
Denial or conditional approval of application.
A bank's record of performance may be the basis for denying or conditioning approval of an application listed in paragraph (a) of this section.
Subpart C—Records, Reporting, and Disclosure Requirements
§ 345.41 Assessment area delineation.
(a)
In general.
A bank shall delineate one or more assessment areas within which the FDIC evaluates the bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community. The FDIC does not evaluate the bank's delineation of its assessment area(s) as a separate performance criterion, but the FDIC reviews the delineation for compliance with the requirements of this section.
(b)
Geographic area(s) for wholesale or limited purpose banks.
The assessment area(s) for a
wholesale or limited purpose bank must consist generally of one or more MSAs or metropolitan divisions (using the MSA or metropolitan division boundaries that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the delineation is made) or one or more contiguous political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, or towns, in which the bank has its main office, branches, and deposit-taking ATMs.
(c)
Geographic area(s) for other banks.
The assessment area(s) for a bank other than a wholesale or limited purpose bank must:
(1) Consist generally of one or more MSAs or metropolitan divisions (using the MSA or metropolitan division boundaries that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the delineation is made) or one or more contiguous political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, or towns; and
(2) Include the geographies in which the bank has its main office, its branches, and its deposit-taking RSFs, as well as the surrounding geographies in which the bank has originated or purchased a substantial portion of its loans (including home mortgage loans, small business and small farm loans, and any other loans the bank chooses, such as those consumer loans on which the bank elects to have its performance assessed).
(d)
Adjustments to geographic area(s).
A bank may adjust the boundaries of its assessment area(s) to include only the portion of a political subdivision that it reasonably can be expected to serve. An adjustment is particularly appropriate in the case of an assessment area that otherwise would be extremely large, of unusual configuration, or divided by significant geographic barriers.
(e)
Limitations on the delineation of an assessment area.
Each bank's assessment area(s):
(1) Must consist only of whole geographies;
(2) May not reflect illegal discrimination;
(3) May not arbitrarily exclude low- or moderate-income geographies, taking into account the bank's size and financial condition; and
(4) May not extend substantially beyond an MSA boundary or beyond a state boundary unless the assessment area is located in a multistate MSA. If a bank serves a geographic area that extends substantially beyond a state boundary, the bank shall delineate separate assessment areas for the areas in each state. If a bank serves a geographic area that extends substantially beyond an MSA boundary, the bank shall delineate separate assessment areas for the areas inside and outside the MSA.
(f)
Banks serving military personnel.
Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, a bank whose business predominantly consists of serving the needs of military personnel or their dependents who are not located within a defined geographic area may delineate its entire deposit customer base as its assessment area.
(g)
Use of assessment area(s).
The FDIC uses the assessment area(s) delineated by a bank in its evaluation of the bank's CRA performance unless the FDIC determines that the assessment area(s) do not comply with the requirements of this section.

(d)
Banks evaluated under the small bank performance standards
—(1)
Lending test ratings
—(i)
Eligibility for a satisfactory lending test rating.
The FDIC rates a small bank's lending performance “satisfactory” if, in general, the bank demonstrates:
(A) A reasonable loan-to-deposit ratio (considering seasonal variations) given the bank's size, financial condition, the credit needs of its assessment area(s), and taking into account, as appropriate, other lending-related activities such as loan originations for sale to the secondary markets and community development loans and qualified investments;
(B) A majority of its loans and, as appropriate, other lending-related activities, are in its assessment area;
(C) A distribution of loans to and, as appropriate, other lending-related activities for individuals of different income levels (including low- and moderate-income individuals) and businesses and farms of different sizes that is reasonable given the demographics of the bank's assessment area(s);
(D) A record of taking appropriate action, when warranted, in response to written complaints, if any, about the bank's performance in helping to meet the credit needs of its assessment area(s); and
(E) A reasonable geographic distribution of loans given the bank's assessment area(s).
(ii)
Eligibility for an “outstanding” lending test rating.
A small bank that meets each of the standards for a “satisfactory” rating under this paragraph and exceeds some or all of those standards may warrant consideration for a lending test rating of “outstanding.”
(iii)
Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance ratings.
A small bank may also receive a lending test rating of “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance” depending on the degree to which its performance has failed to meet the standard for a “satisfactory” rating.
(2)
Community development test ratings for intermediate small banks
—(i)
Eligibility for a satisfactory community development test rating.
The FDIC rates an intermediate small bank's community development performance “satisfactory” if the bank demonstrates adequate responsiveness to the community development needs of its assessment area(s) through community development loans, qualified investments, and community development services. The adequacy of the bank's response will depend on its capacity for such community development activities, its assessment area's need for such community development activities, and the availability of such opportunities for community development in the bank's assessment area(s).
(ii)
Eligibility for an outstanding community development test rating.
The FDIC rates an intermediate small bank's community development performance “outstanding” if the bank demonstrates excellent responsiveness to community development needs in its assessment area(s) through community development loans, qualified investments, and community development services, as appropriate, considering the bank's capacity and the need and availability of such opportunities for community development in the bank's assessment area(s).
(iii)
Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance ratings.
An intermediate small bank may also receive a community development test rating of “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance” depending on the degree to which its performance has failed to meet the standards for a “satisfactory” rating.
(3)
Overall rating
—(i)
Eligibility for a satisfactory overall rating.
No intermediate small bank may receive an assigned overall rating of “satisfactory” unless it receives a rating of at least “satisfactory” on both the lending test and the community development test.
(ii)
Eligibility for an outstanding overall rating.
(A) An intermediate small bank that receives an “outstanding” rating on one test and at least “satisfactory” on the other test may receive an assigned overall rating of “outstanding.”
(B) A small bank that is not an intermediate small bank that meets each of the standards for a “satisfactory” rating under the lending test and exceeds some or all of those standards may warrant consideration for an overall rating of “outstanding.” In assessing whether a bank's performance is “outstanding,” the FDIC considers the extent to which the bank exceeds each of the performance standards for a “satisfactory” rating and its performance in making qualified investments and its performance in providing branches and other services and delivery systems that enhance credit availability in its assessment area(s).
(iii)
Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance overall ratings.
A small bank may also receive a rating of “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance” depending on the degree to which its performance has failed to meet the standards for a “satisfactory” rating.
(e)
Strategic plan assessment and rating
—(1)
Satisfactory goals.
The FDIC approves as “satisfactory” measurable goals that adequately help to meet the credit needs of the bank's assessment area(s).
(2)
Outstanding goals.
If the plan identifies a separate group of measurable goals that substantially exceed the levels approved as “satisfactory,” the FDIC will approve those goals as “outstanding.”
(3)
Rating.
The FDIC assesses the performance of a bank operating under an approved plan to determine if the bank has met its plan goals:
(i) If the bank substantially achieves its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the FDIC will rate the bank's performance under the plan as “satisfactory.”
(ii) If the bank exceeds its plan goals for a satisfactory rating and substantially achieves its plan goals for an outstanding rating, the FDIC will rate the bank's performance under the plan as “outstanding.”
(iii) If the bank fails to meet substantially its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the FDIC will rate the bank as either “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance,” depending on the extent to which it falls short of its plan goals, unless the bank elected in its plan to be rated otherwise, as provided in § 345.27(f)(4).

§ 346.1
Purpose and scope of this part.
(a)
General.
This part implements section 711 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (12 U.S.C. 1831y). That section requires any nongovernmental entity or person, insured depository institution, or affiliate of an insured depository institution that enters into a covered agreement to—

(c)
Relation to Community Reinvestment Act.
This part does not affect in any way the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 U.S.C. 2901
et seq.
) or the FDIC's Community Reinvestment regulation found at 12 CFR part 345, or the FDIC's interpretations or administration of that Act or regulation.
(d)
Examples.
(1) The examples in this part are not exclusive. Compliance with an example, to the extent applicable, constitutes compliance with this part.
(2) Examples in a paragraph illustrate only the issue described in the paragraph and do not illustrate any other issues that may arise in this part.
§ 346.2
Definition of covered agreement.
(a)
General definition of covered agreement.
A covered agreement is any contract, arrangement, or understanding that meets all of the following criteria—
(1) The agreement is in writing.
(2) The parties to the agreement include—
(i) One or more insured depository institutions or affiliates of an insured depository institution; and
(ii) One or more nongovernmental entities or persons (referred to hereafter as NGEPs).
(3) The agreement provides for the insured depository institution or any affiliate to—
(i) Provide to one or more individuals or entities (whether or not parties to the agreement) cash payments, grants, or other consideration (except loans) that have an aggregate value of more than $10,000 in any calendar year; or
(ii) Make to one or more individuals or entities (whether or not parties to the agreement) loans that have an aggregate principal amount of more than $50,000 in any calendar year.
(4) The agreement is made pursuant to, or in connection with, the fulfillment of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 U.S.C. 2901
et seq.
) (CRA), as defined in§ 346.4.
(5) The agreement is with a NGEP that has had a CRA communication as described in § 346.3 prior to entering into the agreement.
(b)
Examples concerning written arrangements or understandings
—
(1)
Example 1.
A NGEP meets with an insured depository institution and states that the institution needs to make more community development investments in the NGEP's community. The NGEP and insured depository institution do not reach an agreement concerning the community development investments the institution should make in the community, and the parties do not reach any mutual arrangement or understanding. Two weeks later, the institution unilaterally issues a press release announcing that it has established a general goal of making $100 million of community development grants in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods served by the insured depository institution over the next 5 years. The NGEP is not identified in the press release. The press release is not a written arrangement or understanding.
(2)
Example 2.
A NGEP meets with an insured depository institution and states that the institution needs to offer new loan programs in the NGEP's community. The NGEP and the insured
depository institution reach a mutual arrangement or understanding that the institution will provide additional loans in the NGEP's community. The institution tells the NGEP that it will issue a press release announcing the program. Later, the insured depository institution issues a press release announcing the loan program. The press release incorporates the key terms of the understanding reached between the NGEP and the insured depository institution. The written press release reflects the mutual arrangement or understanding of the NGEP and the insured depository institution and is, therefore, a written arrangement or understanding.
(3)
Example 3.
An NGEP sends a letter to an insured depository institution requesting that the institution provide a $15,000 grant to the NGEP. The insured depository institution responds in writing and agrees to provide the grant in connection with its annual grant program. The exchange of letters constitutes a written arrangement or understanding.
(c)
Loan agreements that are not covered agreements.
A covered agreement does not include—
(1) Any individual loan that is secured by real estate; or
(2) Any specific contract or commitment for a loan or extension of credit to an individual, business, farm, or other entity, or group of such individuals or entities if—
(i) The funds are loaned at rates that are not substantially below market rates; and
(ii) The loan application or other loan documentation does not indicate that the borrower intends or is authorized to use the borrowed funds to make a loan or extension of credit to one or more third parties.
(d)
Examples concerning loan agreements
—
(1)
Example 1.
An insured depository institution provides an organization with a $1 million loan that is documented in writing and is secured by real estate owned or to-be-acquired by the organization. The agreement is an individual mortgage loan and is exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, regardless of the interest rate on the loan or whether the organization intends or is authorized to re-loan the funds to a third party.
(2)
Example 2.
An insured depository institution commits to provide a $500,000 line of credit to a small business that is documented by a written agreement. The loan is made at rates that are within the range of rates offered by the institution to similarly situated small businesses in the market and the loan documentation does not indicate that the small business intends or is authorized to re-lend the borrowed funds. The agreement is exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(3)
Example 3.
An insured depository institution offers small business loans that are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). A small business obtains a $75,000 loan, documented in writing, from the institution under the institution's SBA loan program. The loan documentation does not indicate that the borrower intends or is authorized to re-lend the funds. Although the rate charged on the loan is well below that charged by the institution on commercial loans, the rate is within the range of rates that the institution would charge a similarly situated small business for a similar loan under the SBA loan program. Accordingly, the loan is not made at substantially below market rates and is exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(4)
Example 4.
A bank holding company enters into a written agreement with a community development organization that provides that insured depository institutions owned by the bank holding company will make $250 million in small business loans in the community over the next 5 years. The written agreement is not a specific contract or commitment for a loan or an extension of credit and, thus, is not exempt from coverage under paragraph (c)(2) of this section: Each small business loan made by the insured depository institution pursuant to this general commitment would, however, be exempt from coverage if the loan is made at rates that are not substantially below market rates and the loan documentation does not indicate that
the borrower intended or was authorized to re-lend the funds.
(e)
Agreements that include exempt loan agreements.
If an agreement includes a loan, extension of credit or loan commitment that, if documented separately, would be exempt under paragraph (c) of this section, the exempt loan, extension of credit or loan commitment may be excluded for purposes of determining whether the agreement is a covered agreement.
(f)
Determining annual value of agreements that lack schedule of disbursements.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a multi-year agreement that does not include a schedule for the disbursement of payments, grants, loans or other consideration by the insured depository institution or affiliate, is considered to have a value in the first year of the agreement equal to all payments, grants, loans and other consideration to be provided at any time under the agreement.
§ 346.3
CRA communications.
(a)
Definition of CRA communication.
A CRA communication is any of the following—
(1) Any written or oral comment or testimony provided to a Federal banking agency concerning the adequacy of the performance under the CRA of the insured depository institution, any affiliated insured depository institution, or any CRA affiliate.
(2) Any written comment submitted to the insured depository institution that discusses the adequacy of the performance under the CRA of the institution and must be included in the institution's CRA public file.
(3) Any discussion or other contact with the insured depository institution or any affiliate about—
(i) Providing (or refraining from providing) written or oral comments or testimony to any Federal banking agency concerning the adequacy of the performance under the CRA of the insured depository institution, any affiliated insured depository institution, or any CRA affiliate;
(ii) Providing (or refraining from providing) written comments to the insured depository institution that concern the adequacy of the institution's performance under the CRA and must be included in the institution's CRA public file; or

(b)
Discussions or contacts that are not CRA communications
—(1)
Timing of contacts with a Federal banking agency.
An oral or written communication with a Federal banking agency is not a CRA communication if it occurred more than 3 years before the parties entered into the agreement.
(2)
Timing of contacts with insured depository institutions and affiliates.
A communication with an insured depository institution or affiliate is not a CRA communication if the communication occurred—
(i) More than 3 years before the parties entered into the agreement, in the case of any written communication;
(ii) More than 3 years before the parties entered into the agreement, in the case of any oral communication in which the NGEP discusses providing (or refraining from providing) comments or testimony to a Federal banking agency or written comments that must be included in the institution's CRA public file in connection with a request to, or agreement by, the institution or affiliate to take (or refrain from taking) any action that is in fulfillment of the CRA; or
(iii) More than 1 year before the parties entered into the agreement, in the case of any other oral communication not described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
(3)
Knowledge of communication by insured depository institution or affiliate.
(i) A communication is only a CRA communication under paragraph (a) of this section if the insured depository institution or its affiliate has knowledge of the communication under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) or (iii) of this section.
(ii)
Communication with insured depository institution or affiliate.
An insured depository institution or affiliate has knowledge of a communication by the NGEP to the institution or its affiliate under this paragraph only if one of the
following representatives of the insured depository institution or any affiliate has knowledge of the communication—
(A) An employee who approves, directs, authorizes, or negotiates the agreement with the NGEP; or
(B) An employee designated with responsibility for compliance with the CRA or executive officer if the employee or executive officer knows that the institution or affiliate is negotiating, intends to negotiate, or has been informed by the NGEP that it expects to request that the institution or affiliate negotiate an agreement with the NGEP.
(iii)
Other communications.
An insured depository institution or affiliate is deemed to have knowledge of—
(A) Any testimony provided to a Federal banking agency at a public meeting or hearing;
(B) Any comment submitted to a Federal banking agency that is conveyed in writing by the agency to the insured depository institution or affiliate; and
(C) Any written comment submitted to the insured depository institution that must be and is included in the institution's CRA public file.
(4)
Communication where NGEP has knowledge.
A NGEP has a CRA communication with an insured depository institution or affiliate only if any of the following individuals has knowledge of the communication—
(i) A director, employee, or member of the NGEP who approves, directs, authorizes, or negotiates the agreement with the insured depository institution or affiliate;
(ii) A person who functions as an executive officer of the NGEP and who knows that the NGEP is negotiating or intends to negotiate an agreement with the insured depository institution or affiliate; or
(iii) Where the NGEP is an individual, the NGEP.
(c)
Examples of CRA communications
—(1)
Examples of actions that are CRA communications.
The following are examples of CRA communications. These examples are not exclusive and assume that the communication occurs within the relevant time period as described in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section and the appropriate representatives have knowledge of the communication as specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section.
(i)
Example 1.
A NGEP files a written comment with a Federal banking agency that states than an insured depository institution successfully addresses the credit needs of its community. The written comment is in response to a general request from the agency for comments on an application of the insured depository institution to open a new branch and a copy of the comment is provided to the institution.
(ii)
Examples 2.
A NGEP meets with an executive officer of an insured depository institution and states that the institution must improve its CRA performance.
(iii)
Example 3.
A NGEP meets with an executive officer of an insured depository institution and states that the institution needs to make more mortgage loans in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods in its community.
(iv)
Example 4.
A bank holding company files an application with a Federal banking agency to acquire an insured depository institution. Two weeks later, the NGEP meets with an executive officer of the bank holding company to discuss the adequacy of the performance under the CRA of the target insured depository institution. The insured depository institution was an affiliate of the bank holding company at the time the NGEP met with the target institution. (See § 346.11(a).) Accordingly, the NGEP had a CRA communication with an affiliate of the bank holding company.
(2)
Examples of actions that are not CRA communications.
The following are examples of actions that are not by themselves CRA communications. These examples are not exclusive.
(i)
Example 1.
A NGEP provides to a Federal banking agency comments or testimony concerning an insured depository institution or affiliate in response to a direct request by the agency for comments or testimony from that NGEP. Direct requests for comments or testimony do not include a general invitation by a Federal banking agency for comments or testimony from the public in connection with a
CRA performance evaluation of, or application for a deposit facility (as defined in section 803 of the CRA (12 U.S.C. 2902(3)) by, an insured depository institution or an application by a company to acquire an insured depository institution.
(ii)
Example 2.
A NGEP makes a statement concerning an insured depository institution or affiliate at a widely attended conference or seminar regarding a general topic. A public or private meeting, public hearing, or other meeting regarding one or more specific institutions, affiliates or transactions involving an application for a deposit facility is not considered a widely attended conference or seminar.
(iii)
Example 3.
A NGEP, such as a civil rights group, community group providing housing and other services in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, veterans organization, community theater group, or youth organization, sends a fundraising letter to insured depository institutions and to other businesses in its community. The letter encourages all businesses in the community to meet their obligation to assist in making the local community a better place to live and work by supporting the fundraising efforts of the NGEP.
(iv)
Example 4.
A NGEP discusses with an insured depository institution or affiliate whether particular loans, services, investments, community development activities, or other activities are generally eligible for consideration by a Federal banking agency under the CRA. The NGEP and insured depository institution or affiliate do not discuss the adequacy of the CRA performance of the insured depository institution or affiliate.
(v)
Example 5.
A NGEP engaged in the sale or purchase of loans in the secondary market sends a general offering circular to financial institutions offering to sell or purchase a portfolio of loans. An insured depository institution that receives the offering circular discusses with the NGEP the types of loans included in the loan pool, whether such loans are generally eligible for consideration under the CRA, and which loans are made to borrowers in the institution's local community. The NGEP and insured depository institution do not discuss the adequacy of the institution's CRA performance.
(d)

(5)
Examples of annual report requirements for NGEPs
—
(i)
Example 1.
A NGEP receives an unrestricted grant of $15,000 under a covered agreement, includes the funds in its general operating budget, and uses the funds during its fiscal year. The NGEP's annual report for the fiscal year must provide the name and mailing address of the NGEP, information sufficient to identify the covered agreement, and state that the NGEP received $15,000 during the fiscal year. The report must also indicate the total expenditures made by the NGEP during the fiscal year for compensation, administrative expenses, travel expenses, entertainment expenses, consulting and professional fees, and other expenses and uses. The NGEP's annual report may provide this information by submitting an Internal Revenue Service Form 990 that includes the required information. If the Internal Revenue Service Form does not include information for all of the required categories listed in this part, the NGEP must report the total expenditures in the remaining categories either by providing that information directly or by providing another form or report that includes the required information.
(ii)
Examples 2.
An organization receives $15,000 from an insured depository institution under a covered agreement and allocates and uses the $15,000 during the fiscal year to purchase computer equipment to support its functions. The organization's annual report must include the name and address of the organization, information sufficient to identify the agreement, and a statement that the organization received $15,000 during the year. In addition, since the organization allocated and used the funds for a specific purpose that is more narrow and limited than the categories of expenses included in the detailed, itemized list of expenses, the organization would have the option of providing either the total amount it used during the year for each category of expenses included in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, or a statement that it used the $15,000 to purchase computer equipment and a brief description of the equipment purchased.
(iii)
Examples 3.
A community group receives $50,000 from an insured depository institution under a covered agreement. During its fiscal year, the community group specifically allocates and uses $5,000 of the funds to pay for a particular business trip and uses the remaining $45,000 for general operating expenses. The group's annual report for the fiscal year must include the name and address of the group, information sufficient to identify the agreement, and a statement that the group received $50,000. Because the group did not allocate and use all of the funds for a specific purpose, the group's annual report must provide the total amount of funds it used during the year for each category of expenses included in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section. The group's annual report also could state that it used $5,000 for a particular business trip and include a brief description of the trip.
(iv)
Example 4.
A community development organization is a party to two separate covered agreements with two unaffiliated insured depository institutions. Under each agreement, the organization receives $15,000 during its fiscal year and uses the funds to support
its activities during that year. If the organization elects to file a consolidated annual report, the consolidated report must identify the organization and the two covered agreements, state that the organization received $15,000 during the fiscal year under each agreement, and provide the total amount that the organization used during the year for each category of expenses included in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.

(iv) The aggregate amount of payments, aggregate amount of fees, and aggregate amount of loans received by the insured depository institution or affiliate under the covered agreement from any other party to the agreement during the fiscal year;
(v) A general description of the terms and conditions of any payments, fees, or loans reported under paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section, or, in the event such terms and conditions are set forth—
(A) In the covered agreement, a statement identifying the covered agreement and the date the agreement (or a list identifying the agreement) was filed with the relevant supervisory agency; or

(A) By the insured depository institution or affiliate during its fiscal year; and
(B) By any other party to the agreement, unless such information is not known to the insured depository institution or affiliate filing the report or such information is or will be contained in the annual report filed by another party under this section.

(A) A copy of the NGEP's annual report required under paragraph (d) of this section for the fiscal year; and
(B) Written instructions that the insured depository institution or affiliate promptly forward the annual report to the relevant supervisory agency or agencies on behalf of the NGEP.
(ii) An insured depository institution or affiliate that receives an annual report from a NGEP pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section must file the report with the relevant supervisory agency or agencies on behalf of the NGEP within 30 days.
